EVENING.\n\n     Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film,\n     sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates\n     around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness.\n\n                         RIPLEY (O/S)\n               If I could just go back.  If I could rub\n               everything out.  Starting with myself.\n               Starting with borrowing a jacket.\n\n     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING.\n\n     Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano.\n     CREDITS begin.\n\n                         FRAN (SINGS)\n               Ah, such fleeting paradise\n               such innocent delight\n               to love,\n               be loved,\n               a lullabye,\n               then silence.\n\n     The song finishes.  Applause.  They're the entertainment at a\n     cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.\n     Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A\n     distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair,\n     approaches Ripley, offers his hand.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n                   (pointing at Ripley's borrowed\n                    jacket)\n               I see you were at Princeton.\n               Then you'll most likely know our son,\n               Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...\n\n                         EMILY GREENLEAF\n               We couldn't help noticing your jacket.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Yes.\n\n                         EMILY GREENLEAF\n               Class of '56?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (hesitating)\n               How is Dickie?\n\n     INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.\n\n     Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an\n     elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.\n\n                         EMILY GREENLEAF\n                   (to Fran)\n               I hope you'll come and see us...\n\n                         FRAN\n               That's very kind.\n\n                         EMILY GREENLEAF\n               Both of you...\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Of course, Dickie's idea of music is\n               Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz\n               is just noise, just an insolent noise.\n\n     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.\n\n     Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into\n     his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley\n     crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him\n     his share of their fee.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Gotta run. I'm so late.\n                   (he hands Fran's boyfriend the\n                    jacket he's been wearing)\n               Thanks for the jacket.\n\n                         BOYFRIEND\n               Sure.  Thanks for filling in for me.\n\n     From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing.\n\n                         EMILY GREENLEAF\n               Darling couple, aren't they?\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Yes.  An exceptional young man.\n\n     From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets\n     into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.\n\n     EXT. THEATER. EVENING.\n\n     Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and\n     heads for the theater. Music continues.\n\n     INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.\n\n     The interval: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming\n     themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers\n     towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and\n     through him.  Put coins in a bowl.\n\n     INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT\n\n     The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at\n     the performances.  A haughty woman in the box turns round and\n     he closes the curtain.\n\n     INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.\n\n     An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue\n     ghostlight.  A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on\n     the house lights.  Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves\n     apologetically.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Sorry, sorry.  I know.  Sorry.\n\n     EXT. GREENLEAF SHIPYARDS, BROOKLYN. DAY.\n\n     Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks.  A\n     huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers\n     preparing the shell of a new liner.  If Central Park is where\n     the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made.  And a\n     lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name\n     over the buildings behind them.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples.\n               Marge, his uh, the young lade is\n               supposedly writing some kind of book. God\n               knows what he does. By all accounts they\n               spend the whole time on the beach. Or his\n               sailboat. That's my son's talent,\n               spending his allowance.\n\n     Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a\n     sober young man, listens attentively.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)\n               Could you ever conceive of going to\n               Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?\n                   (Ripley looks doubtful)\n               I'd pay you.  I'd pay you 1000 dollars.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir,\n               but...\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Good. Now you can go for a reason.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.\n\n     A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up.  An exuberant and\n     mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides\n     into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's The\n     Champ. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the\n     man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an\n     undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.\n\n                         RIPLEY (O/S)\n               I don't know. Count Basie?  Duke\n               Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.\n\n     The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of\n     the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses\n     to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.\n\n     A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered\n     table which includes classical sheet music and a paper\n     keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.\n\n     Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.\n     Chet Baker's My Funny Valentine.  Signs everywhere of\n     packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this\n     BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and\n     bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows\n     give onto bars and a wall.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Don't even know if this is a man or a\n               woman.\n\n     There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He\n     flinches.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.\n\n     Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing\n     himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:\n     Charlie Parker's Koko.  He listens hard, recognizes the\n     track.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               That's Charlie Parker. Bird.\n\n     He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's\n     right, he smiles.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.\n\n     Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a\n     Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up\n     his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment\n     before closing the door behind him.\n\n     EXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.\n\n     Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.\n     He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's\n     chauffeur.\n\n                         CHAUFFEUR\n               Here.  I'll take that.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Thanks.\n\n                         CARETAKER\n                   (nodding towards the apartment)\n               That thousand bucks should come in handy.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Yes, sir.\n\n                         CHAUFFEUR\n                   (interupts Ripley, who is\n                    about to open the car door)\n               I'll get that.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Thanks.\n\n                         CHAUFFEUR\n                   (as he holds open the door for\n                    Ripley)\n               Sir.\n                   (Ripley laughs excitedly)\n               You're gonna have a great trip.  Mr\n               Greenleaf is personal friends with the\n               Cunard people.\n\n     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY.\n\n     Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He\n     opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.\n     Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks\n     and dollars.\n\n                         CHAUFFEUR\n               I can tell you.  The Greenleaf name opens\n               a lot of doors.\n\n     EXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY.\n\n     The liner leaves New York en route to Italy.  END CREDITS.\n\n     INT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS & IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY.\n\n     ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.\n     Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.\n     Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,\n     escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been\n     unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall\n     under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS\n     OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks\n     and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around\n     them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants\n     his name.  Ripley. Ripley. Ripley! he repeats in the hubbub\n     and joins the crowd around the letter R.  A striking young\n     woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.\n\n     Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a\n     line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith\n     catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               What's your secret?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Excuse me?\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               No, it's just - you are American, aren't\n               you? - no, I just, I have so much\n               luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.\n               It's humiliating.\n\n     Ripley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the\n     passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse.\n\n                         MEREDITH (cont'd)\n               I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith\n               Randall.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               Hello.\n\n     They are passed through immigration, head down the long\n     stairs towards the street.  Meredith catches up with Ripley.\n\n                         MEREDITH (cont'd)\n               You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (thinking quickly)\n               Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               So now, did they put your suitcase in the\n               wrong pile? It's just - upstairs -\n               weren't you under the R stand? I thought\n               I saw you there.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               My father wants me in New York. He builds\n               boats. I'd rather sail them.  I travel\n               under my mother's name.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               Which is?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Emily.\n                   (Meredith's bewildered)\n               Just kidding.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               The funny thing is, I'm not Randall\n               either. I'm Logue.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (nods, recognizing the name)\n               As in the...?\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug\n               off the dress. I travel under my mother's\n               name, too.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Randall.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               Right.\n\n     They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs\n     explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the\n     other for Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO.  They're going in\n     different directions.\n\n                         MEREDITH (cont'd)\n                   (offering her hand)\n               So - partners in disguise.\n                   (looks at the signs)\n               Bye.\n\n     EXT. COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON.\n\n     A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a\n     cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.\n\n     INT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON.\n\n     Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a\n     new town. People get off.\n\n     INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.\n\n     Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on\n     their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind\n     down through a square, passing the local church.\n\n     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY.\n\n     And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side\n     there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men\n     working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the\n     street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on\n     their Vespas. The Driver chants -\n\n                         DRIVER\n               MONGIBELLO!\n\n     Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on\n     its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign.\n\n     EXT. MIRAMARE HOTEL/BOAT AT SEA. MORNING.\n\n     A SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops\n     the sail.  A couple dive off and swim towards shore.\n\n     ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's\n     watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony\n     in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched\n     on his knees and, during this, he continues his study,\n     mouthing the Italian words.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (looking at a long, lean girl\n                    about to dive)\n               La fidanzata a una faccia.  The fianc\u00c8e\n               has a face.  La fidanzata e Marge.\n\n     Her partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown,\n     beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat:\n     \"BIRD\".\n\n                         RIPLEY (cont'd)\n               Questo e la mia faccia.....\n\n     The golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the\n     water, grins.\n\n                         RIPLEY (cont'd)\n               This is my face.\n\n     He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book.\n\n                         RIPLEY (cont'd)\n               Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la\n               faccia di Dickie.\n\n     EXT. MONGIBELLO. DAY.\n\n     Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on\n     the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY\n     LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys\n     turn laconically and watch him.\n\n     Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels\n     ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies.\n     Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes\n     and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness\n     of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up\n     to Dickie.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Dickie Greenleaf?\n\n     Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Who's this?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at\n               Princeton together.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Okay.\n                   (he sits up)\n               And did we know each other?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must\n               have known me.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (to Marge)\n               Princeton is like a fog, America's like a\n               fog.\n                   (to Ripley)\n               This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what\n               was it?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.\n\n                         MARGE\n               How do you do.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               What are you doing in Mongi?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (finds this idea absurd)\n               Passing through! You're so white. Did you\n               ever see a guy so white, Marge?  Gray,\n               actually.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               It's just an undercoat.\n                   (Marge laughs)\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Say again?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               You know, a primer.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               That's funny.\n\n     He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.  Ripley\n     stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up.\n\n                         MARGE\n               You should come and have lunch with us,\n               before you go - Dickie?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Sure.  Any time.\n\n                         MARGE\n               And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in\n               danger of turning a little pink.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Thanks. Well, a coincidence.\n\n     EXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING.\n\n     ANOTHER DAY.  Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in\n     shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square\n     on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps.\n     RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches\n     all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty,\n     SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then\n     climbs on the scooter, behind him.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I've been looking for you everywhere.\n\n                         SILVANA\n               Ah, today you're looking for me.  And\n               where have you been the rest of the week?\n               Pig.  With your American girl?  I hate\n               you, you know?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               What?\n\n                         SILVANA\n               I hate you.\n\n     And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards\n     the sea.\n\n     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.\n\n     Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.\n     Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of\n     the remnants of lunch.  Dickie's sheepish, showered, late.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late,\n               I'm a swine.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Did you forget where I live?

Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We\n               thought you'd disappeared. We were going\n               to send out a search party.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               No, still here.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Tom was telling me about his trip over.\n               Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Is that good?\n\n                         MARGE\n               Shut up!\n\n     Marge flicks him with a napkin. They start to wrestle,\n     excluding Tom.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'm intruding.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Can you mix a martini?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (hesitant)\n               Sure.\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (going inside)\n               I'll do it.

DUSK.\n\n     A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring\n     out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm\n     in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are\n     compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.\n     Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's\n     scheming.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I'm never going back. To actually hire\n               somebody to come all the way here to drag\n               me back home - got to be insane, hasn't\n               he?\n\n     SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her\n     fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal\n     FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise\n     there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.\n     Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.\n\n                         DICKIE (cont'd)\n               I'm never going back!\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               No, I think your mother, her illness -\n\n                         DICKIE\n               It's got nothing to do with my mother!\n               She's had leukemia for - !

DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON.\n\n     Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front\n     door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of\n     which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his\n     fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom\n     talking with Dickie.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Hi Tom.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (looks up)\n               Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.\n\n                         MARGE\n               I'll come down.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (to Ripley)\n               Did you speak to my father?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               You were right about the telephones.\n               There are no lines, there's some problem.\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (coming out of the front door)\n               Hello Tom.

He\n     bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps.\n\n                         RIPLEY (cont'd)\n               Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's -\n\n     Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               You like jazz!\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (gathering up the records)\n               I love jazz.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (holding up a Chet Baker)\n               This is the best.

NIGHT.\n\n     A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast\n     out their version of MOANIN'. Dickie and Ripley arrive and\n     make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with\n     friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts\n     introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.  Dickie is\n     instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.\n     An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses\n     Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for\n     her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his\n     cigarette.  Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's\n     clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to Tu\n     vuo' fa' L'Americano - a hit which reflects the current craze\n     for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie\n     up onto the stage.\n\n                         FAUSTO\n                   (improvising in Italian)\n               Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf,\n               all the way from America... etc.\n\n     Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody\n     claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.\n\n                         FAUSTO (cont'd)\n               And a big round of applause for a new\n               friend from New York - Tom Ripley!\n\n     Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls\n     him up.  The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's\n     Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can\n     sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience\n     is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.\n\n                         DICKIE (O/S)\n                   (reading)\n               I have bumped into an old friend from\n               Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.\n               He says he's going to haunt me until I\n               agree to come back to New York with\n               him...\n\n     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NOON.\n\n     Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table,\n     typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which\n     he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (grins)\n               Good afternoon!\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What time is it?\n                   (puts on his glasses and checks\n                    his watch)\n               Oh God!  Do you always type your letters?\n                   (points at the letter)\n               That should be two Ts.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I can't write and I can't spell.  That's\n               the privilege of a first-class education.\n               You're upstairs at the back. I think\n               Ermelinda made the bed up.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               This is so good of you.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Don't say it again. Now you're a Double\n               Agent and we're going to string my Dad\n               alone, I was thinking we might buy a\n               little car with the expense money he's\n               sending you. What do you think, Marge...a\n               little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?\n\n     Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No,\n               what we need urgently is an icebox. What\n               do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll\n               be your friend for life.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I absolutely agree with Marge.\n\n     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY.\n\n     Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a\n     comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only\n     to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.\n\n     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY.\n\n     Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the\n     Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out\n     shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,\n     cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and\n     walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where\n     lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of\n     conversation float up to Ripley.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               It'll just be for a little while.  He can\n               be... he makes me laugh.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Okay, darling.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               You'd say if you mind?\n\n                         MARGE\n               No, I like him.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Marge, you like everybody.\n\n                         MARGE\n               I don't like you.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Then I'll go to your place and you can\n               move in with Tom.\n\n     Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing\n     the cadences, No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,\n     until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.\n\n     EXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY.\n\n     Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and\n     sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the\n     coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he\n     uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his\n     pants, his rings.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Now you know why Miss Sherwood always\n               shows up for breakfast.  It's not love\n               it's the coffee machine.\n\n                         MARGE\n               It's the one task Dickie can do on his\n               own - make coffee.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Shut up.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Oh darling - is that for me?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (as Dickie hands him his cup)\n               That ring's so great. The green one.\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (delighted)\n               Tom, I love you!\n                   (to Dickie)\n               See!\n                   (to Ripley)\n               I bought it for him, for his birthday.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               It's superb.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I had to promise, capital P, never to\n               take it off - otherwise I'd give it to\n               you.\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (flicking a crumb at him)\n               Bastard!\n                   (to Ripley)\n               Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in\n               Naples.  I bargained for about two weeks.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I hope it wasn't cheap.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Oh, it was.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (to Marge)\n               I have to find a birthday present for\n               Frances. Perhaps you can help me?\n\n                         MARGE\n               Frances?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               My fianc\u00c8e.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Your parents met her.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Oh God - I can just imagine - if only\n               Dickie would settle down... doesn't every\n               parent deserve a grandchild?  Never! I\n               swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never\n               going back.\n\n     EXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY.\n\n     The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a\n     manoeuvre going on with the sail.  Captain Dickie supervises\n     his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please\n     Ripley.  Dickie goes over to help him.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               You're doing great. We'll make a sailor\n               of you yet. You're doing really well.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing\n               Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Yes please!\n\n     She heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Could we sail to Venice?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Sure.  I love Venice.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I have to go to Venice.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or\n               is it Rome? You do something and die,\n               don't you?  Okay, Venice is on the list.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               And Rome.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Do you ski?\n                   (Ripley frowns)\n               Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!\n               That's the next thing to deal with. We're\n               planning to go to Cortina at Christmas.\n               Excellent skiing. Excellent.\n                   (as Marge reappears)\n               Marge - Ripley can't ski.  We'll have to\n               teach him that, too. Have you ever known\n               such low class?\n\n                         MARGE\n               Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting\n               married. We might have to invite him on\n               our honeymoon.\n\n     EXT. MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.\n\n     Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down\n     the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the\n     little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue\n               crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my\n               book, and I was always going to this cafe\n               with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to\n               play his saxophone outside and I would\n               see him and he would see me, and he would\n               play My Funny Valentine. It was only\n               later that I realised he only knows about\n               six songs.\n\n     They've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman\n     who owns the store greets them.  Silvana, who's her daughter,\n     is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's\n     order.\n\n                         MARGE (cont'd)\n                   (to Silvana, in Italian)\n               Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e\n               pane, e del prosciutto.\n\n                         SILVANA\n               E fichi?  Come sempre?\n\n                         MARGE\n               Si.  Come sempre.  Grazie.\n\n     Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns.\n\n                         MARGE (cont'd)\n                   (back to Ripley)\n               Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see\n               Dickie, he starts playing My Funny\n               Valentine, and then all of a sudden he\n               just walks into the cafe, right in front\n               of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had\n               never spoken to him in my life - he said\n               I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want\n               you to come with me. So I did.\n\n     At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men\n     throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a\n     small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and\n     two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.\n     Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce\n     en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him.\n\n                         MARGE (cont'd)\n               If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom\n               and I are running off together.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Okay.\n\n     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. EARLY EVENING.\n\n     Dickie and Ripley are leaving.  They're fooling around.\n     Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the\n     top of the garden.\n\n     EXT. MONGIBELLO SQUARE. EARLY EVENING.\n\n     Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's\n     grocery store.  Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's\n     tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated.\n\n                         SILVANA\n               Did you get my message?  I want to talk\n               to you.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.\n\n     And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him\n     then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.\n\n     EXT. COASTAL ROAD TO NAPLES. EVENING.\n\n     Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where\n     the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains\n     speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               You're breaking my ribs!\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               You're breaking my ribs!\n\n     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.\n\n     Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of My Funny\n     Valentine in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is\n     playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous\n     applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.\n\n     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.\n\n     A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living\n     room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a\n     couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through\n     his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I could fuck this icebox I love it so\n               much.\n                   (considering Ripley)\n               What were you actually doing in New York?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I played piano in a few places.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               That's one job, you told me a lot of\n               jobs.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway,\n               I don't want to think about New York.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I\n               spend hours speculating.\n                   (drinking)\n               Cold beer. Thank you Dad.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Copy out from here...\n\n     He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (staring to write on the back\n                    of a postcard)\n               I love the fact you brought Shakespeare\n               with you and no clothes.  Ermelinda says\n               you wash the same shirt out every night.\n               Is that true?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               No! I've got more than one shirt!\n\n                         DICKIE\n               She can do that stuff for you. Anyway,\n               just wear some of my things, wear\n               anything you want, most of it's ancient.\n                   (he's finished writing)\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Now your signature.\n                   (watching him write)\n               Not \"Dickie\". Your signature.\n\n     Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard.\n     Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean\n     them. Dickie looks at him.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Without the glasses you're not even ugly.\n                   (takes them, tries them on)\n               I don't need them because I never read.\n               How do I look.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Like Clark Kent.\n                   (takes them back, puts them on\n                    beaming at Dickie)\n               Now Superman.\n\n     Dickie cuffs him.  Ripley looks down at the postcard.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I know. I write like a child.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T,\n               do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's\n               pain, that's secret pain.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               It must be a deep secret, cause I don't\n               know about it.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Your handwriting - nothing more naked.\n               See - nothing's quite touching the line -\n               that's vanity.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (flattered)\n               Well we certainly know that's true.\n\n     INT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.\n\n     Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next\n     to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the\n     board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the\n     water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a\n     burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Do you have any brothers?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               No, no brothers, no sisters.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               me neither. Nor does Marge. All only\n               children - what does that mean?\n\n     He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Means we never shared a bath.\n               I'm cold. Can I get in?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               No!\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I didn't mean with you in it.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (standing)\n               Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune\n               anyway.\n\n     He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But\n     Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie\n     turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with\n     his towel.\n\n     INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY.\n\n     An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's\n     not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie\n     is used to it.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               It is me. It's an old picture.\n                   (sighs at Ripley)\n               Every time - 'is it you?  Doesn't look\n               like you'.\n\n     He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case\n     with his initials prominently embossed.  Ripley watches him\n     sign and collect a large wad of notes.\n\n                         CLERK\n               Letters - Greenleaf, and for Ripley.\n\n     Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he\n     holds up one letter to Dickie.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Fran.\n                   (anticipating her letter)\n               I miss you, where are you coming home?\n               Stop telling me what a great time you're\n               having, how you love Dickie... and Marge\n               and...\n                   (the next letter)\n               And this one, I think, is your dad...\n\n     INT. TRAIN TO ROME. DAY.\n\n     Ripley sits reading the LETTER from Herbert Greenleaf.  He\n     frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               What does he say?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               He's getting impatient. He wants me to\n               reassure him you'll be home by\n               Thanksgiving.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               You've got to get a new jacket. Really.\n               You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm\n               sick of seeing you in them.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I can't. I can't keep spending your\n               father's money.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I love how responsible you are. My Dad\n               should make you Chief Accountant or\n               something.  Let me buy you a jacket.\n               There's a great place when we get to\n               Rome, Batistoni.\n\n     Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, \"Batistoni\".\n\n                         DICKIE (cont'd)\n               Andiamo a Roma.  We're taking Tom to\n               Roma!\n\n     EXT. ARCARI'S CAFE, PIAZZA NAVONA, ROME. DAY.\n\n     Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.\n     Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd.  There are\n     already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of\n     Frascati.  Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly\n     impatient. Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the\n     duration.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Where do we find a carozza for the Forum,\n               or can we hire any of them - ?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Relax.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               It's just there's so much to do in a\n               single day.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Relax. The most important question is\n               where to eat. I hope Freddie made a\n               reservation.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Freddie?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Freddie Miles.  You know - he's\n               organizing the Cortina skiing trip.\n\n     Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A\n     horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his\n     open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and\n     bustles over.  He's a heavy-set American with a reddish\n     crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at. Dickie is\n     delighted.\n\n                         DICKIE (cont'd)\n               Frederico!\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               Ciao bello.\n                   (noticing a beautiful woman in\n                    an open-topped car)\n               Don't you want to fuck every woman you\n               see.  Just once.\n\n     They kiss cheeks, continental-style.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n                   (mugging)\n               Hey, if I'm late, think what her\n               husband's saying!\n\n     He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.\n\n                         FREDDIE (cont'd)\n               So let's go. I got us a table outside at\n               Fabrizio's.\n\n     And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny\n     checks to work out the bill and pay it.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with\n               Mongi.\n\n     Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the\n     street to Freddie's car.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               I know.  I was there.\n                   (looks back to see Ripley\n                    struggling to settle the\n                    check)\n               Tommy!  It's S.R.O.  Two seater.\n               Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy!\n\n     Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He\n     has to crouch in the rear.\n\n                         FREDDIE (cont'd)\n               You're going to have to sit between us.\n               But don't put your shoes on the seat,\n               know what I mean, put them one on top of\n               the other.  Okay?\n\n     INT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON.\n\n     This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and\n     stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the\n     stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.  There are two\n     LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed\n     into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside\n     the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,\n     while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.\n     He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.\n     Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the\n     accordion doors.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and\n               meet some friends of Freddie's. The best\n               thing is - if you want to be a tourist -\n               grab a cab and we can meet up at the\n               railway station.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (absolutely crestfallen)\n               What club?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Freddie's arranged it with some of the\n               skiing crowd. Come if you want but I\n               thought you wanted to see the Forum...?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I did. And then maybe get the jacket and\n               what have you...\n\n                         FREDDIE\n                   (from inside the booth)\n               Dick - you've got to hear this!\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (oblivious to Ripley's pain)\n               Listen, just take one of mine when we get\n               back. Don't worry about it.  I did the\n               Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is\n               enough in anyone's life.\n\n     Ripley hands him the coats, turns away.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Ciao.  Have fun.\n\n     Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the\n     booth.  Dickie pushes it open.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               You said to make sure you didn't miss the\n               train. It leaves at eight.\n\n     EXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON.\n\n     Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's\n     looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then\n     he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This\n     is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by\n     antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't\n     alone.\n\n     INT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT.\n\n     It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of\n     the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving\n     up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his\n     compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.\n\n     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.\n\n     There's music playing, Bing Crosby's \"May I\". Very loud.\n     Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED\n     AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair,\n     catches one of Dickie's expressions.  There are clothes\n     abandoned everywhere.  He's been having a big dressing-up\n     session. He sings along with Bing.\n\n                         DICKIE (O/S)\n               What are you doing?\n\n     Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the\n     doorway.  The music thumps away.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Oh - just amusing myself.  Sorry, Dickie.\n                   (pause)\n               I didn't think you were coming back.\n\n     Dickie turns off the record player.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I wish you'd get out of my clothes.\n\n     Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with\n     mortification and shock.  Dickie looks at his feet, shakes\n     his head.\n\n                         DICKIE (cont'd)\n               Shoes too?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (lame, ashamed)\n               You said I could pick out a jacket and I\n               just... Sorry.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Get undressed in your own room, would\n               you?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I thought you'd missed the train.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Freddie drove me back in his car.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (horrified)\n               Is Freddie here?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               He's downstairs.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I was just fooling around. Don't say\n               anything. Sorry.\n\n     Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the\n     dressing-up session, not amused.\n\n     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. DAY.\n\n     Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and\n     Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks\n     perfectly happy.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Hi, Tom.  Come join us.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was\n               just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in\n               Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear\n               his clothes, and his father picks up the\n               tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll\n               do it!\n\n     EXT. THE OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DAY.\n\n     The boat is drifting.  Freddie and Dickie and Marge are\n     swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley\n     is sitting alone, reading.\n\n                         MARGE\n               You really should go in, it's marvellous.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'm fine.\n\n     She approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a\n     red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Are you okay?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Sure.\n\n     They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water.\n\n                         MARGE\n               The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun\n               shines on you and it's glorious, then he\n               forgets you and it's very very cold.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               So I'm learning.\n\n                         MARGE\n               He's not even aware of it. When you've\n               got his attention you feel like you're\n               the only person in the world. That's why\n               everybody loves him. Other times...\n\n     There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (laughing and choking)\n               He's drowning me!\n\n                         MARGE\n               It's always the same whenever someone new\n               comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,\n               Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -\n               did you meet him, he's a musician? -\n               ... and especially you, of course... and\n               that's only the boys.\n\n     They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.\n\n                         MARGE (cont'd)\n               Tell me, why is it when men play they\n               always play at killing each other...?\n               I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What about Cortina?\n\n                         MARGE\n               Didn't Dick say? - he talked to\n               Freddie... apparently it's not going to\n               work out -\n                   (Ripley's devastated, Marge\n                    notices, can't look at him)\n               Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.\n\n     EXT. OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DUSK.\n\n     LATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in\n     his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Come on, Frederico, do you really have\n               to go back?  At least stick around for\n               the Festival of the Madonna.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               I don't think so. Come back with me to\n               Rome. There's this great new club.  Have\n               some drinks, lotta ladies...\n\n     Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie\n     makes a face at Freddie.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Do you think you can steer this thing?\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               Sure.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Just point her at Capri and avoid the\n               rocks.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               What are you doing?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Marge-maintenance.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               Aye, aye.\n\n     Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the\n     tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the\n     water.\n\n     From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but\n     he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering\n     him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of\n     flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves,\n     he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then\n     Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted\n     toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely\n     betrayed.\n\n                         FREDDIE (cont'd)\n               Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,\n               you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy.\n\n     Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting\n     before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.\n\n     EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY.\n\n     The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as\n     ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting\n     instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley\n     looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.\n     Dickie notices her too.\n\n     EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY.\n\n     A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.\n\n     It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with\n     flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden,\n     staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,\n     wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their\n     shoulders.\n\n     The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual\n     Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their\n     fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and\n     altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from\n     Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is\n     carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,\n     the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is\n     walking on water.\n\n     Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,\n     about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from\n     among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.\n     One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the\n     direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.\n     It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the\n     palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -\n     wades, swims, splashes towards the body.\n\n     PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people\n     splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,\n     Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.\n\n     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY.\n\n     Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below\n     them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the\n     whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,\n     police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle\n     A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her\n     brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls\n     away.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What's the fight about? That's her\n               fianc\u00c8, isn't it?  Are they blaming him?\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (sharp)\n               I don't know! Why are you asking me?\n                   (agitated)\n               How can it take an hour to find an\n               ambulance?\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (conciliatory)\n               Well, she was already dead, darling,\n               wasn't she, so I suppose -\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I don't know why people say this\n               country's civilised. It isn't. It's\n               fucking primitive.\n\n     And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING\n     THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across\n     the terrace. Dickie storms inside.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Dickie!\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'll go and see what's the matter.\n\n                         MARGE\n               I'll go.\n\n     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.\n\n     Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window\n     overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening\n     phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,\n     begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up\n     empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I know why you're upset.\n                   (Dickie continues playing)\n               I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you\n               and Silvana.\n\n     Dickie stops playing.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               What about us?\n\n     He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.\n\n                         DICKIE (cont'd)\n                   (losing his temper)\n               You don't have to clean up! Really!\n\n     Ripley disappears into the kitchen.\n\n                         DICKIE (cont'd)\n                   (as Ripley returns)\n               She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do\n               you know what that means in a place like\n               this?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'm prepared to take the blame.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               What are you talking about?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               You've been so good to me. You're the\n               brother I never had. I'm the brother you\n               never had.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               She came to me for help, she needed\n               money, and I didn't help her. I didn't\n               help her. Now she's dead and it's my\n               fault.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'm not going to say anything - to Marge,\n               or anybody, the police - It's a secret\n               between us and I'll keep it.\n\n     And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax,\n     somehow in thrall to Ripley.\n\n                         RIPLEY (O/S)\n               Dear Tom, I think the time has come to\n               discontinue your expense checks...\n\n     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, NAPLES. DAY.\n\n     Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express\n     Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case,\n     Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter\n     from Herbert Greenleaf -\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               ...The thousand dollars, of course, was\n               only due in the event that you succeeded\n               in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I\n               hope the trip has afforded you some\n               pleasure despite the failure of its main\n               objective you need no longer consider\n               yourself obligated to us in any way...\n\n                         DICKIE\n               You can't blame him.  You could hardly\n               expect this to go on forever.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I thought you might write again. Now that\n               we're brothers...\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've\n               had a good run, haven't we?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (increasingly miserable)\n               What about Venice? Can we stick to that\n               plan at least?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on\n               here without money.  It's time we all\n               moved on.  Besides I'm sick of Mongi.\n               Especially now with everything - I really\n               want to move to the North. I need to\n               check out San Remo next week, find\n               somewhere new to keep the boat.\n               But it would be great, though, if you\n               came with me.  Our last trip before you\n               leave. There's a jazz festival - we could\n               say goodbye in style.  What do you think?\n               A last trip?\n\n     INT. TRAIN TO SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.\n\n     Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo. They sit next to\n     each other. Dickie's asleep. Ripley lays his head on Dickie's\n     shoulder, but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces\n     the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs. Then\n     Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the\n     reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head\n     and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's.  Dickie\n     suddenly catches him staring. Ripley looks away.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (terse)\n               Why do you do that thing - with your\n               neck? On trains you always do that thing,\n               it's so spooky.\n\n     EXT. HOTEL TERRACE RESTAURANT, SAN REMO. NIGHT.\n\n     Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which\n     lips out towards the sea. There's a restaurant and palms and\n     a JAZZ QUINTET playing, American. Very cool. They pass the\n     band. Dickie's captivated as they head for their table. They\n     pass some girls at a table. Dickie smiles greedily.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               This is more like it. Didn't I tell you\n               San Remo was crazy!\n\n     They're shown to a good table. Dickie watches the band while\n     their glasses are filled with champagne. Ripley looks happy.\n     He's got Dickie all to himself.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               To Mongibello and the happiest days of my\n               life.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               To Mongi.  You're cheerful tonight.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'm suddenly quite happy to be going\n               back.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               That's good.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I've got plans!\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Ripley's plans.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Esatto. I'm always planning.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I\n               didn't, did I?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Why are you asking all of a sudden?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               No reason. Because you're leaving, I\n               guess. I don't think you were there, were\n               you?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Why?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I mean it as a compliment. You've got\n               such great taste, I don't know. Most of\n               the thugs at Princeton had tasted\n               everything and had no taste. Used to say,\n               the cream of America: rich and thick.\n               Freddie's the perfect example.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Then I'll take it as a compliment.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (a beat)\n               Ha.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Do you even like jazz - or was that\n               something for my benefit?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (conceding, without guile)\n               I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to\n               like everything about the way you live.\n               It's one big love affair. If you knew my\n               life back home in New York...\n\n     Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert\n     solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what\n               do you think about drums?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               So cool.\n\n     He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this\n     - it's superficiality.\n\n     EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY.\n\n     The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor \n     boat.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               That's how I found my place in Mongi.\n               Took a boat out round the bay.  The first\n               place I liked, I got it.\n\n     The motor boat is ploughing the waves.

Dickie cuts the\n     motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (ecstatic)\n               I love it here! Gonna live here!\n\n     Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of\n     the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers,\n     already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I wanted to tell you my plan.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               So tell me.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I thought I might come back.

Let's say, for argument's\n               sake, you were here - perhaps we could\n               split the rent on a house - I'll get a\n               job - or, better still, I could get a\n               place in Rome and when we're there we\n               could be there and if we're here we could\n               be here -\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Oh God, I don't think so.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               - you see, particularly with the Marge\n               problem, you can just blame me.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               Marge and I are getting married.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (appalled)\n               How?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               How?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Yesterday you're ogling girls on the\n               terrace, today you're getting married.\n               It's absurd.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I love Marge.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               You love me and you're not marrying me.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (cold)\n               Tom, I don't love you.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained\n               all of that.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               I'm actually a little relieved you're\n               going, to be honest. I think we've seen\n               enough of each other for a while.\n\n     Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What?\n\n                         DICKIE\n               You can be a leech - you know this - and\n               it's boring.

But you, first of all I know\n               there's something - that evening when we\n               played chess, for instance, it was\n               obvious -\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (incredulous)\n               What evening?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for\n               you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers,\n               fine, then you do this sordid thing with\n               Marge, fucking her on the boat while we\n               all have to listen, which was\n               excruciating, frankly, plus you follow\n               your cock around like a - and now you're\n               getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive\n               me...you're lying to Marge then getting\n               married to her, you're knocking up\n               Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've\n               got to play drums, which is it, Dickie,\n               what do you really play?\n\n     Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley.\n\n                         DICKIE\n                   (attacking him, administering\n                    tiny slaps as punctuation to\n                    his tirade)\n               Who are you - some imposter, some third\n               class mooch - who are you to tell me\n               anything? Actually, I really really\n               really don't want to be on this boat with\n               you, I can't move without you moving,\n               which is exactly how it feels and it\n               gives me the creeps.\n                   (he goes to rev up the engine)\n               I can't move without - \"Dickie, Dickie,\n               Dickie\" - like a little girl.

DICKIE SLIPS\n     OFF THE WOODEN SEAT, HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!\n\n     The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller.  Dickie looks\n     up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back.\n\n                         DICKIE\n               For God's sake.\n\n     Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat,\n     catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face,\n     apparently unmarked, SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN, a line of blood and\n     then a peeling like a fruit bursting. Ripley's appalled.  A\n     terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at\n     Ripley.\n\n                         DICKIE (cont'd)\n               I'll kill you!\n\n     Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar,\n     kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle. The boat is\n     rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the\n     tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come\n     off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death\n     wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his\n     own blood, loses his grip.\n\n     Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like\n     a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood\n     on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,\n     letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's\n     let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls\n     there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.\n\n     Nobody's in sight.  The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling\n     indifferently on the waves.  Ripley lies by Dickie in the\n     bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.\n\n     The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.  The sea\n     calms.\n\n     EXT. A COVE NEAR SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.\n\n     A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley\n     clambers onto a rock over the shore.  He's watching the boat\n     slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he\n     finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat\n     disappears under the surface.\n\n     EXT. SAN REMO. DUSK.\n\n     Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's\n     jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder.\n\n     INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.\n\n     Ripley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's not\n     wearing his glasses.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Can I have my key, please?\n\n                         RECEPTIONIST\n                   (at the key rack)\n               Of course - But you must be very cold?\n               Signor Greenleaf?  Yes? -\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (mind racing)\n               No, it's - I'm...\n\n     EXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY.\n\n     Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.  He\n     stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea\n     what to do.\n\n     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY.\n\n     The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very\n     together.\n\n     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY.\n\n     Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches\n     Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He\n     can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.\n\n     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY.\n\n     Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is\n     busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the\n     Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read\n     part of it - C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear\n     Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write... Ripley\n     produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES\n     DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.\n\n     EXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY.\n\n     Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is\n     working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by\n     references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her\n     until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Hello Marge.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Tom, you startled me!  You're back.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               How are you? Sorry. Is your book going\n               well?\n\n                         MARGE\n               Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I was just looking at you -\n                   (looking at her tenderly)\n               - so quiet.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Where's Dickie?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I think he's planning on staying in Rome\n               for a few days.\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (looks at him)\n               Ha. Did he say why?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I don't know. I don't understand Dickie,\n               Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.\n\n                         MARGE\n               What does that mean?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the\n               next day I'm not, one day we're all one\n               family, the next day he wants to be\n               alone. You tell me.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Is that what he said - he wanted to be\n               alone?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked\n               me to deliver this.\n\n     He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Thanks. he knows I love this, although\n               why it couldn't have waited...\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Errand number one - deliver Marge's\n               perfume. Errand number two, pack some\n               clothes and his precious saxophone.\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (alarmed)\n               How long's he staying for?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Search me. I guess we're abandoned.\n\n     EXT. MONGIBELLO, BEACH. EARLY MORNING.\n\n     Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty,\n     forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning.\n\n     INT. OFF FROM DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. MORNING.\n\n     As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in\n     the living room. She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox\n     open for ice. She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks\n     back into the kitchen area.\n\n                         MARGE\n               There was a letter from Dickie in with my\n               perfume. You realize it's more than a few\n               days? He's thinking of moving to Rome.\n\n     She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling\n     everywhere. Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear\n     them up.  She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley. He puts\n     fresh ice into her glass.\n\n                         MARGE (cont'd)\n               The thing is, the night before he left,\n               we talked about moving, together, going\n               North - and I suppose I put some pressure\n               on him, about getting married, I just\n               might have scared him off. There's a side\n               to him, when our heads are on the pillow,\n               I know no-one else sees it, which is\n               really tender.\n                   (unravelling)\n               I think I should come with you to Rome\n               and just confront him.\n\n     Ripley lights a cigarette.  Marge loses confidence.\n\n                         MARGE (cont'd)\n               He hates being confronted.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I think you're right.\n\n     INT. ALBERGO GOLDONI, ROME. DAY.\n\n     RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of\n     this small hotel. He exchanges his passport at the desk for\n     his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to\n     the metal cage elevator. THIS SCENE INTERCUTS WITH:\n\n     INT. HOTEL GRAND. DAY.\n\n     DICKIE'S ARRAY OF LEATHER LUGGAGE is pulled along on a \n     baggage trolley by a liveried PORTER.\n\n     Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk. A key comes\n     back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive\n     rings.  As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the\n     passport, he looks at the owner.  Ripley wears a terrific\n     suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses. His\n     voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl.\n\n                         ALDO\n               Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (walking away)\n               Thank you.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. DAY.\n\n     The PORTER takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks\n     around the suite. It's large and splendid. Ripley breathes in\n     its opulence.  He immediately picks up the telephone.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel\n               Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor\n               Thomas Ripley - No Ripley, R, yes.\n               Grazie.\n\n     He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly - H R\n     Greenleaf.  Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing\n     case to reveal Dickie's Stars, hide your fires handwriting\n     specimen. He compares the two signatures, is pleased.\n\n     The telephone rings.\n\n                         RIPLEY (cont'd)\n               Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd\n               like to leave a message. Yes. Please call\n               Dickie - Dickie Greenleaf - at the Grand.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S HOTEL ROOM, GOLDONI. DAY.\n\n     A tiny, cell of a room, single bed. Ripley on the phone.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               He's not there?  Very well. I'll leave a\n               message - Got your call. Dinner tonight\n               sounds fine. Ripley.\n                   (listens as it's read back)\n               Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank\n               you.\n\n     INT. GUCCI STORE, ROME. DAY.\n\n     Ripley has bought some more LEATHER GOODS - a briefcase and\n     overnight bag. He is at the counter, signing checks.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'd like these to have my initials -\n               embossed, I don't know the word in\n               Italian ...embossed?\n\n                         GUCCI ASSISTANT\n               Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf.\n\n     There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!\n     Shocked, Ripley looks over to find MEREDITH LOGUE outside,\n     alone and delighted to see him.

I don't think so. But I've met him,\n               of course, and we've chatted and I know\n               about you and Marge and Mongi and what an\n               unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you\n               were a rat and I thought to myself now I\n               know why he travels under R.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So\n               the rat's here now, in Rome.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Don't be sorry.

DAY.\n\n     Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head\n     inside the office.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               The truth is if you've had money your\n               entire life, even if you despise it,\n               which we do - agreed? - you're only truly\n               comfortable around other people who have\n               it and despise it.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I know.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               I've never admitted that to anyone.\n\n     INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.\n\n     Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with\n     him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed\n     by her presence.  She goes to the window ahead of him.\n\n     She takes her money, turns to him.\n\n     He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's\n     signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at\n     him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I don't want too many large bills. Nobody\n               will change them.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY.\n\n     Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket\n     for Ripley.

While he's inside,\n     Meredith shows the Tailor out.  As she returns she notices\n     the open sax case, peers inside.\n\n                         MEREDITH (O/S)\n               I know you're a jazz fiend but do you\n               absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been\n               trying to give my tickets away, it's\n               tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be\n               dragged...\n\n     She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by\n     him, the romance she feels to be in the air.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (emerging)\n               You could drag me.\n\n     INT.

He knows what comes next.\n     Lensky is shot by Onegin. Blood pours from his neck into the\n     snow.  Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes\n     over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing,\n     kneels holding him... Ripley can barely hide his emotion...\n     Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.\n\n     INT. OUTSIDE THE BOXES, OPERA HOUSE, ROME.\n\n     The Interval.  Ripley and Meredith exit their box with\n     Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval\n     drinks).\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.\n\n                         JOAN\n               Can you bear it?

OPERA HOUSE, FOYER. NIGHT.\n\n     Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the\n     Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured\n     Englishman.

Really. Don't worry.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               You're such a pal to understand. It's as\n               if Marge is here now - I look at you and\n               I see her face - and I can't, whatever\n               I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               No, I absolutely understand.

Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps,\n     among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an\n     outside table. Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via\n     Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith.  She\n     acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.\n\n                         PETER\n               Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm\n               sorry, half-asleep, how are you?

He's - I\n               think you'll find he's coming home to\n               you.\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (proprietorial)\n               How would you know that?\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               He told me everything. I was supposed to\n               meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm\n               going to go now, I think. Unless he meant\n               us to meet - which would be a little\n               cruel, wouldn't it?\n\n                         PETER\n               No, we're meeting another friend.

Peter lays a hand to comfort her.\n\n                         MEREDITH (cont'd)\n               I hope I didn't complicate matters, but\n               nothing, nothing untoward happened,\n               nothing to prevent you from welcoming him\n               back, from marrying him...Goodbye.\n               Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.\n\n     Peter gets up. Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of\n     the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the\n     crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he\n     becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. He's\n     apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his\n     element, lying and believing in his lie.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers.\n               Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp\n               when they can make you line up for three.\n               Have you been waiting long?\n\n                         PETER\n               Not at all. Morning Tom.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Hi.\n                   (to Marge)\n               Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've\n               seen a ghost...\n\n                         MARGE\n               Dickie was at the Opera last night.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't\n               drag Dickie to -\n\n                         MARGE\n               He was there with someone. So I suppose\n               she must have dragged him - that's not\n               fair.  I'm going back to Mongi. I think\n               Dickie's coming home.\n                   (to Peter)\n               I'm going to go home.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Really? That's swell. No, I was just -\n               you're way ahead of me! Great!\n\n                         PETER\n               We think he's had a change of heart.\n                   (to Marge)\n               So we should be celebrating.\n\n                         MARGE\n               I hope so.\n\n                         PETER\n                   (to Marge)\n               That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith\n               said -\n                   (to Ripley)\n               Meredith's the American girl I saw last\n               night, I know her, at the Opera, she's\n               been seeing something of Dickie -\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               My God.\n\n                         PETER\n               But the point is Dickie - well we know\n               this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses\n               her and apparently he's come to his\n               senses...\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               It's fantastic.\n                   (to Peter)\n               I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand\n               this, but anytime Dickie does something I\n               feel guilty.\n\n     INT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY.\n\n     Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo\n     Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley\n     explores, relishing the decor.\n\n                         SIGNORA BUFFI\n               Accendo il riscaldamento.\n               (I'll turn the heating on.)\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (mimes playing sax)\n               Mi piace suonare.\n               (I like to play music.)\n\n                         SIGNORA BUFFI\n                   (shrugs)\n               Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una\n               coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace?\n               (I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,\n               do you like it?)\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.\n\n     Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.\n     There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with\n     some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's\n     a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a\n     glass, pours himself a drink.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON.\n\n     Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and\n     precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops\n     playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Hello?\n\n                         FREDDIE (O/S)\n               Dickie?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Who is it?\n\n                         FREDDIE (O/S)\n               It's Freddie. Let me in.\n\n     RIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint.\n\n                         FREDDIE (O/S)\n               Dickie, come on, it's me.\n\n     Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the\n     door.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n                   (confused, not pleasantly)\n               Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at\n               dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm.\n               If you said he was still at lunch I'd\n               believe you. Incredible. The guy has\n               disappeared off the face of the earth.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I guess.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               The landlady - as far as I could tell,\n               the landlady said he was here right now.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I\n               can't think why you would imagine Dickie\n               would hide from you.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               Because he's been hiding from me - what\n               happened at Christmas?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What about Christmas?\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't\n               get a cable or a call or a note or,\n               frankly, a fart.\n\n     Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING\n     FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the\n     kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.\n\n                         RIPLEY (O/S)\n               Of course, he's been very involved in his\n               music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,\n               you know, you have to go into a cocoon\n               before you can become a butterfly.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him\n               play that thing?\n                   (gesturing at the sax on its\n                    stand)\n               He can't.\n\n                         RIPLEY (O/S)\n                   (casually)\n               How did you find him? It's such an out of\n               the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               No thanks.\n                   (explaining his detective work)\n               Some kid at the American Express Office.\n                   (he starts to explore)\n               Are you living here?\n\n     Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (returning, flinching)\n               No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,\n               in Rome.  That's a new piano, so you prob -\n\n                         FREDDIE (O/S)\n               Did this place come furnished? It doesn't\n               look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so\n               bourgeois.\n\n     Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               You should watch that!\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               In fact the only thing which looks like\n               Dickie is you.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Hardly.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               Have you done something to your hair?\n\n     Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Freddie, do you have something to say?\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               What? I think I'm saying it. Something's\n               going on. He's either converted to\n               Christianity - or to something else.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself.\n               Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the\n               Corso.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               Is it on \"delle Croce, just off the\n               Corso\"? You're a quick study, aren't you?\n               Last time you didn't know your ass from\n               your elbow, now you're giving me\n               directions. That's not fair, you probably\n               do know your ass from your elbow. I'll\n               see you.\n\n     AND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner\n     on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back\n     to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.\n\n     INT. LANDING AND STAIRS, RIPLEY'S BUILDING. LATE DAY.\n\n     FREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley\n     can't make out the text but there's some discussion about\n     Signor Greenleaf and Signor Ripley. Ripley hurries inside as\n     Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY.\n\n     Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches\n     in, he launches into his interrogation.\n\n                         FREDDIE\n               Ripley? There's someth -\n\n     - AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY\n     SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE\n     HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE.\n\n     Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then\n     to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating\n     him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his\n     balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before\n     slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.\n     THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.\n\n     EXT. PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.\n\n     It's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows\n     towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley\n     talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He\n     pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (mimicking Freddie's voice)\n               Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her\n               husband's saying.\n\n     EXT. VIA APPIA ANTICA. NIGHT.\n\n     The Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs\n     punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car,\n     Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body.\n     He slows near a clump of trees.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. EVENING.\n\n     Someone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it,\n     finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO\n     POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Dickie Greenleaf?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Yes?\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING.\n\n     Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini\n     and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did\n               Signor Miles leave yesterday?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd\n               both taken on far too many drinks - but\n               it was dark, it was certainly dark when I\n               walked him down to his car.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               So Signor Miles drove away and you did\n               what?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but\n               I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks.\n               I've suffered all day. Who found him?\n\n     Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Senta.  We have to ask you to stay in\n               Rome.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               So, the Doctor, he has to make the -\n                   (looks at Baggio)\n               - come se dice?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Postmortem?\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Yes, exactly, but his first, his first\n               conclusion was that Signor Miles was\n               killed not later than seven o'clock\n               yesterday evening.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he\n               drove off in his car.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               No.\n\n     EXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING.\n\n     Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his\n     scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES\n     AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances\n     sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images\n     and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE\n     WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the\n     pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along\n     the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an\n     Italian, runs up concerned.\n\n     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY.\n\n     Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the\n     street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips\n     Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.\n     Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no\n     mood for pleasantries.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Did he kill Freddie?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Marge, when did you get here?\n\n                         MARGE\n               Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.\n\n                         MARGE\n               I tried again, waiting here, watching for\n               him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look\n               for Dickie I find you.\n\n                   (focusing on Ripley's cuts and\n                    bruises)\n               What happened to your face?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Dickie did it.\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (suddenly tense)\n               Dickie?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               My face! There was an argument. I said\n               some things I shouldn't have.  About you.\n               About the appalling way he's treating\n               you, all of us.  And the next thing I\n               know he's launched himself at me.\n                   (he pulls the scooter off the\n                    stand)\n               Are you getting on?\n\n                         MARGE\n               What?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Get on. I'll take you to him.\n\n     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. DAY.\n\n     Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter. The\n     entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars.\n     Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them. Ripley,\n     startled, drives straight past the entrance.\n\n     EXT. ROME STREET, BY THE RIVER. DAY.\n\n     Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different\n     piazza full of book stalls.  Marge is confused.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Where does Dickie live?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               We passed it a few blocks back, where the\n               police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They\n               don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not\n               going to incriminate Dickie -\n\n                         MARGE\n               Perhaps I shouldn't go either.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (thinking hard, distracted)\n               No, well go if you want to, but don't\n               talk to the Police about my face - they\n               find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he\n               could've hit Freddie.\n                   (sincerely)\n               Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you\n               later.\n\n     And he drives off. At the first opportunity HE DOUBLES BACK\n     and roars towards the Palazzo.\n\n     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. AFTERNOON.\n\n     Ripley drives towards the entrance.  As Ripley gets off and\n     pushes his scooter through the doorway SOME JOURNALISTS,\n     LOITERING INSIDE A BARBER'S SHOP come running out and swarm\n     around him with questions about Freddie. One of them gets off\n     a photograph.  It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away\n     as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside.\n\n     INT. ENTRANCE AND STAIRS, PALAZZO GIOIA. CONTINUOUS.\n\n     As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting\n     more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell. On a\n     landing is Roverini. Ripley hurries towards him.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Can we go up? Do you mind?\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Of course. What happened to your face?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by\n               photographers.\n\n     He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow.\n\n                         RIPLEY (cont'd)\n                   (agitated)\n               The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm\n               feeling hounded - do you think you could\n               not give out my address?\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Never. We've had many requests and, of\n               course, we say no - even to your fianc\u00c8e.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I really don't want to see anybody.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Even your fianc\u00c8e...?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Even her.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               What about Thomas Ripley?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What about Ripley?\n\n     Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment.\n     He waits nervously for Roverini. He unlocks the door and can\n     barely wait for Roverini to catch up.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.\n\n     Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo,\n               is that right?\n\n     Ripley is appalled. He smiles.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That\n               was months ago.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               November, I thought.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Was it? Did you speak to Tom?\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               November 7th is my information.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I don't remember the exact date.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               And when did you last see Signor Ripley?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               A few days ago.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Does he stay with you here?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               No!\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago\n               Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your\n               apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a\n               little boat is found in San Remo full of\n               rocks, and the owner tells the Police it\n               was stolen on November 7th. We look at\n               hotel records and we see oh! Dickie\n               Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then\n               our boatman remembers two Americans\n               taking a boat.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence.\n               There must be fifty hotels in San Remo,\n               there must have been a hundred people\n               renting a boat on that day.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               31 people.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               31 people.\n\n     Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge\n               Sherwood.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (appalled, defeated)\n               Let her in, what's the difference?  Let\n               her in.\n                   (Baggio is on his way to the\n                    door.)\n               No, actually, no, I'd like it very much\n               if you would ask her to come back later.\n\n     Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out.\n\n                         RIPLEY (cont'd)\n               Thank you.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n                   (watching him)\n               May I ask...why would you speak to your\n               friend and not your fianc\u00c8e?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I think I just said. Ripley was handling\n               some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley\n               want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me\n               every day if I would marry him. And when.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Do you have a photograph of Signor\n               Ripley?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'm not in the habit of carrying around\n               photographs of my male friends.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Now I think I have upset you. My English\n               perhaps is coarse.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               It is a little coarse, yes.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley\n               since San -\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I have!\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               You have, yes.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask\n               her! and if I could remember which hotel\n               he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom\n               was staying at the Goldoni.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n               Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A\n               coincidence.\n                   (he gets up to leave)\n               I look forward to our next meeting when I\n               will be more careful with my English and\n               persuade you to play me your saxophone.\n               Alto.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Absolutely.\n\n                         ROVERINI\n                   (suddenly turning)\n               I have a witness who thinks they saw two\n               men getting into Mr Miles' car. She\n               wants to identify you in a - confronto -\n               line-up.\n                   (ominously)\n               Tomorrow then?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (thrown, scrabbling)\n               Tomorrow.\n\n     Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through\n     the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the\n     stairs.\n\n                         ROVERINI (O/S)\n               Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.  He's in but I\n               really don't think he wants to see\n               anyone.\n\n     Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then\n     suddenly a voice shocks him upright.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me.\n               What am I doing, chasing you around...?\n               I was going to say I would count to three\n               and if you didn't open the door, but I\n               won't count any more. On you. I won't\n               count on you any more. Whatever it is,\n               whatever you've done or haven't done,\n               you've broken my heart. That's one thing\n               I know you're guilty of, and I don't know\n               why, I don't know why, I just don't know\n               why...\n\n     Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as\n     they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves\n     into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.\n\n     Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type.\n\n                         RIPLEY (O/S)\n               My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this.\n               Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought\n               about going to the police, but I can't do\n               it, I can't face it.  I can't face\n               anything anymore...\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.\n\n     CHAOS.  Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes,\n     dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one\n     for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates\n     from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one\n     shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing\n     Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks\n     it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.\n\n     He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and\n     needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's\n     leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff\n     links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he\n     opens to scratch at the photograph, obliterating the face.\n\n                         RIPLEY (O/S)\n               ...I wish I could give you the life I\n               took for granted. You've always\n               understood what's at the heart of me,\n               Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's\n               why I'm writing this to you, the brother\n               I never had. The only true friend I ever\n               had. In all kinds of ways you're much\n               more like the son my father always\n               wanted. I realise you can change the\n               people, change the scenery, but you can't\n               change your own rotten self. Now I can't\n               think what to do, or where to go. I'm\n               haunted by everything I've done, and\n               can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on.\n               I've made a mess of being Dickie\n               Greenleaf haven't I?\n\n     He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope\n     marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano\n     next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the\n     distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses\n     there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating,\n     as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.\n\n     INT. BASEMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.\n\n     Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL\n     BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and\n     gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush\n     couch sits on top of a mound of furniture.  He finds some\n     dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's\n     saxophone.\n\n     Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the\n     revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns\n     off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated\n     fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.\n\n     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA, ROME. NIGHT.\n\n     Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the\n     entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the\n     police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off\n     into the darkness.\n\n     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.\n\n     Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley,\n     hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it.\n\n     EXT. PIAZZALE ROMA, VENICE. DAWN.\n\n     Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a\n     MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith-\n     Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back.\n\n                         PETER\n                   (indicating the taxi stop)\n               I'll see you over there!\n\n     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. EARLY MORNING.\n\n     Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons\n     scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful\n     grey.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Peter, I'm really sorry to put you\n               through this. I just couldn't face going\n               to the police by myself when my Italian's\n               so rotten.\n\n                         PETER\n               Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted\n               you finally made it to Venice. I'm\n               delighted, contrary to rumour, you're\n               still in one piece?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What rumour?\n\n                         PETER\n               That Dickie murdered you and is\n               travelling under your passport. I know,\n               ridiculous.\n\n     INT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY.\n\n     Later.  Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,\n     where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being\n     processed.  The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a\n     horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in\n     conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley\n     waits.\n\n                         PETER\n               Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks,\n               doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh.\n               Sorry.

COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a\n     sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.\n     Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.

LATE DAY.\n\n     This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a\n     locked area for cells at one wall.  A small, sour window\n     gives onto a canal.  The main station is glimpsed through\n     some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through.\n\n     Verrecchia sits down.

The\n     orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the\n     organ.\n\n     Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and\n     listens. Peter sees him, smiles.

HERBERT GREENLEAF sits out\n     in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe,\n     cradling a glass of hot water.

You look well.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'm well, thank you.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Far cry from New York.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Yes it is.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Marge, good morning.  Unusual weather.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Very.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               And you, sir?  Any better?\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Pretty good.  Sticking with hot water.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Where's Mr MacCarron?\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well,\n               my boy, it's come to a pretty pass,\n               hasn't it?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Yes.  What's the detective hoping to\n               find in San Remo?\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               He's being thorough, that's all. I'm\n               learning about my son, Tom, now he's\n               missing. I'm learning a great deal about\n               him. I hope you can fill in some more\n               blanks for me. Marge has been good enough\n               to do that, about Mongibello.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do\n               anything to help Dickie.\n\n     Marge looks at him in contempt.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               This theory, the letter he left for you,\n               the Police think that's a clear\n               indication he was planning on doing\n               something...to himself.\n\n                         MARGE\n               I just don't believe that!\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk\n               to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon?\n               Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say\n               to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to\n               another fellow -\n\n                         MARGE\n               Such as?\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               What a waste of lives and opportunities\n               and -\n\n     A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza. Greenleaf\n     suddenly explodes.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n                         (cont'd)\n               - I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars\n               right now to shut up!\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.\n\n     Herbert Greenleaf sits on a chair, Ripley pours him some tea.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n                   (reading, plunging into gloom)\n               No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I think it might hurt her to know.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               And his passport photo? Did you hear? To\n               scratch out your own face like that - can\n               you imagine - the frame of mind you'd\n               have to be in?\n                   (reading)\n               I've thought about going to the police\n               but I can't face it. I can't face\n               anything anymore.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him\n               away. I spoke and he heard you.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n                   (such a disappointed father)\n               Well, if we all pushed him away what\n               about him pushing us away? You've been a\n               great friend to my son. Everything is\n               someone else's fault. We all want to sow\n               wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the\n               word?\n                   (Ripley shakes his head)\n               The moment someone confronts him he\n               lashes out.  He lashes out. You know,\n               people always say you can't choose your\n               parents, but you can't choose your\n               children.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK.\n\n     Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head\n     full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in\n     sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY\n     SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter\n     and Marge.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have\n               fallen asleep.\n\n                         PETER\n               You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?\n\n                         MARGE\n               Did Dickie's Dad go?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               He's having an early night.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Poor man.\n                   (she heads to her room)\n               We were knocking on that door for ever.\n                   (she fiddles inside the sleeve\n                    of her dress)\n               I think I've broken my strap.\n\n                         PETER\n               Not guilty.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'll fix some drinks.\n\n                         MARGE\n               You walk in Venice!\n\n     She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear,\n     then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley,\n     a little concerned.\n\n                         PETER\n               Are you okay?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I'm fine.\n\n                         PETER\n                   (a hand on his shoulder)\n               Do you want me to stick around?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               It's okay.\n\n                         PETER\n               Or I could come back.\n\n     Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his\n     pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles.\n\n                         PETER (cont'd)\n               Your key.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.\n\n     Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door.\n\n                         MARGE (O/S)\n               Tom?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.\n\n                         MARGE (O/S)\n               Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.\n\n     Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around\n     his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's\n     slightly breathless.\n\n                         MARGE\n               I found Dickie's rings.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What?\n\n                         MARGE\n               You've got Dickie's rings.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I can explain.\n\n     He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Dickie promised me he would never take\n               off this ring.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Let me put on some clothes and then we\n               can talk about this.\n\n                         MARGE\n               I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to\n               tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr\n               Greenleaf.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Marge, calm down, you're being\n               hysterical.\n\n                         MARGE\n               He promised me. I swear I'll never take\n               off this ring until the day -\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Shut up! Shut up!\n\n     His towel slips off from his waist.\n\n                         RIPLEY (cont'd)\n               I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd\n               really like to put my clothes on. So go\n               and pour us both a drink, will you?\n\n     She goes off obediently, a zombie. He shuts the door.\n     Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to\n     kill Marge with. He's got a shoe but it feels too light. He\n     opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then\n     picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY'S SITTING ROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.\n\n     Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the\n     bathroom.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Marge?  Where are you going?\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (like a creature caught in\n                    headlights)\n               I was looking for a needle and thread. I\n               wasn't snooping. I was looking for a\n               needle and thread to mend my bra.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               The scent you're wearing. I bought it for\n               you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie.\n               So many things. The day he was late back\n               from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he\n               was with another girl. I'm not talking\n               about Meredith, another girl we met in a\n               bar. He couldn't be faithful for five\n               minutes. So when he makes a promise it\n               doesn't mean what it means when you make\n               a promise. Or I do. He has so many\n               realities, Dickie, and he believes them\n               all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half\n               the time he doesn't even realize.\n\n     A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As\n     he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently.\n\n                         RIPLEY (cont'd)\n               Today, for the first time, I've even\n               wondered whether he might have killed\n               Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody\n               contradicted him - well, you know that.\n               Marge. I loved you - you might as well\n               know - I loved you, and because he knew I\n               loved you, he let you think I loved him.\n               Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't\n               know, maybe it's grotesque to say this\n               now, so just write it on a piece of paper\n               or something, and keep it in your purse\n               for a rainy day. Tom loves me.\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (as if she'd heard nothing)\n               Why do you have Dickie's rings?\n\n     His hand goes to his pocket. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I told you. He gave them to me.\n\n                         MARGE\n               Why? When?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I feel as if you haven't heard anything\n               I've been saying to you.\n\n                         MARGE\n               I don't believe you.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               It's all true.\n\n                         MARGE\n               I don't believe a single word you've\n               said.\n\n     Marge is shivering. Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you?\n               Would you let me hold you?\n\n     Marge panics, backed up against the door. She screams and\n     turns straight into the arms of a startled PETER who's come\n     back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door.\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (sobbing uncontrollably)\n               Oh Peter! Get me out of here.\n\n     Ripley storms off. His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED\n     IN BLOOD from the razor. Peter notices, appalled.\n\n                         PETER\n               Tom, are you okay?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               You try. You try talking to her.\n\n                         PETER\n                   (calls after him)\n               Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (not turning around)\n               I give up.\n\n     INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.\n\n     Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand.\n\n                         PETER\n               You can't be angry with her.  She's upset\n               and needs someone to blame. So she blames\n               you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As\n               for you - either get a safety razor or\n               grow a beard.\n\n     INT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING.\n\n     Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance.\n\n     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY.\n\n     Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't\n     recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the\n     private investigator.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Is Mr Greenleaf here?\n\n                         MACCARRON\n               Mr Ripley?

THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE\n     TABLE.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Tom.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Hello, sir.\n                   (smiles thinly at Marge)\n               Marge, you should have waited, didn't\n               Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you\n               up?\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Marge has been telling us about the\n               rings.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               You know I feel ridiculous I didn't\n               mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -\n               ridiculous.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               Perhaps you didn't mention them because\n               there's only one conclusion to be drawn.\n\n     Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf\n     heads into his bedroom.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n                         (cont'd)\n               I'm going to take Marge for a little\n               walk, Tom.  Mr MacCarron wants to talk\n               with you.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (feeling caged in)\n               We could go down to the bar - no need for\n               you to -\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n               No, he should talk to you alone.\n\n     He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS\n     PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks\n     out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and\n     indifferent view.\n\n     EXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY.\n\n     Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I could probably see my bedroom from\n               here. I can see my house. When you see\n               where you live from a distance it's like\n               a dream, isn't it?\n\n                         MACCARRON\n                   (coming out)\n               I don't care for B.S. I don't care to\n               hear it. I don't care to speak it.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Okay.\n\n                         MACCARRON\n               Why do you think Dickie's father sent him\n               to Europe in the first place? Did you\n               know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-\n               killed a boy?\n\n     Ripley turns, shocked.\n\n                         MACCARRON\n                         (cont'd)\n               At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the\n               kid several times in the head. Put him in\n               the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in\n               his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to\n               ask Mr Greenleaf.\n\n     MacCarron gets up.\n\n                         MACCARRON\n                         (cont'd)\n               Nor did they think to check whether a\n               Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at\n               Princeton University. I turned up a Tom\n               Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the\n               music department.\n\n     Ripley's head drops.\n\n                         MACCARRON\n                         (cont'd)\n               See - in America we're taught to check a\n               fact before it becomes a fact. We're\n               taught to nose around when a girl drowns\n               herself, find out if that girl was\n               pregnant, find out if Dickie had an\n               embarrassment there.\n\n     Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.\n\n                         MACCARRON\n                         (cont'd)\n               Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.\n               He really does. Marge, she's got a\n               hundred theories, but there are a few\n               things she doesn't know. We hope she\n               never knows.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I hope she never knows.\n\n                         MACCARRON\n               Three different people saw Dickie get\n               into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't\n               identify himself because he was jumping\n               someone else's wife at the time saw\n               Dickie removing license plates from a red\n               sports car. The Police know about this\n               man because he happens to be a Policeman.\n\n     He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES\n     from Freddie's car.\n\n                         MACCARRON\n                         (cont'd)\n               I found these in the basement of Dickie's\n               apartment. They belonged to Freddie's\n               car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose\n               them in the canal this evening.\n\n     Ripley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream.\n\n                         MACCARRON\n                         (cont'd)\n               Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a\n               silent promise in Dickie's letter to you\n               which he intends to honor. He intends to\n               transfer a good part of Dickie's income\n               from his trust into your name. He doesn't\n               intend to give the Italian police any\n               information about Dickie's past. He's\n               rather hoping you'll feel the same.\n\n     There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.\n\n     EXT. EUROPA REGINA MOORING. DAY.\n\n     Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the\n     water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and\n     then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert\n     Greenleaf carries the saxophone case.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n                   (to Marge)\n               I feel I never should have said those\n               things to you the other evening. I was\n               pretty flustered, the rings and - and you\n               looked so, I don't know.\n\n     Marge shakes her head to silence him.\n\n                         RIPLEY (cont'd)\n               But I hope that note goes to New York in\n               your purse, for a rainy day.\n\n                         MARGE\n               What are you going to do now, Tom?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I don't know. Peter has a concert in\n               Athens next month - and he's asked if I\n               want to go along, help out. He says\n               goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal,\n               otherwise -\n\n                         MARGE\n               Why do I think there's never been a\n               Ripley rainy day?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               What?\n\n                         MARGE\n                   (lunging at him)\n               I know it was you - I know it was you,\n               Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed\n               Dickie. I know it was you.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Oh Marge.\n\n     He puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away.\n     STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that\n     Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to\n     restrain her.  Ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you\n     do, she's hysterical. MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the\n     boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away.\n     They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off\n     towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.\n\n     EXT. FERRY FOR ATHENS, NAPLES. DAY.\n\n     A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the\n     ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.  They're\n     laughing.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Ask me what I want to change about this\n               moment.\n\n                         PETER\n               What do you want to change about this\n               moment?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Nothing.\n\n     INT. PETER'S CABIN. DUSK.\n\n     Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his\n     traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in.\n\n                         PETER\n               Hello.  What are you up to?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               All kinds of things. Making plans.\n\n                         PETER\n               Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans\n               for the future?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I don't know. Both. My plan right now is\n               to go up on deck, look at the sunset.\n               Come with me.\n\n                         PETER\n               You go. I don't want to get dressed yet.\n               Come back though.  Come back.\n                   (smiles at him)\n               You know, you look so relaxed, like a\n               completely different person.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Well, that's entirely your fault.  And,\n               if I fall overboard, that'll be your\n               fault too.\n\n     EXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET.\n\n     Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.\n     Then a voice shakes him from his reverie.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               Dickie?  Dickie?\n\n     He turns. He's caught.

Are you alone?\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.\n\n     Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER\n     COUPLES are walking around the deck.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               Of course.  Aunt Joan.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've\n               thought about you so much.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I've thought about you.\n\n     And now he's thinking I can't kill them all...\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               When I thought about you I was mostly\n               hating you. Where've you been hiding?\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I haven't been hiding. I've been in\n               Police custody. They've been trying to\n               flush out Freddie's killer.\n\n                         MEREDITH\n               You're kidding.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               They're letting me have this vacation.\n               Which is why the get-up.

Kissing off.\n\n                         PETER\n               Didn't look that way - you know - from a\n               distance.\n\n                         RIPLEY\n               I lied. To her.

His eyes are\n     brimming with tears.  He takes the cord from Peter's robe and\n     begins twisting it in his hands.\n\n                         PETER\n               Good things about Tom Ripley?  Could take\n               some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is\n               tender...

RIPLEY'S CABIN. NIGHT.\n\n     Ripley returns to his cabin. Sits on the bed, desolate.\n\n                         PETER (O/S)\n                   (cont'd)\n               ...Tom is not a nobody. Tom has secrets\n               he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he\n               would. Tom has nightmares. That's not a\n               good thing. Tom has someone to love him.\n               That is a good thing!\n                   (feeling Ripley's weight on\n                    him)\n               Tom is crushing me. Tom is crushing me.\n                   (suddenly alarmed)\n               Tom, you're crushing me!\n\n     The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he\n     catches his reflection. It swings shut. Open then shut.\n     Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light\n     dies. There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the\n     round glass. Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making.\n\n     THE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Lullaby for Cain\n\n     From the silence\n     from the night\n     comes a distant lullabye\n\n     Cry, remembering that first cry\n     Your brother standing by\n     and loved\n     both loved\n     beloved sons of mine\n     sing a lullabye\n     mother is close by\n     innocent eyes\n     such innocent eyes\n\n     Envy stole your brother's life\n     came home murdered peace of mind\n     left you nightmares on the pillow\n     sleep now\n\n     Soul, surrendering your soul\n     the heart of you not whole\n     for love\n     but love\n     what toll\n\n     Cast into the dark\n     branded with the mark\n     of shame\n     of Cain\n\n     From the garden of God's light\n     to a wilderness of light\n     sleep now\n\n     sleep now.\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalented Mr. Ripley, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Anthony Minghella\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:56.249415"}
