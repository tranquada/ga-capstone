What does that get us? A \n                         discontented, lazy rabble instead of \n                         a thrifty working class. And all \n                         because a few starry-eyed dreamers \n                         like Peter Bailey stir them up and \n                         fill their heads with a lot of \n                         impossible ideas. Now, I say...\n\n               George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, \n               incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.\n\n<b>                                     GEORGE\n</b>                         Just a minute \u0096 just a minute. Now, \n                         hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right \n                         when you say my father was no business \n                         man. I know that. Why he ever started \n                         this cheap, penny-ante Building and \n                         Loan, I'll never know. But neither \n                         you nor anybody else can say anything \n                         against his character, because his \n                         whole life was... Why, in the twenty-\n                         five years since he and Uncle Billy \n                         started this thing, he never once \n                         thought of himself. Isn't that right, \n                         Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough \n                         money to send Harry to school, let \n                         alone me. But he did help a few people \n                         get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. \n                         And what's wrong with that? Why...  \n                         Here, you're all businessmen here. \n                         Doesn't it make them better citizens? \n                         Doesn't it make them better customers? \n                         You... you said... What'd you say \n                         just a minute ago?... They had to \n                         wait and save their money before \n                         they even ought to think of a decent \n                         home. Wait! Wait for what? Until \n                         their children grow up and leave \n                         them?  Until they're so old and broken-\n                         down that they... Do you know how \n                         long it takes a working man to save \n                         five thousand dollars?  Just remember \n                         this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble \n                         you're talking about... they do most \n                         of the working and paying and living \n                         and dying in this community. Well, \n                         is it too much to have them work and \n                         pay and live and die in a couple of \n                         decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my \n                         father didn't think so. People were \n                         human beings to him, but to you, a \n                         warped, frustrated old man, they're \n                         cattle.

He is in his long winter \n               underwear.  He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at \n               the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the \n               tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved \n               problems.  Clarence is standing on the other side of the \n               stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous \n               seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night \n               shirt \u0096 with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at \n               the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.  The \n               tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them \n               suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but \n               each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or \n               says.

Clarence, secretly trying to get George's \n               attention, now picks up a copy of \"Tom Sawyer\" which is \n               hanging on the line, drying.

Nick the bartender is behind the \n               bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the \n               difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming.

How about some wine?\n\n               As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and \n               glasses, Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord. \n               She starts playing \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,\" and the \n               entire crowd joins in the singing. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS \n               of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are \n               still coming in and dropping their money on the table. Carter, \n               the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly \n               looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces. In \n               the midst of this scene, Harry, in Naval uniform, enters, \n               accompanied by Bert, the cop.\n\n<b>                                     HARRY\n</b>                         Hello, George, how are you?\n\n<b>                                     GEORGE\n</b>                         Harry...

Janie \n               at the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing \"Auld \n               Lang syne,\" and everyone joins in.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT\n</b>\n               George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the \n               pile of money on the table. His eye catches something on top \n               of the pile, and he reaches down for it. It is Clarence's \n               copy of \"Tom Sawyer.\" George opens it and finds an inscription \n               written in it: \"Dear George, remember no man is a failure \n               who has friends.

Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the \n               bell.\n\n<b>                                     ZUZU\n</b>                         Look, Daddy.
