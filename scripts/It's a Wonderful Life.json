BAILEY BUILDING AND LOAN OFFICE \u0096 DAY\n\n               CLOSE SHOT \u0096 DIRECTORS MEETING\n\n               There are about twelve directors seated around a long table. \n               They are the substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr. \n               Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate \n               salesman, etc.  Prominently seated among them is Henry F. \n               Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair. Uncle Billy and George \n               are seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is \n               Dr. Campbell. They have folders and papers before them, on \n               which they have been reporting.  Before each of the directors \n               there are individual reports for them to study.\n\n                                     DR. CAMPBELL\n                         I think that's all we'll need you \n                         for, George. I know you're anxious \n                         to make a train.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                              (rising)\n                         I have a taxi waiting downstairs.\n\n                                     DR.

Good luck to you \n                         at school, George.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Thanks.\n\n                                     DR. CAMPBELL\n                         Now we come to the real purpose of \n                         this meeting \u0096 to appoint a successor \n                         to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my \n                         real purpose.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Wait just a minute now.\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         Wait for what?  I claim this \n                         institution is not necessary to this \n                         town. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I \n                         make a motion to dissolve this \n                         institution and turn its assets and \n                         liabilities over to the receiver.\n\n                                     UNCLE BILLY\n                              (angrily)\n                         George, you hear what that buzzard...\n\n                                     LAWYER\n                         Mr. Chairman, it's too soon after \n                         Peter Bailey's death to discuss \n                         chloroforming the Building and Loan.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Peter Bailey died three months ago. \n                         I second Mr. Potter's motion.\n\n                                     DR. CAMPBELL\n                         Very well. In that case I'll ask the \n                         two executive officers to withdraw.\n\n               Dr. Campbell rises from his seat. George and Uncle Billy \n               start to collect their papers and leave the table.\n\n                                     DR. CAMPBELL\n                         But before you go, I'm sure the whole \n                         board wishes to express its deep \n                         sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Thank you very much.\n\n                                     DR. CAMPBELL\n                         It was his faith and devotion that \n                         are responsible for this organization.\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         I'll go further than that. I'll say \n                         that to the public Peter Bailey was \n                         the Building and Loan.\n\n               Everyone looks at him surprised.\n\n                                     UNCLE BILLY\n                              (trying to control \n                              himself)\n                         Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from \n                         you, considering that you probably \n                         drove him to his grave.\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         Peter Bailey was not a business man.  \n                         That's what killed him. Oh, I don't \n                         mean any disrespect to him, God rest \n                         his soul.  He was a man of high \n                         ideals, so-called, but ideals without \n                         common sense can ruin this town.\n                              (picking up papers \n                              from table)\n                         Now, you take this loan here to Ernie \n                         Bishop... You know, that fellow that \n                         sits around all day on his brains in \n                         his taxi.  You know... I happen to \n                         know the bank turned down this loan, \n                         but he comes here and we're building \n                         him a house worth five thousand \n                         dollars. Why?\n\n               George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and \n               papers, ready to leave.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter. \n                         You have all the papers there. His \n                         salary, insurance. I can personally \n                         vouch for his character.\n\n                                     POTTER\n                              (sarcastically)\n                         A friend of yours?\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Yes, sir.\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         You see, if you shoot pool with some \n                         employee here, you can come and borrow \n                         money. What does that get us? A \n                         discontented, lazy rabble instead of \n                         a thrifty working class. And all \n                         because a few starry-eyed dreamers \n                         like Peter Bailey stir them up and \n                         fill their heads with a lot of \n                         impossible ideas. Now, I say...\n\n               George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, \n               incensed by what Potter is saying about his father.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Just a minute \u0096 just a minute. Now, \n                         hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right \n                         when you say my father was no business \n                         man. I know that. Why he ever started \n                         this cheap, penny-ante Building and \n                         Loan, I'll never know. But neither \n                         you nor anybody else can say anything \n                         against his character, because his \n                         whole life was... Why, in the twenty-\n                         five years since he and Uncle Billy \n                         started this thing, he never once \n                         thought of himself. Isn't that right, \n                         Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough \n                         money to send Harry to school, let \n                         alone me. But he did help a few people \n                         get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. \n                         And what's wrong with that? Why...  \n                         Here, you're all businessmen here. \n                         Doesn't it make them better citizens? \n                         Doesn't it make them better customers? \n                         You... you said... What'd you say \n                         just a minute ago?... They had to \n                         wait and save their money before \n                         they even ought to think of a decent \n                         home. Wait! Wait for what? Until \n                         their children grow up and leave \n                         them?  Until they're so old and broken-\n                         down that they... Do you know how \n                         long it takes a working man to save \n                         five thousand dollars?  Just remember \n                         this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble \n                         you're talking about... they do most \n                         of the working and paying and living \n                         and dying in this community. Well, \n                         is it too much to have them work and \n                         pay and live and die in a couple of \n                         decent rooms and a bath?

If Potter \n                         gets hold of this Building and Loan \n                         there'll never be another decent \n                         house built in this town.

Why? \n                         Well, it's very simple. Because we're \n                         cutting in on his business, that's \n                         why.  And because he wants to keep \n                         you living in his slums and paying \n                         the kind of rent he decides.\n\n               The people are still trying to get out, but some of them \n               have stood still, listening to him.

You didn't lose your house, \n                         did you? Do you think Potter would \n                         have let you keep it?\n                              (turns to address the \n                              room again)\n                         Can't you understand what's happening \n                         here?

That's why. He's picking \n                         up some bargains.  Now, we can get \n                         through this thing all right. We've \n                         got to stick together, though. We've \n                         got to have faith in each other.\n\n                                     MRS.

Quite a cigar, Mr. \n                         Potter.\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         You like it? I'll send you a box.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                              (nervously)\n                         Well, I... I suppose I'll find out \n                         sooner or later, but just what exactly \n                         did you want to see me about?\n\n                                     POTTER\n                              (laughs)\n                         George, now that's just what I like \n                         so much about you.\n                              (pleasantly and \n                              smoothly)\n                         George, I'm an old man, and most \n                         people hate me. But I don't like \n                         them either, so that makes it all \n                         even. You know just as well as I do \n                         that I run practically everything in \n                         this town but the Bailey Building \n                         and Loan. You know, also, that for a \n                         number of years I've been trying to \n                         get control of it... or kill it. But \n                         I haven't been able to do it. You \n                         have been stopping me. In fact, you \n                         have beaten me, George, and as anyone \n                         in this county can tell you, that \n                         takes some doing. Take during the \n                         depression, for instance. You and I \n                         were the only ones that kept our \n                         heads. You saved the Building and \n                         Loan, and I saved all the rest.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Yes. Well, most people say you stole \n                         all the rest.\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         The envious ones say that, George, \n                         the suckers. Now, I have stated my \n                         side very frankly. Now, let's look \n                         at your side.  Young man, twenty-\n                         seven, twenty-eight...  married, \n                         making, say... forty a week.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                              (indignantly)\n                         Forty-five!\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, \n                         after supporting your mother, and \n                         paying your bills, you're able to \n                         keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child \n                         or two comes along, and you won't \n                         even be able to save the ten. Now, \n                         if this young man of twenty-eight \n                         was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd \n                         say he was doing fine. But George \n                         Bailey is not a common, ordinary \n                         yokel. He's an intelligent, smart, \n                         ambitious young man \u0097 who hates his \n                         job \u0096 who hates the Building and \n                         Loan almost as much as I do. A young \n                         man who's been dying to get out on \n                         his own ever since he was born. A \n                         young man... the smartest one of the \n                         crowd, mind you, a young man who has \n                         to sit by and watch his friends go \n                         places, because he's trapped.  Yes, \n                         sir, trapped into frittering his \n                         life away playing nursemaid to a lot \n                         of garlic-eaters.  Do I paint a \n                         correct picture, or do I exaggerate?\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                              (mystified)\n                         Now what's your point, Mr. Potter?\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         My point? My point is, I want to \n                         hire you.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                              (dumbfounded)\n                         Hire me?\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         I want you to manage my affairs, run \n                         my properties. George, I'll start \n                         you out at twenty thousand dollars a \n                         year.\n\n               George drops his cigar on his lap. He nervously brushes off \n               the sparks from his clothes.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                              (flabbergasted)\n                         Twenty thou... twenty thousand dollars \n                         a year?\n\n                                     POTTER\n                         You wouldn't mind living in the nicest \n                         house in town, buying your wife a \n                         lot of fine clothes, a couple of \n                         business trips to New York a year, \n                         maybe once in a while Europe.

In that \n               moment of physical contact he knows he could never be \n               associated with this man.  George drops his hand with a \n               shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                              (vehemently)\n                         No... no... no... no, now wait a \n                         minute, here!

Mary is asleep in the bed. As George \n               comes in, his head is filled with many confusing thoughts, \n               relating to incidents in his past life.\n\n                                     POTTER'S VOICE\n                         You wouldn't mind living in the nicest \n                         house in town.

Maybe to Europe once \n                         in a while.\n\n               George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser \n               and stares at his reflection in the mirror.\n\n                                     GEORGE'S VOICE\n                         I know what I'm going to do tomorrow \n                         and the next day and next year and \n                         the year after that. I'm shaking the \n                         dust of this crummy little town off \n                         my feet, and I'm going to see the \n                         world...

ZUZU'S BEDROOM \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               FULL SHOT\n\n               The SOUND of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same \n               monotonous rhythm over and over. Zuzu (aged six) is sitting \n               up in her bed, the lamp burning beside her. She is holding \n               her prize flower.  George tiptoes in. Then, as he sees she's \n               awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed.\n\n                                     ZUZU\n                         Hi, Daddy.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Well, what happened to you?\n\n                                     ZUZU\n                         I won a flower.\n\n               She starts to get out of bed.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Wait now.

She picks them up.\n\n                                     ZUZU\n                         Look, Daddy... paste it.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste \n                         this together.\n\n               She hands him the fallen petals and the flower. He turns his \n               back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower. He \n               sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the \n               flower, and then turns back to Zuzu.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         There it is, good as new.\n\n                                     ZUZU\n                         Give the flower a drink.\n\n               George puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside \n               her bed.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Now, will you do something for me?\n\n               CLOSEUP \u0096 GEORGE AND ZUZU\n\n               They whisper.\n\n                                     ZUZU\n                         What?\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Will you try to get some sleep?\n\n                                     ZUZU\n                         I'm not sleepy.

George pulls the \n               covers over her. He bends down and his lips touch a tendril \n               of the child's hair. Then he gets up and tiptoes out of the \n               room.\n\n               INT.

George gets out to look at the damage, \n               and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to \n               shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running \n               out.\n\n                                     OWNER\n                         What do you think you're doing?\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               George stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident. \n               The front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George \n               stands dully looking at the damage. The owner comes up, \n               looking at his tree. He leans over to examine the damages.\n\n                                     OWNER\n                              (with indignation)\n                         Now look what you did.

He leans over looking at the water, \n               fascinated, glances furtively around him, hunches himself as \n               though about to jump.\n\n               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT\n\n               From above George a body hurtles past and lands in the water \n               with a loud splash.

TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes \n               running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines \n               on the two figures struggling in the water below.\n\n               EXT. RIVER \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               The man in the water is Clarence, the angel whose voice we \n               have heard speaking from Heaven. George reaches him, grabs \n               hold of him, and starts swimming for shore.\n\n                                                                   WIPE TO:\n\n               INT. TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               MEDIUM SHOT \u0096 GEORGE, CLARENCE, AND THE TOLLKEEPER\n\n               George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which \n               his clothes are drying on a line. He is in his long winter \n               underwear.  He is sipping a mug of hot coffee, staring at \n               the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring Clarence and the \n               tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved \n               problems.  Clarence is standing on the other side of the \n               stove, putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous \n               seventeenth century garment which looks like a baby's night \n               shirt \u0096 with embroidered cuffs and collar, and gathered at \n               the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.  The \n               tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them \n               suspiciously. Throughout the scene he attempts to spit, but \n               each time is stopped by some amazing thing Clarence does or \n               says.  Clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing \n               the tollkeeper.\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                         I didn't have time to get some stylish \n                         underwear. My wife gave me this on \n                         my last birthday. I passed away in \n                         it.\n\n               The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of \n               it by this remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's \n               attention, now picks up a copy of \"Tom Sawyer\" which is \n               hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the book.\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                         Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too. \n                         You should read the new book Mark \n                         Twain's writing now.\n\n               The tollkeeper stares at him incredulously.\n\n                                     TOLLKEEPER\n                         How'd you happen to fall in?\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                         I didn't fall in. I jumped in to \n                         save George.\n\n               George looks up, surprised.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         You what?

I knew if I were drowning \n                         you'd try to save me. And you see, \n                         you did, and that's how I saved you.\n\n               The tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George casually \n               looks at the strange smiling little man a second time.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                              (offhand)\n                         Very funny.\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                         Your lip's bleeding, George.\n\n               George's hand goes to his mouth.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in \n                         answer to a prayer a little bit ago.\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                              (comes around to George)\n                         Oh, no \u0096 no \u0096 no.

Nick the bartender is behind the \n               bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not notice the \n               difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming.

George has a strange, \n               puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they \n               landed, looking at each other.\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                         You see, George, you were not there \n                         to stop Gower from putting that poison \n                         into the...\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         What do you mean, I wasn't there? I \n                         remember distinctly...\n\n               George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with \n               the neon sign over the door. It now reads \"NICK'S PLACE\" \n               instead of \"MARTINI'S.\"\n\n               George and Clarence get to their feet.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                              (exasperated)\n                         What the... hey, what's going on \n                         around here?  Why, this ought to be \n                         Martini's place.\n\n               He points to the sign, and looks at Clarence. Clarence sort \n               of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested \n               look.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Look, who are you?\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                              (patiently)\n                         I told you, George. I'm your guardian \n                         angel.\n\n               George, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his \n               arm.  It's flesh.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. \n                         What else are you?

You have no identity.\n\n               George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but \n               without success.\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         What do you mean, no identity?

Wait a minute \n                         here. As, this is some sort of a \n                         funny dream I'm having here. So long, \n                         mister, I'm going home.\n\n               He starts off. Clarence rises.\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                         Home?

I'm seeing \n                         things. I'm going home and see my \n                         wife and family. Do you understand \n                         that? And I'm going home alone!\n\n               George strides off hurriedly.

STREET \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               MEDIUM SHOT \u0096 GEORGE MOVES INTO THE SCENE\n\n               The sign bearing the name of the town reads: \"Pottersville.\" \n               George looks at it in surprise, then starts up the street \n               toward the main part of town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH \n               him. The character of the place has completely changed. Where \n               before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has now become \n               in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS \n               of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and \n               the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority \n               of them. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque \n               house. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, \n               and so on.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               George stops before what used to be the offices of the \n               Building and Loan.  There is a garish electric sign over the \n               entrance reading: \"Welcome Jitterbugs.\" A crowd of people \n               are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and \n               dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw \n               into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops:\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Hey... hey.

Attracting his attention, he motions \n               to Bert to follow him, indicating he has a nut in the back. \n               Bert gets into his car and follows.\n\n                                                                   WIPE TO:\n\n               EXT.

It is Mrs. Bailey, but \n               she has changed amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired.

How about some wine?\n\n               As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and \n               glasses, Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord. \n               She starts playing \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,\" and the \n               entire crowd joins in the singing. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS \n               of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are \n               still coming in and dropping their money on the table. Carter, \n               the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly \n               looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces. In \n               the midst of this scene, Harry, in Naval uniform, enters, \n               accompanied by Bert, the cop.\n\n                                     HARRY\n                         Hello, George, how are you?\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         Harry...

Janie \n               at the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing \"Auld \n               Lang syne,\" and everyone joins in.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the \n               pile of money on the table. His eye catches something on top \n               of the pile, and he reaches down for it. It is Clarence's \n               copy of \"Tom Sawyer.\" George opens it and finds an inscription \n               written in it: \"Dear George, remember no man is a failure \n               who has friends. Thanks for the wings, Love Clarence.\"\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (looking at book)\n                         What's that?\n\n                                     GEORGE\n                         That's a Christmas present from a \n                         very dear friend of mine.\n\n               At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of \n               the people on the other side of the tree, a little silver \n               bell on the Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery \n               tinkle. Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the \n               bell.\n\n                                     ZUZU\n                         Look, Daddy.
