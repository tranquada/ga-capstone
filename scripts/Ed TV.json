Some kind of\n\tchampionship.\n\n\tONE TEAM is CELEBRATING -- jumping up and down, squealing and\n\thugging each other. We are focused on the bench of the TEAM TRAT\n\tLOST. They're very sad -- several are crying.\n\tOne girl, in particular, (AMY) is really sobbing. She's sweat-\n\tstained, tired and just blubbering.
