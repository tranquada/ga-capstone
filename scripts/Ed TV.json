HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT\n\tThe following is shot DOCUMENTARY-STYLE.\n\tA GIRLS VOLLEYBALL GAME has just ended. It was a big game. Some kind of\n\tchampionship.\n\n\tONE TEAM is CELEBRATING -- jumping up and down, squealing and\n\thugging each other. We are focused on the bench of the TEAM TRAT\n\tLOST. They're very sad -- several are crying.\n\tOne girl, in particular, (AMY) is really sobbing. She's sweat-\n\tstained, tired and just blubbering. Stuff's coming out of her eyes,\n\ther nose, her mouth and the camera is seeing it all.\n\n\tThe COACH, a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls -- Amy in\n\tparticular.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOACH\n\t\t\tYou quit! You gave up!\n\n\tHe KICKS a CHAIR.\n\n\tNow Amy is really a mess.

Just end it right there.\n\n\tREVEAL\n\n\n  2\tINT. OFFICE - DAY\n\tBEGIN CREDITS\n\n\tWe're in New York City. We're in the conference room of a modestly\n\tsuccessful cable TV station called \"Real TV.\" The people are\n\tyoung, energetic, clever. It's crowded, noisy -the furniture is\n\tbeaten up, bulletin boards cover the walls, with large index cards\n\tall over them.\n\tThis room is not for show -- work gets done here.\n\n\tSEVEN OR EIGHT PEOPLE are present. One of them is CYNTHIA REED.\n\tShe's the boss.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTERRY\n\t\t\t\t(to Cynthia)\n\t\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCYNTHIA\n\t\t\tIt's horrible, it's depressing, I\n\t\t\tlove it. What else?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tI want to re-pitch that pregnancy\n\t\t\tidea. Find six women early in their\n\t\t\tpregnancies and follow them all right\n\t\t\tthrough to the births.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKEITH\n\t\t\t\t(negative)\n\t\t\tYeah, when all that stuff comes\n\t\t\tout.\n\n\tMixed reactions, mostly negative.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCYNTHIA\n\t\t\tI have an idea.\n\n\tIMMEDIATE ATTENTION\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCYNTHIA (CONT'D)\n\t\t\tThis is something I've been thinking\n\t\t\tabout for a long time. We're \"Real\n\t\t\tTV\" right? I mean that's the name\n\t\t\tof the station.\n\n\tAGREEMENT\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCYNTHIA (CONT'D)\n\t\t\tSo let's go real. We find someone.\n\t\t\tJust a regular person, someone. And\n\t\t\twe put their life on television -\n\t\t\tlive... all day long.\n\n\tSilence. No movement at all.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCYNTHIA (CONT'D)\n\t\t\tCalm down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKEITH\n\t\t\tWhat do you mean, like PBS did in\n\t\t\tthe seventies? What was that\n\t\t\tfamily?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\tThe Louds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKEITH\n\t\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCYNTHIA\n\t\t\tNo. We go way beyond that. We\n\t\t\tdon't film it and edit it and put\n\t\t\tit on later. We go on the air\n\t\t\tlive every morning and the show\n\t\t\tgoes off each night, when our\n\t\t\tsubject goes to bed. In between,\n\t\t\twe're on live all day, every day -\n\t\t\tthe same person, -- for\n\t\t\t\t(shrugs)\n\t\t\tlet's say a month.\n\n\tNo one is wild for this. Some hate it -- some are unconvinced.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFELICIA\n\t\t\tThat's not a show that's a\n\t\t\tsurveillance camera.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\tYou can't do that.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCYNTHIA\n\t\t\tThe hell we can't. Look, the\n\t\t\tbeauty of being a cable \n\t\t\tchannel is we can take chances. I've\n\t\t\tthought about this and I'm\n\t\t\ttelling you, I think this can\n\t\t\tmake a noise. A loud one. There\n\t\t\tare twelve thousand channels.\n\t\t\tYou've got to do something that\n\t\t\tsays \"Look at me!\" Hell, people\n\t\t\tlook at fish tanks all day. This\n\t\t\tis people!\n\t\t\t\t(more firmly)\n\t\t\tSomeone's real life -- an TV, all day\n\t\t\tlong - live... And, you know what?\n\t\t\tI'm doing it.\n\n\tPause. The others know the argument is over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGREG\n\t\t\tIn that case, we love it.\n\n\tEND CREDITS\n\n\n  3\tEXT. POOL HALL - DAY\n\tA BUS passes. On the bus is an ad. It says, \"Would you\n\tlike to star in your own TV show? Call Real TV (and a\n\tphone number) Coming (and a date).\"\n\n\n  4\tINT. POOL HALL - NIGHT - PARAMUS NEW JERSEY\n\tThis is a nice upscale pool hall. A party is in progress in a\n\tspecial private area -- a room upstairs let's say -- a loft.\n\tThirty or forty PEOPLE in their twenties and thirties are\n\tinformally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends.\n\n\tIt's NOISY, it's fun, it's informal. It's not a high-end group.\n\tBy that we mean, not, for the most part young lawyers or\n\tstockbrokers. They're mostly blue-collar. Community college\n\tgraduates.\n\n\tWE OPEN ON ED PEKURNY. He's an attractive man, about thirty.\n\tThere's still something a little juvenile about him -- not\n\tstupid, just boyish.\n\n\tSOMEONE is VIDEOTAPING HIM for one of those congratulation\n\tmontage things that are done at parties these days. Ed is good\n\tat this. He's not professional but he's a loosey-goosey guy\n\twho's kind of good on camera.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\tI want to congratulate\n\t\t\tKevin and Tracy on their engagement.\n\t\t\tI knew you guys were meant for each\n\t\t\tother from the moment Tracy told us\n\t\t\tshe was pregnant.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRACY\n\t\t\tYou asshole!\n\n\tEveryone else is cracking up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\t\t(innocently)\n\t\t\tWhat?

John's had a couple of drinks. He's a little\n\tmelancholy.\n\n\tHe is looking across the room, thoughtfully.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\t\tLook at this -- people are\n\t\t\tgetting married, they're\n\t\t\tgetting married...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\tYou said that.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\t\tWe're falling behind.\n\n\tEd waves dismissively.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJOHN (CONT'D)\n\t\t\tYou know who we are?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\tTell me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\t\tWe're the guys who clean up after\n\t\t\tthe parade.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\tI'm gonna stick this right in your\n\t\t\teye.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\t\tI was at this comedy club last week\n\t\t\tand this comedian says \"If you're over\n\t\t\tthirty and your job requires you to\n\t\t\twear a name tag, you screwed up your\n\t\t\tlife.\" And I'm laughing and then I\n\t\t\trealize I wear a nametag.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\tSo do I. So what? I'm doing all right.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\t\tYour brother's here.\n\n\tANGLE ON THE DOOR\n\n\tEd's brother RAY and Ray's girlfriend SHARI arrive at the party.\n\tShari is pretty in an unglamorous kind of way. They both wave and\n\tthen Shari goes off to talk to some of the LADIES and Ray joins Ed\n\tand John.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n\t\t\tWhat's up?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\tWhere were you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n\t\t\t\t(reluctantly)\n\t\t\tI was... having dinner with Shari\n\t\t\tand her parents.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJOHN/ED\n\t\t\t\t(taunting)\n\t\t\tOooh!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n\t\t\tI'm telling you, it's\n\t\t\tclosing in on me.

You've been going with\n\t\t\ther six months.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n\t\t\tI know. I mean I'm sitting there\n\t\t\tand her father's asking me about\n\t\t\tmy \"career prospects\" and I'm\n\t\t\tplaying \"Risk,\" with her kid\n\t\t\tbrother, Leon and at dinner the\n\t\t\tdog's sniffing at my balls -- at\n\t\t\tleast I hope it was the dog.\n\t\t\t'Cause her mother disappeared for\n\t\t\ta while.\n\n\tThey LAUGH.\n\n\n  6\tINT. PARTY - LATER\n\tIt's getting wild. Some of the girls are dancing raucously.\n\n\tANGLE ON A TABLE (NOT A POOL TABLE, AN EATING-TABLE)\n\n\tEd, Ray, John, Shari and maybe another WOMAN.\n\n\tRay is holding a big tray of SHRIMP BALLS. During the\n\tconversation, Ray throws them in the air and catches them in\n\this mouth like popcorn. Once, he even bounces one off the\n\twall into his mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\tYou know, those are for everybody.\n\n\tRay waves dismissively, then gets an idea.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n\t\t\tOh!\n\t\t\t\t(to Shari)\n\t\t\tShow them that thing you can do.\n\t\t\t\t(to the others)\n\t\t\tThis is great.

Slightly, amused she\n\ttakes her FIST and fits it completely INTO her MOUTH.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tED\n\t\t\tWhoa!! Oh!\n\n\tRay is cracking up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n\t\t\tIs that unbelievable?\n\n\tShe removes her hand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHARI\n\t\t\tAnd that concludes today's show.\n\t\t\t\t(to Ray)\n\t\t\tThis is where you go around and\n\t\t\tcollect the money.\n\n\tEd LAUGHS.

Instinctively, he begins SCRATCHING his\n\tballs. As he does, it hits him that this is not a normal \n\tmorning. He looks up and sees two steady-cam guys at the foot of his\n\tbed, aiming their cameras at him. Ed, then, looks at his hand on his\n\tballs. Gently, he moves his hand away.\n\n\n  22    INT.

Ed also is confronted by\n\tGUYS grabbing their crotches mockingly, calling out things\n\tlike \"Hey, Ed, holding your own?\" or \"Hey, Ed, howls the grand\n\tballroom.\" Ed is slightly chagrined by all this, but handles\n\tit with good grace.
