THE BAR - DAY\n\nSanta Claus (DOYLE) starts to ring his big Christmas bell,\nabove the singing.  The bell is a signal to DETECTIVE SECOND\nGRADE BUDDY RUSSO.  At this moment RUSSO is in the clothes\nof a hot dog vendor and is in fact working behind a hot dog\nwagon.  At the ringing of DOYLE's bell he takes off his\napron, leaves the wagon, and runs toward the bar.\n\n                         DOYLE\n                   (as RUSSO passes him)\n            The guy in the brown coat.\n\nINT.

BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY\n\nClose shot of BLACK PUSHER tripping on the tangle of trash\ngoing up against the wall in his stumble, face toward the\ncamera, and the figures of RUSSO and DOYLE leaping upon him\nfrom off-camera.  There is a blur or fast struggle as DOYLE\nand RUSSO try to get his arms and put him against the wall.\nBLACK PUSHER writhes loose and we close in on a knife in his\nhand, plunging rapidly into RUSSO'S left forearm.\n\n                         RUSSO\n            Son of a bitch!\n\nThe words are both warning and a grunt of pain.

BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY\n\nClose shot of DOYLE and the BLACK PUSHER, DOYLE pistol-\nwhipping him into submission with three lightening chops of\nthe gun to the PUSHER'S head.

BLACK PUSHER is sitting on his\nhands, wrists manacled behind him, his head down and dripping\nblood onto the jacket and the canary-yellow turtleneck.

Know\n            what that means?  All winter I\n            gotta listen to him gripe about his\n            bowling scores.  Now I'm gonna bust\n            your ass for those three bags -\n            then I'm gonna nail you for pickin'\n            your feet in Poughkeepsie.\n\nEXT. HEADQUARTERS NARCOTICS BUREAU OF THE NYPD 12 OLD SLIP\nAND SOUTH STREETS - NIGHT\n\nDOYLE and RUSSO standing side by side on the front steps of\nthe old First Precinct on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.\nRUSSO has his overcoat over his shoulders as a cape.  The\nsleeve of his left arm is rolled up over a blood-stained\nbandage on the left forearm.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb\n            guinea.\n\n                         RUSSO\n            How'd I know he had a knife.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Never trust a nigger.\n\n                         RUSSO\n            He coulda been white.\n\n                                                            6.\n\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?\n\n                         RUSSO\n            Not a chance.\n\nRUSSO nods in acceptance of the remark.  The easy, synical\nrapport between them is obvious: they are partners in a\nbusiness where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is\npart of the inventory.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Let's popeye around the Chez for a\n            half hour, catch the end of the\n            show and a couple drinks.\n\n                         RUSSO\n            Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.\n\nDOYLE reaches into the right side pocket of BUDDY's suitcoat\nfor a cigarette and matches.  He lights up two in the pause,\nsticks one in RUSSO's mouth.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you\n            say?\n\n                         RUSSO\n            Drink this.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Whip it out.\n\nINT. THE CLUB - NIGHT\n\nTHE TITLES COMMENCE\n\n                    THE FRENCH CONNECTION\n\nTitles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits\nand ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music.  We\nzoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to\noccupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes\nimmediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives\ntheir order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks\nRUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says \"Cinzano.\" DOYLE\nturns and says \"Two of these.\" DOYLE slips into the chair\nopposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is\nconcentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and\nthe people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort\nof man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him,\nwhy they are there.\n\n                                                            7.\n\n\nINT. THE CLUB - NIGHT\n\nA long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quick\ncertain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems\ntoo raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS and\nCAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.  DOYLE's\nattention is apprehended by the noise and activity that\nemanate from the same large table.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            I make at least two junk connections\n            at that table in the corner.  The\n            guy is the stripe combo, I know him\n            too.\n\n                         RUSSO\n            Hey, I thought we come for a drink.\n\nINT. THE CLUB - NIGHT\n\nA long view of the table with DOYLE and RUSSO very close\nforeground, left and right.  DOYLE is leaning on an elbow.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Who is that guy?\n\n                         RUSSO\n            Policy man in Queens.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            What about the last of the big-time\n            spenders.  You make him?\n\nRUSSO's eyes come off the show.  It is a direct line from\nDOYLE's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of SAL\nBOCA, the apparent host of the table of EIGHT MEN AND WOMEN,\nthe Men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars\nof blue or white lace-trimmed shirts, the Women in a mixture\nof pant suits and Catskills cocktail party dresses, their\nhair coiffed towers.\n\n                         RUSSO\n            No, you?\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He\n            spreads it like the Russians are in\n            Jersey.\n\n                         RUSSO\n            He probably sells insurance.  Owns\n            a chicken farm in Hackensack.\n\n                                                            8.\n\n\nZoom in slowly on SAL as he deals tips and orders.  Through\nDOYLE's eyes, we go from Guest to Guest at SAL's table,\ntaking apart their manners and styles as they talk and\nlaugh, lost in the show chatter.\n\nINT. THE CLUB - NIGHT\n\nDOYLE finishing his drink, still looking at the table.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Dig who's just come over.  The\n            creep on the end.\n\nINT.

He\n            don't look the same without a\n            number across his chest.\n\nINT.

DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT\n\nThe view from the back seat of DOYLE's car.  DOYLE is at the\nwheel, RUSSO packed uncomfortably into the corner at DOYLE's\nright.  Seventy-five yards away on the other side of the\nstreet the canopied entrance of the Club.  A Continental is\nparked in front of the club.  The DRIVER leaning on a fender\ntalking with the DOORMAN.  DOYLE frisks his own pockets for\na cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips,\ncrumpled notes, toothpicks and matches.\n\n                                                            9.\n\n\nOne of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going\nthrough the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing\nthe name of a girl.  His attention is really on the entrance\nof the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette\nbusiness are detached and incidental to the art of waiting\nthrough the stakeout.  He stuffs the cards back into his\npocket.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Monica?  Who's Monica?\n\n                         RUSSO\n                   (handing him a cigarette)\n            A and A, that's all you're\n            interested in -- Arrests and Ass.\n\nAs soon as DOYLE has finished lighting the cigarette SAL and\nhis PARTY come bubbling out of the Club noisily, a little\ndrunkenly.  SAL waves to the attentive DOORMAN.\n\nDOYLE close, leaning forward over the wheel to put his hand\non the ignition key.  He does not turn it.  He is waiting\nfor the cover of noise from the starting of SAL's car.\nRUSSO is turning the opposite corner of the car into a bend,\nhis head back, arms across his chest.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Cloudy, I'll lay odds he takes us\n            to Little Italy.\n\nDOYLE reaches under his seat for the straw surveillance\nhat - throws it up to read ledge of car.\n\n                         RUSSO\n            I'm telling you, Popeye, he owns a\n            bagel mine in the Bronx.\n\nA long view of the Club entrance.  SAL and ANGIE, a well-\nbuilt \"classy\" blonde with good legs, get into their black\nMercury sedan.  The Mercury takes off towards First Avenue.\nWe hear DOYLE's car start and we move off after them on the\nlast blink of tail-lights at the corner.\n\nEXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT\n\nCabs, Daily News and Times delivery trucks, bakery vans and\na few cruising cabs, one or two passenger cars and a coasting\ngreen and black police cruiser -- this is the 4:30 a.m.\ntraffic through which DOYLE moves.\n\nA rear-window view of SAL and ANGIE BOCA, in animated\nconversation.  His head is turned toward her, his hand\nraised in a gesture.  ANGIE is sitting in a corner with her\nback to the door, in profile to the back window.\n\n                                                           10.\n\n\nHer blonde head bobbles with laughter over some remark SAL\nhas made.\n\nA long overhead view of the two cars wheeling in and out of\nthe sparse traffic.\n\nClose shot of the license plate on BOCA's car.\n\nClose shot DOYLE staring at license plate, memorizing it.\n\nEXT.

MULBERRY STREET - DAY\n\nSide close view of SAL turning south into Mott Street\npanning to pick up the Italian names on the candy stores,\nfuneral parlors, bars, grocery stores, social clubs.\n\nA long view of SAL's car from the DOYLE-RUSSO auto, over the\nshoulders of the two cops.  DOYLE is leaning on the wheel of\nhis car.  He's against the curb about 100 yards behind SAL.\n\nMedium close view of SAL in the middle of Mott Street,\nwalking quickly toward the opposite side of the street,\nhands in the pocket of his white raincoat.  He glances over\nhis shoulder in the direction of DOYLE's car.\n\nClose of RUSSO who has come awake.  The smart-ass demeanor\nhas dropped away.  DOYLE turns to him and smiles.  This\ndistrict is the heart of every illegal activity in New York.\n\nClose rear view of DOYLE and RUSSO ducking down to the level\nof the dashboard, a reflex action.

A scattering of\ntenement URCHINS give the street some sound and life.  There\nare a couple of dark shops on the street and a bar, all\nappearing to be closed.  We look down the street and pick up\nDOYLE and RUSSO coming down it, walking very quickly.  They\nare heading toward the bar.  A young man is coming out -\nthey grab him and throw him back.\n\nINT. BAR ROOM - DAY\n\nThe Young Man is thrown in, followed by DOYLE and RUSSO.\nThere are about 20 or 30 PUETRO RICAN and BLACK MEN in the\njoint, a couple of BLACK WOMEN.  They are in all manner of\ndress.  Half of them are wearing shades.  The bar is noisy\nwith conversation, laughter and music.\n\n                                                           23.\n\n\nDOYLE and RUSSO standing in the doorway, DOYLE slightly to\nthe left, RUSSO a little behind him.  DOYLE's arms are at\nhis sides.  RUSSO's right hand is crossed over his belt,\nunder his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting\nto back his partner's play or respond to any move within the\nbar.\n\nDOYLE moving into the bar alone.  He pulls the plug out of\nthe Juke Box, plunging the room to silence.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Hands on your heads.  Popeye's here!\n\nTwenty men raise hands to their heads as one.  The raggle-\ntaggle swarm plays a kind of human chicken, refusing to move\nuntil the last moment then stepping out of his way.  One of\nthe customers doesn't.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            What's my name?\n\n                         1ST MAN\n            Doyle.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            What?\n\n                         1ST MAN\n            Mr. Doyle.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?\n\n                         1ST MAN\n            What?\n\nDOYLE raises his left arm and pushes the MAN aside.  The\nMAN's eyes go to RUSSO, off-camera at the door, and back to\nDOYLE.  He doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of\nthem, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar,\nrunning the length of it.\n\nClose of DOYLE at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming\nthe metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the\nmagnetized key boxes into the ashcan.  He isn't even looking\nat them.  His eyes are across the bar, staring down the\ncustomers.\n\nClose shot of the ashcan and the little metal boxes clinking\ninto it.\n\nClose shot of DOYLE, the ashcan now on the bar, opening one\nof the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on\nthe bar.\n\n                                                           24.\n\n\nThen, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of\nheroin.  Then another, containing a glassine deck.  He\nempties the glassine envelopes on the bar into a cocktail\nmixer which he proceeds to shake.  The shaker is half-filled\nwith tomato juice.\n\nDOYLE leaning over the bar toward the glaring crowd, pours\nthe mixture into the ashcan.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Milk shake anyone?\n\nHe wiggles his finger.  It is a command for THREE MEN to\nstep forward.  The MEN do not move at first.\n\n                         DOYLE\n            Move ass when I tell you.\n\nThey move, shuffling, hesitatingly.
