As the transaction seems to be completed, cut to\n\n<b>EXT. THE BAR - DAY\n</b>\nSanta Claus (DOYLE) starts to ring his big Christmas bell,\nabove the singing.  The bell is a signal to DETECTIVE SECOND\nGRADE BUDDY RUSSO.  At this moment RUSSO is in the clothes\nof a hot dog vendor and is in fact working behind a hot dog\nwagon.  At the ringing of DOYLE's bell he takes off his\napron, leaves the wagon, and runs toward the bar.\n\n<b>                         DOYLE\n</b>                   (as RUSSO passes him)\n            The guy in the brown coat.\n\n<b>INT.

BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY\n</b>\nTHREE FIGURES running down a New York tenement alley, the\nfirst in flight, the others in pursuit.  We pick up the\nincredible clutter of such an alley, mounts of rusting beer\ncans, paper bags of garbage bulging and ripping open, old\nbed springs, burned out mattresses, etc.\n\n<b>EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY\n</b>\nClose shot of BLACK PUSHER tripping on the tangle of trash\ngoing up against the wall in his stumble, face toward the\ncamera, and the figures of RUSSO and DOYLE leaping upon him\nfrom off-camera.  There is a blur or fast struggle as DOYLE\nand RUSSO try to get his arms and put him against the wall.\nBLACK PUSHER writhes loose and we close in on a knife in his\nhand, plunging rapidly into RUSSO'S left forearm.\n\n<b>                         RUSSO\n</b>            Son of a bitch!\n\nThe words are both warning and a grunt of pain.

The easy, synical\nrapport between them is obvious: they are partners in a\nbusiness where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is\npart of the inventory.\n\n<b>                         DOYLE\n</b>            Let's popeye around the Chez for a\n            half hour, catch the end of the\n            show and a couple drinks.\n\n<b>                         RUSSO\n</b>            Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.\n\nDOYLE reaches into the right side pocket of BUDDY's suitcoat\nfor a cigarette and matches.

We\nzoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to\noccupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes\nimmediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives\ntheir order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks\nRUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says \"Cinzano.\" DOYLE\nturns and says \"Two of these.\" DOYLE slips into the chair\nopposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is\nconcentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and\nthe people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort\nof man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him,\nwhy they are there.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                            7.\n</b>\n\n<b>INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT\n</b>\nA long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quick\ncertain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems\ntoo raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS and\nCAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.  DOYLE's\nattention is apprehended by the noise and activity that\nemanate from the same large table.\n\n<b>                         DOYLE\n</b>            I make at least two junk connections\n            at that table in the corner.

You make him?\n\nRUSSO's eyes come off the show.  It is a direct line from\nDOYLE's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of SAL\nBOCA, the apparent host of the table of EIGHT MEN AND WOMEN,\nthe Men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars\nof blue or white lace-trimmed shirts, the Women in a mixture\nof pant suits and Catskills cocktail party dresses, their\nhair coiffed towers.\n\n<b>                         RUSSO\n</b>            No, you?\n\n<b>                         DOYLE\n</b>            Hunh-uh.

His attention is really on the entrance\nof the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette\nbusiness are detached and incidental to the art of waiting\nthrough the stakeout.  He stuffs the cards back into his\npocket.\n\n<b>                         DOYLE\n</b>            Monica?

SAL waves to the attentive DOORMAN.\n\nDOYLE close, leaning forward over the wheel to put his hand\non the ignition key.  He does not turn it.

The\nMAN's eyes go to RUSSO, off-camera at the door, and back to\nDOYLE.  He doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of\nthem, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar,\nrunning the length of it.\n\nClose of DOYLE at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming\nthe metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the\nmagnetized key boxes into the ashcan.  He isn't even looking\nat them.  His eyes are across the bar, staring down the\ncustomers.\n\nClose shot of the ashcan and the little metal boxes clinking\ninto it.\n\nClose shot of DOYLE, the ashcan now on the bar, opening one\nof the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on\nthe bar.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                           24.\n</b>\n\nThen, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of\nheroin.
