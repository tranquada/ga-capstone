WOODED HILLSIDE. DAY.\n\nWe see the drawn face of a young woman. Camera tracks with\nher as she runs through the thick woods. She is exerting\nherself heavily as she moves up a steep hillside. She looks\nbehind her quickly, and continues.\n\nANGLE, we see a young man, and then another, running through\nthe woods, out of breath. They are dressed in filthy BDU's,\nand show several days growth of beard. The leader stops for\na moment, and looks around. The two men separate.\n\nANGLE, the  young woman, who has come to a small ledge, over\na ravine.  She stops, panting, and bends over, to attempt to\ncatch her  breath. She looks around, and looks back, her back\nto a steep  wall, a steep drop before her.\n\nANGLE, the first young man, having come up to the spot\nvacated by the young woman. In the BG we see his colleague.\nHe looks down, and sees movement in the brush below him, in\nthe ravine. He starts to descend, and then looks up.\n\nANGLE, the young woman, pulling herself up the steep\nrockface. The young man regains the ledge and looks up.\nCamera takes him around a bend in the ledge.\n\nStanding here we discover ROBERT SCOTT. He is somewhat older\nthan the two men, he is very fit, also dressed in filthy\nBDU's. He is making a note in a small notebook, which he\ncloses. Now, the two men look across the ravine at the young\nwoman, seen disappearing over a ridge.\n\n                       SCOTT\n                  (quietly)\n             ...you better catch her...\n\nThe man looks around, and begins climbing up the rockface\nbehind him, pulling himself up, hand over hand by the roots\nof trees. Several feet up, he falls on his back. He tries to\nwork himself to his knees and winces in pain. He looks to\nScott for help.\n\n                       SCOTT\n             ...your Dad's napping on the\n             sofa, your Mom's watching Let's\n             Make A Deal, and God is Dead.\n             What do you expect me to do...?\n\n                       YOUNG MAN\n                  (very weakly)\n             ...I'm tired, Sir...Sir, there's\n             no way...\n\n                                                              2.\n\n\n                      SCOTT\n            There's always a way...Don't You\n            tell me there's no way...\n\nA pause, as the man tries again to get to his feet. Scott\nlooks up at the young woman on top of the ridge and gives\nher a \"hold\" gesture. She stops, at his command. Scott nods,\nas if to himself, and then kicks the young man in the ribs.\nThe man starts, his eyes grow, and he gets to his feet.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            How 'bout that? That's called\n            'Adrenaline'. You said you Wanted\n            In.\n\nHe moves into the now-standing young man, and hits him, not\nheavily, but convincingly, several times.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            This is where you get in. The\n            mugger don't care. The shooter\n            don't care...get up...Or I will\n            beat you to death on this fucken\n            hill...Now: you better Catch her...\n\nHe motions with his head. In the BG we see the young woman\nnod, and begin running again. We see her, for a moment,\nbreast a hill, and disappear again...\n\nANGLE, on the young man, as he looks at Scott, empty, now,\nof self-pity, as if he just realized something.\n\n                      SCOTT\n                 (responding to his look.\n                 As if to say \"That's right.\")\n            There's nothing but the mission...\n\nThe young man begins to climb the rockface.\n\nHOLD on Scott for a moment.\n\nINT. TRAINING FACILITY. DAY.\n\nA large, hand-painted sign hangs on the cinderblock wall of\nthe rough building. It reads:\n\n                    These are the precincts of pain.\n                    A goddess lives here.\n                    Her name is Victory.\n\nIn front of the sign walks the young woman we saw earlier.\nShe is exhausted, she has a towel wrapped around her neck.\nCamera takes her to Scott, who is holding a cup of coffee,\nand making notes in the small notebook we saw earlier.\n\n                                                             3.\n\n\nShe stands, waiting, as she finishes his note.\n\n                         SCOTT\n            Well done.\n\n                      YOUNG WOMAN (JACKIE BLACK)\n            A signal honor to work with you,\n            sir.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            Thank you, Sergeant.\n\nHe starts away from her, and she raises her hand slightly,\nto indicate she has something more to say. He turns back to her.\n\n                      JACKIE BLACK\n            Sir: Day or Night. Black or White.\n            You reach out for me. \"Black,\n            Jaqueline A. US 24191489.\"\n\n                      SCOTT\n            I'll remember, Sergeant.\n\nShe nods, and walks off. Scott walks toward a mess tent. He\nis joined by George Blane, a very military-looking figure of\nan older man. He wears an informal fatigue outfit, mismatched\njacket and trousers, without insignia. Scott is greeted by\nhim, as they walk toward the mess tent. Scott shows the\nnotebook to Blane, and Blane refers from the notebook to\nwhat we see are a group of eighty young men, in the mess\ntent, two of them the men we saw on the hill. Blane takes\nthe notebook and walks off, as Scott enters the mess tent.\n\nANGLE HIS POV, Scott enters the tent. Several of the young\nmen react to him. He nods to them. Among them, we see the\nyoung man Scott berated on the hill, who rises and comes\nover to Scott.\n\nANGLE, on Scott, who sits, as a uniformed man brings him a\ntinfoil tray with some food on it. Scott takes out a\nstiletto from his pocket, presses a button and the blade\nemerges. He begins to use it to cut up his meat. The young\nman from the hill, Anton, stands sheepishly near Scott, till\nScott turns, acknowledging him.\n\nAnton takes a card out of his pocket, the size of a credit\ncard, old, creased cardboard: It reads, \"Rogers Rangers,\nRules for Engagement. 1782\". There is a line drawing of a\nman with a musket, and we read, on the card, beneath it,\nboldtype rules for fighting guerilla style. Written on the\ncard, in old faded ink, \"SGT. Anton, M. US. 3149584, United\nStates Special Forces.\" The young man (Anton) shows the card\nto Scott.\n\n                                                           4.\n\n\n                      SCOTT\n                 (of the card)\n            What's this then?\n\n                      ANTON\n            It was my father's, sir.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            He carry it Over There?\n\nAs they speak, we see, in an insert, the printed rules -\n\"Dated 1759\". \"Rule 4: Tell the truth about what you see and\nwhat you do - there is an army depending on us for correct\ninformation. You can lie all you please when you tell other\nfolks about the Rangers, but don't never lie to a Ranger or\nan Officer\".\n\n                        ANTON\n            Yes, sir.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            He come back?\n\n                      ANTON\n            Yes, sir. He did.\n\n                      SCOTT\n                 (nods. Pause)\n            Well, so.\n\nScott pauses again. As he looks at the young man, who is\nobviously unable to express his gratitude, and sense of\noccasion.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            You carry that card, son. It\n            might save your life.\n                 (Anton nods)\n            ...You could use it to light a\n            fire, or something...\n\nBlane's Aide calls the men to order.\n\n                      BLANE'S AIDE\n            The Candidate Cadre will fall in\n            on the White Line...\n\nThe men start to come to their feet, and leave the mess tent.\n\n                      ANTON\n            I just wanted to say, sir...That,\n            to meet you...\n\n                                                              5.\n\n\n                      SCOTT\n                 (rising, as he gives\n                 the Ranger card back\n                 to Anton)\n            You never met me. You've been up\n            for a week. You're seeing Snakes...\n\nThe exhausted men come to their feet, and into a line. They\nare happy, and joking with one another. In the BG we see\nthose who failed the course, sitting apart, file onto a bus\nwhich has just pulled up.\n\nANGLE on a young man, who looks out of the window.\n\nANGLE HIS POV. Twenty or so similarly exhausted men, with\ndufflebags, are being shuffled onto the bus.\n\nANGLE, on the young man, Anton, as he exits the tent, who\nstands next to Scott, outside the tent. Scott stands next to\nan old, but pristine Mustang Cobra. He withdraws a small\ndufflebag from the front seat, and looks up to see Anton\nstanding next to him.\n\n                       ANTON\n                 (looking after the\n                 departing, failed men)\n            ...I can't imagine how they live\n            with it...\n\nANGLE on Scott. As he thinks a very brief moment, as if\nreluctant to become philosophical, and then turns back to Anton.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            Make sure you can't imagine it,\n            cause, if you can, it's just one\n            step to doing it.\n\nAnton shakes his head, sadly, at the spectacle of the failed\nmen.\n\n                      SCOTT\n                 (pause)\n            ...they'll be back where they\n            came from by Morning, and all\n            this is just a Bad Dream.\n\n                      ANTON\n            My name is...\n\n                                                             6.\n\n\n                      SCOTT\n            Do I need to know?\n                 (pause)\n            If I want Camaraderie, I'll join\n            the Masons.\n                 (pause. Then, summing\n                 it all up:)\n            There's just the mission.\n\nBeat. Anton steps away.\n\n                      BLANE'S AIDE\n                 (as he glances down at\n                 his clipboard)\n            Congratulations on completion of\n            this evolution. I know you would\n            probably like some sleep, but I\n            do not think you'd mind sparing\n            ten minutes for Induction.\n\nThe camera pans over the smiling faces of the eight very\nproud young men.\n\nANGLE on Blane and Scott, off to the side.\n\nBeyond them, we see the bus holding the failed candidates,\nfilling up.\n\n                      BLANE\n            Thank you, Bobby.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            Not at all, Sir...\n\n                      BLANE\n            ...You going home?\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...weather permitting, Sir...\n\n                      BLANE'S AIDE\n                 (in the distance.

We see various housefronts,\nand storefronts, and targets. A long table along one wall\nholds a coffee urn. Blane draws two cups of coffee.\n\nThrough the open door we see Anton and Grossler, smiling,\nentering the building. Anton comes into the room, and smiles\nat Scott.\n\nWe see Scott look away, sadly. He shares a look with Blane,\ndrains his coffee cup, crumples it, throws it away. Blane\ngestures to Scott, meaning, \"Shall we begin?\" Scott\nhesitates for a moment, and then nods.\n\nFOCUS.\n\nANGLE, on Scott, in the BG, as Blane steps forward to\naddress the two candidates.\n\n                        BLANE\n                  (over his shoulder, to\n                  an Aide)\n             ...would you bolt the door,\n             please...?\n\nScott gestures to the Aide, \"One Moment\".\n\n                        BLANE\n                  (to the candidates)\n             ...are you tired, Gentlemen?\n                  (the two young men smile)\n             This is the completion of the\n             evolution:\n                  (beat)\n             Only one of you may join the\n             unit. The first man through that\n             door will be inducted.\n\nHe gestures at a far door in the room.\n\nANGLE, on Scott, as he looks at the candidates, as they get\nthe picture.\n\nBeat.\n\n                       SCOTT\n                  (to himself, quietly)\n             ...yeah...you wanted to know the\n             'secret knowledge'...\n\nCU Scott  as he looks, interrogating the   two men, weighing\nthem, as  they look at each other. Beat.   Grossler starts to\nadvance  on Anton, in a fighting crouch.   Scott gestures to\nthe Aide  that that was what he wanted to   see.\n\n                                                              8.\n\n\nThe Aide lets Scott out of the back door.\n\nEXT. CINDERBLOCK BUILDING. DAY.\n\nScott, showered, in civilian clothes, a lumberjacket and\njeans, comes out of the building, carrying a small, yellow\nduffle-bag. He opens the trunk.\n\nHe takes the yellow bag, and puts it into the trunk which we\nnow see contains woodworking tools - old levels and planes\nand saws. He closes the trunk. We see the young woman from\nthe first sequence, now in civilian clothes, conferring with\na colleague. She nods at him, and he responds. As he starts\nto get into the car. A squad of exhausted men is marching\npast. As they come to a halt one of the men turns in the\ndirection of Scott.\n\n                      DRILL INSTRUCTOR\n                 (to that man)\n            What the hell are you looking at?\n            There ain't nobody there...\n\nEXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. DUSK.\n\nA young worker in a hardhat, by a large gravel pit, at which\nwe find several earthmovers, idle. He is standing by a high\nchainlink fence topped with barbed wire.\n\nANGLE HIS POV. Some half-mile away, the Mustang, heading in\nhis direction on a rough road. The young worker opens the\nlock on the chainlink fence and swings it open.\n\nWe see a sign \"McGarrity Construction Company\" on the gate.\n\nThe young man walks back toward a construction trailer. We\nsee a red light blinking on a telephone on top of a littered\ndesk. The young worker enters the trailer hurriedly, and\nopens a cabinet which we see contains several assault rifles,\nand grenades. Another phone, its red light blinking, is\nfound in the cabinet. The young worker picks up this phone\nquickly.\n\n                      YOUNG WORKER\n                 (into phone)\n            ...Frontgate...\n\nWe see his face grow serious, as he begins to write on a pad.\n\nINT. MUSTANG. DAY.\n\nScott, driving, comes around a bend.\n\n                                                              9.\n\n\nANGLE HIS POV. The construction trailer up ahead. We see the\nyoung worker come out of the trailer, and stand in the road\ngiving a \"Stop\" signal to the car.\n\nANGLE EXT. THE CAR. We see Scott bring the Mustang to a stop,\nand get, inquisitively, out of the car. We see the young\nworker run up to him and hand him a sheet of paper. Scott\ntakes the paper and begins to read.\n\nHe looks up, to ask a question of the young worker. We see\nthe worker begin to respond, his body language saying\n\"That's all I know.\" As he starts to speak his words are\ndrowned out by the sound of a helicopter. Scott looks up.\n\nANGLE HIS POV. A helicopter, flying low.\n\nANGLE INT. THE HELICOPTER. A man in civilian clothes points\nout Scott, on the ground, to the Pilot. Through the canopy\nwe see Scott and the construction canopy down below. The\nhelicopter goes into a tight turn.\n\nANGLE Scott. Above him, the helicopter goes into its turn,\nand begins to descend in a field some fifty yards away.\n\nANGLE, the sheet of paper Scott holds. Is reads: \"All hands.\"\nOver the throbbing of the helicopter, we see Scott giving\ndirections about the car, to the young worker. Camera takes\nScott to the trunk, which he opens, and from which he\nretrieves his gym bag. He hands the keys to the young worker,\nand takes off, running, to the helicopter.\n\nANGLE, on Scott, as he is pulled up aboard, and the\nhelicopter takes off.\n\nANGLE, over the worker, watching the helicopter disappear.\n\nINT. HELICOPTER. NIGHT.\n\nScott, asleep. As the helicopter banks low over the Charles\nRiver and Harvard College. A Crewman shakes him awake.\n\nANGLE, EXT: the helicopter descends into the field of a\nfootball stadium. A black suburban is waiting.\n\nEXT. BOATHOUSE. CHARLES RIVER. NIGHT.\n\nSeen through the windshield of a car.\n\nANGLE, a black, government Suburban pulls outside the\nboathouse. We see scaffolding being erected outside the main\nentrance.\n\n                                                            10.\n\n\nScott and several types in suits get out of the Suburban,\nand proceed toward the door, over which is hung a large,\npaint-spattered drape. A sign on a stanchion reads\n\"Temporarily Closed For Repairs\".\n\nANGLE, INT. THE BOATHOUSE. The group pushes through the\ndrape, beyond which we see several men in suits, holding\nassault rifles.\n\nAn older government type, MILLER, followed by an AIDE, walks\nup to meet the group, the Aide motions to the armed guards\nthat Scott is to be admitted, that he is \"okay\". Miller\ngestures to Scott that it will just be a moment. The Aide\nhands Scott a sheaf of papers, and leads him through the\nboathouse.

All the occupants of the room are engaged on\nsome task, save Anton, who sits alone on a bench. Scott\nlooks at Anton, who glances at Scott, trying to keep the\nappeal out of his glance, \"Please take me\".\n\n                      SCOTT\n                 (to Anton)\n            We're scraping the bottom of the\n            barrel here, aren't we?\n\n                                                             29.\n\n\n                        ANTON\n            Yes. Sir.\n\nScott looks at Anton and shakes his head. He is summoned to\nthe front of the room by a young woman, who is putting cash\ninto an envelope. Scott comes over to her, and we see her\nfilling out a slip of paper. She hands him the cash in the\nenvelope, and the slip of paper.\n\n                      YOUNG WOMAN\n            I need you to sign it.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            You sign it.\n                 (He scans the room\n                 again, shrugs, and\n                 motions to Anton)\n            Come on, Wallflower...\n                 (Anton rises and walks\n                 over to him)\n\n\nScott turns to Anton.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            Now: your mouth shut. Your eyes\n            open, and form on me...Here's\n            where we're going...\n\nThere is the sound of a gunshot. Scott and Anton\ninstinctively take cover against the side of the building,\ndrawing their sidearms.\n\nHOLD TIGHT on Scott. As he looks through the half-open door.\n\nWe see several of the Swat men, taking up positions, one of\nthem kicks open a door, and his partner enters. Pause. We\nhear the partner call \"clear\".\n\nANGLE, on Scott, as he re-enters the building, and proceeds,\npistol out, toward the room.\n\nANGLE HIS POV. On the floor, we see the dead Secret Service\nAgent, a pistol in his hand.\n\nWe see Miller turn to his team. An Agent kneels to the\nfallen Secret Service Agent, and prods a small hideout\npistol from his hand. Scott turns to leave, and sees Anton\nstanding next to him.\n\n                                                            30.\n\n\n                      SCOTT\n            Don't look at him.

Well, apparently, he felt\n            bad about it...\n\nEXT. REGENCY CLUB. NIGHT.\n\nA garish neon sign, beneath which we see a couple exiting,\ngetting into their limo. Scott, in his sportcoat, walks up\nto the large and threatening bouncer at the velvet rope to\nthe club. We see the bouncer bar his way, and gesture to his\nwatch, meaning \"closing up\".\n\nANGLE INS. Two one-hundred dollar bills are passed to the\nbouncer.\n\nANGLE, Anton, in a cab across the street, looking on.\n\nANGLE INT. THE REGENCY CLUB. Several well-dressed couples\nare leaving. A group of raucous, drunk businessmen types\npush past them. Scott walks up to the bar. The Bartender is\nbeginning to ring out the cash register. In the BG we see a\nmanager eye Scott, and continue to direct the closing\noperations.\n\n                                                          31.\n\n\n                      BARTENDER\n            Closing up...\n                 (he points to his watch)\n            Can't sell you booze after 3 AM.\n\n                      SCOTT\n                 (laying money on the bar)\n            No, no. I just came buy to pay\n            you that money I owe you.\n\nHe gestures to the bills on the bar.

The Bartender comes over and glances at it.\n\nANGLE XCU on Scott as he looks incisively at the Bartender,\nwho displays no flicker of recognition.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...girl like that been in\n            tonight...?\n\n                      BARTENDER\n            ...pretty girl...\n\n                      SCOTT\n            None prettier.\n\nANGLE on Scott, who looks around the club. We see him eyeing\nthe lovely young scantily clad waitresses, who return his\nlooks with disdain. The Bartender, observing him, comes back\nto him.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            Yeah...I'm looking for a girl\n            like that...\n\n                      BARTENDER\n            ...You're sure it was your\n            daughter...?

What would they\n            want to do with me...?\n\nThe Bartender leans close and hesitates. Scott takes out\nseveral more bills and passes them to the Bartender.\n\n                                                               33.\n\n\nHe hesitates a second, as if to say   \"You wouldn't fuck me,\nwould you...?\" The Bartender signs,   \"I am your man\", the\nBartender takes the bills and leans   close and whispers to\nScott, indicating someone over in a   dark corner.\n\nIn this corner, as the lights are flicked up, we see a\nyoungish man in very expensive casual clothes, an American,\ndressed like Eurotrash, sitting talking with the man we saw\nearlier was the Manager. As Scott approaches, we see the\nManager, knowingly, drift off. Beat. The young man (ZIMMER)\nrises from the booth, and tugs himself into neatness, and\nstops, as if bemused by Scott.\n\n                      ZIMMER\n            'Howdy, Pard'.\n\n                       SCOTT\n            Hello.

Zimmer begins\nwalking into a parking lot, where we see   several run-down\nemployee's cars, and his, Zimmer's prime   Mercedes. Scott\ntags along.\n\n                      BOUNCER\n                 (as he walks away, to\n                 Zimmer, of Zimmer's car)\n            I put her back in your space...\n\n                      SCOTT\n            I was looking for a girl...a\n            young girl...\n\n                                                             34.\n\n\n                      ZIMMER\n            Aren't we all.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            My, my, my, my, my, my question\n            was: why would a young girl want\n            to go out with an older man like\n            me? And, if you could \"answer\"\n            that...\n\nHe takes out money from his pocket. Zimmer begins to speak\nslightingly, dismissively to the 'hick'.\n\n                      ZIMMER\n            Look, Bub...\n\nZimmer starts to open his car door. He turns back to Scott,\nand we see, Zimmer's POV, Anton, standing behind Scott, at\nthe doorway to an alleyway. Obviously backing Scott up.\n\nANGLE CU, Zimmer reacts infinitesimally, to the sight of Anton.\n\nANGLE XCU, Scott, sees him, and slams him against the side\nof the car. Zimmer reaches through the half-open door, and\ncomes out with an automatic pistol in his hand. Scott kicks\nhim in the stomach, Zimmer tries to raise the hand with the\ngun, and Scott throws him to the ground, the pistol falls on\nthe concrete.\n\nANGLE on Scott as Anton emerges from the alley. Scott\ndirects him to drag Zimmer into the alleyway, near a\ndumpster. Anton thrusts his hand into the car and starts to\nreach for the dropped pistol.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            Don't touch the piece, don't\n            touch the piece, don't touch the\n            piece, th'out your gloves on...\n\nANGLE INT.

Behind him,\naround the corner, we see a dark van pull up. Anton motions\nthe van to hold.\n\n                                                             38.\n\n\nANGLE, on Scott. As he walks up toward the Businessman,\nholding the black bag. He whistles once or twice for his dog,\nand then turns to see the Businessman.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...beautiful night...\n\n                      BUSINESSMAN\n                 (nods)\n            'Less you got hayfever...\n                 (he gestures at the\n                 flowering trees)\n\n\nScott walks up to him, and pushes him back into the vestibule.\n\nANGLE TIGHT on Scott as he flicks open his switchblade, and\nholds his knife up to the Businessman's throat and whispers.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...you left something back inside.\n\nBeat. The Businessman looks frantically around, beyond him\nwe see Anton taking his Chauffeur out of the car. The\nBusinessman turns to the intercom and pushes a button. We\nhear a female voice answer, after a beat, \"...yes...?\"\n\nANGLE on Anton, holding a machine pistol, behind a corner of\nthe wall.\n\n                      BUSINESSMAN\n            ...I left my case inside.\n\nThere is a beat. And the far door in the vestibule is buzzed\nopen. As it opens several men in Swat gear stream through\nthe vestibule and up the stairs. Scott hands the Businessman\nover to an Agent, who takes charge of him, and camera holds\non Scott, standing, wearily, at the bottom of the stairs.\n\nHe motions for Anton near him to hand him a cigarette. Anton\ndoes so. Scott lights up. From the top of the stairs we hear\nscreams, sounds of breaking, yells, commands being shouted.\n\nBeat. An Agent comes to the top of the stairs, looks down,\nand shakes his head. Beat. Scott turns and finds the\nhandcuffed Businessman in his field of vision.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...they got some young girls up\n            there...?\n\nBeat. The Businessman, terrified, is silent. Scott holds out\nthe photo of the girl in the black hair.\n\n                                                             39.\n\n\n                         SCOTT\n               You see this girl...?\n                    (pause)\n\n\nThe Businessman looks at the photo. Scott gestures at Anton,\nand passes the photo of Laura Newton to Anton. And then\nlooks as if to say \"In or Out?\" Anton hesitates a moment,\nand then strikes the Businessman.\n\n                         ANTON\n               Did you See This Girl...?\n\nANGLE on the Businessman, on the ground. Terrified. He looks\nback at Scott, as if unable to focus. Scott gives him a beat,\nnods, as if to say, \"What would you expect\", and starts up\nthe stairs.\n\nINT. WHOREHOUSE. NIGHT.\n\nScott enters the vaguely Japanese modern establishment.\nSeveral Swat figures are being stood down. They sit, sharing\na thermos of coffee. One of the Swat team nods to Scott, and\nmotions him to the direction he knows Scott wants to go.\n\nCamera takes Scott past a room where two female Agents are\nholding five young women, who are supervised, changing out\nof \"escort\" wear, and into jeans and sweatshirts,\n\"streetclothes\".\n\nANGLE on Scott, as he enters what is obviously the \"office\"\nof the Bordello. One of the techs is sitting at a bashed-in\ncomputer, he is hooking it up to another laptop. He turns to\nScott.\n\n                         TECH\n               ...she was trying to scrub the\n               thing...\n\nBeyond them we see Miller. And a very attractive European-\nlooking woman in her forties. In a room beyond two bodyguard\ntypes are handcuffed, watched over by a Swat officer.\n\nScott moves back to watch Miller interrogating the woman,\nthe Madam, who speaks with a middle-European accent.\n\n                         MADAM\n               ...an escort service.

They apply.\n            For the job, as Hostesses...\n\nANGLE on Scott, who stands by the Tech, who is trying to\nreconstruct the broken computer. It prints out a file, on\nwhich we see photos of various faces. Each girl holds a\nplacard with a number on it.\n\nANGLE on Anton, who looks down.\n\nANGLE HIS POV. The wastebasket. In the BG we hear Nadya\ngoing on about the benefits of working as a Hostess. He\nmotions to Scott.\n\nScott squats to the ground, and pours out what are revealed\nto be several polaroids of beautiful young women. He uses\nhis knife to rearrange them without touching them. They are\nnow alighted and we see the numerals twelve, thirteen,\nfifteen, on placards which they hold up.\n\nANGLE on Scott, as he walks back into the interrogation room,\nholding the sheet printed out by the computer.\n\n                      NADYA\n            ...a contact for Personal\n            Services...They pay us so much\n            for each call, and...The girls\n            pay us!

It's her, isn't it.\n            She was here. Is that her...?\n\nANGLE, on Scott, as he steps away. He takes us through the\nWhorehouse. In the adjacent room we see a bank of video\nmonitors, showing people in various sexual activities. On\nthe screen for a moment comes the face of what looks like a\nvery young girl indeed, camera swerves onto the face of the\nBusinessman we saw outside the Whorehouse, he is disrobing,...\n\n                      BUSINESSMAN (ON TAPE)\n            ...come over here, you little\n            bitch...That's right, get your\n            sweet ass over here...\n\nANGLE on Scott. As he looks to the Businessman, himself, who\nis seated in a chair, presided over by several agents,\nforced to watch the video. He turns his head away.\n\n                      SCOTT\n                 (to an Agent)\n            Make him watch it.\n\n                                                             42.\n\n\nOne of the agents turns the Businessman's head brusquely back.\n\n                      BUSINESSMAN\n            I...I...listen...listen: I'm a\n            wealthy man.

This is a piece\n            of cardboard.\n\nScott holds the card. He shakes his head sadly. Scott nods\nto the Interrogator and Scott throws the card into the\nBusinessman's lap.\n\n                       INTERROGATOR\n                 (as the Businessman\n                 starts to look away)\n            Don't you look away, you son of\n            a bitch...\n                 (he forces him to watch\n                 the video)\n\n\nANGLE CU, on Scott, as he looks disgusted.

Scott hears him, and\nturns.\n\n                      MAN FROM THE SEDAN\n                 (as he sees Scott)\n            ...what the fuck...?\n\n                       SCOTT\n            ...I heard the TV, so I came\n            in...\n                  (pause)\n\n\nThe Sedan Man is put a bit off, as the comment makes no\nsense.

Why would\n            I hurt you? I just wanna know\n            why the TV's on.\n\nANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Where we see the man, and Scott. We\nsee the scene in green, through a sniperscope.\n\nANGLE, on Anton, looking through the scope.\n\nANGLE CU Anton, as he sees something in the scope.\n\nANGLE, in the house. Scott advancing toward the man.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...I just wannit to know, I just\n            came to ask you that question...\n\nThe man backs up, past a half-open glass French door.\n\nANGLE, on Scott, as he advances toward the man.\n\nANGLE, ANTON'S POV. Through the sniperscope. The faint\ntraces of what might be the Picasso symbol.\n\nANGLE, on Anton, as we see him move the sniperscope and\nadjust its magnification toward the symbol. In a corner of\nthe scope, we see another man, in a dirty white shirt,\nemerge, coming up the stairs from what might be the basement\nof the beach house. We see this man take in the scene in the\nnext room, and secrete himself behind a wall.\n\n                                                             58.\n\n\nANGLE, on Anton, whose vision is blocked - Camera takes him\nto a position next to the white tool shed.\n\nScott, moving toward the Sedan Man, unaware of the man\naround the corner.\n\nANGLE through the sniperscope. We see the man in the white\nshirt ready himself behind the opening through which Scott\nwill come. We see him raise a pistol.\n\nANGLE Anton, as he realizes he is behind the curve. As the\nman in the white shirt steps into the doorway Anton fires at\nhim through the sniperscope. We see this man fall.\n\nANGLE, INT. THE HOUSE. The man in the Sedan, his hands\nraised, fetches down a small shotgun from the lintel over\nthe door, and levels it toward Scott. Who draws and fires\nseveral rounds at him.\n\nANGLE INT. THE HOUSE. As the man goes down heavily. Scott\ncomes forward to the dying man, and kicks the shotgun away.\n\nCamera takes Scott warily into the next room, where he sees\nthe man in the white shirt sprawled on the floor. Scott\nmoves past him, and down to a door leading to the basement.\nScott takes a long look down the basement stairs. We see a\nfaint light, and a shadow moving across the light.\n\nANGLE on Scott, as he takes a deep breath, and bursts down\nthe stairs, screaming.\n\nANGLE INT. The Basement. A rough, dirt-floored room. Scott\nstanding alone. We see a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling,\nswinging slightly in the breeze from an open window.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            I'm Coming Up...\n\nANGLE, Anton, inside the house, in a covering position,\nwatching out.

He kneels by him.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...where's the girl...? You're\n            dying, pal. Even it up. WHERE IS\n            THE GIRL...

You're dying, man.\n            Where is the girl...\n\nBeat. The man begins to shudder, violently, and then stops,\nobviously dead. Beat. Scott throws the dead man down onto\nthe floor. Beat.\n\nANGLE, on Anton, who turns to look back. He stares at the\ndead man.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...well, you wanted to know...\n                 (pause.

On the desk\nwe see a bunch of junk, old cigarette packets, empty. A box\nhalf-full of yellowing stationary. Scott prods the stationary\nwith his knife. We read, in an insert: \"Hanson Marine.\nEverything for the boat. Box 38 Essex, Mass.\" (and see, on\nthe envelope, an old fashioned, stylized drawing of an old\nchriscraft-like power boat).\n\nWe hear the sound of a helicopter. And Scott turns, looking\nout of the window. He then turns back, to see Anton, who is\nstanding, looking down at the man he shot. Anton, feeling\nScott's gaze, turns to look at him.\n\n                         ANTON\n            ...I...\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...tell it to the Chaplain.\n\nScott gets up wearily, and walks toward the door out onto\nthe beach. We see a helicopter landing, and several men in\nBDU's, jumping out, and proceeding toward the house.\n\nINT. STADIUM DRESSING ROOM. DAY.\n\nBurch and his Aide. As Scott and Anton enter.

A road sign reads \"Just Two Miles To\n'The Owl', Rest Stop, Restaurant, Gas-Diesel\".\n\nANGLE EXT. THE OWL. Rest Stop. A run-down rural gas station,\nrestaurant. Off to the side we see the cruiser coming down\nthe road. As a roughly-dressed man runs out of the restaurant,\ncarrying a full paper bag in his hand. The Cruiser, unseen\nby the man, pulls up to the gas pump, and the Trooper starts\nto get out of the driver's seat. When gunfire erupts from\nthe restaurant. People are shooting at the fleeing man. A\nman opens the door of the restaurant and fires at the\nroughly-dressed man in a very urban leather jacket, who\nreturns fire. Glass breaks in the windows of the restaurant.\n\nThe roughly-dressed man runs to his car, an 80's Pontiac,\nparked near the pumps. The man in the doorway fires again,\nand the windshield of the Pontiac blows out and a tire\nbursts. The roughly-dressed man returns fire, and the man in\nthe doorway falls. The roughly-dressed man turns to see that\nthe Trooper is out of his Cruiser, and is about to fire at\nhim. The roughly-dressed man drops his satchel, and fires at\nthe Trooper, who falls.\n\nThe paper bag has fallen to the ground and burst, and\ncurrency is spilling out of it, and being taken on the wind.\nThe roughly-dressed man frantically begins to try to scoop\nit up and into his jacket.\n\nANGLE CU on this man, who we now see is SCOTT.

The Trooper comes in, taking off his\nbullet-proof vest, and sits to listen, where we find Miller\nand his Agents. The 'Restaurant Owner', who we now see is\nAnton, takes off his jacket and his bullet-proof vest and\npicks a slug, fired by Scott, out of the center of the vest.\n\n                      HEAVYSET CONVICT (V.O.)\n            ...yeah.

As Scott is found at a table in the\nkitchen next to which are various foodstuffs laid out.\nInside the house we see a female techie, at a table by the\nwall, various communications gear in front of her.

We see the first man rise from the sidewalk, and\nmove toward Scott. Scott struggles to follow the bus, when\nthe second man assaults him. Scott is now fighting the two\nmen, who manoeuvre him toward an alley.\n\nAs Scott's back is to the alley we see a Third Man emerge\nfrom the shadows, and throw a garrotte around Scott's neck.\n\nScott headbutts this man, who hauls Scott off his feet.\nScott belts him again, and stomps on his instep. And turns\ninto him. He elbows this man as the other two men advance\ntoward him, in the alleyway. The garrotte man falls.\n\nScott kicks the garrotte man in the temple. And draws his\npistol.

We see an unmarked sedan\npull up and two men get out of the car. And begin to look\naround. One sees Scott, and motions to the other one, and\nthey both start in his direction. They stop, for a moment,\nas if confused.\n\nANGLE, their POV. The street corner, empty of Scott.\n\nEXT. BOSTON STREET. DAY.\n\nCopley Square. Scott. Coming into the square.\n\nANGLE, the open-air phone stanchion we saw in the earlier\nsequence. It is festooned, as before, with ads for escort\nservices and phone sex.\n\nANGLE, on Scott, getting, hurriedly, out of a taxi cab, on\nthe outskirts of the square.\n\nANGLE, his POV, scanning the square for Anton. Scott looks\nat his watch, and he looks up.\n\nANGLE HIS POV. The figure of Anton, walking from the far\nside of the square, toward the phone booth.\n\nANGLE, on Anton, as he looks around him, and then proceeds\ntoward the phone booth.\n\nAs Scott watches, a van pulls into the plaza, and heads\ntoward Anton. Anton sees the van, and retreats, toward the\nstreetside, where we see, the van has herded him toward\nanother car. Three men get out of the car, one slugs Anton,\nand he is whisked into the car, and the car pulls away.\n\nANGLE, on Scott, on the far side of the square, looking on,\naghast.\n\nANGLE Anton, in the backseat of the car, pointing back, as\nthe car disappears.\n\nANGLE. CU. Scott, looking at Anton's gesture, and following,\nlooking in the direction in which he was pointing.\n\nANGLE Scott's POV. The telephone kiosk. Scott walks into his\nPOV, to the kiosk. He looks down at the pile of trash on the\nshelf.\n\n                                                         101.\n\n\nHe looks up at the various pornographic ads pasted around\nthe interior. He sees that, stuck in one of them is the\n\"Rogers Rangers\" card, which Anton showed him earlier. He\npulls it out of the ad to which it is stuck. He looks down\nat it inquisitively. We read in an insert: \"Rule #11: Don't\never march home the same way.\n\nTake a different route, so you won't be ambushed.\" He then\nsees that there is something else behind the ad. He tears\nthe ad off the kiosk partition, and he is rewarded, as a\nfolded envelope falls out from behind the ad. He picks up\nthe envelope. We see that it is the old yellowed envelope\nfrom the beach house. It is printed \"Hanson Marine -\nEverything For The Boat\", and we see, on it, the drawing of\nthe old power boat. We see Scott feel the envelope, shake it,\ntear off the end, and pour something out into his hand. We\nsee his face, and then pan down to see the object in the\nenvelope was the red crescent earring seen in all photographs\nof Laura Newton.\n\nEXT. BOATHOUSE, ESSEX. DUSK.\n\nA wind is blowing from the sea. Scott turns up the collar of\nhis jacket. We see the house in the BG and Scott, walking\nalong the patio, the sea beyond him. We see him stop and\nkneel, to the piling, from which he took the matchbook. He\nsifts through the sand and gravel at the foot of the piling.\nThe wind blows up the dust, and Scott stands, it is evident\nhe has got a speck in his eye, and he tries to extract it,\nblinking, and squinting. He turns his head.\n\nANGLE, HIS POV. Beyond the property line. Beyond the hedges\nand on what is obviously the next lot, an old, ramshackle\ndwelling, the small white toolshed.\n\nANGLE, Scott, looking at the toolshed, and gauging its\nproximity to the Essex House. He begins to walk toward it.\n\nANGLE. Scott. At the small white toolshed. He stoops, and we\nsee he has picked up the shell, ejected by Anton's rifle. He\nstands, he takes out a small spotter's scope.\n\nANGLE. HIS POV. His shoulder, rubbing against the pollen-\ncovered window in the small white shed, has uncovered a bit\nof a sign.\n\nANGLE. Scott, looking at the sign in the window. He rubs the\npollen off, and we see emerge, on the inside of the window,\ndrawn in the dust, the Picasso sign %-).\n\nANGLE XCU Scott.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...ohmigod...\n\n                                                            102.\n\n\nINT.

We hear the\ntelevision on low, showing talking heads narrating the\nfuneral of Laura Newton.\n\n\"Our Redhead, America's Sweetheart\", et cetera. We see a\nphoto of her in her signature red crescent earrings. Next to\nScott, on the night table, the envelope, holding the same\nred crescent earring.\n\nANGLE, the line of light under the door to the hallway is\noccupied by a pair of feet.\n\nANGLE. A hand, dangling off the bed toward the floor. Below\nit, on the floor, the creased 'Rogers Rangers' card, and\nseveral days worth of newspapers.\n\nANGLE XCU Scott, on the bed. Unshaven. We see his eyes come\nopen.\n\nANGLE on Scott's hand, as it snakes quietly past the Rangers\ncard, on which we read: \"Rule #15: Don't sleep past dawn -\nDawn's when the French and Indians attack\", and comes up\nwith an automatic pistol.\n\nANGLE the door, as we see the door handle move slightly.\n\nANGLE on Scott, as he jerks open the door, his pistol at his\nside.\n\nANGLE HIS POV. In the doorway beyond, we see a Bellboy,\nholding a small paper bag, looking shocked.\n\nScott shoves the Bellboy back away from the door, and\nglances, both ways, down the hall.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            What the hell are you doing?\n\n                      BELLBOY\n                 (showing the package)\n            I...I brought you...\n\n                      SCOTT\n            Why're you screwing with the\n            door...?\n\n                       BELLBOY\n            I...I...\n\nScott drags him into the room.\n\n                                                         103.\n\n\n                      SCOTT\n            Why're you screwing with the\n            door...?\n\nScott frisks him roughly.

Directly over their heads, a small bizjet, on\nfinal, about to touch down.\n\nANGLE, the chainlink fence. Scott and Laura at the fence\nprotecting the airport. Scott moves aside the pre-cut\nsection of fence, and gestures him through.\n\nANGLE, inside the fence. Laura and Scott moving to the\nprotection of a small hangar.\n\nANGLE, beyond them, we see the bizjet come to a halt, on the\ntarmac, and turn.

Stoddard and several of his men, get out of\nthe car which has stopped by the private plane. A man in\nfatigues emerges from the plane, and hands Stoddard a piece\nof paper.

Beyond them we\nhear the engine of the bizjet start up.\n\n                      LAURA\n            ...I'm so tired.\n\n                      WOMAN\n            ...I'm going to ask you to do\n            Just the One More Thing...\n\nLaura looks at her questioningly.\n\n                      WOMAN\n            I'm going to ask you, now, to\n            walk away from this plane, and\n            come with me.\n\nANGLE, to show that the stewardess, who descended from the\nbizjet (the vaguely military clad young woman we saw earlier)\nis still on station outside of the bizjet, and that the\nwoman who is walking and talking with Laura is Jackie Black,\nthe young female sergeant we met earlier. Laura looks at her\nuncomprehendingly. Laura begins shaking her head pathetically,\nand protesting, drawing away from Jackie Black.\n\n                      LAURA\n            No...leave me alone. No - I don't\n            know you...\n\nANGLE, INT. The Petroleum Hangar. Day.\n\n                                                            132.\n\n\n                      STODDARD\n                 (to his men, as he,\n                 Stoddard, casts a\n                 glance outside, and\n                 then back)\n            Alright, take him outside...\n                 (the henchman hoists\n                 Scott to his feet)\n\n\nANGLE, on Laura and Jackie Black. Standing immobile. Laura\nlooks down at something. She then looks up, her face transfixed.\n\nANGLE, on Jackie Black's hands, she holds the cheap jewelry\nbox we saw earlier, and, in it. The photo of Laura and Donny,\nand the legend: \"Donny you can keep this box, cause I will\nnever take them off.\"\n\nANGLE XCU, on Laura, as she looks at Jackie, who now moves\nLaura away from the bizjet, and towards the assemblage of\nnewspeople, who are on the tarmac, around the \"global news\" jet.\n\nANGLE, EXT. The Global News Jet. A female reporter,\ngossiping, with some of her crew, looks over in the\ndirection of Laura and Jackie, and does a double-take.\n\n                      FEMALE REPORTER\n            Oh, my God...\n\nANGLE, on Stoddard, his man, and Scott. As they leave the\nhangar. Stoddard looks around.\n\nANGLE, his POV. Inside the hangar, the fallen man, that\nScott has killed. Stoddard goes back inside, to drag this\nman away. He looks up. And, as he does so, he sees Laura,\nwalking with Jackie Black, toward the Global News Plane.\n\n                      STODDARD\n                 (yells)\n            Wait...!\n\nANGLE, on Jackie Black and Laura, walking toward the plane,\nwhere we see the crew hurriedly setting up a camera.\n\nANGLE, on Stoddard, as he draws his pistol, and fires toward\nLaura and Jackie. We see Jackie move to shield Laura, and\nthen, struck by a bullet, she goes down.\n\n                      JACKIE BLACK\n                 (to Laura)\n            Keep walking...\n\nANGLE, on Scott, in the grip of Stoddard's henchman.\n\n                                                         133.\n\n\n                      HENCHMAN\n                 (to Stoddard)\n            ...do you want me to...?\n\nIn the moment he is distracted. Scott breaks the man's grip,\nand his arm. He knees the man, and kicks him to the ground.\n\nANGLE, INT. The Global Jet. The news crew reacts to the shot.\nBeyond them we see Jackie, fallen to the tarmac, and Laura,\nis walking toward the newspeople.\n\n                      FEMALE REPORTER\n            Gimme an uplink Gimme an uplink...\n            GET IT ON THE SAT. Now Now Now...\n\nInside the jet we see various monitors, and one switches\nfrom an innocuous travelogue, to the scene at the airport,\nand the caption \"Live\". We see the shot is taken from inside\nthe plane. We see Laura stumbling toward the bizjet, and see\nthe female reporter run out of the plane, and move her to\nsafety inside the cabin.\n\n                      FEMALE REPORTER\n                 (to the unseen cameraman)\n            On her. On her, get it on the\n            girl...Get us Out of Here...\n\nThe camera shifts to the image of Laura Newton, going out\nlive. Behind her we hear the crew shooting commands, and see\nthe door to the Global jet close, as the jet begins to taxi.\n\nANGLE, INT. The Petroleum Hangar. We see Stoddard, reloading\nhis pistol. In the BG we see Scott step through his\nhandcuffs, that is, bring them in front of his body. He\ntakes a pistol from the henchman, who is writing on the\nfloor. He raises the pistol and shoots the henchman. He\nturns on Stoddard.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            The girl ain't dead, baby, you're\n            dead. You see: that's the\n            difference.\n\nHe walks toward Stoddard,who is fumbling, trying to reload\nhis pistol.\n\n                      STODDARD\n            WAIT: WAIT. The girl's home. You\n            brought her home. Now, listen to\n            me, because I am going to tell\n            you...now, you wanted to be\n            \"inside\"...I am going to take\n            you as far inside as you can go:\n            Z'at what you want...? Is that\n            what you want?\n\n                                                            134.\n\n\n                       SCOTT\n            No, I just wanted to bring the\n            girl back.\n\nHe shoots Stoddard, who falls.\n\nANGLE, INT. The Bizjet, as it taxis. Laura Newton turns her\nface to the sound of the shot.\n\nANGLE, her POV. Jackie Black, on the tarmac, Scott, kneeling\nto the fallen Stoddard, and then running out of the hangar\ntoward her.\n\nANGLE, on Scott, running, as we see he has the key he has\ntaken from Stoddard, and is releasing his handcuffs.\n\nANGLE Jackie Black, bleeding, as Scott kneels to her, and\ncradles her. Scott looks down. Black is weakening, and\nobviously expiring.\n\n                      JACKIE BLACK\n            ...is she safe?\n\n                      SCOTT\n            That's right, she's safe.\n\n                      JACKIE BLACK\n                 (weakly, almost whispering)\n            ...well, then...\n\nANGLE on Scott, cradling her. Weeping, as he smoothes her hair.\n\n                      SCOTT\n            ...that's right, Baby...\n\n\nFADE OUT.\n\n\n\n\nSPARTAN\nA Screenplay by David Mamet\nCopyright c 2002\nBy David Mamet\n\n\n\n                                             AUGUST 2002\n\n\n\n\n\nSpartan\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Brian Helgeland\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:07.869290"}
