SPACE\nA vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.\n\n\t\t\t\tThere is unrest in the Galactic Senate\n\t\t\t\tSeveral hundred solar systems under\n\t\t\t\tthe leadership of the rebel leader, Count\n\t\t\t\tDooku, have decalred their intentions to\n\t\t\t\tsecede from the Republic.\n\n\t\t\t\tThis separatist movement has made it\n\t\t\t\tdifficult for the limited number of\n\t\t\t\tJedi Kights to maintain peace and\n\t\t\t\torder in the galaxy.\n\n\t\t\t\tSenator Amidala, the former Queen of\n\t\t\t\tNaboo, is returning to Coruscant\n\t\t\t\tto vote on the critical issue\n\t\t\t\tof creating an army to assist the\n\t\t\t\toverwhelmed Jedi.\n\nPAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.\n\nEXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN\nThe ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.\n\nEXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN\nTwo Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.\n\nA small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.\n\nOne of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.\n\nCAPTAIN TYPHO\nWe made it. I guess I was wrong,\nthere was no danger at all.\n\nThe ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.\n\nThe DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.\n\nKlaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9 \n\t\t\tCord\u00e9...\n\nShe gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cord\u00e9's eyes are open. She looks up at her.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORD\u00c9\n\t\t\t... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I... \n\nCORD\u00c9 dies. PADM\u00c9 hugs her.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMIDALA\n\t\t\tNo!... No!... No!...\n\nPADM\u00c9 lowers CORD\u00c9 to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMIDALA\n\t\t\tI should not have come back.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN TYPHO\n\t\t\tM'Lady, you are still in danger.\n\nAmidala says nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN TYPHO\n\t\t\tThis vote is very important. You did\n\t\t\tyour duty and Cord\u00e9 did hers. Now\n\t\t\tcome. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,\n\t\t\tplease!\n\nShe turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.\n\nEXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY \nThe massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.\n\nINT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY\nThe vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAS AMEDDA\n\t\t\tOrder! We shall have order! The motion\n\t\t\tfor the Republic to commission an army\n\t\t\ttakes precedent, and that is what we\n\t\t\twill vote on at this time.\n\nEverything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\t...My esteemed colleagues, excuse\n\t\t\tme... I have just received some\n\t\t\ttragic and disturbing news. Senator\n\t\t\tAmidala of the Naboo system... Has\n\t\t\tbeen assassinated!\n\nThere is a shock silence in the vast arena.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\t\t(continued)\n\t\t\tThis grievous blow is especially\n\t\t\tpersonal to me. Before I became\n\t\t\tChancellor, I served Amidala when\n\t\t\tshe was Queen. She was a great\n\t\t\tleader who fought for justice, not\n\t\t\tonly in this honourable assembly,\n\t\t\tbut also on her home planet. She\n\t\t\twas so loved she could have been\n\t\t\telected queen for life. She\n\t\t\tbelieved in public service, and\n\t\t\tshe fervently believed in\n\t\t\tdemocracy. Her death is a great\n\t\t\tloss to us all. We will all mourn\n\t\t\ther as a relentless champion of\n\t\t\tfreedom... and as a dear friend.\n\nThere is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.\n\n\t\t\t\tSENATOR ASK AAK\n\t\t\tHow many more Senators will die\n\t\t\tbefore this civil strife ends! We\n\t\t\tmust confront these rebels now,\n\t\t\tand they need an army to do it.\n\nA second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the \nAMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMBASSADOR DARSANA\n\t\t\tWhy weren't the Jedi able to stop\n\t\t\tthis assassination? We are no\n\t\t\tlonger safe, under their protection.\n\nSenator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.\n\n\t\t\t\tORN FREE TAA\n\t\t\tThe Republic needs more security\n\t\t\tnow! Before it comes to war.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tMust I remind the Senator from\n\t\t\tMalastare that negotiations are\n\t\t\tcontinuing with the separatists.\n\t\t\tPeace is our objective here... not\n\t\t\twar.\n\nThe SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMIDALA\n\t\t\tMy noble colleagues, I concur with\n\t\t\tthe Supreme Chancellor. At all\n\t\t\tcosts, we do not want war!\n\nThe Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and \napplause.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tIt is with great surprise and\n\t\t\tjoy the chair recognises the\n\t\t\tSenator from Naboo, Padm\u00e9 Amidala.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tLess than an hour ago, an\n\t\t\tassassination attempt was made\n\t\t\tagainst my life. One of my\n\t\t\tbodyguards and six  others were\n\t\t\truthlessly and senselessly\n\t\t\tmurdered. I was the target but,\n\t\t\tmore importantly, I believe this\n\t\t\tsecurity measure before you, was\n\t\t\tthe target. I have led the\n\t\t\topposition to build an army... but\n\t\t\tthere is someone in this body who\n\t\t\twill stop at nothing to assure it's\n\t\t\tpassage...\n\nMany of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\t \t(continuing)\n\t\t\tI warn you, if you vote to create\n\t\t\tthis army, war will follow. I\n\t\t\thave experienced the misery of war \n\t\t\tfirst-hand; I do not wish to do it\n\t\t\tagain.\n\nThere is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tWake up, Senators... you must wake\n\t\t\tup! If you offer the separatists\n\t\t\tviolence, they can only show us\n\t\t\tviolence in return! Many will\n\t\t\tlose their lives. All will lose\n\t\t\ttheir freedom. This decision\n\t\t\tcould very well destroy the very\n\t\t\tfoundation of our great Republic.\n\t\t\tI pray you do not let fear push\n\t\t\tyou into a disastrous decision.\n\t\t\tVote down this security measure,\n\t\t\twhich is nothing less than a\n\t\t\tdeclaration of war! Does anyone\n\t\t\there want that? I cannot believe\n\t\t\tthey do.\n\nThere is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.\n\n\t\t\t\tORN FREE TAA\n\t\t\tMy motion to defer the vote must\n\t\t\tbe dealt with first. That is the\n\t\t\trule of law.\n\nAMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tDue to the lateness of the hour\n\t\t\tand the seriousness of this\n\t\t\tmotion, we will take up these\n\t\t\tmatters tomorrow. Until then, the\n\t\t\tSenate stands adjourned.\n\nEXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY \nThe giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.\n\nINT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nCHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from him.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tI don't know how much longer I can\n\t\t\thold off the vote, my friends.\n\t\t\tMore and more star systems are\n\t\t\tjoining the separatists.\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tIf they do break away -\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tNo! I will not let that happen!\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tBut if they do, you must realise\n\t\t\tthere aren't enough Jedi to\n\t\t\tprotect the Republic. We are\n\t\t\tkeepers of the peace, not soldiers.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tMaster Yoda, do you think it will\n\t\t\treally come to war?\n\nYODA closes his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\tWorse than war, I fear... Much\n\t\t\tworse. \n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tWhat do you sense, Master?\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\tImpossible to see ... The Dark Side\n\t\t\tclouds everything. But this I am\n\t\t\tsure of -\n\t\t\t\t(opens his eyes)\n\t\t\tDo their duty the Jedi will.\n\nA muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAR WAC\n\t\t\tThe loyalist committee has arrived,\n\t\t\tmy Lord. \n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tSend them in.\n\nThey all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\tWith you the force is strong...\n\t\t\tyoung Senator. To see you alive\n\t\t\tbrings warm feeling to my heart.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tThank you, Master Yoda. Do you\n\t\t\thave any idea who was behind\n\t\t\tthe attack?\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tOur intelligence points to\n\t\t\tdisgruntled spice miners, on\n\t\t\tthe moons of Naboo.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tI don't wish to disagree but I\n\t\t\tthink that Count Dooku was behind\n\t\t\tit.\n\nThere is a stir of surprise.\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tYou know, M'Lady, Count Dooku\n\t\t\twas once a Jedi. He wouldn't\n\t\t\tassassinate anyone, it is not in\n\t\t\this character.\n\n\t\t\t\tKI-ADI-MUNDI\n\t\t\tHe is a political idealist, not\n\t\t\ta murderer.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\tIn dark times nothing is what it\n\t\t\tappears to be, but the fact remains\n\t\t\tSenator, in grave danger you are.\n\nPALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tCount Dooku has always avoided\n\t\t\tany kind of conflict. It appears\n\t\t\the has no desire to start a war.\n\t\t\tWhy would he kill you? To what end?\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9 \n\t\t\tI don't know, but everything in my\n\t\t\tbeing tells me he was behind it... \n\nAfter gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to \nMace.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tMaster Jedi, may I suggest that\n\t\t\tthe Senator be placed under the\n\t\t\tprotection of your graces.\n\n\t\t\t\tBAIL ORGANA\n\t\t\tDo you think that is a wise use\n\t\t\tof manpower during these stressful\n\t\t\ttimes?\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tChancellor, if I may comment, I\n\t\t\tdo not believe the...\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\t...\"situation is that serious.\"\n\t\t\tNo, but I do, Senator.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tChancellor, please! I don't want\n\t\t\tany more guards!\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tI realise all too well that\n\t\t\tadditional security might be\n\t\t\tdisruptive for you, but perhaps\n\t\t\tsomeone you are familiar with... an\n\t\t\told friend like... Master Kenobi...\n\nPALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tThat's possible. He has just\n\t\t\treturned from a Border dispute on\n\t\t\tAnsion.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tYou must remember him, M'Lady...\n\t\t\the watched over you during the\n\t\t\tblockade conflict.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tThis is not necessary, Chancellor.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tDo it for me, M'Lady, please. I\n\t\t\twill rest easier. We had a big\n\t\t\tscare today. The thought of\n\t\t\tlosing you is unbearable.\n\nAMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tI will have Obi-Wan report to you\n\t\t\timmediately, M'Lady.\n\nYODA leans into her ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\tToo little about yourself you\n\t\t\tworry, Senator, and too much about\n\t\t\tpolitics. Be mindful of your\n\t\t\tdanger, Padm\u00e9. Accept our help.\n\nAs the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.\n\n\t\t\t\tPALPATINE\n\t\t\tI will not like this Republiv, that\n\t\t\thas stood for over a thousand\n\t\t\tyears, be split in two\n\nEXT.

Only\n\t\t\tgoing through the Dark Side can we\n\t\t\tsee.\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tIt's been ten years, and the Sith\n\t\t\tstill have no shown themselves.\n\t\t\tDo you think they are behind this?\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\t...Out there, they are. A\n\t\t\tcertainty that is.\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tDo you think Obi-Wan's apprentice\n\t\t\twill be able to bring balance to\n\t\t\tthe Force?\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\tOnly if he chooses to follow his\n\t\t\tdestiny.\n\nThere is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.\n\nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT\nPADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off.\n\nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT\nANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.\n\nThe door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tCaptain Typho has more than enough\n\t\t\tmen downstairs. No assassin will\n\t\t\ttry that way. Any activity up\n\t\t\there?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tQuiet as a tomb. I don't like\n\t\t\tjust waiting here for something to\n\t\t\thappen to her.\n\nOBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat's going on?\n\nANAKIN shrugs.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tShe covered that camera. I don't\n\t\t\tthink she liked me watching her.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat is she thinking?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tShe programmed Artoo to warn us if\n\t\t\tthere's an intruder.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt's not an intruder I'm worried\n\t\t\tabout. There are many other ways\n\t\t\tto kill a Senator.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI know, but we also want to catch\n\t\t\tthis assassin. Don't we, Master?\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tYou're using her as bait??\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tIt was her idea... No harm will\n\t\t\tcome to her. I can sense\n\t\t\teverything going on in that room.\n\t\t\tTrust me.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt's too risky... and your senses\n\t\t\taren't that attuned, young\n\t\t\tapprentice.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tAnd yours are?\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tPossibly.\n\nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT\nAs PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.\n\nARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.\n\nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT\nANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN \n\t\t\tYou look tired.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI don't sleep well, anymore.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN \n\t\t\tBecause of your mother?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI don't know why I keep dreaming\n\t\t\tAbout her now. I haven't seen her\n\t\t\tsince I was little.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tDreams pass in time.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI'd rather dream of Padm\u00e9. Just\n\t\t\tBeing around her again is...\n\t\t\tintoxicating.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tMind your thoughts, Anakin, they\n\t\t\tbetray you. You've made a\n\t\t\tcommitment to the Jedi order... a\n\t\t\tcommitment not easily broken...\n\t\t\tand don't forget she's a\n\t\t\tpolitician. They're not to be\n\t\t\ttrusted.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN \n\t\t\tShe's not like the others in the\n\t\t\tSenate, Master.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt's been my experience that\n\t\t\tSenators are only focused on\n\t\t\tpleasing those who fund their\n\t\t\tcampaigns... and they are more\n\t\t\tthan willing to forget the\n\t\t\tniceties of democracy to get those\n\t\t\tfunds.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tNot another lecture, Master. Not\n\t\t\ton the economics of politics....\n\t\t\tIt's too early in the morning... and\n\t\t\tbesides, you're generalising. The\n\t\t\tChancellor doesn't appear to\n\t\t\tbe corrupt.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tPalpatine's a politician, I've\n\t\t\tobserved that he is very clever at\n\t\t\tfollowing the passions and\n\t\t\tprejudices of the Senators.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI think he is a good man. My\n\t\t\tinstincts are very positive\n\t\t\tabout...\n\nANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI sense it, too.\n\nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT\nARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.\n\n\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.\n\nOBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.\n\nEXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\nOBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.\n\nINT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tStay here!\n\nCAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.\n\nEXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT\nThe PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off. \n\nEXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT\nANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.\n\nEXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT\nThe DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI have a bad feeling about this.\n\nFINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tThat was wacky! I almost lost you\n\t\t\tin the traffic.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat took you so long?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tOh, you know, Master, I couldn't\n\t\t\tfind a speeder I really liked,\n\t\t\twith an open cockpit... and with\n\t\t\tthe right speed capabilities...\n\t\t\tand then you know I had to get a\n\t\t\treally gonzo color...\n\nThey zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIf you'd spend as much time\n\t\t\tworking on your saber skills as\n\t\t\tyou do on your wit, young Padawan,\n\t\t\tyou would rival Master Yoda as a\n\t\t\tswordsman.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI thought I already did.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tOnly in your mind, my very young\n\t\t\tapprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!\n\nAs this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, I forgot you don't like\n\t\t\tflying, Master.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI don't mind flying... but\n\t\t\twhat you're doing is suicide!\n\nThey barely miss a commuter train\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tMaster, you know I've been flying\n\t\t\tsince before I could walk. I'm very\n\t\t\tgood at this.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tJust slow down!\n\nZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tWait! Don't go in there!\n\nANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tYou know I don't like it when you\n\t\t\tdo that!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, Master. Don't worry, this\n\t\t\tguy's gonna kill himself any\n\t\t\tminute now!\n\nZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing? He's gonna\n\t\t\tblast me!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tRight - this isn't working.\n\nANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tThat was too close!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tClear that!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat??\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tClear the flag! We're losing\n\t\t\tpower! Hurry!\n\nOBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhooooaaa! Don't do that! I\n\t\t\tdon't  like it when you do that!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSo sorry, Master.\n\nThey chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt's dangerous near those power\n\t\t\tcouplings! Slow down! Don't go\n\t\t\tthrough there!\n\nHuge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tYiiii, what are you doing?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, Master!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(sarcastically)\n\t\t\tOh, that was good...\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tThat was crazy!!!\n\nZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tAhh, damn.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tStop!!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tNo, we can make it.\n\nANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm\n\t\t\tcrazy.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tBut it worked... we made it.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(angrily)\n\t\t\tIt didn't work... we've stalled!\n\t\t\tAnd you almost got us killed!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI think we're still alive.\n\nANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(very angrily)\n\t\t\tIt was stupid!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(sheepishly)\n\t\t\tI could have made it...\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(furious)\n\t\t\tBut you didn't!!! And now we've\n\t\t\tlost him.\n\nSuddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tNo we didn\u0092t...\n\nOut of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhere are you going?! He went\n\t\t\tdown there, the other way.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tThis is a shortcut... I think.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhat do you mean, \u0091You think?\u0092\n\t\t\tWhat kind of shortcut?! He went\n\t\t\tcompletely the other way! You\u0092ve\n\t\t\tlost him!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tMaster, if we keep this chase\n\t\t\tgoing, that creep\u0092s gonna end up\n\t\t\tdeep fried. Personally, I\u0092d very\n\t\t\tmuch like to find out who in the\n\t\t\thell he is and who he\u0092s working\n\t\t\tfor...\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(sarcastic)\n\t\t\tOh, so that\u0092s why we\u0092re going in\n\t\t\tthe wrong direction.\n\nANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tWell, you lost him.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI\u0092m deeply sorry, Master.\n\nANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to \nstart counting to himself as he watches something below approach.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tExcuse me for a moment.\n\nANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam\u0092s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter\u0092s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.\n\nZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder\u0092s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can\u0092t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.\n\nOBI-WAN has jumped into the driver\u0092s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger\u0092s seat.\n\nANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM\u0092S hand. She grabs the Jedi\u0092s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it\u0092s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter\u0092s speeder.\n\nJust as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.\n\nEXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT\nZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.\n\nIt's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.\n\nANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.\n\nAhead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.\n\nA nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tAnakin!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tShe went into that club, Master.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tPatience.\n\nOBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t \t(continuing)\n\t\t\tHere. Next time try not to lose it.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tSorry, Master.\n\nANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tA Jedi's saber is his most\n\t\t\tprecious possession.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tYes, Master.\n\nHe reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tHe must keep it with him at all\n\t\t\ttimes.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI know, Master.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tThis weapon is your life!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI've heard this lesson before...\n\nOBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tBut, you haven't learned anything,\n\t\t\tAnakin.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI try, Master.\n\nINT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT\nOBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tWhy do I think you are going to be\n\t\t\tthe death of me?!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tDon't say that Master... You're\n\t\t\tthe closest thing I have to a\n\t\t\tfather... I love you. I don't want\n\t\t\tto cause you pain.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tThen why don't you listen to me?!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI will. I'll do better, I promise.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tDo you see him him?\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI think he's a she...\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tThen be extra careful...\n\t\t\t\t(nods to a room)\n\t\t\tCheck it out.\n\nOBI-WAN goes away.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tWhere are you going, Master?\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tTo get a drink.\n\nOBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.\n\nCLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.\n\n\t\t\t\tELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO\n\t\t\tWanna buy some death sticks?\n\nOBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tYou don't want to sell me death-\n\t\t\tsticks.\n\n\t\t\t\tELAN\n\t\t\tI don't want to sell you death-\n\t\t\tsticks.\n\nOBI-WAN moves his fingers.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tYou want to go home and rethink \n\t\t\tyour life.\n\n\t\t\t\tELAN\n\t\t\tI want to go home and rethink my\n\t\t\tlife.\n\nHe leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.\n\nCLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.\n\nANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.\n\nThe drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it.

They exit onto the main plaza.\n\nEXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON\nThe speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tIf I grew up here, I don't think\n\t\t\tI'd ever leave.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\t\t(laughing)\n\t\t\tI doubt that.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tNo, really. When I started my\n\t\t\ttraining, I was very homesick and\n\t\t\tvery lonely. This city and my Mom\n\t\t\twere the only pleasant things I\n\t\t\thad to think about... The problem\n\t\t\twas, the more I thought about my\n\t\t\tMom, the worse I felt. But I\n\t\t\twould feel better if I thought\n\t\t\tabout the palace - the way it\n\t\t\tshimmers in the sunlight - the way\n\t\t\tthe air always smells of flowers...\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\t...and the soft sound of the\n\t\t\tdistant waterfalls. The first\n\t\t\ttime I saw the Capital, I was very\n\t\t\tyoung... I'd never seen a\n\t\t\twaterfall before. I though they\n\t\t\twere so beautiful... I never\n\t\t\tdreamed one day I'd live in the\n\t\t\tpalace.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tWell, tell me, did you dream of\n\t\t\tpower and politics when you were\n\t\t\ta little girl?\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\t\t(laughing)\n\t\t\tNo! That was the last thing I\n\t\t\tthought of. My dream was to help\n\t\t\tin the \"Refugee Relief Movement.\"\n\t\t\tI never thought of running for\n\t\t\telected office. But the more\n\t\t\thistory I studied, the more I\n\t\t\trealised how much good politicians\n\t\t\tcould do. So when I was eight, I\n\t\t\tjoined the \"Apprentice\n\t\t\tLegislators\", then later on became\n\t\t\ta Senatorial advisor, with such a\n\t\t\tpassion that, before I knew it, I\n\t\t\twas elected Queen. Partly because\n\t\t\tI scored so high on my education\n\t\t\tcertificate, but for the most part\n\t\t\tit was my conviction that reform\n\t\t\twas possible. I wasn't the\n\t\t\tyoungest Queen ever elected, but\n\t\t\tnow that I think back on it, I'm\n\t\t\tnot sure I was old enough. I'm not\n\t\t\tsure I was ready.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tThe people you served thought you\n\t\t\tdid a good job. I heard they\n\t\t\ttried to amend the Constitution so\n\t\t\tyou could stay in office.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tPopular rule is not democracy,\n\t\t\tAnnie. It gives the people what\n\t\t\tthey want, not what they need.\n\t\t\tAnd, truthfully, I was relieved\n\t\t\twhen my two terms were up. So\n\t\t\twere my parents. They worried\n\t\t\tAbout me during the blockade and\n\t\t\tcouldn't wait for it all to be\n\t\t\tover. Actually, I was hoping to\n\t\t\thave a family by now... My\n\t\t\tsisters have the most amazing,\n\t\t\twonderful kids... but when the\n\t\t\tQueen asked me to serve as\n\t\t\tSenator, I couldn't refuse her.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI agree! I think the Republic\n\t\t\tneeds you... I'm glad you chose\n\t\t\tto serve. I feel things are going\n\t\t\tto happen in our generation that\n\t\t\twill change the galaxy in profound\n\t\t\tways.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tI think so too.\n\nANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace.

And more are\n\t\t\tleaving the Republic every day.\n\t\t\tIf the Senate votes to create an\n\t\t\tarmy, I'm sure it's going to push\n\t\t\tus into a civil war.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIO BIBBLE\n\t\t\tIt's unthinkable! There hasn't\n\t\t\tbeen a full-scale war since the\n\t\t\tformation of the Republic!\n\n\t\t\t\tQUEEN JAMILLIA\n\t\t\tDo you see any way, through\n\t\t\tnegotiations, to bring the\n\t\t\tseparatists back into the Republic?\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tNot if they feel threatened. The\n\t\t\tseparatists don't have an army,\n\t\t\tbut if they are provoked, they\n\t\t\twill move to defend themselves.\n\t\t\tI'm sure of that. And with no time\n\t\t\tor money to build an army, my\n\t\t\tguess is they will turn to the\n\t\t\tCommerce Guilds or the Trade\n\t\t\tFederation for help.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUEEN JAMILLIA\n\t\t\tThe armies of commerce! Why has\n\t\t\tNothing been done in the Senate\n\t\t\tto restrain them?\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tI'm afraid that, despite the\n\t\t\tChancellor's best efforts, there\n\t\t\tare still many bureaucrats,\n\t\t\tjudges, and even Senators on the\n\t\t\tpayrolls of the Guilds.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIO BIBBLE\n\t\t\tIt's outrageous! After all of\n\t\t\tthose hearings, and the four trials in\n\t\t\tthe Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is\n\t\t\tstill the Viceroy of the Trade\n\t\t\tFederation. Do those money\n\t\t\tmongers control everything?\n\n\t\t\t\tQUEEN JAMILLIA\n\t\t\tRemember, Counsellor, the courts\n\t\t\twere able to reduce the\n\t\t\tFederation's armies.

OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.\n\nOn the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.\n\nAfter OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi.

In the\n\t\t\tend, I think he left because he\n\t\t\tlost faith in the Republic. He\n\t\t\tbelieved that politics were\n\t\t\tcorrupt, and he felt the Jedi\n\t\t\tbetrayed themselves by serving the\n\t\t\tpoliticians.

Always\n\t\t\tcarrying the weight of the\n\t\t\tuniverse on your shoulders.\n\nANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.\n\nANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.\n\nThe SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.\n\nANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.\n\nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY\nOBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground.

He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.\n\nINT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY\nOBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.\n\nINT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY\nOBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.\n\nOBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.\n\nEXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY\nJANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:\n\n\t\t\t\tBOBA FETT\n\t\t\tDad!!\n\nJANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.\n\nJANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.\n\nThe bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.\n\nJANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.\n\nIN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.\n\nOUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.\n\nIN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.\n\nOUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:\n\nIN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.\n\nOUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.\n\nThe lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.\n\nIN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:\n\nOUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.\n\nJANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.\n\nOBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.\n\nLocked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.\n\nOBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.\n\nJANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.\n\nOUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:\n\nA HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.\n\nEXT.

Four of us came back.\n\t\t\tThree more are still out there\n\t\t\tlooking. I'd be with them,\n\t\t\tonly...

Suddenly:\n\n\t\t\t\tBOBA FETT\n\t\t\tDad, look!!\n\nOn the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tJANGO FETT\n\t\t\tHang on!\n\nThe ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.\n\nEXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS\nThe ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through.\n\nFinally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids.\n\nIn JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOBA FETT\n\t\t\tDad! Watch out!\n\n\t\t\t\tJANGO FETT\n\t\t\tStay calm, son. We'll be fine.\n\t\t\tThat Jedi won't be able to follow\n\t\t\tus through this.\n\nBut Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.\n\nIN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.\n\nIN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOBA FETT\n\t\t\tGot him! Yeahhhhh!\n\n\t\t\t\tJANGO FETT\n\t\t\tWe won't see him again.\n\nBOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.\n\nEXT.

He looks around.\n\nGeonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains.\n\nThe night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks his bearings, then heads away.\n\nEXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT\nOBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly.

The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.\n\nA SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING.

TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT\nThe lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.\n\nA shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.\n\nHe cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been \nterribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tMom... Mom... Mom... \n\nSHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open.

He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.\n\nSLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.\n\nEXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN\nThe pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.\n\nAs she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakin\u0092s lightsaber switches on.\n\nEXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT\nOBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit.

Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena\n\nINT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY\nThe great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI was beginning to wonder if you\n\t\t\thad gotten my message.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI retransmitted it as you\n\t\t\trequested, Master. Then we decided\n\t\t\tto come and rescue you.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt looks like you're going a good\n\t\t\tjob so far.\n\nTheir arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUN RIT\n\t\t\tThe felons before you have been\n\t\t\tconvicted of espionage against the\n\t\t\tSovereign System of Geonosis.\n\t\t\tTheir sentence of death is to be\n\t\t\tcarried out in this public arena\n\t\t\thenceforth.\n\nThe crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOGGLE\n\t\t\tLet the executions begin!\n\nThe crowd goes wild.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI have a bad feeling about this.\n\nFrom different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.\n\nThe MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tTake the one the left. I'll\n\t\t\ttake the one on the right.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tWhat about Padme?\n\nPADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tIt looks like she's already on top\n\t\t\tof things.\n\nThe REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post\n\nOBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.\n\nThe NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.\n\nIn the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.\n\nIn the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.\n\nANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.\n\nThe NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.\n\nIn the archducal box:\n\n\t\t\t\tNUTE GUNRAY\n\t\t\tFoul!! She can't do that... shoot\n\t\t\ther or something!\n\nIn the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tYou okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tPADME\n\t\t\t\t(nods, gasping)\n\t\t\tSure! Well, sort of.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tJump!!!\n\nThe NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.\n\nIn the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.\n\n\t\t\t\tNUTE GUNRAY\n\t\t\tThis isn't how it's supposed to\n\t\t\tbe! Jango, finish her off.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(smiling enigmatically)\n\t\t\tPatiece, Viceroy... she will die.\n\t\t\tMaybe this is the way it's\n\t\t\tsupposed to end.\n\nOBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.\n\nINT.

GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY\nIn the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tMaster Windu, how pleasant of you\n\t\t\tto join us. You're just in time\n\t\t\tfor the moment of truth.

The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(to Mace Windu)\n\t\t\tBrave, but stupid, my old Jedi\n\t\t\tfriend. You're impossibly\n\t\t\toutnumbered.\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tI don't think so. One Jedi has to\n\t\t\tbe worth a hundred Geonosians.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tIt wasn't the Geonosians I was\n\t\t\tthinking about. How well do you\n\t\t\tthink one Jedi will hold up\n\t\t\tagainst a thousand battle droids?\n\nCOUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.\n\nMACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.\n\nThe REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.\n\nAmong the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.\n\nINT.

Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted/ The rest are retreating into the arena.\n\nANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.\n\nMACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tSomeone's got to - shut down -\n\t\t\tthese droids.\n\n\t\t\t\tMACE WINDU\n\t\t\tDon't worry!

He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!\n\nThere is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.\n\n\t\t\t\tPLO KOON\n\t\t\tWe've done it! Now we have a\n\t\t\tchance!\n\nSuddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND.

GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY\nMACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.\n\nAt the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up.\n\nKI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.\n\nIn the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons.

PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADME\n\t\t\tLook!\n\nAbove, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\tCome on - hurry! Hurry!\n\nThe SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.\n\nEXT.

GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY\nOBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.\n\nThe Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tHold on! Look over there...\n\nThrough the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tIt's Dooku, go after him!\n\nThe PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tPadme!!!\n\nANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\t\t(continuing; to pilot)\n\t\t\tPut the ship down!

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.\n\nCount Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.\n\nINT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY\nCOUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.\n\n\t\t\t\tDROID CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tYour Excellency!\n\nCOUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tThat won't be necessary, Captain.\n\t\t\tStand down. And leave them to me.\n\nThe DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\t\t(to Anakin)\n\t\t\tWe move in together - you slowly\n\t\t\ton the...\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI'm taking him now!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tAnakin, no!\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tYou'll pay for all the Jedi you've\n\t\t\tkilled today, Dooku.\n\nANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tKenobi, isn't it? As you can see,\n\t\t\tmy Jedi powers are far beyond\n\t\t\tyours. Now, back down.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tI don't think so.\n\nOBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tAh, but if I must.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tI have spent the last ten years\n\t\t\tlearning to use the power of the\n\t\t\tDark Side. It gives me infinitely\n\t\t\tgreater power.\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tYou will have to prove it.\n\nOBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tGrand Master Kenobi, you\n\t\t\tdisappoint me. Yoda holds you in\n\t\t\tsuch high esteem.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU parried another cut.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tSurely you can do better...?\n\t\t\t\t(parries)\n\t\t\tNo, I'm surprised. Has Jedi\n\t\t\tswordsmanship degenerated so\n\t\t\tquickly, or are you trying to make\n\t\t\tfun of me?\n\t\t\t\t(cuts)\n\t\t\tWhich is it?\n\nCOUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tcome, come, Master Kenobi. Put me\n\t\t\tout of my misery.\n\nOBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.\n\nOBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tThat's brave of you, boy - but\n\t\t\tfoolish. I would have thought\n\t\t\tyou'd have learnt your lesson.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tI'm a slow learner.\n\nAnd ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tYou have unusual powers, young\n\t\t\tPadawan. But not enought to save\n\t\t\tyou this time.\n\n\t\t\t\tANAKIN\n\t\t\tDon't bet on it!\n\n\t\t\t\tOBI-WAN\n\t\t\tAnakin!\n\nOBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.\n\nSuddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.\n\nBefore the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.\n\nSilence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\tMaster Yoda. At last we shall\n\t\t\tknow who is the most powerful.\n\nYODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\tCount Dooku. No interest in\n\t\t\tcontests, do I have.\n\nCOUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.\n\nYODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.\n\nCount Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.\n\n\t\t\t\tYODA\n\t\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t\tThe end for you, Count, this is.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOUNT DOOKU\n\t\t\t...Not yet...\n\nCOUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.\n\nANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.\n\nYODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADM\u00c9 and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\tPADM\u00c9\n\t\t\tAnakin!\n\nPADM\u00c9 runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLONE CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tResistance is at an end, General.\n\t\t\tWhat are your orders ?\n\nYODA looks at him and sighs.\n\nEXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN\nCOUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant.
