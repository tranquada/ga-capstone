MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY\n</b>\n<b>               A BOAT\n</b>\n               Specifically, a garbage scow.\n\n               We see it from ON HIGH, chugging down the placid but mighty \n               Mississippi.\n\n               Head credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow. No sound, \n               except for an incongruously heroic score.\n\n               The COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with \n               the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film \n               rather than a feature.\n\n               One piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is \n               obviously library. And not a new library either.\n\n               The garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad, \n               sluggish waters, and proceeds on to its landfill, a steaming \n               river island. Disturbed gulls and other scavenger birds rise \n               from where they were picking through trash. Their squawks, \n               like the boat horn, are not quite believable as SYNC.\n\n               The head credits end as the anthemic music resolves.\n\n<b>               EXT.

The porch is half-shaded from the noonday sun. It is \n               quiet except for the chirr of heat bugs, close by, and, very \n               distant, many voices in chorus, engaged in divine worship in \n               a Baptist church sufficiently far away that vagaries of breeze \n               fan them in and out of audibility.\n\n               We once again hear the toot of the scow's horn, distant now \n               and played as real, not slapdash effect. At this, the dog \n               lifts his nose to catch the breeze, sniffs, and then, whining, \n               lowers his head to the floor and covers his snout with his \n               forepaws. He huffs briefly and goes to sleep.\n\n               We DRIFT UP to show that the dog is sleeping before the\n\n<b>               SAUCIER WORM STORE\n</b>\n               Your source for worms, lures, etcetera, etcetera...\n\n               We TRAVEL OVER TO REVEAL that the modest one-story structure \n               houses two establishments; its other front door leads to the\n\n<b>               SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING.\n</b>\n               A campaign sign in the window on the municipal side shows a \n               black man of late middle-age beaming and giving the viewer a \n               thumbs-up:\n\n               RE-ELECT WAYNE WYNER SHERIFF/He Is Too Old to Go to Work.\n\n<b>               INT.

The OFFSCREEN snoring and whirring \n               continues.\n\n               The TRACK'S SHIFTING ANGLE now makes the light catch a spider \n               web spun between the key and the wall.\n\n<b>               POLICE SCANNER\n</b>\n               We DRIFT across the face of the radio. The peaceful steady \n               hissing jumps in louder at the CUT: it is uninterrupted: a \n               transmissionless, crimeless, misdemeanorless idle radio hiss.\n\n               The snoring is also louder here. As we TRAVEL OFF the radio \n               we are COMING ONTO a pair of feet propped up on the desktop.\n\n               They belong to SHERIFF WYNER, tipped back in his chair, \n               fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward.\n\n               As the MOVING CAMERA FINALLY ENDS on him, there is the ring \n               of a telephone -- muffled, not present.\n\n               It nevertheless rouses the sheriff who almost strangles on a \n               snore as he awakes, and then rocks forward to pick up his \n               phone.\n\n<b>                                     SHERIFF WYNER\n</b>                         Sheriff Wyner...\n\n               The muffled ringing continues; the sheriff looks, puzzled, \n               at the phone.

At the call \n               of \"Hike!\" we and everyone on the field spring into action.\n\n               We sprint downfield, the breathing becoming even louder.

MUNSON\n</b>                         ...What a fellowship, What a peace \n                         of mind, Safe and secure from all \n                         harm. Lean on Jesus, Lean on Jesus, \n                         Leaning on the everlasting arm...\n\n               When she opens the front door the cat slips out.\n\n<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON\n</b>                         ...Pickles!\n\n               It races off down the street.\n\n<b>                                     MRS. MUNSON\n</b>                         ...Pickles!\n\n<b>               EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - BRIDGE - DAY\n</b>\n               Pickles scurries along the walkway. We hear the toot! of an \n               approaching scow.\n\n               The cat reaches the middle of the bridge. He sticks his head \n               through the bars of the railing.\n\n               When we CUT CLOSE on the cat as he looks down at the water, \n               we see that he holds in his mouth a human finger.\n\n               As the scow passes underneath, the cat opens its mouth and \n               lets the finger drop.\n\n               The finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it \n               hits the scow.\n\n               The cat looks up INTO THE LENS, and blinks. Its sideways \n               irises adjust.\n\n               The scow is gliding away. With the low mournful toot of its \n               horn we tilt up the river to the great garbage island where \n               scavenger birds pick through the trash.\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Ladykillers, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=William Rose\" title=\"Scripts by William Rose\">William Rose</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Joel Coen\" title=\"Scripts by Joel Coen\">Joel Coen</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Ethan Coen\" title=\"Scripts by Ethan Coen\">Ethan Coen</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Ladykillers, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Ladykillers, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:09:26.103004"}
