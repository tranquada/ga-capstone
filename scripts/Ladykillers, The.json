MISSISSIPPI RIVER - DAY\n\n               A BOAT\n\n               Specifically, a garbage scow.\n\n               We see it from ON HIGH, chugging down the placid but mighty \n               Mississippi.\n\n               Head credits play over COVERAGE of the garbage scow. No sound, \n               except for an incongruously heroic score.\n\n               The COVERAGE is a little rough, coarse-grained; along with \n               the overbearing score it almost suggests an industrial film \n               rather than a feature.\n\n               One piece of sound -- the toot of the boat's horn -- is \n               obviously library. And not a new library either.\n\n               The garbage scow passes under a bridge spanning the broad, \n               sluggish waters, and proceeds on to its landfill, a steaming \n               river island. Disturbed gulls and other scavenger birds rise \n               from where they were picking through trash. Their squawks, \n               like the boat horn, are not quite believable as SYNC.\n\n               The head credits end as the anthemic music resolves.\n\n               EXT. SAUCIER, MISSISSIPPI - DAY\n\n               AN OLD HOUND DOG\n\n               lies on the weather-grayed and -roughened planking of a front \n               porch. The porch is half-shaded from the noonday sun. It is \n               quiet except for the chirr of heat bugs, close by, and, very \n               distant, many voices in chorus, engaged in divine worship in \n               a Baptist church sufficiently far away that vagaries of breeze \n               fan them in and out of audibility.\n\n               We once again hear the toot of the scow's horn, distant now \n               and played as real, not slapdash effect. At this, the dog \n               lifts his nose to catch the breeze, sniffs, and then, whining, \n               lowers his head to the floor and covers his snout with his \n               forepaws. He huffs briefly and goes to sleep.\n\n               We DRIFT UP to show that the dog is sleeping before the\n\n               SAUCIER WORM STORE\n\n               Your source for worms, lures, etcetera, etcetera...\n\n               We TRAVEL OVER TO REVEAL that the modest one-story structure \n               houses two establishments; its other front door leads to the\n\n               SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING.\n\n               A campaign sign in the window on the municipal side shows a \n               black man of late middle-age beaming and giving the viewer a \n               thumbs-up:\n\n               RE-ELECT WAYNE WYNER SHERIFF/He Is Too Old to Go to Work.\n\n               INT. SAUCIER MUNICIPAL BUILDING - DAY\n\n               We hear snoring on top of a low, steady hissing sound.\n\n               We are DRIFTING toward the door of the lock-up, which stands \n               open. The small cell is empty, its bed neatly made.\n\n               A KEY\n\n               We are ARCING slowly around a jailer's key on a ring that \n               hangs from a nail. The OFFSCREEN snoring and whirring \n               continues.\n\n               The TRACK'S SHIFTING ANGLE now makes the light catch a spider \n               web spun between the key and the wall.\n\n               POLICE SCANNER\n\n               We DRIFT across the face of the radio. The peaceful steady \n               hissing jumps in louder at the CUT: it is uninterrupted: a \n               transmissionless, crimeless, misdemeanorless idle radio hiss.\n\n               The snoring is also louder here. As we TRAVEL OFF the radio \n               we are COMING ONTO a pair of feet propped up on the desktop.\n\n               They belong to SHERIFF WYNER, tipped back in his chair, \n               fingers laced on his chest, head lolling forward.\n\n               As the MOVING CAMERA FINALLY ENDS on him, there is the ring \n               of a telephone -- muffled, not present.\n\n               It nevertheless rouses the sheriff who almost strangles on a \n               snore as he awakes, and then rocks forward to pick up his \n               phone.\n\n                                     SHERIFF WYNER\n                         Sheriff Wyner...\n\n               The muffled ringing continues; the sheriff looks, puzzled, \n               at the phone. Now the ringing stops and we hear a muffled \n               voice next door:\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Worms.\n\n               The sheriff replaces the phone, leans back again, adjusts \n               his hat, and is about to go back to sleep when we hear the \n               front door open.\n\n               The sheriff looks and reacts with genuine, if momentary, \n               fear.\n\n               He manages to compose himself and give the intruder a smile:\n\n                                     SHERIFF WYNER\n                         Afternoon, Miz Munson.\n\n               Entering is an elderly black woman in a floral print dress \n               and fruited bonnet.\n\n                                     MRS.

MUNSON HOUSE - DAY\n\n               With a neatly tended garden. It is the last house on a street \n               of other similarly modest but well maintained homes; beyond \n               it the street disappears down a bluff. The empty space beyond \n               suggests a wide river, and indeed we can see the top of an \n               anchored, gaudily painted paddle-boat poking over the rise. \n               The paddle-boat is apparently anchored at the near bank of \n               the river.\n\n               Mrs. Munson is entering by the gate. She stops in the garden \n               and stoops to pull a tiny weed marring the otherwise perfect \n               row of flowers.\n\n               I/E. MUNSON HOUSE - FOYER - DAY\n\n               Mrs. Munson lets herself in.

MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Above the fireplace is an oil portrait of a serious-looking \n               black man of late middle-age with a neatly groomed mustache \n               starting to gray. A couple of candles sit on the mantel below \n               the portrait, giving it the semblance of a shrine.\n\n               Mrs. Munson enters and lights the candles.\n\n                                     MRS.

As Mrs. Munson looks around the room, \n               vaguely towards the ceiling, sensing a negative aura, the \n               cat arches its back and hisses.\n\n               At this moment the doorbell rings.\n\n                                     MRS.

FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY\n\n               POV\n\n               We are looking out from inside a football helmet; we hear \n               the super-present breathing of the helmet's occupant. Just \n               over the breathing we can hear the muffled shouting of a \n               snap count.\n\n               We are in a crouch position looking downfield. At the call \n               of \"Hike!\" we and everyone on the field spring into action.\n\n               We sprint downfield, the breathing becoming even louder. A \n               very big person downfield is sprinting toward us.\n\n               After several yards, still on the move, we PAN quickly around \n               to look back for the quarterback. Barely visible among \n               converging bodies, he is releasing the football toward someone \n               else.\n\n               Easing up on the run we PAN BACK around to look downfield \n               just as the oncoming defender is upon us and -- CRUNCH -- \n               slams into us. A STROBING PAN leaves us looking up at the \n               sky. Our loud breathing has stopped.\n\n               After a long beat the breathing resumes with a raggedy labored \n               inhale. It continues irregularly. Another helmeted player \n               appears above us to peer down into our helmet. He extends a \n               hand to help us up.\n\n               HUDDLE\n\n               We are looking back and forth around the circle at our \n               gathered teammates.\n\n                                     QUARTERBACK\n                         Delta thirty-seven.

His mouthpiece clatters against ours and in horrific \n               CLOSE-UP he strains against us, his animal gurgles of effort \n               audible over our own ragged breath.\n\n               With a primal roar from the defenseman our POV tips back and \n               up, BOOMING DOWN to stop with a CRUNCH against the ground, \n               staring up. Once again our breathing has stopped.\n\n               After a beat a foot is planted on our helmet as a looming \n               running back steps on us in his charge downfield. He is \n               pursued by defenders some of whom leap over us and some of \n               whom by the sound of it step on various body parts.\n\n               HUDDLE\n\n               The same back-and-forth PAN.\n\n                                     QUARTERBACK\n                         Okay, Epsilon twenty-two!

MINI-MALL / HI-HO DONUT - DAY\n\n               HIGH ANGLE\n\n               It is a typical sunbaked concrete strip mall with a Seven-\n               Eleven, a launderette, and a Hi-Ho Donut. The Hi-Ho Donut \n               sign shows a pink donut with sprinkles and says in much \n               smaller lettering: And Croissants.\n\n               A beat-up Impala pulls into the lot, pulsing hip-hop music. \n               After a long rumbling idle the ignition is killed. Both front \n               doors open. Two BLACK KIDS get out and look around with a \n               manner that is if anything too casual.\n\n               INT. HI-HO DONUT - DAY\n\n               There is faint muzak and loud air-conditioner hum. Glass \n               cases display donuts identified as GLAZED, JELLY, and FANCIES. \n               Fancies ooze yellow goo. The jelly on the jelly donuts is \n               developing a crust of age. The glazed also look moth-eaten.\n\n               One customer, a disheveled older man, sits at one of the \n               little formica tables staring into a coffee cup. Next to the \n               coffee is a brown paper bag from which a straw protrudes.\n\n               Behind the counter is a middle-aged VIETNAMESE WOMAN in a \n               neat white blouse.\n\n               The two youths enter pulling out enormous handguns from \n               underneath their windbreakers.\n\n                                     YOUTH #1\n                         All right Dragon Lady, give us all \n                         the fuckin' money!\n\n               The woman stares blankly.\n\n                                     YOUTH #1\n                         We want that donut money!\n\n                                     VIETNAMESE WOMAN\n                         Yao gin nyap!\n\n               A man appears from the kitchen in back. He is a middle-aged \n               Vietnamese gentleman in a crisply pressed khaki leisure suit. \n               An ascot is knotted at his neck. He wears aviator eyeglasses. \n               In his mouth smolders a half-burned-down filterless cigarette. \n               This, we shall learn later, is THE GENERAL.\n\n                                     YOUTH #2\n                         Okay papa-san, we want that donut \n                         money.\n\n                                     YOUTH #1\n                         And we ain't fuckin' around, Mr. Hi-\n                         Ho.\n\n                                     VIETNAMESE WOMAN\n                         Hi-Ho.\n\n               The two youths look at her briefly.

That's how it works, \n                         see?\n\n               The General stares at him. As with his wife, none of it seems \n               to register; unlike his wife, he seems unperturbed.\n\n                                     YOUTH #1\n                         Give us the money!\n\n               He is pointing the gun directly at the General's head.\n\n                                     YOUTH #1\n                         ...You got three fuckin' seconds. \n                         You understand one-two-three?

Three sec\u0096- huh!\n\n               The General has swung his fist up to hook two fingers inside \n               the youth's nostrils. His gun clatters to the floor. The \n               fingers are way, way up his nose. Only one knuckle shows on \n               each finger.\n\n               The youth is staring cross-eyed at his own nose.\n\n               His friend is also stupefied.\n\n                                     YOUTH #1\n                              (very nasal)\n                         His fingers are way the fuck up my \n                         nose.\n\n                                     YOUTH #2\n                         GET...

HI-HO DONUT - DAY\n\n               HIGH ANGLE\n\n               The car is still pulsing hip-hop music.

HI-HO DONUT - DAY\n\n               The General now has the first youth's face pressed into the \n               Fancies from behind. Without disturbing his smoking, the \n               General repeatedly kicks the youth in the ass.\n\n               His wife, muttering irritably in Vietnamese, is wheeling a \n               water bucket and mop to where the floor is covered with \n               coffee.\n\n               INT. CHURCH - DAY\n\n               At the CUT many voices are swelling in a song of worship. It \n               is a black Baptist church, and the music has great energy.\n\n               The white-robed choir finishes singing; a preacher takes the \n               podium.\n\n                                     PREACHER\n                         I know you all remember that when \n                         Moses came down the mountain, carrying \n                         the word a God, come down that Sinai \n                         peak, he caught those Israelites red-\n                         handed.

He lands catlike in the living \n               room, glides to the blubbering Lump, grabs one shoulder firmly \n               with one hand, and with the other slaps him sharply, once \n               forehand, once backhand.\n\n               Lump stares at him, shocked, his blubbering cut short.\n\n               More noise is coming from the stairs:\n\n                                     PANCAKE\n                         ...why, it's nothing to make a fuss \n                         about.

He \n               is clutching one hand with the other.\n\n                                     PANCAKE\n                         ...No, no.

We hear \n               the hiss of the cat.\n\n               The men are bundling Pancake into the hearse.

MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR - NIGHT\n\n               PULLING HIM UP THE STAIRS\n\n               Slowly, slowly, Gawain mounts the cellar stairs. Behind him, \n               gathered in a semi-circle and looking up from the foot of \n               the stairs, the other men wait.\n\n               As he plants one plodding foot in front of the other Gawain \n               raises the gun, slides back its primer to make sure there is \n               a round in the chamber, and then slides it shut as he reaches \n               the door.\n\n               INT. MUNSON - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               In the foreground Mrs. Munson sits knitting, humming an old \n               temperance tune. In the background the cellar door swings \n               open. Marva Munson doesn't notice; her knitting needles \n               continue their rhythmic clack.\n\n               We PULL Gawain, gun at the ready, as he takes slow, cautious \n               steps across the floor.\n\n               We INTERCUT his POV of the back of the old lady's head, bowed \n               over her knitting.\n\n               As Gawain passes the sofa he picks up a cushion and buries \n               in it his hand holding the gun.\n\n               He looks back up at the old lady. But now, still cautiously \n               approaching, he cocks his head, his expression bemused.\n\n               HIS POV\n\n               nearing the old lady is now different somehow. The perspective \n               is somewhat lower; the humming woman sounds not quite the \n               same; the rocking chair and the room itself are subtly \n               different.\n\n               WHEN WE CUT BACK TO GAWAIN\n\n               he is a runty, TEN-YEAR-OLD CHILD walking slowly across the \n               floor; he is cradling not a gun in a pillow but a squirming \n               little puppy dog.\n\n               The dog yips; the woman turns to look at us. It is not Mrs. \n               Munson, but another black woman of about the same age.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         What you got there, Gawain?\n\n                                     CHILD GAWAIN\n                         Why -- nothin', mama.\n\n                                     MAMA\n                         Nothin' my ass!

We hear rustling from the bed.\n\n               Hands reach INTO FRAME and hesitate, finding the glass empty \n               of water and precariously perched.\n\n                                     MRS. MUNSON (O.S.)\n                         Hmm.\n\n               The hands tip the glass and take the teeth. We hear \n               complicated oral noises.\n\n               EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - DAY\n\n               The door opens away to reveal the morning paper lying on the \n               stoop. Mrs. Munson leans INTO FRAME to pick it up and we \n               ADJUST as she straightens to have a look:\n\n               The headline says: $2.6 MILLION DISAPPEARS FROM LADY LUCK \n               CASINO. The subhead: POLICE BAFFLED.\n\n                                     MRS. MUNSON\n                         Mm-hm.\n\n               INT.

SAUCIER, MISSISSIPPI - DAY\n\n               Mrs. Munson is walking home. It is a beautiful spring day.\n\n               From far off, wafting toward us on the breeze, we can hear \n               the church chorus singing. Mrs. Munson joins in. She has a \n               strong voice:\n\n                                     MRS. MUNSON\n                         Leaning, Leaning, Safe and secure \n                         from all harm.

We hear the toot! of an \n               approaching scow.\n\n               The cat reaches the middle of the bridge. He sticks his head \n               through the bars of the railing.\n\n               When we CUT CLOSE on the cat as he looks down at the water, \n               we see that he holds in his mouth a human finger.\n\n               As the scow passes underneath, the cat opens its mouth and \n               lets the finger drop.\n\n               The finger falls away and is barely visible by the time it \n               hits the scow.\n\n               The cat looks up INTO THE LENS, and blinks. Its sideways \n               irises adjust.\n\n               The scow is gliding away. With the low mournful toot of its \n               horn we tilt up the river to the great garbage island where \n               scavenger birds pick through the trash.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nLadykillers, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0William Rose\u00a0\u00a0Joel Coen\u00a0\u00a0Ethan Coen\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Crime\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:28:56.547212"}
