You remember how it was \n                         when you were starting out.\n\n               The henchman yanks on the rope.

With this hand, there's no way he can lose. He \n               places his daddy's pocket watch on top of the pile.

The car pulls up and SHERIFF WARREN PIKE \n               steps out.

As Winston struggles back to his feet, a stiletto \n               flashes and he lunges for the sheriff, slashing his cheek. \n               The deputies grab Winston from behind, holding him by both \n               arms. The long knife clatters to ground. Pike touches his \n               face, examining the blood on his fingers.\n\n<b>                                     PIKE\n</b>                         You just committed suicide, boy.\n\n<b>               INT.

Two shooter shacks sit at diagonal corners of the yard. \n               In each shack, two trusties with rifles keep vigilant watch \n               over the camp. SGT.

It appears \n               that the Abernathys are leaving town. In the back seat, Mae \n               Rose cradles her baby. Her mother sits next to her. Dillard \n               steps out into the yard to confer with the Superintendent, \n               then turns to address the inmates.\n\n<b>                                     DILLARD\n</b>                         Alright, listen up!

Scowling, he moves a little further down the line, \n               scrutinizing the features of each man. He pauses in front of \n               Claude, holds up the baby. Maybe. Abernathy stops in front \n               Goldmouth. Holds up the baby. The possibility makes him \n               shudder. He moves on to Can't Get Right.

Disgusted, \n               confused and thoroughly fed up, Abernathy jams the revolver \n               into his belt and climbs into the car. As he guns the engine, \n               Mae Rose gazes out the back window, smiling one last time at \n               the father of her baby.

Down at the gunline, \n               Dillard takes his cut from inmates lined up for their turn \n               in the tonk. A FIVE-PIECE PRISON BAND is playing the blues. \n               Nearby, Willie is dispensing Ray's moonshine from a bunkhouse \n               window. He raises a jar in a toast.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIE\n</b>                         To Superintendent Abernathy.

It's a good thing the old \n               man is blind because he wouldn't want to see how far his \n               flock has strayed.

Nearby, Jangle Leg dances \n               intimately with a YOUNG WOMAN.\n\n               Up on the porch, Ray refreshes Biscuit's drink. Biscuit has \n               been crying and it shows.

He breaks into a run. \n               Dillard nods to Hoppin' Bob who raises his rifle and draws a \n               bead. But he can't pull the trigger. He lowers his gun.\n\n               Shots ring out from the shooter shacks.

Jangle Leg pushes \n               his way through the crowd and crosses the gunline without \n               hesitation. Dillard indicates for the shooters to hold their \n               fire. They train their rifles on Jangle Leg as he strides \n               toward his fallen companion. Jangle Leg gently lifts Biscuit's \n               lifeless body into his big arms and somberly carries him \n               back toward the camp.

Wilkins' 1973 Lincoln \n               Continental convertible lurches down the drive with Claude \n               at the wheel.

All around him are the sights, sounds and \n               smells of the free world. A woman rushes into the arms of a \n               man as he climbs off a bus. Across the street is Grandma \n               Dodi's Pork Rib Joint where Cookie never made it to the peach \n               cobbler. A young brother with a boom box walks by. In the \n               street, kids crowd around the back of an ice cream truck. \n               Then Claude catches his reflection in the car window and \n               frowns.

Warren Pike's hair has gone grey and he's \n               40 years older, but there's no mistaking the former sheriff \n               of Natchez County.
