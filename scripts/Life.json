PRISON CEMETERY -- DAY\n\n               A handful of people are gathered in an open field under a \n               fierce Mississippi sun. A couple of young inmates, JAKE and \n               LEON, lean on their shovels. They are waiting to bury two \n               identical CASKETS with inmate numbers stenciled on the \n               pinewood lids.\n\n               A GUARD rests the butt of his rifle on the ground and takes \n               a long, healthy pull from his canteen. He offers it to the \n               PRISON CHAPLAIN, who is much obliged. SUPERINTENDENT BILL \n               BURKE, a 40-year-old black man, glances at his watch and \n               loosens his tie. Sure is hot.\n\n               MARY HUMPHRIES, an elderly white woman in a nurse's uniform, \n               stands behind WILLIE LONG, an ancient inmate sleeping \n               peacefully in a wheelchair. She readjusts an umbrella to \n               shield the old black man from the blistering sun.\n\n               Burke dabs his forehead with a handkerchief. He gives the \n               nod to the chaplain, who steps forward and cracks his bible. \n               The men remove their hats.\n\n                                     CHAPLAIN\n                         In accordance with the regulations \n                         of the State of Mississippi, we gather \n                         here today to lay to rest the remains \n                         of inmates R. Gibson, number 4316, \n                         and C. Banks, number 4317. Ashes to \n                         ashes, dust to dust.

He takes a swig and \n               stashes the bottle in his belt. He adjusts his tie, polishes \n               his shoes on the back of his pants and raps on the door.\n\n               INT. SPANKY'S -- NIGHT\n\n               The speakeasy is jumping, jammed with people. Up on stage a \n               hot JAZZ BAND is playing backup for a seductive CHANTEUSE. \n               Well-heeled PATRONS enter through doors near the stage.\n\n               In the back, at the end of a long hallway, a BOUNCER cracks \n               open the door and Ray squeezes inside.\n\n                                     BOUNCER\n                         Oh, no, Ray.

Ray shakes his \n               head in wonderment at her departing form. The BARKEEP steps \n               up as Ray pulls out his bottle.\n\n                                     BARKEEP\n                         You can't drink that in here, Ray.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I sure can't drink that watered-down \n                         swill you're serving.

Shaking \n               his head, the barkeep moves on to a paying customer. Ray's \n               eyes follow a bottle of French Champagne as it is delivered \n               to a nearby table.\n\n               Here sits the straight-laced CLAUDE BANKS with his girlfriend, \n               DAISY.

MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Glancing around, Ray spots Claude's feet under the stall \n               door. He steps up to the sink, washes his hands and takes a \n               towel from the ATTENDANT. Scanning the assortment of grooming \n               products, he selects a bottle of cologne and takes a sniff.\n\n                                     RAY\n                              (displeased)\n                         You have any of that French stuff?\n\n               As the attendent bends down to retrieve a bottle of the good \n               stuff, Ray palms a coin from the tip basket.\n\n                                     ATTENDENT\n                         Here you go.\n\n               Ray offers the quarter, a gesture of uncommon generosity.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Keep the change.\n\n                                     ATTENDENT\n                         Why, thank you, sir!\n\n               Ray pats the cologne on his face. A toilet flushes and Claude \n               steps over to the sink. Ray catches his eye in the mirror.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Don't I know you?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I don't think so.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Sure I do.

Good old Monroe...\n\n               Ray throws his arms around Claude, deftly snatching his \n               wallet.

But he didn't last long enough \n                         to teach you the meaning of the word \n                         respect so I guess I'm gonna have to \n                         school you myself.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to \n                         get by here. You remember how it was \n                         when you were starting out.\n\n               The henchman yanks on the rope. Claude emerges from the hole, \n               gasping for breath.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I was supposed to wear this suit on \n                         Monday!\n\n               The henchman releases the rope, sending Claude back into the \n               water. Ray reaches into his jacket. Bullethead pulls a gun \n               and presses it into Ray's temple. Ray gives him a look and \n               cautiously pulls out his bottle.\n\n                                     SPANKY\n                         What's that, some of your bathtub \n                         brew?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.\n\n               Ray tosses him the bottle. Spanky uncorks, sniffs, samples \n               the goods. He's impressed.\n\n                                     SPANKY\n                         Where'd you get this?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Comes up the Mississippi. I can get \n                         more. A lot more. I was thinking \n                         about going into business for myself, \n                         but under the circumstances, I'd be \n                         willing to take on a partner.\n\n               Once again, the henchman yanks on the rope and Claude comes \n               up sucking air desperately. He releases the rope, submerging \n               Claude for a third time.\n\n                                     SPANKY\n                         I'm interested.

I could be back in two, three \n                         days tops if I had somebody to share \n                         the driving.\n\n               Spanky considers the terms. Can he afford to trust Ray? Can \n               he afford not to?\n\n                                     SPANKY\n                         If you fuck me on this one, I'll \n                         spare no expense.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Understood.\n\n                                     SPANKY\n                         Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. \n                         Pick your man and get going.\n\n               Ray glances around. The pulley rope is still twitching in \n               the water.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I'll take the little choirboy, if \n                         you don't mind.\n\n                                     SPANKY\n                         If I was you, I'd want somebody who \n                         can handle himself in a tight spot.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I just want somebody who won't put a \n                         bullet in my back once the truck is \n                         full.\n\n               Spanky sees Ray's point. He nods to the henchman, who hoists \n               Claude's limp body out of the water and onto the cement. \n               Spanky plants a foot on Claude's chest and applies pressure. \n               A geyser of Harlem River water shoots from Claude's mouth as \n               he sputters back to life.\n\n                                     SPANKY\n                         For your sake, I hope you can drive. \n                         Somebody give him some dry clothes.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE SPINNING WHEEL OF A TRUCK\n\n               The CAMERA MOVES UP the side of the old Ford truck to find \n               Claude sitting pensively in the passenger seat.\n\n               INT.

That's what you got to \n                         have in that business.

Claude becomes aware of a soft, young female hand on \n               his shoulder.\n\n                                     SYLVIA\n                         I've never seen you in here before.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                              (staring at the hand)\n                         That's because I've never been here \n                         before.\n\n                                     SYLVIA\n                         I'm Sylvia. What's your name?\n\n               Against his better judgement, Claude's gaze follows the long, \n               slender arm up past a bare shoulder and settles on SYLVIA'S \n               angelic face. He is struck dumb.\n\n                                     SYLVIA\n                         Can't you remember your own name?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I know it begins with a \"C\"...\n\n                                     SYLVIA\n                         Well, Mr. \"C\", how about buying a \n                         girl a drink?\n                              (to the bartender)\n                         Two bourbons.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an \n                         eye on my friend.\n\n                                     SYLVIA\n                         He looks like he can take care of \n                         himself.\n\n               The drinks arrive. She places a shot glass in Claude's \n               reluctant hand. She winks provocatively and slowly pours the \n               whiskey down her throat. Instinctively, Claude tosses back \n               his shot.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's \n                         never happened before.\n\n                                     SYLVIA\n                         You're cute. You have any money, \n                         Claude?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Ten dollars. But I need it to get \n                         home.\n\n                                     SYLVIA\n                         Why would you want to go home? It's \n                         so early.\n\n               The bartender refills their glasses.\n\n               BACK AT THE POKER TABLE\n\n               Winston considers his cards, hardly looking up as a WAITRESS \n               lays down a cocktail napkin and sets a drink down on top of \n               it. He glances at Ray, who casually considers his cards.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I'll take two.\n\n               The dealer tosses Ray a couple of cards.\n\n               INSERT -- Ray fans his cards to reveal a full house.\n\n               After considering the other players at the table, Ray pushes \n               what's left of his money into the center of the table. The \n               three other PLAYERS fold with disgust. Winston squints long \n               and hard at Ray, then pushes everything he has into the center \n               of the table.\n\n                                     WINSTON\n                         I'll see that...\n\n               Winston reaches into his jacket and throws down some more \n               money on the pile.\n\n                                     WINSTON\n                         And while we're at it, let's sweeten \n                         the pot.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Looks like my sugar bowl's empty, \n                         Mr. Hancock.\n\n                                     WINSTON\n                              (reaching for the pot)\n                         That's just too damn bad, ain't it?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Now, hang on, slick. I ain't through \n                         with you yet.\n\n               Ray checks his cards again. He looks at the pot, it's a lot \n               of money. With this hand, there's no way he can lose. He \n               places his daddy's pocket watch on top of the pile. Winston \n               checks the time piece.\n\n                                     WINSTON\n                         That'll cover it.\n\n               Ray lays down his hand.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Full boat, ladies doing the paddling.\n\n                                     WINSTON\n                         Four threes.\n\n               Ray sits back, stunned. Winston rakes in his winnings. The \n               game is over for the night. The three other players head to \n               the bar.\n\n                                     WINSTON\n                         Don't take it too hard, New York. \n                         Have a round on me.\n\n               Winston tosses a silver dollar to Ray, who snatches it out \n               of the air. Winston drops his hat on his head and moves \n               through the crowd and out the door.\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n                         Can I get you something?\n\n               Ray shakes his head. Carefully, she begins to clear the table. \n               Suddenly, he grabs her wrist. Winston's glass tips over. Ray \n               flips over the cocktail napkin to reveal an extra pile of \n               cards.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Looks like he had a whole lot of \n                         nothing in his hand until you came \n                         along.\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n                              (wrenching free)\n                         You're hurting my arm.\n\n               EXT. JUKE JOINT -- NIGHT\n\n               Ray dashes into the street, glancing both ways. No sign of \n               Winston. Damn.\n\n               EXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT\n\n               Winston produces Ray's pocket watch and pops it open. A smile \n               crosses his face as the mechanical tune plays.\n\n               A sheriff's sedan rounds a corner, illuminating Winston in \n               its headlights. The car pulls up and SHERIFF WARREN PIKE \n               steps out. Distinguished by a casual cruelness, he's a young \n               white man who loves his uniform.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         If it isn't Winston Hancock.\n\n               Winston tries to move past Pike, but the sheriff blocks his \n               path with a night stick. As Winston backs off, another squad \n               car pulls up behind him. TWO DEPUTIES step from the car, \n               guns drawn.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         I thought we agreed that you were \n                         gonna leave town.\n\n                                     WINSTON\n                         I tried to leave, Sheriff Pike. But \n                         your wife begged me to stay.\n\n               Pike slams Winston with his club, sending the black man to \n               his knees. As Winston struggles back to his feet, a stiletto \n               flashes and he lunges for the sheriff, slashing his cheek. \n               The deputies grab Winston from behind, holding him by both \n               arms. The long knife clatters to ground. Pike touches his \n               face, examining the blood on his fingers.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         You just committed suicide, boy.\n\n               INT. BORDELLO HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n\n               Ray walks slowly down the hallway to Room 13. He is about to \n               knock when he hears the sound of lovemaking from within.\n\n               INT. SYLVIA'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Ray opens the door and peeks in. Sylvia's on top and in \n               charge. Claude is concentrating real hard. Ray smiles to \n               himself and closes the door.\n\n               INT. JUKE JOINT -- NIGHT\n\n               Claude hitches up his suspenders as he comes down the stairs. \n               He finds Ray having a drink at the now-empty bar.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Hey, Ray.

See, I met this \n                         girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing \n                         girl. Her name's Sylvia.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         That jelly you were talking to right \n                         here?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs \n                         this operation, and they ain't got \n                         the money for it. Their church took \n                         up a collection but they were still \n                         short...\n\n                                     RAY\n                         So you made a generous contribution.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         What can I say?

BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT\n\n               Ray and Claude head down the alley.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         You sure the truck's this way?\n                              (looking over his \n                              shoulder)\n                         I swear it was back that way.\n\n               Suddenly, the bloodied figure of Winston Hancock lurches \n               from the shadows and grabs Claude by the lapels. Claude is \n               too scared to scream, staggering backward. But the man's \n               grip loosens and he slips to the ground.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                              (croaking)\n                         Ray... Yo, Ray...!\n\n               Ray turns back to find Claude trembling with fear and covered \n               in blood. He just points down. Ray eyes widen. He kneels \n               down and turns Winston's body over.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I think he's hurt pretty bad.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         He's dead.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body \n                         before!\n\n               Much to Claude's horror, Ray starts rifling through Winston's \n               pockets.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         What do you think you're doing?!

There's no way around \n                         it, you're soft.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         What'd you say?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I said you're soft.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Don't call me that. You know I hate \n                         it when you call me that.\n\n               Ray gets in Claude's face and silently mouths the word -- \n               \"soft.\" Claude throws down his hoe and sinks his fist deep \n               into Ray's gut.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Damn, that felt good. I should have \n                         done that the first time I met you.\n\n               Ray touches the blood coming from his nose. Eyes blazing, he \n               tackles Claude, dragging him to the ground. The two men roll \n               around, trying to strangle each other.\n\n               Hoppin' Bob hustles down the hill and drags Ray off of Claude. \n               But Claude comes back for more. Hoppin' Bob finds himself in \n               the middle of the fray.\n\n               That's when the cavalry arrives. Two trusties use their rifles \n               to crack Ray and Claude over the backs of their heads, sending \n               them both down for the count.\n\n               Hoppin' Bob empties his canteen over their faces. They sputter \n               back to consciousness.\n\n                                     HOPPIN' BOB\n                         Now you girls set aside your \n                         differences and get back to work or \n                         I'll see to it --\n\n                                     RAY\n                         -- we'll spend a night in the hole. \n                         We heard this shit before.\n\n               Ray and Claude stagger to their feet and pick up their tools. \n               Hoppin' Bob and the trusties head back up the hill. Ray starts \n               to chuckle.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         What the fuck are you laughing about?\n\n               Ray opens his palm to reveal TWO PEBBLES. Claude regards Ray \n               with new-found respect.\n\n               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- SUNDOWN\n\n               One by one, the prisoners of Camp 8 climb into the mule carts \n               under the watchful eye of Hoppin' Bob. As each man passes, \n               he removes a pebble from his pocket. The last one in is \n               Willie. Hoppin' Bob's pocket is now empty.\n\n                                     HOPPIN' BOB\n                         All in, boss!\n\n                                     DILLARD\n                         Move it out.\n\n                                     HOPPIN' BOB\n                         Movin' it out, boss.\n\n               Dillard spurs his horse, escorting the mule carts back to \n               camp.\n\n               EXT. FIELD -- SUNDOWN\n\n               As the carts fade into the distance, Ray and Claude pop up \n               from a roadside ditch and take off for a grove of trees in \n               the opposite direction.\n\n               EXT. WOODS -- SUNDOWN\n\n               Running for all they're worth, Ray and Claude crash through \n               the bramble. Claude trips over a root and sprawls face first \n               in the bushes. Ray turns around and helps him to his feet. \n               Claude is still laughing giddily. He throws his arms around \n               Ray.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         You did it, man! You got us out! \n                         Next stop, New York City!\n\n                                     RAY\n                         New York's a long way's off. Let's \n                         just keep moving, okay?\n\n               As Ray and Claude disappear into the woods...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n               Radio's pulling in some jazz music out of New Orleans. \n               Prisoners hit their bunks as the floorwalker does the nightly \n               head count. He stops at Claude and Ray's empty bunks, glancing \n               around, puzzled.\n\n               EXT. DILLARD'S PORCH -- NIGHT\n\n               Dillard smokes a cigarette on the swing. His wife steps out \n               with a fresh bourbon and ice. Suddenly, SIRENS start to wail \n               and emergency floodlights blaze to life at Camp 8.\n\n               EXT. FIELD -- NIGHT\n\n               Hounds scramble down from the back of a truck and gather \n               around the DOG BOY. He holds out a handful of soiled laundry \n               and a dozen snouts sniff it thoroughly.\n\n               Nearby, Dillard gathers a DOZEN MEN with rifles and \n               flashlights into a posse. He puts a cigarette in his mouth. \n               Hoppin' Bob lights it for him.\n\n               EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT\n\n               Trees rise ominously around Ray and Claude as they push \n               through dense underbrush.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I know these trees all look the same, \n                         but I'm getting an awful familiar \n                         vibration from this one right here. \n                         You sure you know where we're going?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Absolutely. The map is very clear.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Let me take a look at that map.\n\n               Claude considers it from various angles.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         You call this a map? What was Cookie \n                         smoking when he drew this?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Cookie didn't draw it. I did.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         You drew this?!\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't \n                         have a map.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         That gripes my soul, man. We're out \n                         here in the middle of nowhere. There \n                         is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't \n                         tell me you don't know where we're \n                         going!\n\n               Ray shrugs and presses on. Dumbfounded, Claude considers the \n               map again, then tears it to shreds. The braying of hounds \n               echoes through the trees.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Hey, wait up!\n\n               EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT\n\n               Ray and Claude race through the underbrush.\n\n               EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT\n\n               Dillard and his men follow the dogs through the woods, hot \n               on the scent.\n\n               EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT\n\n               Ray and Claude race up to a chain-link fence. On the other \n               side, an old Ford is parked on a dirt road. Hearing the posse \n               closing in behind them, Ray and Claude fling themselves onto \n               the fence.\n\n               EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT\n\n               The posse is gaining ground. Dillard takes two men off to \n               the left, sending the rest of the men straight ahead.\n\n               EXT. THE WOODS -- NIGHT\n\n               Claude clears the fence first and scrambles for the old Ford. \n               Ray's shirt snags on a piece of wire as he drops down from \n               the fence. Stuck, he dangles helplessly a few feet off the \n               ground.\n\n               INT. FORD -- NIGHT\n\n               Claude yanks open the door and jumps behind the wheel. TWO \n               WHITE TEENAGERS bolt up in the backseat where they were \n               necking. After a beat -- group scream. The half-dressed \n               teenagers dive from the car and scramble off down the road. \n               Claude twists the key in the ignition and the engine roars \n               to life.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Come on, Ray, time to go!\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I'm stuck!\n\n               Claude sees Ray caught up on the fence, then hears the sounds \n               of the approaching posse. If he floored it right now, he \n               might make it. But he can't just leave Ray hanging there.\n\n               EXT. FENCE -- NIGHT\n\n               Claude runs up and grabs Ray's legs, pulling for all he's \n               worth. The shirt rips free, sending Ray and Claude tumbling \n               to the ground. They leap to their feet and turn toward the \n               car -- running smack into the barrel of Dillard's shotgun.\n\n               EXT. SUPERINTENDENT'S MANSION -- DAY\n\n               An OLD BLACK PRISONER delivers a frosty mint julep to \n               SUPERINTENDENT ABERNATHY who rocks slowly in his chair. At \n               his feet, his 10-year-old daughter MAE ROSE is playing jacks. \n               Her long blonde hair makes her look like a little angel.\n\n                                     MAE ROSE\n                         Look, daddy. They caught those two \n                         men who escaped last night.\n\n               Mae Rose is pointing down the drive, where Dillard and a \n               couple of trusties march Ray and Claude toward the house.\n\n                                     ABERNATHY\n                         They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're \n                         convicts. And nigger convicts to \n                         boot. Can you say nigger?\n\n                                     MAE ROSE\n                         Nagger?\n\n                                     ABERNATHY\n                         No, nigger.\n\n                                     MAE ROSE\n                         Nigger.\n\n                                     ABERNATHY\n                         That's my girl.\n\n               Bound by leg irons and handcuffs, Ray and Claude are deposited \n               at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n                                     DILLARD\n                         Here they are, Superintendent. We \n                         tracked 'em all the way to the \n                         Tallahachie.\n\n                                     ABERNATHY\n                         That's quite a ways. I'm glad you \n                         New York boys could see some of our \n                         lovely countryside while you're down \n                         here. What do you say, Mae Rose? How \n                         should we teach these two a lesson?\n\n               Mae Rose considers their faces. Ray and Claude look like \n               they've been to hell and back.\n\n                                     MAE ROSE\n                         A night in the hole?\n\n                                     ABERNATHY\n                         Better make it a week.\n\n               Dillard nods and turns Ray and Claude around. As they march \n               back down the drive, Abernathy takes sip of his mint julep \n               and affectionately pats Mae Rose on the head.\n\n               EXT. CAMP 8 -- DAY\n\n               The incorrigibles of Camp 8 gather at the gun line, watching \n               silently as Dillard and a couple of trusties march Ray and \n               Claude toward the hole.\n\n               EXT. THE HOLE -- DAY\n\n               The trusties shove them each into a small, dank cell and \n               slam the doors behind them. Dillard secures both doors with \n               an iron bar.\n\n                                     DILLARD\n                         See you in a week, boys.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               INT.

It's a small, \n               uncomfortable space, not even big enough to lie down. Just a \n               tin bucket for a toilet.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Don't mention it.\n\n                                     RAY\n                              (off)\n                         Hell, you'd probably be half way to \n                         New York by now...\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I'm serious, man.

Willie tosses his money on the \n               table.\n\n                                     POKER FACE\n                         Now that's what I call a bet.\n\n                                     GOLDMOUTH\n                         It's a mighty long shot, Willie. \n                         Nobody ever made it a week in the \n                         hole.\n\n                                     JANGLE LEG\n                         Not in August, anyway.\n\n               But Willie leaves the money where it is.\n\n                                     POKER FACE\n                         Who else has some guts around here?\n\n               Poker Face makes notations as the betting resumes.\n\n               EXT. FIELD -- DAY\n\n               Work goes on as usual for the prisoners of Camp 8. Trusties \n               keep their eyes peeled for slackers.\n\n               EXT. THE HOLE -- DAY\n\n               The brick shacks bake in the noonday sun.\n\n               EXT.

THE HOLE -- DAY\n\n               Superintendent Abernathy strides up and gives the nod to \n               Dillard, who unlocks the doors. Huddled in their respective \n               cells, Ray and Claude shrink from the bright sunlight. Then, \n               slowly and painfully, they rise to their feet.\n\n               In the background, the incorrigibles gather at the gun line \n               as word spreads that the fellows are still alive. Abernathy \n               glances at the crowd with annoyance.\n\n                                     ABERNATHY\n                         I don't think these boys have learned \n                         their lesson.

When I give an order, you \n                         jump to it, or I'll kick you and \n                         that first-cousin you call a wife \n                         outta that pretty little house so \n                         fast it'll make your pin-head spin. \n                         You got that?\n\n                                     DILLARD\n                         Yes, sir.\n\n               Dillard slams the doors on Ray and Claude and clamps shut \n               the padlocks. Abernathy smiles at the incorrigibles, who \n               regard him with undisguised hatred.\n\n               AT THE GUN LINE\n\n               A somber Poker Face offers Willie a wad of bills.\n\n                                     POKER FACE\n                         Well, they made it a week.

CLAUDE'S CELL -- NIGHT\n\n               A slot at the bottom of the door opens. A tin plate of mush \n               slides through and the slot closes. Slumped in the corner, \n               Claude reaches for the food -- but a RAT beats him to it, \n               scampering out of the shadows and leaping onto the dish.\n\n               INT. RAY'S CELL -- NIGHT\n\n               A commotion and wild screams come from Claude's cell. Ray \n               leaps to his feet, shouting through the wall.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Claude? You alright?!\n\n               INT.

Goldmouth, Cookie, Poker Face, \n               Biscuit -- they don't exactly inspire confidence.\n\n                                     BLOCKER\n                         Nice looking squad.

BASEBALL FIELD -- DAY\n\n               The inmates of Camp 12 are in the field. Our boys from Camp \n               8 cheer for Cookie digging in at the plate. Ray taunts the \n               opposition from the third base line.\n\n               The PITCHER winds up and releases a fast ball. Cookie swings \n               and connects for a base hit up the middle.\n\n               IN THE STANDS\n\n               Mrs. Abernathy and Mrs. Dillard share a box of Cracker Jack.\n\n                                     MRS.

Look at the way she \n                         glows.\n\n               Mae Rose sits next to them. She is SIX MONTHS PREGNANT. She \n               removes her sunglasses and coyly bites a fingernail when she \n               spots Can't Get Right in the on-deck circle.\n\n               DOWN ON THE FIELD\n\n               Can't Get Right smiles shyly. Sensing trouble, Claude ushers \n               Can't Get Right toward the plate, massaging his shoulders.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         You're my boy, just keep what little \n                         mind you have focused on the game. \n                         If you hit that ball the way I know \n                         you can, you might just be our ticket \n                         off this farm.\n\n               Can't Get Right digs in. Claude returns to the sidelines and \n               appeals to the gods. The pitcher winds up and releases a \n               fast ball. Can't Get Right connects with that familiar CRACK! \n               Blocker stands up and watches the ball clear the fence and \n               just keep going.\n\n               With his team cheering him on, Can't Get Right trots around \n               the bases. But he's still looking at Mae Rose.\n\n               EXT. CAMP 8 YARD (LATER) -- DAY\n\n               Cookie slowly turns the pig on a spit over an open fire.

As always, trusty \n               guards keep an eye on things.\n\n               Off to the side, Blocker is laughing with Ray and Claude. He \n               takes a hit off Ray's bottle of shine.

MAE ROSE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Superintendent Abernathy paces anxiously in front of a white \n               curtain surrounding Mae Rose's bed. Suddenly, Mrs Abernathy \n               staggers out from behind the curtain with a stricken look on \n               her face. She tries to speak, but words fail her. Her legs \n               go wobbly and she faints dead away.\n\n                                     ABERNATHY\n                         Uh, doctor...\n\n               The DOCTOR steps from behind the curtain, drawing it behind \n               him.

Where's my new \n                         grandson?\n\n               The NURSE turns around, cradling the baby in her arms. \n               Abernathy gently pulls back the soft blanket. His eyes widen \n               with horror upon discovering that the newest member of the \n               Abernathy family is black.\n\n               EXT.

CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY\n\n               Abernathy drives his sedan up to the bunkhouse. All of his \n               worldly possessions are strapped to the roof. It appears \n               that the Abernathys are leaving town. In the back seat, Mae \n               Rose cradles her baby. Her mother sits next to her. Dillard \n               steps out into the yard to confer with the Superintendent, \n               then turns to address the inmates.\n\n                                     DILLARD\n                         Alright, listen up!

CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY\n\n               Abernathy holds his newborn grandson up next to Ray's face. \n               Hmm. Scowling, he moves a little further down the line, \n               scrutinizing the features of each man. He pauses in front of \n               Claude, holds up the baby. Maybe. Abernathy stops in front \n               Goldmouth. Holds up the baby. The possibility makes him \n               shudder. He moves on to Can't Get Right. His eyes narrow.\n\n                                     ABERNATHY\n                         I know it was somebody from this \n                         camp. I can feel it in my bones.\n\n               Disgusted, Abernathy hands the baby back to Mae Rose. Then \n               he turns, walks back to Can't Get Right and places a revolver \n               against his head.\n\n                                     ABERNATHY\n                         Do you know who the father of that \n                         little chocolated baby is?\n\n               Can't Get Right nods slowly. Abernathy smiles.\n\n                                     ABERNATHY\n                         Well, then, who is it?\n\n               Up and down the line, the men brace themselves for the worst. \n               Can't Get Right just grins. Enraged, Abernathy cocks the \n               revolver. That's when Ray steps forward.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         The baby's mine, boss.\n\n               Stunned, Abernathy lowers the gun and approaches Ray. Then \n               Claude steps forward.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         He's lying, boss. I'm the father of \n                         that baby.\n\n               Confused, Abernathy looks back and forth between the two \n               men. Then Willie steps forward.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Actually, it was me, boss.

Disgusted, \n               confused and thoroughly fed up, Abernathy jams the revolver \n               into his belt and climbs into the car. As he guns the engine, \n               Mae Rose gazes out the back window, smiling one last time at \n               the father of her baby. Can't Get Right smiles back.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.

Down at the gunline, \n               Dillard takes his cut from inmates lined up for their turn \n               in the tonk. A FIVE-PIECE PRISON BAND is playing the blues. \n               Nearby, Willie is dispensing Ray's moonshine from a bunkhouse \n               window. He raises a jar in a toast.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         To Superintendent Abernathy.

Claude grabs \n               Can't Get Right and shakes him.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         What I want to know is where? When? \n                         How?\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Wasting your breath, Claude. He ain't \n                         the type to kiss and tell.\n\n               Just then, Rev. Clay and his daughter emerge from the mess \n               hall and start across the yard. It's a good thing the old \n               man is blind because he wouldn't want to see how far his \n               flock has strayed. The Reverend inhales deeply as one of \n               Sylvia's girls passes nearby.\n\n                                     REV.

In the midst of the \n               dancers, Claude clings to Sylvia. Nearby, Jangle Leg dances \n               intimately with a YOUNG WOMAN.\n\n               Up on the porch, Ray refreshes Biscuit's drink. Biscuit has \n               been crying and it shows. The liquor probably isn't helping.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Don't take it so hard, Biscuit.

It ain't that.\n\n               He pulls some folded sheets of paper from his pocket, passes \n               them to Ray.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         These are free papers.\n\n                                     BISCUIT\n                              (devastated)\n                         What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I \n                         can't go home to my mama like this. \n                         I'll get the strap for sure.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. \n                         Your mama's gonna break down in tears \n                         when you show up on her doorstep.\n\n               Poker Face leans in.\n\n                                     POKER FACE\n                              (sotto)\n                         I'll give you three to one she gives \n                         him the strap.\n\n               Ray gives Poker face a shove, then turns back to Biscuit.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         It's 1945. It's a different world \n                         now.\n\n                                     BISCUIT\n                         Not for me, it ain't.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. \n                         This ain't no life for a man. Any \n                         one of these fellas would give their \n                         right arm to be in your shoes. I \n                         sure know I would.\n\n               Ray hands back the papers and heads off to dance with a PRETTY \n               YOUNG WOMAN lingering nearby. Left alone, Biscuit polishes \n               off his moonshine and checks his reflection in the bunkhouse \n               window.\n\n                                     BISCUIT\n                         No life on the inside, no life on \n                         the outside...\n\n               He crumples the discharge papers and drops them. Then he \n               steps down from the porch and walks calmly past the dancing \n               prisoners toward the gun line.\n\n               Ray lifts his head off his date's shoulder. Something about \n               the way Biscuit is walking suggests that he isn't going to \n               stop.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Hey, Biscuit...!\n\n               But it's too late. Biscuit crosses the gun line and keeps \n               walking, his eyes focused on the horizon.\n\n                                     TRUSTY\n                         Man over the line!\n\n               The band stops playing, the dancers grow still. Dillard turns \n               around and squints.\n\n                                     DILLARD\n                         Goddamnit, Biscuit, get back here!\n\n               But Biscuit isn't paying attention. He breaks into a run. \n               Dillard nods to Hoppin' Bob who raises his rifle and draws a \n               bead. But he can't pull the trigger. He lowers his gun.\n\n               Shots ring out from the shooter shacks. Biscuit reels from \n               the impact of the bullets and looks down sadly at the blood \n               spreading across his ring-arounds...\n\n               Prisoners silently gather at the gunline. Jangle Leg pushes \n               his way through the crowd and crosses the gunline without \n               hesitation. Dillard indicates for the shooters to hold their \n               fire. They train their rifles on Jangle Leg as he strides \n               toward his fallen companion. Jangle Leg gently lifts Biscuit's \n               lifeless body into his big arms and somberly carries him \n               back toward the camp. The CAMERA RISES HIGH OVERHEAD as the \n               prisoners make way for Jangle Leg to cross back over the \n               gunline.\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE -- DAY\n\n               A dark mood hangs over the men. Jangle Leg sits stoically as \n               Radio fiddles with his receiver. Nearby, Poker Face and Ray \n               play a listless game of gin rummy. Claude is thumbing \n               distractedly through a dog-eared copy of Baseball Digest.\n\n                                     RADIO\n                         Hey, fellas, I got Chicago.\n\n               But nobody can muster much enthusiasm for this news. Radio \n               shrugs and drops down on his bunk.\n\n               Just then, Can't Get Right walks past heading for the door. \n               He's dressed in civilian clothes, his bindle slung over his \n               shoulder.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Hey, Can't Get Right, where you going? \n                         Why you dressed like that?\n\n               Can't Get Right holds out a piece of paper which Ray \n               scrutinizes.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         It's a pardon from the governor.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Let me see that.\n\n               The incorrigibles gather around for a glimpse at Can't Get \n               Right's ticket to freedom.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Where'd you get this?\n\n               Can't Get Right nods out the window. Stan Blocker is waiting \n               by his car.\n\n               EXT. CAMP 8 YARD -- DAY\n\n               Claude storms across the yard and stops at the gun line. Ray \n               is a few steps behind.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?\n\n                                     BLOCKER\n                         Kid's getting out.

I \n                         didn't see our names on that pardon. \n                         You said you were gonna put in a \n                         good word for us.\n\n                                     BLOCKER\n                         I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I \n                         mentioned you both. But the fact is, \n                         pardons don't come cheap. The kid \n                         can hit. What can you do?\n\n               This hits Claude hard.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Let it go, Claude.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I'm not gonna let it go. The man \n                         needs to explain himself.

Isn't \n                         this what you wanted?\n\n               Claude looks around as the incorrigibles begin to gather. \n               He's on the spot. Dillard approaches with Can't Get Right. \n               Claude looks into the big kid's eyes.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                              (resigned)\n                         Yeah. Of course it is.\n\n               Steeling himself to the reality of the situation, Claude \n               gives Can't Get Right a hug.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         You show them Crawfords how to play \n                         ball.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Make 'em throw strikes.\n\n               Can't Get Right nods. He steps up to the gun line and looks \n               at both shooter shacks.\n\n                                     DILLARD\n                         It's alright. You're a free man now.\n\n               Can't Get Right steps across the gun line. Blocker opens the \n               car door for him. But before he climbs in, Can't Get Right \n               reaches into his pocket and pulls out his rubber ball. With \n               a smile, he tosses it to Claude, who snatches it out of the \n               air.\n\n                                     BLOCKER\n                         Don't worry, we'll take good care of \n                         him.\n\n               Blocker tips his hat and climbs behind the wheel. Claude and \n               Ray watch Blocker's car drive off under a red Mississippi \n               sunset. Slowly, the inmates drift back toward the bunkhouse \n               until Ray an Claude are left alone at the gun line.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         One of the new kids said they're \n                         farming those acres just north of \n                         the swamp.

Barefoot, \n               balanced on Coke bottles, the two men stand a few feet apart \n               facing each other. A trusty with a rifle keeps an eye on \n               them.

That \n                         pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.\n\n               The two men start to laugh. Really laugh. Nearly a decade's \n               worth of laughter comes welling up out of them, and they \n               nearly lose their balance, which only makes them laugh harder.\n\n               EXT.

As the birds \n               take wing, Wilkins aims his shot gun and fires twice in rapid \n               succession.

All around him are the sights, sounds and \n               smells of the free world. A woman rushes into the arms of a \n               man as he climbs off a bus. Across the street is Grandma \n               Dodi's Pork Rib Joint where Cookie never made it to the peach \n               cobbler. A young brother with a boom box walks by. In the \n               street, kids crowd around the back of an ice cream truck. \n               Then Claude catches his reflection in the car window and \n               frowns. When did he get this old? Unnerved, he moves around \n               to the back of the car and pops open the trunk.\n\n                                     RAY\n                              (sitting up)\n                         Damn, it was getting hot in there.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         What the hell are you doing in that \n                         trunk?!\n\n                                     RAY\n                         You didn't think I was gonna let you \n                         escape alone, did you?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I ain't escaping! We're picking up \n                         the new super just like I told you.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Then you're lucky I came along. \n                         Doesn't take a visionary to spot a \n                         golden opportunity like this. Now \n                         help me out of this trunk.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         You ain't getting out of that trunk.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp \n                         up here.\n                              (Ray struggles out of \n                              the trunk)\n                         We have the chance right here, right \n                         now, I say we go!\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Go where, Ray?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Back to New York for starters.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         And what will we do when we get there? \n                         I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So \n                         are you. What are we gonna do out \n                         here? Get married, have kids, settle \n                         down? That boat sailed without us, \n                         man.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         This boat's gonna sail without you, \n                         too. I don't care if I last one day \n                         out here. At least it's one day of \n                         freedom. Now gimme those keys.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Forget about that. You run if you \n                         want to, but you're not taking this \n                         car.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me \n                         those keys.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I ain't spending a month in the hole \n                         so you can take a joy ride.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Don't make me take them away from \n                         you.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Hey, there's Wilkins!\n\n               Ray looks, Claude clocks him. Ray slumps back into the trunk. \n               Claude stuffs Ray's legs back into the trunk and slams the \n               lid.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Who's driving now, bitch?\n\n               He looks up just as Wilkins and the new superintendent exit \n               the bus station. Warren Pike's hair has gone grey and he's \n               40 years older, but there's no mistaking the former sheriff \n               of Natchez County. He still bears a nasty scar on his cheek \n               from a wound inflicted long ago.\n\n               CLAUDE'S POV -- Pike appears as a young man in his sheriff's \n               uniform striding slowly toward him.\n\n               Claude blinks and looks again. Pike has returned to his old \n               self as he and Wilkins step up.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                              (dropping his bags)\n                         There you go, boy.\n\n               Oblivious, Pike climbs into the back seat. Wilkins nods to \n               Claude.\n\n                                     WILKINS\n                         Come on, Claude, time to go.\n\n               Claude snaps to it, grabbing the bags. He considers opening \n               the trunk, but decides to carry them around to the front \n               seat with him.\n\n               EXT. KITCHEN PORCH -- DUSK\n\n               Backs to the CAMERA, Ray and Claude urinate, presumably off \n               the porch.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         You sure it was him?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Some faces you just don't forget. \n                         Warren Pike's is one of 'em.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I don't like it, I don't like it one \n                         bit. We shoulda taken that car when \n                         we had the opportunity. We'd be half \n                         way to New York by now.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, \n                         man, you're peeing on my shoe.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I know. Simultaneously, they shake \n                         and zip. Claude bends down and picks \n                         up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a \n                         tray next to an identical one.\n\n               INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Wilkins pours a frosty drink and offers it to Pike.\n\n                                     WILKINS\n                         Lemonade?\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         I prefer bourbon.\n\n                                     WILKINS\n                         I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor \n                         in the house.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         Well, fortunately, I carry my own.\n\n               Pike pulls a flask from his jacket and tilts it high. Claude \n               enters from the kitchen with the two steaming bowls of gumbo.\n\n                                     WILKINS\n                         Hunting's been pretty good on the \n                         farm the last few years. It's one of \n                         the perks of the job. If you're \n                         interested, tomorrow I could show \n                         you some of my favorite spots.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         You don't have to twist my arm.\n                              (digging in)\n                         Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.\n\n                                     WILKINS\n                         Thank you, Claude. That'll be all \n                         for tonight.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.\n\n                                     WILKINS\n                         Goodnight, Claude.\n\n               Pike nods coldly. Claude steps back into the kitchen.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         If you don't mind my saying, you \n                         seem mighty familiar with your house \n                         boy.\n\n                                     WILKINS\n                         I believe in treating the convicts \n                         with respect, if that's what you \n                         mean.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                              (sarcastic)\n                         Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.\n\n                                     WILKINS\n                         If somebody deserves respect, Mr. \n                         Pike, they receive it from me, convict \n                         or no convict.\n\n               Pike curls his lip with disdain before taking a healthy \n               spoonful of gumbo.\n\n               EXT. MARSH -- DAY\n\n               Claude and Ray beat the bullrushes with switches. Amid a \n               flutter of wings, three pheasants take to the air. Wilkins \n               fires first, knocking one out the sky. Pike pulls off two \n               rounds, playing clean up.\n\n               EXT. FIELD -- DAY\n\n               Ray and Claude dump their game bags into the back of a pickup \n               truck. Nearby, Pike drains his flask while Wilkins scrapes \n               mud off his boots. The breeze picks up, clouds fill the sky.\n\n                                     WILKINS\n                         Well, that's a pretty good haul. \n                         What do you say, Mr. Pike? Ready to \n                         call it a day?\n\n               Pike pulls a gold watch from his pocket and releases the \n               face plate. A familiar mechanical tune floats on the gathering \n               breeze. Ray turns around slowly. His eyes fall on the watch \n               in Pike's hand. His daddy's watch. In Pike's hand.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         Yeah, it's getting late. I could \n                         sure use a bath.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         That's a real nice watch you got \n                         there, sir. Fancy old thing even \n                         plays a little tune.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         Yeah, it's special. They don't make \n                         'em like this anymore.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you \n                         got it?\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         Why, my wife gave it to me on our \n                         anniversary some years back.\n\n               Claude looks at the watch, then at Ray. Uh oh.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Must have been some time ago. Maybe \n                         forty years?\n\n                                     PIKE\n                              (eyes narrowing)\n                         Something like that, yes.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         She give you that scar, too?\n\n               Pike thrusts the barrel of his gun up under Ray's chin.\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         I oughta shoot you for that comment, \n                         boy.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Like you shot Winston Hancock?\n\n               Wilkins turns to see Pike holding Ray at gunpoint.\n\n                                     WILKINS\n                         What's going on here?\n\n                                     PIKE\n                         I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach \n                         this uppity nigger a lesson in \n                         manners.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         That's Mr. Uppity Nigger to you.\n\n               Ray grabs the barrel of the shotgun and slams it into Pike's \n               face. Pike rolls over and freezes, staring down the barrel \n               of his own gun now in Ray's hands.

The currency on \n               the table isn't poker chips, it's pills of various sizes and \n               colors.\n\n                                     GANG BANGER #1\n                         Two Percodan.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I'll raise you.\n\n                                     GANG BANGER #1\n                         What the fuck are those?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Keeps your cholesterol down.\n\n                                     GANG BANGER #1\n                         I look like I give a shit about my \n                         cholesterol?\n\n               GANG BANGER #2 takes a quick hit of cocaine from a bullet. \n               He notices Ray staring at him.\n\n                                     GANG BANGER #2\n                         You want a bump, G?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I wouldn't be putting that shit up \n                         my nose. That came in in somebody's \n                         ass. It's like you're sniffin' ass. \n                         Maybe that's your thing, but it ain't \n                         mine.\n\n               Ray pushes his bet to the center of the table. The shaky \n               junkie folds. Willie tosses in some pills and turns to Gang \n               Banger #2.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Looks like it's up to you, stinky \n                         ass sniffer.\n\n               Glaring, Gang Banger #2 flips a big pill into the pot.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Thorazine? Well, that's a little \n                         rich for my blood.\n\n               He tosses down his cards. The shaky junkie attempts to light \n               a cigarette. The match slips from his trembling fingers and \n               falls into his lap.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Damn fool gonna set this place on \n                         fire one of these days.\n\n               Gang Banger #1 folds. It's back to Ray.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I got three stool softeners left.\n                              (to Gang Banger #2)\n                         That oughta be right up your alley.\n\n               The remaining players match the pot. Gang Banger #2 reveals \n               his cards. Willie frowns. Ray lays down his cards and \n               victoriously sweeps his winnings into a paper cup. Across \n               the room, Nurse Humphries enters with a tray of snacks. She, \n               too, is showing the years.\n\n                                     NURSE HUMPHRIES\n                         Who wants Jell-O?\n\n               The magic word. The poker players join a stampede of oldsters \n               in a clatter of canes, walkers and artificial limbs. Ray and \n               Claude are left alone at the table.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Hey, where you going? We got money \n                         on the table here!\n\n               Claude glances around to ensure that he's not overheard.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         You know, Ray, I've been chewing on \n                         what you said this afternoon. I think \n                         I got a plan.\n\n               Ray gives Claude a long look.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Are you trying to tell me after all \n                         this time you finally have a plan \n                         for busting out of here?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Shh!

It's probably all fucked up, \n                         anyway.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         You don't want to hear it, you don't \n                         want to hear it. There's no shame in \n                         that.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         It's too late for plans.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson \n                         say that. Hell with you then. You'd \n                         only slow me down anyway.\n\n               Ray turns away as Claude walks off. A DODDERING INMATE stands \n               nearby slurping on Jell-O. His robe hangs open.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Hey, man, cover that shit up!\n\n               Disgusted, Ray discards his own Jell-O. He pulls out his \n               daddy's pocket watch and checks the time. The little \n               mechanical tune nags at him. He snaps the lid shut and \n               considers the watch resting in the palm of his hand.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               EXT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT\n\n               The building is dark. But then, through a first-floor window, \n               we see the unmistakable orange glow of a fire.\n\n               INT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT\n\n               An ALARM BLARES as the place fills with smoke. Wearing a \n               robe and slippers, Nurse Humphries runs among the prisoners, \n               helping them out the door.\n\n               EXT. INFIRMARY -- NIGHT\n\n               Coughing and disheveled, Ray emerges onto the lawn pushing \n               Willie in the wheelchair. As other prisoners evacuate the \n               building, Ray looks around for Claude, but he doesn't see \n               him. Nurse Humphries takes a quick head count.\n\n                                     NURSE HUMPHRIES\n                         Is everyone here?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Hey, where's Claude?

INFIRMARY -- NIGHT\n\n               Nurse Humphries, Willie and the rest of the inmates watch \n               grimly as flames engulf the building. Nobody could survive \n               this blaze. From the highway comes the siren wail of \n               approaching fire engines. But it's too late. Sparks erupt \n               into the night sky as the roof collapses...\n\n               EXT.

From \n                         the look of things, Banks never even \n                         made it out of bed.\n\n               Burke watches solemnly as the coroners wheel the bodies past \n               him.\n\n               EXT.

Claude figured \n                         they could steal a couple of bodies \n                         from the morgue. They got a couple \n                         of crackers working there don't know \n                         their asses from their elbows. Then \n                         they was gonna set fire to the \n                         infirmary and make it look like those \n                         bodies was them that got stuck inside. \n                         Claude figured during the commotion, \n                         it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto \n                         one of the fire trucks and hang tight \n                         until it rolled right on out of here \n                         in the morning.\n\n               The young inmates share a look, then glance into the graves, \n               then look back at Willie.\n\n                                     JAKE\n                         What makes you think it didn't work?\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         I never said it didn't work.\n\n               Leon and Jake do the arithmetic. You can almost hear the \n               gears grinding under the strain.\n\n                                     LEON\n                         You trying to tell us that's not Ray \n                         and Claude in those boxes?\n\n               Willie starts to chuckle and sets his electric wheel chair \n               on auto-pilot, leaving the young inmates to guess at the \n               truth.\n\n                                     JAKE\n                         What do you think about that?\n\n                                     LEON\n                         I think that old man lost his marbles \n                         about a hundred years ago. Come on, \n                         let's get this over with.\n\n               They pick up their shovels and go back to work burying the \n               caskets.\n\n               INT.

A couple of FIREMEN emerge \n               from the showers wrapped in towels and open their lockers. \n               They share a look.\n\n                                     FIREMAN #1\n                              (to the room)\n                         Alright, which of you hambones took \n                         our clothes?\n\n               EXT.

Somebody is singing \n               \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\"\n\n               EXT. STANDS -- DAY\n\n               In the middle of a capacity crowd, a VENDOR fixes two hot \n               dogs and passes them to a KID at the end of an aisle. The \n               kid passes them to the MAN next to him, and so on down the \n               line.\n\n               The CAMERA FOLLOWS the hot dogs from face to face, some old, \n               some young, some black, some white -- it's New York City, \n               after all -- and finally the hot dogs arrive in a pair of \n               old, calloused black hands. Ray passes one of the dogs to \n               Claude.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I can't eat this.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Why the hell not?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom \n                         urinating. He didn't wash his hands.\n\n               Ray and Claude glance around confused as the wave rolls \n               through their section of the bleachers. What the fuck? Claude \n               inspects his hot dog.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Just put some mustard on it and eat \n                         it.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         You didn't get ketchup?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Gimme that damn thing.\n\n               Ray snatches back the hot dog.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         What am I gonna eat?\n\n               Ray is suddenly young again.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Have my ice cream.\n\n               Claude takes the ice cream. He, too, is suddenly young again.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Thanks.\n\n               They look at each other and share a laugh.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, \n                         Claude?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on \n                         fire.\n\n               Claude pops the top on his ice cream. Suddenly, they are \n               both old again.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         No, this ain't gonna work either. \n                         It's half chocolate, half vanilla.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         So?\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         They're touching.\n\n               The CAMERA begins to pull back.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         If you don't eat that ice cream right \n                         now, I'm gonna strangle you until \n                         you are completely dead.\n\n                                     CLAUDE\n                         Yeah?
