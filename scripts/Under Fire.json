Sleepy-eyed, he pulls on a multi-\n               pocketed fishing vest over a baggy shirt. He carries a beat \n               up canvas bag over his shoulder.\n\n               A BLACK WOMAN, 40, sleeps at the lobby switchboard desk. \n               Another OLD BLACK MAN sweeps the floor. Price mumbles a 'good \n               morning' and goes to two vintage WW II vending machines -- \n               one for candy, one for Coca-Cola. He buys two candy bars and \n               a coke, and begins eating his \"breakfast\" as he crosses the \n               lobby.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Several street vendors have their wares laid out \n               on the sidewalk against the hotel. Some are shaded by \n               makeshift awnings, some are not. Jimmy rises as Price arrives; \n               there is familiar ritual in their greeting.\n\n               They cross the street together toward Jimmy's waiting taxi, \n               a hand-painted purple old American car with the words on the \n               door, \"New People's Taxi Company\" and Jimmy's name in script \n               above it.

A hand-painted image of Che Guevarra -- \n               with an X painted over it -- is on one wall. Price pulls a \n               joint from his pocket and lights up, taking a hit.\n\n               The sounds of war machinery soon interrupt the stillness. \n               Price hurries to the corner.\n\n<b>               P.O.V.

Price then \n               steps boldly into the street in front of the approaching \n               convoy. He exchanges shouts with an officer in a jeep, and \n               with a motion is given permission to join.\n\n<b>               PRICE CLIMBS INTO THE LAST OF THREE TROOP TRUCKS\n</b>\n               Each truck is filled with perhaps 25 African soldiers in \n               khaki, each holding an automatic rifle.

Two dozen cases of \n               Coca-Cola are tied to a stretcher among stacks of guns.\n\n               As Price settles in for the ride, he begins pulling cameras \n               from his bag. Quickly and automatically, rarely looking, he \n               switches lenses, loads film, and prepares his cameras. He \n               has done this a thousand times.\n\n               A SINGLE WHITE SOLDIER -- OATES, rises from among the blacks, \n               and shakily makes his way toward Price. A mercenary dressed \n               in a ragged uniform of his own design, carries two machine \n               guns and a .45. He smiles broadly, recognizing Price.

In the \n               line we recognize the WAITER from the Viking Club.

The soldier pulls a knife, then pulls his own tongue \n               from his mouth, and makes motions with the knife as if cutting \n               out his tongue.

For a moment Price doesn't know where \n               he's going to be led. The civilian points to a different \n               door -- it opens -- and Price steps down off the display \n               rack into a room.\n\n               THROUGH THE DOOR as Price steps through, the action continues \n               with the other Nicaraguan prisoners.

Pedro \n               follows with his sack of contact bombs. Then Price goes up \n               as the Priest holds the ladder.

OF LEON -- DUSK Late in the afternoon now, the fighting \n               is over for the day. An occasional gunshot. Smoke rises from \n               scattered places throughout the city. There is new rubble. \n               The town is littered with bodies.\n\n<b>               P.O.V.

The Sandinistas are \n               carefully peeking around the corner, checking out the plaza. \n               It seems safe. The door opens; the Priest lets Claire out. \n               For a moment she looks around to see who's still alive -- in \n               the shadows Price looks like one of the Guerrillas.
