Cates\n              twists sideways just as Ganz fires. The bullet misses. Again\n              Frizzy starts screaming and struggling. Ganz swipes the woman\n              across the head with the gun. Her body slumps to the floor.\n              Police sirens can be heard in the distance. Cates makes an\n              attempt for Algren's gun. A bullet splatters against the\n              floor only inches from his outstretched fingers.

Cates next takes out his\n              wallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the\n              car fender...

Cates blocks it with\n              crossed forearms, grabs, twists.  Hammond tumbles, rolls away\n              from Cates.

Cates smiles.\n\n              Hammond dances in and out... Cates' breathing becomes more\n              labored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense. Cates\n              clears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater\n              bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a\n              brick wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Hammond is faster...\n\n              Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees.

They slug away, each now arm-weary...\n              Exchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at\n              his side... Breath coming like a bellows...\n\n              Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put\n              him out.\n\n<b>                                  CATES\n</b>                        Now, you bastard, you going to\n                        tell me what's going on...\n\n              Puffing away.\n\n<b>                                  CATES\n</b>                               (continuing)\n                        ...

A black-and-\n              white comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights\n              flashing, it slides to a stop.
