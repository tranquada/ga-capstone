Then at the gun held\n              against her. She's petrified.\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        Stall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  LISA\n                        What do you want?\n\n                                  VANZANT\n                        Police business.

Almost as if he's enjoying the moment.\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        Keep stallin'.\n\n\n\n                                  LISA\n                        Alright, I'm coming...hold on.\n\n              I'll just be a minute.\n\n              CORRIDOR\n\n              Vanzant and Algren waiting. Sounds of movement from within\n              the room.\n\n              LOBBY\n\n              Cates moves toward the foot of the stairwell. Looks across at\n              mirror on the wall opposite. The entire lobby covered from\n              this spot. Every angle, including Frizzy.\n\n              ROOM\n\n              Ganz gestures to Lisa.\n\n                                  LISA\n                        Just a second.\n\n              Ganz belts her with his gun; she falls..Ganz goes through the\n              connecting door. Slips into the adjacent room.\n\n              BILLY'S ROOM\n\n              Another Hooker cowers in the corner, pulling on her clothes.\n              She's a Mexican girl in a ridiculous 'Indian' outfit.\n\n                                  MEXICAN GIRL\n                        Que paso?

He pulls her to her feet as Ganz moves by.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  BILLY\n                               (continuing)\n                        When I say jump, girl, you better\n                        jump.\n\n\n\n                                  BILLY\n                               (continuing)\n\n              CORRIDOR\n\n              Vanzant reaches down, tries the knob.  Locked. Algren moves\n              back, preparing to kick the door down.\n\n              ADJACENT ROOM\n\n              Ganz opens the door behind the two cops. Raises his pistol\n              and fires. Billy's shots follow immediately. Hits Vanzant.\n              Algren rolls just as Ganz fires again. Wounded, he gets off\n              three shots, then moves inside Ganz' room. Ganz and Billy run\n              for the elevator... Exchange two more shots with Algren. The\n              Mexican Girl begins screaming in Spanish...\n\n              LOBBY\n\n              Cates draws his .44. Races up the stairs three at a time.\n              Frizzy starts to frantically call the police.\n\n              CORRIDOR\n\n              Cates stops at the landing. Vanzant's body sprawled across\n              the hallway. Algren back in the corridor, still losing\n              blood... Leans against the wall for support... Lisa staggers\n              out of the room, screams. Algren points the gun toward the\n              elevator. Indicating where Ganz and Billy have just fled.\n              Cates starts back down toward the lobby.\n\n              ELEVATOR\n\n              Ganz and Billy, guns ready as the carriage jolts downward.\n              Rosalie is terrified, sobbing...\n\n              CATES\n\n              Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase. He takes\n              the next flight in two jumps.\n\n              ELEVATOR\n\n              As the doors open, Ganz gestures for Billy and Rosalie to\n              wait as he heads for the lobby.\n\n              LOBBY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Cates literally flies into the lobby just as Ganz appears. He\n              slams Ganz against a column, belts him across the neck with\n              his pistol. Ganz screams with pain, drops his gun... Cates\n              again slams him with his pistol, felling him...\n\n              GANZ\n\n              Slides across the floor.\n\n              CATES Senses something ... moves just as Billy appears behind\n              and fires at him. The bullet takes out a window. Cates dives\n              over the desk. Another bullet chews up the wood.\n\n              LOBBY\n\n              Frizzy has been standing beside her desk, screaming... Cates'\n              move and the accompanying bulletspanic her. She dashes for\n              safety... Cates gets to his feet behind cover. Sees Billy\n              holding Rosalie by the throat. Frizzy begins to scream.\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        He'll blow her goddamn head off.\n\n              Cates doesn't miss a beat. He slowly levels his .44. Takes\n              careful aim and starts to fire at Billy.\n\n                                  ROSALIE\n                        No. No.\n\n              Cates' shot narrowly misses Rosalie. The bullet smashes into\n              a mirror above Billy's head. Cates keeps moving closer, gun\n              pointed straight ahead. Billy pushes the pistol against\n              Rosalie'temple. For the first time, Cates hesitates. They\n              face each other across the length of the lobby.\n\n              ALGREN\n\n              Struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby. He still\n              holds his revolver. Dares not raise it towards Billy and\n              Rosalie.\n\n              BILLY BEAR\n\n              Covers Algren from near the entrance.  He's confused, doesn't\n              know what to do... He keeps hold of Rosalie.\n\n              GANZ\n\n              His eyes catch Algren's...\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        You.  Drop it and we won't kill\n                        her.\n\n              Algren tosses his gun to the floor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  GANZ\n                               (continuing)\n                        Now, tell him to drop his Goddamn\n                        piece.\n\n                                  ALGREN\n                        Do it, Cates.\n\n              No response.\n\n                                  ALGREN\n                               (continuing)\n                        Do it, Cates.  Goddamn it, do it.\n\n              Cates lowers his gun. Finally lets it drop to the floor.\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        Kick it over here.\n\n              Cates does; Ganz picks it up, smiles, looks at Billy.\n\n                                  GANZ\n                               (continuing)\n                        Get the car.\n\n              Then back to Cates as Billy runs out the entrance with\n              Rosalie.\n\n                                  GANZ\n                               (continuing)\n                        Your gun's just like mine.\n\n              He's going to kill Cates. But first be glances at Algren.\n              Then, almost casually, shoots him twice with Cates' .44.\n              Algren staggers back. Dead before he hits the floor. Cates\n              twists sideways just as Ganz fires. The bullet misses. Again\n              Frizzy starts screaming and struggling. Ganz swipes the woman\n              across the head with the gun. Her body slumps to the floor.\n              Police sirens can be heard in the distance. Cates makes an\n              attempt for Algren's gun. A bullet splatters against the\n              floor only inches from his outstretched fingers. The gun\n              skitters out of reach.\n\n                                  CATES\n                        You lying son of a bitch...\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        What are you talking about? We\n                        didn't kill her ...\n\n              Ganz smiles.\n\n              With your own gun, cop. How does it feel? Cates leaps into a\n              wooden phone booth. Ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth\n              with both his and Cates' gun. Two bullets crash into the\n              booth. Ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are\n              ominously near. Ganz finally retreats out the entrance.\n\n\n\n\n\n              STREET\n\n              Billy and Rosalie weave their way across street to the\n              Cougar. They make a U-turn. Ganz runs out. Car pulls out,\n              then the police cars and vans begin to arrive.\n\n              PHONE BOOTH\n\n              Chunks of wood on the floor. Shafts of light through a dozen\n              bullet holes. Shattered receiver dangling from a cord. Cates,\n              wedged tight into the very top of the cubicle. He drops to\n              the floor.\n\n              LOBBY\n\n              The police arrive. Swarm into the hotel. All eyes on Cates as\n              he rushes to Algren. Too late... Cates realizes Algren is\n              dead. He cradles Algren's head as he stares at the arriving\n              TAC Squad and Patrolmen.\n\n              TRANSITION.\n\n              SQUAD ROOM DAY\n\n              Cates walks in.

Nearby, at the same time (within Cates' line of\n              sight, within earshot), Lisa, the Hooker, is being\n              interrogated by a POLICE-WOMAN who pulls the statement off\n              the typewriter.

He didn't\n                        feel like sitting and talking. He\n                        was in a big hurry to get laid.\n                        I was with him about an hour...\n\n              Cates has gotten interested in the last part of this ...\n              drifts toward her...

Inmates stare at him from\n              inside the stark cells. They don't know who he is, but they\n              can smell a cop. Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside...\n              a bit startled. Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and\n              taste. The paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall\n              instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a\n              graduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods\n              to the Guard at the end of the cell block. He throws a switch\n              and the door opens.\n\n              HAMMOND'S CELL\n\n              Cates steps inside. Hammond is at a table wearing a Sony\n              Walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain\n              pen. He's boogeying in his seat to the music. Sprawled on a\n              bunk nearby is LEROY, another black inmate close to Hammond's\n              age. Leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine. He\n              doesn't even look at Cates.\n\n                                  CATES\n                        Hammond.\n\n              Cates steps inside the cell.\n\n                                  CATES\n                               (continuing)\n                        Hammond!\n\n              No answer.

He looks at it, hardly reacts.\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n                        Henry Wong... My old pal.

The other occupants of the bar\n              watch Hammond herd the four Punks to the end wall.\n\n              A BIG COWBOY\n\n              when Hammond isn't looking, he dashes toward the exit, Cates\n              puts out a leg. Sends the Cowboy crashing into a crowdedtable.\n\n\n\n\n\n              HAMMOND\n\n              Turns around at the noise.\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n                               (continuing)\n                        That wasn't necessary, buddy.

He drops a wallet on the floor\n              and moves to the second. A switchblade, some credit cards and\n              another wallet fall to the floor. The last Punk has only a\n              roll of bills.

Huge crash as\n              the glasses break into a million fragments.\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n                               (continuing)\n                        Looks like you're on your way to\n                        bein' outta business, redneck...\n                        Now, let's see what can we fuck\n                        with next?\n\n              The Bartender doesn't have the look of a happy man.\n\n                                  BARTENDER\n                        Okay, okay.

Cates and\n              Hammond move along the buildings... Arrive at the back of the\n              hardware store. Quietly, they start to ascend the stairs.\n\n              STAIRWELL\n\n              The metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door.\n              Cates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent\n              window. Between the drawn curtains, a flickering glimmer from\n              a TV set. On the tube, various poses from stridently\n              exercising women.\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n                        What the shit is that?\n\n              Looks again.

Hammond fiddles with it for\n              several moments. The door swings open. They step into a\n              darkened room.\n\n              APARTMENT\n\n              Cates takes the .38 from his pocket. He stops near the open\n              bedroom doorway. He looks at Hammond and then both men step\n              quickly into the room.\n\n                                  CATES\n                        Police!

She won't even\n                        know who you are, sucker.\n\n              They stop by the car. Cates takes the gun out, lays it on the\n              hood.  Hammond stares at him. Cates next takes out his\n              wallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the\n              car fender... Smiles.\n\n                                  CATES\n                        I guess the first thing I ought,\n                        to explain to you, nigger, is I\n                        fight dirty.\n\n              Hits Hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face.\n              Hammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support. Cates\n              hesitates ... and Hammond kicks out, sending the partially\n              open car door slamming into Cates. Cates sprawls.\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n                        So do I.\n\n              Hammond aims a kick at Cates' head.  Cates blocks it with\n              crossed forearms, grabs, twists.  Hammond tumbles, rolls away\n              from Cates.  Both men struggle to their feet, circle each\n              other.\n\n              Hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates,\n              a bit sooner than he expected.  Cates smiles.\n\n              Hammond dances in and out... Cates' breathing becomes more\n              labored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense. Cates\n              clears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater\n              bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a\n              brick wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Hammond is faster...\n\n              Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees. They look at\n              one another. Silently, they move to their feet. Hammond's\n              back is to a wall... Cates keeps him there, negates the\n              lighter man's agility. They slug away, each now arm-weary...\n              Exchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at\n              his side... Breath coming like a bellows...\n\n              Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put\n              him out.\n\n                                  CATES\n                        Now, you bastard, you going to\n                        tell me what's going on...\n\n              Puffing away.\n\n                                  CATES\n                               (continuing)\n                        ... Do I have to kick the shit out\n                        of you some more.\n\n              They stand facing one another. Hammond smiles. A black-and-\n              white comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights\n              flashing, it slides to a stop. TWO UNIFORMED COPS jump out,\n              guns drawn.\n\n                                  FIRST COP\n                        All right, you two.

Cates falls back against\n              the patrol car. Still fighting for breath. The First Cop\n              lifts Cates' wallet off the Cadillac and looks at his badge,\n              shows it to the other cop.\n\n                                  FIRST COP\n                        What the hell's going on here?\n\n              Cates walks over, pockets his gun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                  SECOND COP\n                        I've got a burglary call.

Cates is one step ahead of him. He rolls up a\n              piece of the wet towel and inserts it over his bleeding gum.\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n                        Too bad we got interrupted when we\n                        did.

APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n              Cates is stealthily going to the end of the second corridor\n              of the kitchen and living room area. That corridor turns at\n              a sharp angle and goes to the back. Hammond is at the very\n              front of that first corridor..at a door ... he shoves it back.\n\n              INT. FIRST BEDROOM\n\n              There is a bed and  Rosalie, undressed, is in it... Billy is\n              seated on the edge of it... pants on, shirt off, pulling on\n              his boots. Suddenly, Hammond is pointing a gun at him...\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n                        Give it up, Billy.

With lightning sudden quickness, he\n              reaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back.\n              Billy smiles, laughs...then with a sudden, awful roar, he\n              leaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol.  The big\n              slugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as\n              Rosalie shrieks.\n\n              INT. BACK BEDROOM\n\n              Ganz, half-dressed, asleep, gun in hand, throws himself off\n              the bed, pushes Sally out of the way ... opens the door and\n              starts firing furiously down the corridor... He grabs the\n              briefcase and runs to the window.\n\n              INT.

BACK BEDROOM\n\n              Sally gets to her feett yelling, runs at Cates as he appears\n              and futilely tries to hit him....He throws her down on the\n              bed as if she were a doll ... He goes to the window...\n\n              EXT. FIRE ESCAPE\n\n              Ganz peels down the fire escapes hits the ground. He stops\n              for a second... Then Cates appears, Ganz fires a shot then\n              starts to run. Cates keeps coming...\n\n              INT. FIRST BEDROOM\n\n              Hammond hears the gunfire, runs out of the room...\n\n              CATES\n\n              Dives down the fire escape.\n\n              BATHROOM\n\n              Hammond enters to find it empty of Ganz and Cates, only Sally\n              crying hysterically ...

STREET\n\n              Ganz runs, turns out of an alley onto a street baked with\n              neon light. Cates pursues.\n\n              EXT. FRONT OF CASEY'S BUILDING\n\n              Hammond runs out, turns down the adjoining street.\n\n              CATES\n\n              Following Ganz, holding him in sight, but unable to get a\n              shot off...\n\n              PARALLEL STREET\n\n              Hammond running down a street near the one where Ganz is\n              being chased...\n\n              MAIN STREET\n\n              Cates fires at Ganz ... Ganz ducks in a doorway...\n\n              HAMMOND\n\n              on his street hears the shot... he runs toward it, down a\n              narrow alley between two buildings....\n\n              EXT. DOORWAY AT END OF ALLEY\n\n              Ganz hears footsteps approach from the opposite direction of\n              Cates.  They move very close to where be is crouched... it is\n              Hammond coming toward him... Ganz suddenly rolls a garbage\n              can in his path, dropping him like a stone.\n\n              CATES\n\n              Comes toward where he expects to find Ganz... Ganz has his\n              arm around Hammond's throat and his gun to his ear...\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        Drop it... you come up against me,\n                        you're gonna lose...\n\n              Hammond drops his gun.\n\n                                  GANZ\n                               (continuing)\n                        Hey, cop, come on...l got\n                        something for ya... come on...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              EXT.  MAIN STREET\n\n              Cates comes out of the doorway from which he's fired...and\n              comes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it\n              down when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy.  The hand\n              that's around Hammond's throat also holds the black bag.\n              Cates walks forward, his gun down at his side...\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        After I get outta this, cop...I'm\n                        gonna live forever...\n\n                                  CATES\n                        I don't think you're gonna make it.\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        Whaddya mean...I got your gun ...\n                        I got his money...

Hammond twists as Ganz\n              also fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet\n              backward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the\n              ground, looks at Cates.\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n                        Jesus Christ, I didn't think you'd\n                        really do it. You are crazy.\n\n              Ganz' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side.\n              Cates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again.\n\n\n\n\n\n              Ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... A look\n              of childish disbelief passes over his face.\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        I got hit.  I can't believe it.

End of story.\n\n                                  GANZ\n                        I ain't gonna beg for my life. It\n                        ain't cool.\n\n              He runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is\n              stopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his\n              chest. Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of\n              Ganz' now lifeless hand. Then goes over to Hammond...\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n                        Yours?\n\n              Cates raises the pistol.\n\n                                  CATES\n                        Mine...\n\n              Pause.\n\n                                  CATES\n                               (continuing)\n                        You okay?\n\n                                  HAMMOND\n                        Yeah.
