WOXOF BAR\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tLoud music, low ceiling, plaques of the squadrons line the \n\twalls. A dancer gyrates on stage, largely ignored by pilots \n\ttalking with their hands. Every pretty girl in San Diego \n\tseems to be here. It's a noisy, rowdy place--a \"steam \n\treleaser\" for people under pressure. Nevertheless, there is \n\ta control to it all, there are none of the usual bar types, \n\tjust pilots and Naval Officers.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe Ghost Riders enter. The place is on fire:  a mob of \n\tdancers, flashing lights, blaring HARD ROCK MUSIC. Beer \n\tflows. Pilots talk flying and hustle girls.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tNEARBY - AN A7 pilot stands by the bar. He knows Goose and \n\tspeaks loudly for his benefit.. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tA7 PILOT\n</b>\tYou know the Fighter Pilots motto? \n\tIt's better to be dead than to look \n\tbad.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThey grin broadly.

Maverick is a bit reserved. He doesn't move among the \n\tcrowd as naturally as Goose does. Hollywood and Wolfman drift \n<b>\t\n</b>\taway, searching for quarry. Goose orders beer. He nods toward a \n\tTALL YOUNG MAN across the room.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tGOOSE\n</b>\tKeller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew \n\thim at Pensacola.

The barmaid pours Drambuie. They \n\tlook at Goose apprehensively.

The barmaid pours it.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tGOOSE\n</b>\tCareful, don't make an ash of \n\tyourself...\n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe tries to drink the flaming concoction. He tries to go for a \n\tsip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame \n\taway, but that doesn't work. Finally he goes for the gulp. He \n\tburns his lip and misses.  He sets his hair on fire. It goes up \n\tin a WHOOOSH!!\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tSUNDOWN\n</b>\tYeow!\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tGOOSE\n</b>\tMayday!

He watches a few \n\tpretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits, then \n\tturns and walks up to Ice, who sits, drinking with Slider.\n\tMaverick walks over to him. Ice notices Slider's attention going \n\tto Maverick. He turns and grins at him.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tICEMAN\n</b>\tFigured it out yet?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tMAVERICK\n</b>\tFigured out what?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tICEMAN\n</b>\tWho is the best.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tMAVERICK\n</b>\tNope.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tICEMAN\n</b>\tNeed a hint?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tMAVERICK\n</b>\tI think I can work it out on my \n\town.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tICEMAN\n</b>\tYou like to work alone.

It's not quite a joke, more an \n\tinsult. Maverick's about to take the whole conversation too far \n\twhen something...someone catches his eye. She catches quite a few \n\teyes in this room. She is very pretty and she's walking in on the \n\tarm of a Commander. Maverick turns back, but the moment has \n\tpassed. Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile. Goose pulls \n\thim away.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tMAVERICK\n</b>\tWhat do these guys think, I made \n\tCougar quit?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tGOOSE\n</b>\tPay no attention to it.

They start to make a \n\tmove for her. But just then she finds her date at the bar; a \n\tdistinguished man with Captain's stripes. Their smiles freeze and \n\tthey slide back in their chairs. Maverick can't stop looking at \n\ther...After a while, the intensity of his gaze draws her \n\tattention. She feels him. She is nodding and smiling to her date, \n\tbut her eyes scan the room like radar. A warning tone goes off in \n\this brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him. He feels that \n\tthrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're \n\ttargeted in someone's scope. Her eyes hold on him for a long \n\tmoment...long enough, and then sweep by the rest of the room. She \n\tturns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something \n\the says.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tOver in a corner, Goose chats up a couple of San Diego girls.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tGOOSE\n</b>\tThe family unit -- that's the most \n\timportant thing.

He tries not to stare. She seems to know a lot of \n\tpeople in the club. He looks away. Hollywood is chatting up a \n\tgirl with a sincerity that cannot be taught. His line is just as \n\tpolished as his appearance.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n</b>\tYou don't think about death up \n\tthere, but you think a lot about \n\tthe danger.

You feel a \n\tcertain intensity of life, and you \n\twant to grab onto every moment.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMaverick looks up at the bar again. A shock. She (Charlie) is \n\tstaring right at him, intensely, as her date whispers something \n\tin her ear. She notices him, staring back, quickly looks away, \n\tembarrassed. She says something to the man. He nods and turns \n\taway as someone else grabs his attention. The woman, now wouldn't \n\tlook this way for anything. She picks up her purse from the bar \n\tand walks through the crowd and out of the room. Impulsively, \n\tMaverick's up, he follows. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\t46.  INT.

Maverick turns, sees the \n\tothers sizing him up. Most of them grin. Maverick moves down \n\tthe corridor past the CO's Office. Viper leans against the \n<b>\t\n</b>\tdoorsill. He lights a pipe, laconically eyes Maverick. His \n\ttone gives away nothing, like an ELINT probe eliciting a \n\tresponse.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tVIPER\n</b>\tMaverick...

SKY - LATER\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tAt twenty-eight thousand feet, the two planes circle each \n\tother, going in opposite directions. As they jockey for \n\tposition, they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe earth spins, the horizon appears and disappears. With \n\teach hard turn, Maverick and Goose can be heard \"grunting\" to \n\tkeep blood in their brains, to keep from passing out.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe fight is hard, physical, and exhausting. The extreme G \n\tforces--6.5--flatten them against their seats, causing their \n\theads to weigh over one hundred pounds. Maverick strains to \n\tturn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at \n\tMach One. \n<b>\t\t\tMAVERICK\n</b>\tI've lost him -- where is he?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tGOOSE\n</b>\tOn your six -- coming hard.

I'll nail him this time. \n\tGoing vertical.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tTHE PLANE EXPLODES INTO AFTERBURNER - rocketing toward \n\tspace. Jester is left in direct line with the sun, and his \n\tcanopy is sprayed with a blinding glare. Going ballistic is \n\tdangerous. The plane flys like a bullet, obeying the laws of \n\tphysics, not the pilot's touch on control surfaces. The \n\tballistic call warns other aircraft that he is, for the \n\tmoment, out of control.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tGOOSE\n</b>\tHe's blind -- you got him!\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tJESTER\n</b><b>\tNO JOY!

It rockets \n\tdown the outside, gaining energy. Over the ROAR of jets, the \n\tSCREAM of the wind, Goose shouts data, but it is muffled, a \n\tdistant voice in a typhoon. Through the canopy, we see \n\tJester, and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of \n\ta falcon.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tPILOT'S POV - HUD in windscreen - a diamond in a box. \n\tMaverick lines up the diamond with Jester, and we hear the \n\thigh pitched tone BEEPING.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tJESTER\n</b><b>\tWE'RE BELOW THE HARD DECK.

They crane their \n\tnecks from their battle stations, sweating into the sun, \n\twatching for the approach of F-14's. Someone sees it--he \n\tpoints and SHOUTS. The F-14 appears, and every man stands and \n<b>\tCHEERS.\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\t132.

Ice is first down over the ramp, \n\twaved in.  The F-14 comes in a little rocky. It bounces hard \n\tbut grabs the wire, then jerks to a sudden halt. The sailors \n\tCHEER AND APPLAUD, throwing fists of victory into the air, \n\tstraining to get a look at Ice as the crew directs his plane \n\toff to the side. Opening the canopy, Ice and Slider unstrap. \n\tStinger and the others are there. Guys are climbing up, \n\tclimbing all over the airplane. They're already painting a \n\tMiG on the side, and they're looking at Ice in awe.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\t135.

EXT. FLIGHT DECK\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tHe swings the nose around past Ice's. Ice's plane is covered \n\tin colored jerseys as the ground crew pulls him out. \n\tMaverick's plane swings towards the PRI-FLY BRIDGE.

His face is \n\tinscrutable. Maverick gets mobbed, but pushes over to Ice. \n\tThey stare at each other for a moment, eye to eye even as \n\tthey are buffeted by the crowd. Finally, Ice breaks...a grin.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tICE\n</b>\tI guess I owe you one.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tMAVERICK\n</b>\tYou don't owe me anything.\n\t\tWe're on the same team. \n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\tICE\n</b>\tYou saved our lives.

As Ice and Slider snap it off, it \n\tturns into the pilot's salute, they give them the bird. \n\tMaverick and Fungus laugh and return the compliment. \n<b>\t\n</b>\tAs they are mobbed by sailors, Maverick is elated to see two \n\tfamiliar figures: Hollywood and Wolfman turn from their \n\tbattle damaged TOMCAT on the forward elevator as it sinks out \n\tof sight below decks.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\t138.
