EXT. NIGHT. - THE PACIFIC IS ANYTHING BUT\n\t\n\tWINDS HOWL. Rain drives horizontal. The sea surges up, \n\tnearly to the flight deck of the Aircraft Carrier USS Kitty \n\tHawk. The carrier plunges, driving its bow into a wall of \n\tgrey water. The deck pitches forward and back, rolls left to \n\tright, and yaws in a corkscrew motion. The entire 93,000 ton \n\tbehemoth rises and falls in the TYPHOON-DRIVEN SWELL. \n\t\n\t\n\t2.  SOMETHING DROPS DOWN OUT OF THE NIGHT\n\t\n\tA ROAR. Silver wings flash by, a cockpit, fiery jet \n\texhausts. A forty ton monster drops at 120 knots into an area \n\tthe size of a tennis court in a CONTROLLED CRASH. \n\t\n\t2A.  A SHOWER OF SPARKS, A SCREECH OF RUBBER AND METAL as \n\tthe gear hits the deck. The hook catches the 3 wire and the \n\tF-14 TOMCAT is slammed to a halt. It's the scariest thing \n\tyou've ever seen, the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and \n\tjust another day at the office for a Naval Aviator.\n\t\n\tTITLES OVER \n\t\n\tHARD DRIVING ROCK AND ROLL - THE CARS - RIDE ME HIGH\n\t\n\t\n\t3.  FLIGHT DECK - THE LANDING SIGNAL OFFICER - (LSO)\n\t\n\tLeans almost horizontal into the winds. He holds the pickle, \n\tcontrolling the landing lights and speaks into a mike. His \n\tcalm, professional commands belie the extreme conditions.\n\t\n\t\t\tLSO\n\tPOWER, POWER...DON'T CLIMB...\n\tOKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT.\n\t\n\t\n\t4.  ANOTHER TOMCAT FLIES OVER THE RAMP\n\t\n\tIt slams in. The pilot hits full power, catches the wire, slams \n\tto a stop, cuts his engines.\n\t\n\t5.  OMITTED\n\t\n\t6.  AIR OPS - BELOW DECK \n\t\n\tLots of scopes and electronic gear. The CARRIER CONTROL APPROACH \n\tOFFICER (CCA) watches a blip on radar, reaches for his mike key.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t7.  EXT. THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING - (AERIAL)\n\t\n\tWe float like gods, above the storm, above the cloud cover, \n\tlooking down. From overhead, a probe slides into frame, then \n\ta graceful nose. The cockpit sides by, Pilot, then Radar \n\tIntercept Officer (RIO) barely illuminated by the orange glow \n\tof their instruments. The fuselage gracefully swells to two \n\tenormous air intakes, then variable angle wings, swept back \n\tfor high speed flight. Twin tailbooms cant outward, \n\thorizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments. Enormous \n\ttwin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight.\n\t\n\t\n\t8.  INT. COCKPIT - (AERIAL)\n\t\n\tWe become aware of WIND WHISTLE, JET ENGINE SOUNDS, RADIO \n\tSTATIC. The pilot, COUGAR, is calm, steady.

SKY \n\t\n\tClosing at 900 knots, The MiG is a speck, then a flash and a \n\tROAR, a knife-edge pass at 300 feet. It rockets past his left \n\twing tip and disappears. Cougar kicks rudder, whips the stick, \n\tscreams into a tight turning roll and dives after him. He slams \n\tthe throttle forward to ZONE 5 AFTERBURNER.  \n\t\n\t\n\t13.  EXT. - MAVERICK'S F-14\n\t\n\tMaverick sees a SECOND MiG drop from above onto Cougar's tail.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tBOGEY ON YOUR SIX.

He scans the sky frantically, while rolling the \n\taircraft. ...Suddenly, he feels a presence. He looks straight up \n\tand behind him. A few feet away, a TOMCAT slides into position \n\tcanopy to canopy, an incredible feat of flying. Maverick and \n\tWizard stare at him. Maverick slides even closer, canopies nearly \n\ttouching. The MiG pilot acknowledges them with a weak wave.  \n\tMaverick stares for a moment, then flips him the bird. \n\t\n\tThe MiG pushes negative G, hard down and away. He heads for the \n\tdeck.\n\t\n\t\t\tWIZARD\n\tHe's running for it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tAh, the thrill of victory and the \n\tagony of defeat.\n\t\n\t\t\tWIZARD\n\tSpeaking of feet, fuel's down to \n\t4.0.

FLIGHT DECK \n\t\n\tAll eyes are on what they can see of the approach of the two \n\tplanes. Maverick drops him off at the pattern and circles. The \n\tLSO watches the approach.

The deck crew watches in terror as the plane \n\twallows in toward them. The LSO'S turn, take a few steps and \n\tthrow themselves off the flight deck.\n\t\n\tThey sail into the night toward the surging seas a hundred feet \n\tbelow, then are caught in safety nets hung off the side.\n\t\n\t\n\t28A.  THE PLANE\n\t\n\tSettles, settles, standing on it's engines, trying to arrest \n\tit's downward momentum. The hook raises sparks as it skids across \n\tthe deck... The plane stops falling and hangs for a moment, about \n\tto blast back up, when the hook catches the last wire.. The wire \n\tsnags it, plucking 45,000 pounds of fuel, metal and men out of \n\tthe air and slamming it all to the deck. WHAMMMM! Right wheel \n\tflies up the deck and over the side...the gear collapses. The \n\tplane SCREECHES sideways. The crew watches helplessly as it skids \n\tslams into it and comes to rest in cloud of fuel vapor and steam.\n\t\n\tThe LSO runs up, shouting into the mike. \n\t\n\t\t\tLSO\n\tCOUGAR, GOOSE...COME IN COUGAR! \n\tSHUT YOUR ENGINES DOWN, YOU'VE \n\tARRIVED.\n\t\n\t\t\tAIR BOSS\n\tGHOST RIDER!

I \n\tthought I heard a funny noise.\n\t\n\tOther crewmembers help Cougar out. He seems stunned, but Goose \n\treacts to his fear with frantic one-liners.

Goose, eyes wild, \n\twaves at Maverick and Wizard, rolling up. They flame out - \n\tVVOOOMMMMM! They sit there, immobile, waiting for a tow, looking \n\tnumb.  Goose does his \"stewardess\".\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tOn behalf of your Captain and your \n\tcrew, I want to thank you for \n\tflying VF101. And next time your \n\tplans include the middle of the \n\tgoddamn ocean in the dead of \n\tfrigging night, I hope you'll think \n\tof Naval Aviation.\n\t\n\tThe surgeon looks into Goose's eyes.\n\t\n\t\t\tSURGEON\n\tStress reaction...\n\t\n\t\t\tXO\n\t\n\tCheck his head.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\t   (wobbling off)\n\tNever mind my head, check my \n\tshorts!\n\t\n\t\n\t32.  SICK BAY - LATER\n\t\n\tCougar lies alone in the dimness, staring at the overhead.\n\t\n\t33. 03 LEVEL - BELOW DECKS - OFFICER'S COUNTRY\n\t\n\tThe usual CLANGS, WHISTLES, ENGINES of Navy life sound FORLORN \n\tECHOING through the dim, deserted passage. From the distance, a \n\tsingle figure passes in and out of the glow of the overhead \n\tlights. Cougar comes closer, hobbling unsteadily.\n\t\n\tHe reaches a door, pulls himself erect and knocks on the sign:\n\t\n\tCommander Tom Otawoczek\n\tCO VF 101\n\tSTINGER\n\t\n\t\n\t34.  STINGER'S CABIN\n\t\n\tThe skipper works at his desk, responds without looking up.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tCome in.\n\t\n\tHe looks up. Cougar stands in the doorway, a strange, dazed look \n\ton his face.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tCougar, what is it? You should be \n\tin sick bay. What are you doing?\n\t\n\tHe walks over to the skipper's desk. His eyes are glazed, but \n\this jaw is firm.\n\t\n\t\t\tCOUGAR\n\tThinking of my wife and kid.\n\t\n\tA determined movement. Hand to chest.\n\t\n\t\n\t34A. OMITTED\n\t\n\tSomething metal hits it, skids across the polished surface and \n\tclangs up against the coffee mug: gold wings.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t35.  PASSAGEWAY\n\t\n\tCougar comes out of Stinger's room, bumps into Goose, and \n\tMaverick. He turns the other way.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tCougar!\n\t\n\tHe stops, turns to them. There is nothing to say. Goose hands \n\thim his snapshot. Cougar looks at his wife and kid for a moment, \n\tthen looks up at them. He turns away.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tCougar?\t\tSTINGER (O.S.)\n\tMaverick, Goose...Come in here.\n\t\n\t\n\t36.  STINGER'S OFFICE - DOORWAY\n\t\n\tMaverick appears, followed by Goose. They stand at \n\tattention.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tSir?\n\t\n\tThe Skipper says nothing. Maverick sees the wings on the \n\tdesk. He enters, walks over, stares down at them. He picks \n\tthem up. \n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tDon't worry. I'll talk to him.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tDon't.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHe's a good pilot.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tI talked a man back once. Three \n\tmonths later, we lost him. It's his \n\tdecision. Only he knows.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tHe's the best you have. He's going \n\tTop Gun!\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tWas.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat?\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tWas going. (Turns to Maverick.) Now \n\tyou are.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tMe?\n\t\n\tMaverick stares at the wings, lost in conflicting emotions.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tWell, he's going (indicating Goose) \n\tand he needs someone to fly the \n\tplane.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tSkipper, you can't do this!\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tI didn't do it, he did it himself. \n\tSomething about a wife and kid. The \n\tfact is, he's lost it. He knows it. \n\tI know it. You were up there, you \n\tknow it, too.\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tGive him a break, Skipper. It was \n\training snakes up there. He'll be \n\talright, soon as all the gorillas go \n\thome...\n\t\n\tThe Skipper stares at Goose, non-plussed for a moment.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tI know some RIOS are a little \n\twiggy...but you abuse the \n\tpriviledge! I don't believe I'm \n\tgoing to have to put the two of you \n\tin the same cockpit...but there it \n\tis! It may be good for the Navy. It \n\tmight be good for you, but most of \n\tall, it's good for me. It'll get \n\tyou out of my sight.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tBut, Skipper, Cougar's been picked \n\tfor Top Gun...He's the best of the \n\tbest!\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tWell, you'll just have to make do \n\twith him (indicates Maverick).\n\t\n\tGoose and Maverick exchange looks.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tMav's a great flyer but....\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tHe's a hell of a flyer. In fact, \n\the's so damn good he might have \n\tbeen picked for Top Gun himself. \n\tExcept for one thing. (SCREAMS) He \n\tjust can't seem to follow orders!\n\t\n\t\n\tStinger moves slightly, to stand now, directly in front of \n\tMaverick and speak eye to eye at four inches.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tYou just did an incredibly brave thing! \n\tWhat you should have done was land your \n\tplane. You don't own that plane, the \n\ttaxpayers do. I should ream you out for \n\tit. But it just doesn't work with you. \n\tYou're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe \n\t...too good. You never really stepped in \n\tit yet. So this is your chance. I'm \n\tgonna send you up against the best. They \n\tare better than you. Maybe they'll knock \n\tthat shine off your eagle and you'll \n\tsee, finally, where discipline and \n\tteamwork fit it. \n\tMaverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out \n\tof it.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tSir?\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tThat is all. Tell me about the MiG \n\tsome other time...\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir!\n\t\n\tHe snaps off a salute and does an about face.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tMaverick..\n\t\n\tHe turns back.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir..\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tThe wings..\n\t\n\t\n\tHe looks down at the wings in his hands, slowing walks over \n\tplaces them gently on the Skipper's desk.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tGentlemen!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK/GOOSE\n\tSir?\n\t\n\t\n\tHis facade cracks just slightly.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tGood luck.\n\t\n\t\n\t37.  INT. PASSAGEWAY\n\t\n\tMaverick and Goose push through a gauntlet of aircrews. They \n\thave become notorious. Guys grab at them...questions...the \n\tMiGs?..What happened up there? How close did they get? What did \n\tthe MiGs do? One word is heard over and over...\"TopGun\". Goose is \n\tleft behind in the crowd. Maverick pushes through. He walks \n\tfast...faster. Up ladders, around turns, down ladders, through \n\tpassageways. Faster. He breaks into a trot, then a canter, \n\tsqueezing past enlisted men, parts lockers, then he breaks into a \n\trun...\n\t\n\t38.  EXT - CARRIER - NIGHT AND STORM\n\t\n\tA hatch slams open on the side of the Carrier. He's out on a \n\tcatwalk, instantly soaked, running on rain slicked stairs \n\tcantilevered high over the breaking seas. He plunges forward to \n\tthe bow of the ship, stands on the very peak. He is yelling \n\tsomething. He stands there as the bow plunges terrifyingly into \n\tthe trough. The water rises like a green mountain, up, up to \n\tbreak just a few feet below him, showering him with spray. The \n\tnoise is incredible. \n\t\n\tCome around on his face. It is maddened. He raises his fist and \n\tpunches the night.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe foaming slope of the wave rushes up, changing color as it \n\tDISSOLVES TO:\n\t\n\tDesert Sand whipping by...\n\t\n\t39.  MOJAVE DESERT - 1 WEEK LATER\n\t\n\tA big bike, a real big bike, a turbo...rockets across the \n\tdesert. Fast. Real fast. Aviator shades low above the handlebars \n\t--Maverick. Goose hangs on in back. It cranks faster, pulls \n\tcloser...ENGINE SCREAMING. It cranks up a notch, it's going to \n\t\n\texplode. It can't go faster, but it does. It SCREAMS HIGHER. It \n\tROARS under, by and away, leaving dust...\n\t\n\t\n\t39A.  THE BIKE - STILL\n\t\n\tSilence. Just the HISS AND POP OF METAL COOLING. Maverick sits \n\ton it, staring out past us. Goose looks over Maverick's shoulder.\n\t\n\tWe see why. Feet come into the frame. Then the uniform: \n\tCalifornia Highway Patrol.\n\t\n\t\n\t40.  COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR SAN DIEGO\n\t\n\t40A.  ANGLE ON MAVERICK. CHP enters the frame, the usual \n\thypercivil arrogance tinged with awed disbelief. The usual \n\tquestions are spaced for effect as if he might be talking to some \n\tother form of life. Maverick is off the bike, standing at \n\tattention. Goose follows more slowly.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\tSon. Do you know why\n\tI stopped you?\n\t\n\tMaverick has some good idea how to deal with authority.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir. I do sir\n\t\n\tThe CHP adjusts his own aviator shades.\n\t\t\tCHP\n\tWell... What   is   it?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t   (more than sincere)\n\tSir. You are going to give me a \n\twarning, Sir!\n\t\n\t\n\tCHP - A touch of a smile, quickly surpressed.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\tLicense and registration.\n\t\n\tMaverick hands them over with his Navy ID. CHP scans them, \n\thesitates a moment over the last, looks up with a touch more \n\trespect.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\tLieutenant, do you know how fast  \n\tyou were going?\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir. I do, Sir.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\tWell? \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tSir. I was going Mach point one \n\tfive.\n\t\n\tCHP nods sagely.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\tOne SIXTH the speed of sound!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\t   (a guess)\n\tLieutenant... What do you...  \n\tusually fly?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tF-14's sir.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\t   (new respect)\n\tTomcats?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir!\n\t\n\tA long pause. Respect in the cop's eyes. He taps the Navy ID on \n\tthe handlebars...staring at this sincere young man.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\tLieutenant... Is there...\n\ta Russian attack?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNo sir! But you have to be ready. \n\t\n\t\n\tThe cop nods and stares at him.\n\t\n\t\n\t41.  EXT. MIRAMAR NAVAL AIR STATION - LATER\n\t\n\t\n\t41A.  OMIT\n\t\n\t\n\tThe bike is BLURPING... barely going fast enough to stay \n\tupright. Maverick cool in shades and campaign cap dorks past the \n\thanger with the sign: FIGHTERTOWN, USA. He pulls ahead. In back \n\tof him, escorting with flashers...the CHP. They pull up at the \n\tgate. Maverick and Goose salute the guard, hands over their ID. \n\tThe CHP gets out of his car, leans against the door.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\tLieutenant.\n\t\n\tMaverick turns to him.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes, Sergeant?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\tRemember one thing.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tSir?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHP\n\tOutside of this gate...\n\tI...am Top Gun.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir!\n\t\n\tHe salutes. The CHP returns a snappy one. He gets back in his \n\tcar and turns away. Maverick receives his ID and clearance. As he \n\tpasses through, a couple of pilots in flight suits (ICE AND \n\tHOLLYWOOD) stare at him. The taller, dark, cool one speaks in a \n\tdry voice, meant to be overheard.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tUh oh, police escort. This one must \n\tbe a real killer.\n\t\n\tThe second pilot grins big at them. Maverick turns slightly \n\tstares over his shades at them as he passes. Goose grins back the \n\tchallenge.\n\t\n\t42.  AERIAL COMBAT - VIETNAM ERA - F4'S, MIG 17'S - STOCK \n\t\n\tThe Doors on the soundtrack.  Jets swoop, missiles fire, a plane \n\texplodes. Gun camera views of MiGs, SAMS, flak, bombing runs...\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER (V.O.) \n\tDuring the Korean War, the Navy kill \n\tratio was twelve-to-one. We shot down \n\ttwelve of their jets for every one of \n\tours. In Vietnam, this ratio fell to \n\tthree-to-one. Our pilots depended on \n\tmissles. They lost their dogfighting \n\tskills.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tF-14's fighting with F-5's. Music becomes current. \n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER (V.O.) \n\tTop Gun was created to teach ACM. Air \n\tCombat Maneuvering...Dogfighting. \n\tRichthofen, Guynemer, Rickenbacker, \n\tGalland, Rudel, Bong would envy us. We \n\tdo just what they did, but we do it \n\tbeyond the speed of sound. \n\t\n\t\n\t43.  INT. DAY - TOP GUN ORIENTATION ROOM.\n\t\n\t\n\tVIPER - A tough-looking, confident leader in a blue flight suit, \n\tstands before a video-tape monitor. Behind him, on the monitor, \n\tthe dogfighting continues.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tBy the end of Vietnam we upped our \n\tkill ratio to thirteen to one. \n\t\n\t\n\tHe turns on the lights. We see his audience in F.G.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tYou're here 'cause you're the top \n\tone per cent of all naval aviators.\n\t\n\tTHE CLASS \n\t\n\tSixteen young men - eight flight crews - sit at attention. They \n\tare trim, fit and confident - high school heroes, college jocks.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER (V.O.) \n\tYou're the elite, the best of the \n\tbest. We're gonna make you better, \n\tbecause you're job is damned \n\timportant. \n\t\n\tANOTHER ANGLE - THE MEN \n\t\n\tThe camera moves among them. Hold on one of the men; the one who \n\tgreeted Maverick at the gate, Ice.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER (V.O.)\n\tWith the tensions in the world today, the potential for confron- \n\ttation is greater than ever, and \n\tcarrier pilots will be the first \n\tones there. Air combat excellence \n\tis vital.\n\t\n\t\n\tIce is not looking at the speaker, but, rather, in our \n\tdirection. HOLLYWOOD, a blond, good-looking pilot, whispers \n\tsomething to him, and gestures. Ice is getting the lowdown on \n\tsomeone. The camera moves and we see who that someone is, as \n\tMaverick enters the frame. \n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\t ...Someone once asked me if \n\ttraining men for air combat made \n\tthe world less safe--flying loaded \n\tguns... an accidental confrontation \n\tand so forth...\n\t\n\tMaverick feels the stare of the other man and glances in his \n\tdirection. Their eyes meet. Ice smiles coldly.\n\t\n\t\n\tANGLE - VIPER \n\t \t\tVIPER (Con't)\n\tMy answer is: the dangerous thing \n\tis being unprepared. You want \n\ttrouble, that's what you get when \n\tthings don't work out, when you \n\tcan't do what you say you can. When \n\tyou don't know what you can do. And \n\twhen your opponents aren't sure \n\teither. We are not policy. We don't \n\tmake policy. Elected officials \n\t...civilians, do that. We are the \n\tinstrument of policy. The tip of \n\tthe spear. So we had best be sharp.\n\t\n\tMaverick has turned to look at Ice. Ice glances back in his \n\tdirection. Maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in \n\tblue flight suits stand. They are the instructors. They look \n\trelaxed, poised, mean.  Goose is looking up front...Where Viper \n\thas stopped. Goose nudges Maverick. \n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\t   (whispers)\n\tWhat are you doing?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNothing...That's McGown...that's \n\tSinger, isn't it?\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tTurn around, pay attention. What \n\tare you doing?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t    (musing to himself)\n\t...Just wondering...(turns back) \n\t...who is the best.\n\t\n\t\n\tHe's shocked to find Viper staring right at him, with a killer \n\tgrin on his face. He's feels caught like a naughty schoolboy.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tReally...    (smiles)\n\tYa know. We'd like to know who's \n\tbest too. That's why we've got that \n\tplaque on the wall... with the Top \n\tTop Gun crew from each class. You \n\tthink maybe your name's gonna be on \n\tit?\n\t\n\tMaverick knows he's in trouble, considers the social \n\talternatives, then tells him the truth.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir.\n\t\n\tA couple of ooo's and aahh's from the guys. The instructors \n\tstare the challenge at him. He slides lower in his seat.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tConsidering the company you're in, \n\tthat's a pretty arrogant attitude.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t    (somewhat chastised)\n\tYes sir.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tI like that in a fighter pilot.  \n\t(couple of laughs from the guys) \n\tIt's okay to be confident. You have \n\tto think you're King Kong to want \n\tto try to land on carriers. Just \n\tkeep in mind the other component of \n\tsuccess...teamwork.\n\t\n\tViper gathers his notes, the lecture is over.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir.\n\t\n\tViper turns back for one more thought.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tGentlemen, this is about combat. \n\tRemember, there are no points for \n\tsecond place. Dismissed.\n\tViper walks out. Maverick finds Goose looking at him, \n\tquizzically. Others mill around the plaque.  A big, friendly bear \n\tof a RIO speaks.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tWOLFMAN\n\tA plaque?\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tIt's not the plaque. The winner can \n\tget assigned here as instructor. He \n\tgets to fight every day.\n\t\n\tThey move closer to examine the names on the plaque.\n\t\n\t\n\t44.  EXT. \"O\" CLUB - NIGHT.\n\t\n\tFast cars in the driveway, fast music blares into the \n\tnight. It's Wednesday; Animal Night. Maverick, Goose \n\tHollywood and Wolfman walk to the entrance.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t45.  INT. WOXOF BAR\n\t\n\t\n\tLoud music, low ceiling, plaques of the squadrons line the \n\twalls. A dancer gyrates on stage, largely ignored by pilots \n\ttalking with their hands. Every pretty girl in San Diego \n\tseems to be here. It's a noisy, rowdy place--a \"steam \n\treleaser\" for people under pressure. Nevertheless, there is \n\ta control to it all, there are none of the usual bar types, \n\tjust pilots and Naval Officers.\n\t\n\tThe Ghost Riders enter. The place is on fire:  a mob of \n\tdancers, flashing lights, blaring HARD ROCK MUSIC. Beer \n\tflows. Pilots talk flying and hustle girls.\n\t\n\tNEARBY - AN A7 pilot stands by the bar. He knows Goose and \n\tspeaks loudly for his benefit.. \n\t\n\t\t\tA7 PILOT\n\tYou know the Fighter Pilots motto? \n\tIt's better to be dead than to look \n\tbad.\n\t\n\tThey grin broadly. Goose replies as they brush past.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tI don't know, Frank, anybody gets \n\toff on bombing the shit out of dirt \n\thas got to be queer.\n\t\n\tGoose exchanges friendly punches with the attack pilots. \n\tMaverick's introductions and friendly barbs are drowned by the \n\tmusic. Maverick is a bit reserved. He doesn't move among the \n\tcrowd as naturally as Goose does. Hollywood and Wolfman drift \n\t\n\taway, searching for quarry. Goose orders beer. He nods toward a \n\tTALL YOUNG MAN across the room.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tKeller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew \n\thim at Pensacola. He's damn good.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIs there anybody in the Navy you \n\tdon't know? \n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tGotta keep track of the \n\tcompetition.\n\t\n\tGoose suddenly reaches out and grabs a guy moving past.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tSlider -- they let you into Top \n\tGun? If you're among the best in \n\tthe Navy, I tremble for the \n\tsecurity of this country.\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tWhy Goose, whose butt did you kiss \n\tto get here?\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tThe list is long, but \n\tdistinguished.\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tSo's my Johnson.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tThis is Maverick.\n\t\n\tSmiles good-naturedly, shakes hands with Mav. \n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tSo I've heard.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tWho's your pilot?\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tTom Kazansky.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\t    (very impressed)\n\tNo shit. The Iceman....\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tMister to you.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tYou think you can stay up with us.\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tI think, yeah, we'll show you a \n\tthing or two.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tThis is Evan Mitchell, he steers \n\tthe thing. \n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tSo I heard. Steers it pretty close. \n\tSorry to hear about Cougar. He was \n\ta good man.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tStill is..\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tYeah. That's what I meant.\n\t\n\tSuddenly, behind them, a flame shoots up. Someone ducks his head \n\tand swallows it. The pilot sets an empty glass on the bar.\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tWhat was that?\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tFlaming Hooker. Sort of an \n\tinstitution around here. Or maybe \n\tthis is the institution, I forget \n\twhich. It's the house drink. It'll \n\twarm the cockles of your heart ... \n\tand other things depending on where \n\tyou spill it.\n\t\n\tHe motions to the barmaid and she moves over, sets them up. \n\tGOOSE holds a demitasse glass. The barmaid pours Drambuie. They \n\tlook at Goose apprehensively. Goose looks at nearby flyers in \n\tCamo fatigues.\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tYou can't show fear in front of \n\tMarines...They're like Doberman's \n\tthey'll go for your throat, it's \n\tinstinctive.\n\t\n\tHe takes out match and lights it. Maverick holds his arm.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou ever done this before?\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tWhat, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!\n\t\n\t\n\tHe downs it all in one gulp, slaps the glass on the bar, still \n\taflame. He stands there, blinking. \n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tHow was it?\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tCould use a dash more jet fuel.\n\t\n\tThe others are duly impressed. Maverick's gaze falls on Ice \n\twatching from the end of the bar - Slider takes one, Maverick \n\ttakes one too, downs it in a gulp. Sundown, taking up the \n\tchallenge, motions for one. The barmaid pours it.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tCareful, don't make an ash of \n\tyourself...\n\t\n\tHe tries to drink the flaming concoction. He tries to go for a \n\tsip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame \n\taway, but that doesn't work. Finally he goes for the gulp. He \n\tburns his lip and misses.  He sets his hair on fire. It goes up \n\tin a WHOOOSH!!\n\t\n\t\t\tSUNDOWN\n\tYeow!\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tMayday! Down in flames! \n\t\n\tHe throws a beer in Sundown's face, quenching the fire. Sundown \n\tblinks through the beer.\n\t\n\t\t\tSUNDOWN\n\tThanks, I needed that.\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tYou guys are not only crazy, you're \n\tdangerous!\n\t\n\tIce comes up from the end of the bar. He motions the Barmaid for \n\tanother; it comes. Goose lights it. He gulps it down, cool as \n\thell.\n\t\t\tICE\n\t    (Disdainfully)\n\tFrat boys.\n\t\n\t\n\tHe walks away. Slider goes after him.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWho is that guy?\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tThat's Kazanski.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tNo shit! That why they call him Ice?\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tNope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. \n\tNo mistakes. Wears you down. After \n\tenough time, you just get bored and \n\tfrustrated, you do something stupid, and \n\the's got you.\n\t\n\tMaverick moves in Ice's direction. He passes Wolfman dancing \n\twith a girl with bright purple fingernails.\n\t\n\tANGLE - DANCEFLOOR.\n\t\n\t\t\tGIRL\n\tWhy do you all have such funny \n\tnames?\n\t\n\t\t\tWOLFMAN\n\tYou gotta have a call sign that's \n\tjust your own...never changes...you \n\thave to recognize it immediately. \n\tThen, if someone shouts \"Wolf, \n\tbreak left!\"..you react right away.\n\t\n\t\t\tGIRL\n\tWhy do they call you Wolf?\n\t\n\t\t\tWOLDFMAN\n\t   (smiles)\n\tOh, I don't know.\n\t\n\tGoose comes up with his arm around a girl.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tHey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't \n\tbelieve a word I say. Tell her I'm \n\tmarried, will you?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYeah, he's married--but then again, \n\the,s not dead.\n\t\n\tSally laughs and tries to pull Goose back toward the dance \n\tfloor. Something in Maverick's eyes makes him hang back with his \n\tpartner.\n\tANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - DANCERS\n\t\n\t\t\tGIRL\n\tCould I get a call sign?\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tWOLFMAN\n\tWell, I don't know. That depends.\n\t\n\t\t\tGIRL\n\tOn what?\n\t\n\t\t\tWOLFMAN\n\tWell, it doesn't just happen, you \n\tgotta do something famous.\n\t\n\t\t\tGIRL\n\tLike what?\n\t\n\t\t\tWOLFMAN\n\tOh...I'll think of something.\n\t\n\tMaverick smiles at this, but seems on edge... He watches a few \n\tpretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits, then \n\tturns and walks up to Ice, who sits, drinking with Slider.\n\tMaverick walks over to him. Ice notices Slider's attention going \n\tto Maverick. He turns and grins at him.\n\t\n\t\t\tICEMAN\n\tFigured it out yet?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tFigured out what?\n\t\n\t\t\tICEMAN\n\tWho is the best.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNope.\n\t\n\t\t\tICEMAN\n\tNeed a hint?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI think I can work it out on my \n\town.\n\t\n\t\t\tICEMAN\n\tYou like to work alone. I've heard \n\tthat about you. \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI've heard of you, too. You were in \n\t124 with Bargamian.\n\t\n\t\t\tICEMAN\n\tAnd you were with Cougar. He was my \n\troommate in flight school.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHe's a good man.\n\t\t\tICEMAN\n\tThe best.\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tYou must have soloed under a lucky \n\tstar. First the MiG, then you slide \n\tinto Cougar's place.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tIt's not Cougar's place. It's ours. \n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tWhat do you think it was? Was it \n\tthat MiG contact that did it?\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tDid what?\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tGot you here.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tWe're here because we're the best \n\tflyers in the wing. Not because of \n\tsome MiG encounter.\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tWhat luck! Guys fly their whole \n\tcareer without seeing a MiG up \n\tclose...You're famous.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tYou mean notorious.\n\t\n\tSomething in the way he says it. It's not quite a joke, more an \n\tinsult. Maverick's about to take the whole conversation too far \n\twhen something...someone catches his eye. She catches quite a few \n\teyes in this room. She is very pretty and she's walking in on the \n\tarm of a Commander. Maverick turns back, but the moment has \n\tpassed. Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile. Goose pulls \n\thim away.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat do these guys think, I made \n\tCougar quit?\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tPay no attention to it. They're \n\tjust trying to rattle you. It's all \n\tpsychological. Sit down..and drink.\n\t\n\t\n\tHe deposits Maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots \n\tcluster watching and listening to Bugs shoot down his wristwatch. \n\tMaverick broods...\n\t\t\tBUGS\n\tWe were just really diving down and by \n\tthen we were right over downtown \n\tHaiphong.  It was some great shit. Jack \n\tsays, \"What are you doing?\" \"What, what \n\tam I doing, Jack?\" He says, \"What are \n\tyou doing?\" I said, \"I'm rolling in, \n\tJack.\" \"Bugs, we're at thirty-two \n\thundred feet. Oh shit, we were like \n\tzooom... So we scraped down at hundred \n\tfeet right over--downtown Hanoi!  Oh \n\tshit, goddamn it! And blowing down the \n\triver. And so once we were there we let \n\tdown to about fifty feet just going down \n\tthe river and Jack says... \"Bugs... \n\tdon't ever do that again!\" \"Okay, right, \n\tJack, I'll never do that again!\"\n\t\n\tMaverick pays little or no attention. He broods and drinks. \n\tSuddenly, Hollywood nudges him, he turns.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat, what is it?\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tTarget passing. Check your six.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNever mind mine. Check hers.\n\t\n\tThey turn. Long legs, great ass, beautiful.\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tHer six is a ten! Uh oh, a turn to \n\tengage.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tHIS POV - ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM\n\t\n\tMaverick sees a stranger, and somehow he knows, he knows even \n\tthen.  Wolfman turns, sees her walking too.\n\t\n\t\t\tWOLFMAN\n\tBogey...9 o'clock level.\n\t\n\t\t\tSUNDOWN\n\tNine thirty. Bogey?  You presume \n\tthat hostile?\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\t\n\tWell, we should contact and check \n\tit out.\n\t\n\t\n\tShe has turned toward them. She passes by. They start to make a \n\tmove for her. But just then she finds her date at the bar; a \n\tdistinguished man with Captain's stripes. Their smiles freeze and \n\tthey slide back in their chairs. Maverick can't stop looking at \n\ther...After a while, the intensity of his gaze draws her \n\tattention. She feels him. She is nodding and smiling to her date, \n\tbut her eyes scan the room like radar. A warning tone goes off in \n\this brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him. He feels that \n\tthrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're \n\ttargeted in someone's scope. Her eyes hold on him for a long \n\tmoment...long enough, and then sweep by the rest of the room. She \n\tturns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something \n\the says.\n\t\n\t\n\tOver in a corner, Goose chats up a couple of San Diego girls.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tThe family unit -- that's the most \n\timportant thing. It's the only \n\tthing you can count on. I'm married \n\t--did I tell you that?\n\t\n\t\t\tFIRST GIRL\n\tFour times. We don't believe you.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tI've been married since I was \n\teighteen. Why don't you believe me?\n\t\n\t\t\tSECOND GIRL\n\tBecause you don't look married. \n\t\n\t\t\tFIRST GIRL\n\tYou're not even wearing a ring.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\t    (big smile)\n\tI take it off when I'm chasing \n\twomen. It's the only honorable \n\tthing to do.\n\t\n\t\n\tANGLE - MAVERICK\n\t\n\tHe's half listening to Bugs rattle on.  His eyes are drawn back \n\tto the woman. He tries not to stare. She seems to know a lot of \n\tpeople in the club. He looks away. Hollywood is chatting up a \n\tgirl with a sincerity that cannot be taught. His line is just as \n\tpolished as his appearance.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tYou don't think about death up \n\tthere, but you think a lot about \n\tthe danger. One mistake and you're \n\ta smoking hole in the ground.\n\t\n\t\t\tGIRL\n\tI never knew it was so dangerous.\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tOh yeah, it makes everything down \n\there more meaningful. You feel a \n\tcertain intensity of life, and you \n\twant to grab onto every moment.\n\t\n\tMaverick looks up at the bar again. A shock. She (Charlie) is \n\tstaring right at him, intensely, as her date whispers something \n\tin her ear. She notices him, staring back, quickly looks away, \n\tembarrassed. She says something to the man. He nods and turns \n\taway as someone else grabs his attention. The woman, now wouldn't \n\tlook this way for anything. She picks up her purse from the bar \n\tand walks through the crowd and out of the room. Impulsively, \n\tMaverick's up, he follows. \n\t\n\t\n\t46.  INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE BAR\n\t\n\tHe breaks out, looks around, doesn't see her. Someone disappears \n\taround a corner. He moves after.\n\t\n\tCORNER - A door slams shut. Impulsively, before he realizes what \n\the is doing, he's through it. \n\t\n\t\n\t47.  WOMEN'S ROOM. \n\t\n\tA feminine GASP!  He should have looked at the sign on the door. \n\tThe realization of where he is hits him too late. She is standing \n\tby the mirror, with her make-up out, looking back at him. He's \n\tnot quite sure what to do. A hasty retreat would be appropriate, \n\tif embarrassing. Ah, what the hell, he is a fighter pilot!  He \n\tjust walks right over to her...no idea what he will say. She's \n\tgot her lipstick out, twisting it. She looks over at him with an \n\tamused smile.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tLong cruise, was it?\n\t\n\tShe leans over the sink, puts on lipstick, sees his eyes cover \n\ther.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tAnything I can do to help, Lieutenant?\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tLots of things. \n\t\n\tShe laughs. He is sort of attractive, but there are other girls \n\tin the room, she doesn't want to be too encouraging...She tries \n\tnot to grin at his embarrassment.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI'll bet!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tUhhh...Anything I can do for you?\n\tShe laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, \n\tbut she's instinctively attracted.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYeah. Hold this. It might be safer.\n\t\n\tShe hands him a makeup mirror. Starts redoing her lipstick. He \n\tjust stares at her...She looks up at him, than back to her \n\twarpaint. Finally, when it comes, it is cool and amused.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tNow I know why all the girls come \n\there. They know how horny you guys \n\tget. But this...is ridiculous.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIt's not that.\n\t\n\tMock anger. She's toying with him.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tIt isn't?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWell, it is. It is that, too.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tThat's a big comfort to me.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI could be, too.\n\t\n\t \t\tCHARLIE\n\tHow so?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tSave you from a big mistake with \n\tthat other guy.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tAnd on to a bigger one with you?\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYeah, most likely.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWas there ever a girl who didn't \n\tlike fighter pilots?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI heard of one once.\n\t\n\tShe laughs again, shakes her head...another cowboy! She gently \n\ttakes the compact out of his hands, snaps it closed.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI'm really flattered, Lieutenant, \n\tbut I don't go out with pilots.\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tThen what are you doing here?\n\t\n\tThree pretty blondes enter and look at Maverick quizzically but \n\tnot without interest.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI think the question is...what are \n\tyou?\n\t\n\tShe tries to keep a straight face as she walks out of the room. \n\t\n\tThe other girls look at him expectantly.  A beat.  He just \n\tstands there, then realizes he's holding her lipstick. \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHi. I'm here to talk about a new \n\tconcept in cosmetics...\n\t\n\t47A.  WOXOF BAR. She returns, spots the Captain, motioning to \n\ther.  Maverick enters, goes to the other end of the bar. He \n\torders a drink. It comes. He drinks it, pays for it, moves off \n\ttoward the door. Someone backs into his path, he moves quickly \n\tand bumps into someone else; her. \n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tSorry.\n\t\n\tShe sees it's him.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tMy fault. Should have watched\n\twhere I was going.\n\t\n\tHer hand goes to his collar. She adjusts his insignia. She \n\tsmiles.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\n\tWhere's your wing man? Who's \n\twatching your six?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tUh, nobody, I guess.\n\t\n\tOne final adjustment.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tToo bad.\n\t\n\tShe breaks the spell abruptly, turns away.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tSee you around.\n\t\n\tMaverick finds his voice.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tCan I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI'm with someone. \n\t\n\t\n\t48.  EXT. \"O\" CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\t\n\tP.O.V. - \n\t\n\tFrom a car in the parking lot, we see Charlie and the Captain \n\tleave the club. They walk directly toward us and stop. She turns, \n\tsays something polite...a peck on the cheek. He turns away. A \n\tdome light briefly illuminates the interior of the car as a door \n\topens. It rocks slightly as someone gets in. Charlie turns back \n\tand walks over, taking her keys out. She opens the door to the \n\tcar and gets in. \n\t\n\t\n\t48A.  EXT. CAR - NIGHT\n\t\n\tShe starts the car and pulls away. Suddenly, a figure sits up in \n\tthe back.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI thought he'd never leave.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYeow!\n\t\n\tStartled, she nearly drives off the road. She turns to him, \n\tstartled.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou! What are you doing here?\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tEverybody's got to be somewhere.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWhat if Captain Dawson had come \n\twith me?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIt would have been really \n\tembarrassing!\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tHow did you know this was my car?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tSimple deduction. It's fast. It's \n\tpretty. Sleek and stylish...It's \n\tyour color...matches your lipstick.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tThat's all!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tAnd I asked someone.\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou think you're pretty smart.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI think I'm in love.\n\t\n\t\n\t49.  EXT. GUARD GATE\n\t\n\tShe pulls up at the guard gate, a MARINE CORPORAL is on duty. He \n\tsees the pretty girl pull up and stop, leans over helpfully.\n\t\n\t\t\tMARINE\n\tCan I help you, Ma'am?\n\t\n\tShe smiles even more sweetly.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI don't know, Corporal. Can you do \n\tanything about this lunatic?\n\t\n\tThe car door swings open. Maverick gets out. The car roars away. \n\tHe stands in the glare of the spotlight...rocking on his heels, \n\tlooking across at the guard, who snaps to attention and stares \n\tholes in his chest.\n\t\n\t\n\t50.  INT. TOP GUN - NEXT MORNING. \n\t\n\t\n\tTwo guys in flight suits run down stairs past stencils of MiG \n\tkills on walls, then down corridor.\n\t\n\t\t\tFLEX\n\tNot so fast...my head.\n\t\n\tThey skid to stop outside a door.\n\t\n\t\n\t51.  INT. HANGAR\n\t\n\tGround crews work on planes in B.G. Jester in middle of lecture.\n\tDoor bursts open. Sundown and Flex skid to a halt when they see \n\twhole class looking at them.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tWho are you?\n\t\n\t\t\tSUNDOWN\n\tI'm Sundown.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tYeah, right. You're late.\n\t\n\t\n\tViper breaks in, indicating Flex.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tAnd who are you?\n\t\n\t\t\tFLEX\n\tFlex \n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tFlex...? You don't look like Flex  \n\tto me. You call that muscle? \n\tDoesn't look like muscle. Looks \n\tlike...Pork.\n\t\n\tThey laugh. Even Sundown has to laugh, scratching his chest.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tWhat're you laughing at? You're \n\tFungus.\n\t\n\tStops scratching.\n\t\t\tSUNDOWN/FUNGUS\n\tFungus!\n\t\n\t\t\tPORK\n\tDon't make an issue of it, it'll \n\tstick.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS (Unhappily)\n\t\n\tIt'll stick anyway. \n\t\n\tViper turns away...\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tNow to continue. In this class we \n\twill be dealing with F-5's and \n\tA4's, as our MiG simulators. \n\tTechnically the F-5 does not have \n\tthe thrust to weight ratio of the \n\tMiG-21--it also does not bleed \n\tenergy below 300 knots like the \n\tMiG-21 does. The A4 does not turn \n\tas well as the MiG-17 but has \n\tsignificantly better visibility.\n\t\n\tMaverick looks back to his notes. SFX footsteps...door \n\topening. Viper looks up to back of room door.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tHi, Charlie. Good, our TAGREF's \n\there. Charlie's the most qualified \n\tto get into P subs and curves, and \n\tVN diagrams.\n\t\n\tMaverick turns to see the TAGREF walk forward.  Maverick \n\tstares at her as she passes without acknowledging him. He is \n\tsurprised, embarrassed.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tCharlotte Blackwood--code name Charlie-- \n\tnot your ordinary TAGREF. Charlie has \n\ther Ph.D. in astrophysics--she's a \n\tcivilian contractor so you don't salute \n\ther...or anything else. Is that clear?\n\t\n\tShe walks to the front and starts her presentation. She \n\ttalks about something very technical, arcane. MiG tactics, \n\ttechnology. As the briefing rattles on, Maverick reacts to \n\ther. Goose glances over at him. He, too, recognizes the girl. \n\tHe looks at his partner. Maverick feels his stare.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tHello, I think I have some new data for \n\tyou...Now a MiG 21 has a problem with \n\tthe inverted flight tanks. It won't do a \n\tNegative G push over. Even below one G, \n\tthey risk a flame out. Operationally, \n\tthey will do a zero to one G only.\n\t\n\tA snicker from the audience. She hesitates momentarily, goes \n\ton.\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\n\tThe latest intelligence shows that \n\tthe most they will do in operation \n\tis one....is there something wrong, \n\tLieutenant.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI don't think you're altogether \n\tright...about the MiG, that is.\n\t\n\tShe stops--some of the pilots look at him. Viper glares.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI beg your pardon.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNo, I beg yours. But I don't think \n\tyou're right on that.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWhy not?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI saw one.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou saw a MiG 21?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t    (She doesn't believe him)\n\tWhere did you see that?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIt's classified.\n\t\n\tNervous buzz in the room. Viper goes rigid. Charlie can't \n\tbelieve it.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tIt's what?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIt's classified. Like Hollywood \n\tsays, I could tell you, but then \n\tI'd have to kill you.\n\t\n\tPork stifles a laugh, the others chuckle. Viper is \n\tembarrassed.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tMaverick!!!\n\t\n\t\n\tShe stops Viper with a glance.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tIt's all right.\n\t\n\tShe can handle it. She is very cool, not overbearing. She \n\tsays it calmly. She doesn't want to embarrass him any more \n\tthan he is, but she has to get the facts straight.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t Lieutenant, I have a top secret \n\tclearance. The Pentagon sees to it \n\tthat I know more than you.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNot in this case.\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t    (Flatly.)\n\tYou saw a MiG push negative 4G?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes, ma'am.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWhere were you?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tOn his six.\n\t\n\tLittle stifled laughs.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tHe was in a 4G Negative dive and \n\tyou were on his six?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes, ma'am, At first. Then I was \n\tdirectly above him.\n\t\n\tShe stares at him for a moment, then she has him. She goes \n\tfor the kill.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tIf you were directly above him, how \n\tdid you see him?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI was inverted.\n\t\n\tA real buzz in the room.  Ice laughs audibly.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou were in a 4G inverted dive with \n\ta MiG 21?   (She can't believe it.)\n\t\n\tAt what range ?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tTwo.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tTwo miles.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tTwo meters.\n\t\n\t\n\tChuckles, barely suppressed.

The finger.\n\t\n\tHe shows her, but she can handle this. \n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tSo you're the reason those\n\tSALT talks failed.\n\t\n\tThe room breaks into laughter. At him. Now he grows red. \n\tGoose puts his hand on Maverick's arm, shakes his head as if \n\tto say: \"Let it go, pal, she got you\". \n\t\n\tShe looks at Viper. He doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. \n\tHe knows there's something here he doesn't control.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tLieutenant!\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tIt's just like he says, sir.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\t    (He snaps)\n\tI don't care!\n\t\n\t\n\t51A. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE LECTURE HALL\n\t\n\tShe walks away. He runs up and stops her.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhy didn't you tell me you were a \n\tTAGREF?\n\t\n\tShe studies him coolly for a moment, like a specimen.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tIt never came up.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou let me make a fool of myself.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou seemed determined to do that \n\tanyway.. Why didn't you tell me you \n\twere a famous MiG insulter?\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWould it have made a difference? \n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tNo.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat would?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou know, I'm assigned to this \n\tschool. I see sixteen new hotshots \n\tevery eight weeks. Your attention \n\tis flattering, but not really \n\tproductive. Why don't you keep your \n\tmind on flying.\n\t\n\tShe reaches over and aligns his collar insignia.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWhy can't you keep this straight?\n\t\n\tShe smiles at him and walks away. Maverick turns, sees the \n\tothers sizing him up. Most of them grin. Maverick moves down \n\tthe corridor past the CO's Office. Viper leans against the \n\t\n\tdoorsill. He lights a pipe, laconically eyes Maverick. His \n\ttone gives away nothing, like an ELINT probe eliciting a \n\tresponse.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tMaverick... Where'd you get that \n\tcall sign?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tAhhh... Runs in the family, sir.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tYou're father was Marvin Mitchell..\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tA good man. Good flyer.\n\t\n\tViper turns away. \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYes sir. Thank you sir.\n\t\n\tMaverick watches him for a beat, he's been tested, but he's \n\tnot sure how or why. He turns to catch up with Goose and the \n\tothers.\n\t\n\tEXT. SKY - LATER\n\t\n\tAt twenty-eight thousand feet, the two planes circle each \n\tother, going in opposite directions. As they jockey for \n\tposition, they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips.\n\t\n\tThe earth spins, the horizon appears and disappears. With \n\teach hard turn, Maverick and Goose can be heard \"grunting\" to \n\tkeep blood in their brains, to keep from passing out.\n\t\n\tThe fight is hard, physical, and exhausting. The extreme G \n\tforces--6.5--flatten them against their seats, causing their \n\theads to weigh over one hundred pounds. Maverick strains to \n\tturn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at \n\tMach One. \n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI've lost him -- where is he?\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tOn your six -- coming hard. Four \n\thundred. Losing airspeed! He's on \n\tyour six and closing fast!\n\tHard left! HARD LEFT!\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick jerks the stick left, and the F-14 takes an \n\tastonishing turn. Jester ROARS past into a wide arc.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tGreat move. Great\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHe should've had me.\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tTake it down. Let's bug out of \n\there. Call for a draw.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNo way. I'll nail him this time. \n\tGoing vertical.\n\t\n\t\n\tTHE PLANE EXPLODES INTO AFTERBURNER - rocketing toward \n\tspace. Jester is left in direct line with the sun, and his \n\tcanopy is sprayed with a blinding glare. Going ballistic is \n\tdangerous. The plane flys like a bullet, obeying the laws of \n\tphysics, not the pilot's touch on control surfaces. The \n\tballistic call warns other aircraft that he is, for the \n\tmoment, out of control.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tHe's blind -- you got him!\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tNO JOY! NO JOY! WHERE ARE YOU?\n\tI'VE LOST SIGHT.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tHe's out of energy! You got \n\tcontrol? Unload!\n\t\n\tThe F-14 peels over the egg, in a backward dive. It rockets \n\tdown the outside, gaining energy. Over the ROAR of jets, the \n\tSCREAM of the wind, Goose shouts data, but it is muffled, a \n\tdistant voice in a typhoon. Through the canopy, we see \n\tJester, and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of \n\ta falcon.\n\t\n\tPILOT'S POV - HUD in windscreen - a diamond in a box. \n\tMaverick lines up the diamond with Jester, and we hear the \n\thigh pitched tone BEEPING.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tWE'RE BELOW THE HARD DECK. FIGHT'S \n\tOFF.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tHe's right. We're at ten thousand.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNo way. I got you, sucker. You're \n\tgoing down.\n\t\n\tJester maneuvers, but Maverick keeps him in the gunsight. \n\tThe BEEPING is louder, faster.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIn the envelope. FOX TWO MISSILE \n\tSHOT. YOU'RE GONE, JESTER, DEAD! \n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\t    (stunned)\n\tGoddamn! We beat him!\n\t\n\tThere is an edge of anger in Jester's voice.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tROGER FOX TWO. GET YOUR BUTTS ABOVE \n\tTHE HARD DECK. RETURN TO BASE \n\tIMMEDIATELY.\n\t              \n\tThey are brought up short for a moment, then the thrill of \n\tvictory gets the best of them. Goose lets out a war whoop. \n\tThe F-14 sweeps up, rolls into an Immelman..\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWe did it!\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tLook, Ma, top of the world!\n\t\n\t\n\t52A.  EXT. MIRAMAR - LANDING PATTERN.\n\t\n\tMaverick's Tomcat breaks hard and high, rolls over on its \n\tside, wings perpendicular to the ground. Goose sees the world \n\tgo sideways.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tAhhh...A little high on the left, \n\tdon't you think?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tRight.\n\t\n\tHe aileron rolls another quarter turn. Inverted, they pass \n\tright down the runway.  Goose looks out and insouciantly \n\twatches the world go by at 300 knots, upside down.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tRight. Much better. ...Ahhh...what \n\tdo you call this?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIt's a victory roll.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tI wouldn't call it victory.  It's \n\tmore like...self immolation.\n\t\n\t\n\t52B.  INT. CONTROL TOWER \n\t\n\tControllers work. Officers watch the landing activity. One \n\told salt, turns from the coffee machine, a cup of steaming \n\tJava microns from his lips. A ROAR. VABOOM! The Tomcat roars \n\tover. He yelps as hot coffee flys all over his shirt.         \n\t                                                    52C.  \n\tEXT.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY\n\t\n\tPilots half undressed. Maverick and Goose enter the room, \n\tcarrying their helmets. The students look up at them, and \n\tGoose suddenly flashes a thumb's up sign with a grin. The \n\tstudents react with clenched fists, ad libs, high fives, \n\tvictory punches.\n\t\n\t\t\tWOLFMAN\n\tYou won?!!!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tDidn't everybody?\n\t\n\t\"Oooo\" -- they all go \"ooo\" and laugh.\n\t                                                 \n\t\t\tWOLFMAN\n\tNo, we...got our butts kicked.\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tThirty seconds.

The students celebrate Ice's win.  Ice handles the \n\tattention with the easy composure of one who is used to it. \n\tMaverick ignores him and begins to peel out of his G-suit. \n\tIce moves toward his locker.\n\t                                                      ***\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tYou won. \n\tCongratulations.\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tMaverick and Goose won too.\n\t\n\tIce talks into his locker.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tThat's not what I heard.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tWe won! \n\tIce turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his \n\tlocker, dismissing them.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tBelow the hard deck doesn't count. \n\tYou guys are the second team, \n\taren't you?\n\t\n\tMaverick gets up, moves to him, starts to say something, \n\twhen Jester, breaks into the room.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tMaverick, Goose. Viper's office. Now!\n\t\n\t\n\t53A. INT. TOPGUN CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CO'S OFFICE.\n\t\n\t\n\tSCREAMING AND YELLING.

Behind the CO'S door, \n\tsomeone is screaming his head off.\n\t\n\t\n\tBOOM! The door bursts open. A big, brawling Officer - Johnson, \n\tthe Air Boss - blasts out, nearly smashing into a female petty \n\tofficer. She almost spills her coffee. Johnson looks right and \n\tleft in fury too strong for words. He looks like he wants to \n\tsmash something. They move out of his way, but he justs blasts \n\tthrough the door and disappears down the hall.\n\tThe enlisted men turn to Viper's office.\n\t\n\t\n\t53D  THEIR POV\n\t\n\tJester stands inside stonefaced. Maverick and Goose are \n\trigid. Viper...with excess calm deliberation, softly walks \n\tover, grasps the doornob. He glances in this direction. The \n\tglance is totally without expression, and even scarier for \n\tthat.\n\t                                                  ***\n\t53D. ANGLE ENLISTED (MEN)\n\t\n\tIn a flash, each man finds something totally engrossing in \n\this work, or something terribly important to do elsewhere. \n\tSlowly, steadily, Viper swings his door closed.54.  INT. \n\tVIPER'S OFFICE \n\t\n\tHe moves over to face Maverick. There is a SILENCE like \n\tafter a train wreck; nothing but the POPPING of sprung metal \n\tand the low GASP of escaping steam. Viper speaks quietly, \n\tlike a funeral director consoling the living. Makes you want \n\tto scream.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tWell....That about covers the \n\tflyby. \n\t\n\tJester almost breaks into a grin.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tNow...in addition...you broke two \n\tmajor rules of engagement. And... \n\tThat's ...not good.\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick gives no response. Viper continues.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tLieutenant Candela lost sight of \n\tyou, and called \"no joy\". You \n\tfailed to respond. \n\t\n\tHe stops and looks at Maverick... A beat. Maverick finally \n\tnods \n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tWhy?\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick is exhausted. It's been a long, rough day. His \n\tvoice is a horse whisper.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI had him in view. I was peeling \n\tover the egg, into a dive. He saw \n\tme when I moved in for the kill. \n\tThere wasn't any danger...\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\t    (to Goose)\n\tIs that how you remember it?\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tYes, sir. By the time we could \n\trespond, we were diving right into \n\this view.\n\t\n\tViper is not satisfied with the answer, but he moves on.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tThe hard deck for this hop was ten \n\tthousand feet. Jester, at what \n\tpoint did you call off the fight?\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tJust below ten thousand.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tBut you continued to fight.\n\t\n\tAnother pause, another grudging nod.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tWhy?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWe weren't below for more than ten \n\tseconds. There was no danger. I had \n\tthe shot. I took it.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tThe rules of engagement are not \n\tflexible. They exist for your  \n\tsafety. You will obey them.\n\tIs that clear?\n\t\n\tMaverick thinks about continuing the discussion, but the \n\tthought is momentary. He quickly cuts his losses, gives Viper \n\twhat he thinks he wants...He is just on the cusp of too \n\tsincere.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t\n\tYes sir, perfectly clear. I guess \n\twe were ...I was... just a little \n\tover enthusiastic.\n\t\n\tViper measures him for a moment, then lets it go.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tI guess you were. Dismissed.\n\t\n\tMaverick and Goose leave the room. Viper looks at Jester, \n\tpicks up Maverick's fitness report. Doesn't read it, looks \n\tback at Jester.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tI don't know what to tell you, \n\tSkip.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tTell me one thing.\n\t\n\tJester waits.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\t...If you had to go into combat, \n\twould you want him with you?\n\t\n\tJester turns, walks slowly around the room. The walls are \n\tlined with pictures; planes and pilots...history. There are \n\tMiG killers, attack squadrons, ground personnel...There's one \n\tpicture of a Phantom in flight with the backseater mooning \n\tthe camera. Other pictures show carriers, famous flyers, \n\tprevious CO's. Finally Jester replys.   \n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tYep.\n\t\n\tViper slaps shut the fitness report. \n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tHe's seat of the pants... \n\tCompletely unpredictable -- nothing \n\tby the book.

Of \n\tcourse it had to be Ice and Slider.Charlie sits and watches \n\tas the game gets immediately out of hand. In moments, \n\tMaverick and Ice rotate to forward positions directly \n\topposite each other across the net. Other revelers turn to \n\twatch as it degenerates (?) to more than a game. Maverick \n\tglances at Charlie. He seems uncomfortable, but irrevocably \n\tdrawn into the confrontation. She says nothing, but her \n\tattitude is apparent. Back to the game: Slider and Goose set \n\tthem up, as they try to spike the ball in each other's face. \n\tThe final point...up over the middle. They both go up, \n\tMaverick smashes, Ice blocks, but the ball sails away, off \n\this forearm. For the first time ever, Maverick beats him. He \n\tlooks over at Charlie, she is staring out to sea. She looks \n\tback at him and he's suddenly had enough competition. They \n\tcall for another game, but Maverick turns away...\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tCome on, come on! It's double or \n\tnothing..

The TACTS Range is an area of the desert \n\tcompletely enveloped by computerized radar. The computers \n\t\n\tcalculate a number of aircraft's positions and velocities by \n\tmeans of transponders in the ships and ground stations that \n\ttalk to each other thousands of times a second.

He jerks the stick right, and the two \n\tplanes make a quick pass.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tSNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tENGAGING THE OTHER GUY.\n\tWOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tJust cover Wood, Maverick.\n\tMutual support, man!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI'm gonna take him, Goose.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tDon't be greedy. Stay with Wood.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI want him!\n\t\n\tMaverick goes suddenly vertical, zooms straight up.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tHey, come on--hey!\n\t\n\tMaverick loops the F-14 down to get the quick angle on Viper \n\tin Bogey Two. Viper takes off, running from the fight again. \n\tMaverick looks over his shoulder and sees that Hollywood \n\tstill has a good position on Bogey One. He takes a hard right \n\tand streaks off after Viper.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tWhat what are you doing?\n\tWe're cover!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWood's okay. I want Viper.\n\t\n\tGoose looks back at Hollywood and Bogey One.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tBut we're cover!\n\t\n\t\n\tViper streaks across the sky with Maverick close behind. He \n\tpushes the throttle forward to ZONE 5 - full afterburner.\n\tViper shows all his tricks...hard left, hard right, rolling \n\tinto vertical, flipping into a dive. Maverick stays with him. \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER (To himself)\n\tGoddamn, rookie, you're all right!\n\t\n\t\n\t79.  INT. F-14\n\t\n\tMaverick turns to get Viper in the diamond. He hears a \n\tSIDEWINDER GROWL in his headset.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat's the range, Goose. I've got a \n\tgood tone.\n\t\n\tViper jinks but Maverick stays with him.  Viper is in the \n\tdiamond, and the TONE GOES CRAZY. But suddenly....\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tTwo bogies ! Three o'clock high, \n\tnine o'clock high! Break!\n\t\n\tThey come out of nowhere, flashing down toward Maverick--a \n\tcrossfire ambush. Maverick's eyes are startled.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tATOLL ON THE NORTHERN F-14. HE'S \n\tOUT OF THE FIGHT..\n\t\n\tMaverick is stunned. He has been tricked, humiliated. \n\tThere's a little salt for the wound as Viper and Jester \n\tcelebrate.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\t \tWALKED RIGHT INTO IT.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tNOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR \n\tWINGMAN. NICE GOING. \n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tTHE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REGRETS TO \n\tINFORM YOU THAT YOUR SONS ARE DEAD \n\tBECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID! \n\t\n\tSlaps his helmet like a dolt...\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tKNOCK OFF THE CHATTER, TOP GUNS. \n\tLET'S RTB. VIPER HAS THE LEAD.\n\t\n\t\n\t80.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY\n\t\n\tSilence. Several pilots in various forms of undress. \n\tMaverick and Goose sit with their heads down, a hangdog \n\texpression on their faces.\n\t\n\t81.  INT. DIRTY DAN'S - A BAR - \n\tLATER\n\t\n\tMaverick mopes at the bar, a figure comes up behind him.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tYa know, that was the best flying \n\tI've seen since Nam...(He grins) \n\t...Right up to that part where you \n\tgot killed.\n\t\n\tViper sits down. He's in a jovial, taunting mood.  Maverick \n\twatches him guardedly.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tTwenty years' experience, I \n\tcouldn't shake you. You may be a \n\tgreat flyer. I mean that.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI lost.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tOf course you did. I said a great \n\tflyer, not a smart one. You fly \n\treckless. Great instincts. No \n\tdiscipline. That ambush today, you \n\tfollowed your emotions instead of \n\tyour wingman. Of course you got \n\tkilled...and well deserved to. It \n\twas a really stupid mistake. In \n\tbattle, it gets people killed.\n\t\n\tMaverick nods and stares at his beer.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI can take care of myself.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tTalent is no holy shield. Von \n\tRichtofen was killed by a farm boy. \n\tInstincts are not enough. Do it our \n\tway. We've worked these things out. \n\tThe good pilots can become better \n\tand the great ones can learn how to \n\tstay alive.  (he studies him for a \n\tmoment)  Why do you have to do \n\teverything the hard way?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIt's my own way. It works for me.  \n\tI don't care about the rest of that \n\tstuff.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tThen why are you here?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tFor the same reason you are.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tOh, you mean the thrill!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tThe flying. The fighting.  I'd go \n\tup there ten times a day to fight. \n\tI'd win at least nine of them. \n\tThat's all I want to do. It's what \n\tI do best. I am real good.  Just \n\tgive me the jet.\n\t\n\tViper studies him,\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tIt's not a gift, just a loan...\n\t\n\tHe finishes his beer, then rises.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tNine out of ten is okay, as long as \n\tit's only fun and games. But this \n\tisn't about that. This is serious \n\tbusiness. It is dangerous up there! \n\tAt 500 knots, things can change a \n\tlot in a second. Discipline is what \n\tprotects us.\n\t\n\tHe signals the bartender and drops some money on the bar. He \n\tstretches, looks around. \n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tIt was a good day. You learned \n\tsomething. You lost and you're \n\tstill alive to think about it. And, \n\tyou lost your wingman. That's a \n\tcardinal sin...don't ever do it \n\tagain. You owe Hollywood an apology \n\tand you owe me a beer.\n\t\n\tViper touches Maverick's shoulder as he moves away. It was \n\tjust the gesture Maverick needed, for he seems to relax from \n\this tension. He sips his beer alone.\n\t\n\t\n\t82.  INT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMaverick and Goose move through the terminal, \n\tanxious/expectant looks on their faces.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tRelationships are a bitch, here. \n\tIt's hard enough to concentrate \n\t...under the pressure. Having a \n\twoman here is asking for it.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI guess that's what I'm doing, \n\tthen.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tWhere do you find the time? Where \n\tdo you find the energy. It's tough \n\tenough to keep your mind on school. \n\tA woman here is a real pain in \n\tthe...\n\t\n\t\n\tA pretty woman emerges from the crowd and spots them first. \n\tShe rushes them, happily, carrying her sleepy four-year-old, \n\tRICKY. Goose undergoes an immediate change, beaming a big \n\tsmile that he has practiced on her for years. She sets down \n\tthe kid.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\t...butt...Hi, honey, God, am I glad \n\tto see you! I missed you.\n\t\n\tGoose wraps his arms around Carol, smack, a kiss. She smiles \n\tat Maverick, turns back to Goose.\n\t\n\t\t\tCAROL\n\tI had to come, Willard, I got so \n\tlonesome I just couldn't stand it.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tSure, honey, I understand. It's \n\tgreat to see you. Hey where's your \n\tbackseater, where's the world's \n\tsmallest RIO..\n\t\n\tHe looks all around and then down at the kid, hiding shyly \n\tbehind his mother's skirts. Goose grabs up the kid and zooms \n\thim around, a game they've played before, every six months or \n\tso. The kid laughs happily.  Maverick just sort of smiles to \n\thimself and shakes his head.\n\t\n\t83.  OMITTED\n\t\n\t84.  A POOL (OR BEACH)\n\t\n\tMaverick comes to the surface. She enters frame by the side \n\tof the pool.  She hands him a split fresh pineapple. He eats \n\tit in the  most salacious manner possible. He's so contented, \n\the's babbling.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tFood...and you...my F-14!\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tIn that order?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWell no...inverse order.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI'm still second best.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou ever fly an F-14?\n\t    (She laughs.)\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI don't fly in anything that\n\t\tdoesn't show movies.\n\t\n\tHe gets out, grabs a towel, moves over to some chairs. His \n\tflight suit is draped over one. He moves it to sit down.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tAhhh, you'd love it. Night carrier \n\tlandings! The most dangerous thing \n\tyou can think of! ...next to \n\tyou...And the most exciting. You're \n\tliving at one hundred and ten per \n\tcent. Greatest high in the world... \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tDanger?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t    (of course).\n\tYeah! \n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tDoesn't it ever bother you?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhy, what's gonna happen?\n\t\n\tHis flight suit slips onto the ground. Charlie retrieves it. \n\tAs she lifts the suit, something falls out of the pocket. \n\tLooks like a gold coin. She picks it up. Maverick is drying \n\this hair. She holds the object out to him, questioning. He \n\tsees it, quickly takes it, stuffs it back into his pocket.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tLucky charm.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWhat do you take me for? It's a \n\tNavy Cross.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tJust good luck.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWhere'd you get it.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tPawn shop. What's to eat?\n\t\n\tHe roots through a picnic basket.\n\t\n\t\n\t84A.  MONTAGE - PREFLIGHT ACTIVITY\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER (V.O.) \n\t...MiG sweep over the water.  You \n\twill proceed down the one-seven \n\t-zero degree radial looking for \n\tMiGs. You will engage all that you \n\tfind, destroy them, and return to \n\tbase. Maverick, has the lead. Any \n\tquestions? All right, let's go. \n\tMove like you've got a \n\tpurpose....\n\t\n\t85.  EXT. CLOUD COVER - \n\t20,000 FT. - DAY\n\t\n\tFour F-14's fly in formation over the Pacific, searching for \n\t(MiGs). They spot them, engage. The combatants fly scissor \n\tpatterns, slashing past each other, angling for position.\n\t\n\tWe hear the VOICES OF COMBAT from the planes, a barrage of \n\tinformation exchanges between pilots and RIO's. Maverick and \n\tIce swoop close together on each other's wing--moving on each \n\tother, testing, they glance at each other and nod. The \n\tChallenge...the fight is on. Suddenly an F-5 rises up out of \n\tthe clouds in front of them--Ice has the advantage and rolls \n\tin on him.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tSHIT!!\n\t\n\tThe F-5 sees his pursuers. Goes into a hard left.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tMIG'S IN A LEFT. MIG'S IN A \n\tLEFTHAND. I'M ENGAGING.\n\t\n\t\n\tIce struggles against the G's to bring his nose to bear. \n\tThey go around into a Lufbery--a tight circle, Ice has the \n\tadvantage. He is closer to the F-5's tail than the F-5 is to \n\this. But he can't close, can't line up the shot. He grunts \n\tand strains as the G force pushes him down.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tCOME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M \n\tIN--I'LL ENGAGE.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tSTAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M \n\tENGAGED. I'M IN.\n\t\n\tMaverick maneuvers close to their left circle.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tGET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. \n\tGET OUT OF THERE.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tFIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tGET LOST!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- \n\tI'M COMING IN.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tIT'S MY SHOT.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tCOME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY \n\tWAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tSTAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, \n\tMAVERICK.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.\n\t\n\t\n\tMAVERICK - ABOVE.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tNO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick is pulling a log of G's, but can't target his \n\tweapons, he continues to turn in a hard circle, going round \n\tand round without gaining. He can't bring his nose to bear.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tNO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.\n\t\n\tIce stays.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tCOMING IN.\n\t\n\tMaverick dives down between the two planes pulling 6.5 G's, \n\texposing his underside to Ice. All Ice sees is belly. \n\tObviously, in this attitude Maverick can't see him.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\t    (under breath.)\n\tSonofabitch.\n\t\n\tHe slams the stick hard right in toward Maverick. \n\tIce quickly rolls up right, in front of him.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tLOOK OUT!\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick sees him flash into his view. He has to slam the \n\tstick forward to avoid collision. He swings by real close. \n\tToo close.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tOh, no!\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tThey pass through Ice's turbulence. The blast distorts the \n\tairflow to Maverick's left engine. BOOMBOOMBOOM. The engine \n\tflames out. Full thrust on the right, engine swings the tail \n\taround in a yaw. Maverick slams the stick right to correct \n\tbut too late.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tPlane's coupling up! Plane's \n\tcoupling up!\n\t\n\t\n\tThe plane couples one yaw to the next--the tail swings \n\taround-- which becomes an ever increasing flat spin, like an \n\tout-of -control frisbee.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tThis is not good!...(Rising panic) \n\tWe're low!\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal \n\tforce, desperately tries to reach back for the ejection \n\tlever--but is falling short by about a foot.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI'm pinned to the panel.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\tTime to go.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI can't eject.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe plane is spinning ever faster, out of control. He drops \n\tthe gear. Still spins. Goose is closer to center of spin--G \n\tforces are less. He reaches behind him for the eject handle, \n\tstarts the eject sequence.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\t3000 feet. I'll do it.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tGo ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!\n\t\n\t\n\t85A.  BOOM - A HURRICANE OF WIND AND NOISE\n\t\n\tThe canopy BLASTS away--but is held spinning above the \n\tcockpit by the vortex of the sinking jet. Goose glances up at \n\tit.\n\t\n\t\t\tGOOSE\n\t1000.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tLet's go. Eject.\n\t\n\t\n\tGoose yanks the ejection handle. Things happen in a split \n\tsecond. Goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his \n\tseat. Almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy. A \n\tsickening CRUNCH. The canopy is knocked away. Maverick is \n\tslammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up. \n\tHe is BLASTED out of the plane just before it spins in.\n\t\n\t\n\t85B.  TIGHT ON MAVERICK AS HE TUMBLES IN SLOW MOTION\n\t\n\tHe's in shock..the loud THUMPING of his heart, labored \n\tbreathing, a scream that stays in his mind.\n\t\n\tInstinctively, he gropes for straps. He releases the pilot \n\tseat, it tumbles away. His chute streams, balloons open, \n\tsnapping his body like a bullwhip.  He drifts momentarily, \n\tthen plunges into the sea.\n\t\n\t\n\t85C. UNDERWATER\n\t\n\tHis face, distorted in the water; wild eyes, disoriented, \n\tchoking for air. He reaches out, finds nothing to grab.\n\tSuddenly, he is yanked hard to the side.\n\t\n\t\n\t85D.  SURFACE \n\t\n\tThe parachute is caught by the wind, and dragged, pulling \n\tMaverick along beneath the surface. He is twisting in the \n\twater, turning over and over, trying desperately to slip out \n\tof the tangled straps. He finally hits the surface of the \n\twater and sucks air into his lungs. With the end of his \n\tstrength, he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the \n\tparachute. It whips away like a kite in a typhoon.\n\t\n\tThe sea is choppy and rough. He struggles as his equipment \n\tdrags him under. He twists, finds the inflatable raft \n\tattached to his harness. Maverick pulls the cord, and the \n\traft hisses open. He pulls his body into the six-by-two foot \n\traft and collapses, completely exhausted. The survival has \n\tbeen almost without thinking: an instinctual physical \n\tstruggle.\n\t\n\t\n\t85E.  TWILIGHT\n\t\n\tMaverick begins to focus on the situation. He stains the \n\twater with dye, then sees another parachute floating nearby. \n\tPaddling to the parachute, he reaches over the side and \n\tbegins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the \n\twater.\n\t\n\tA great struggle. The weight is extremely heavy. Finally, he \n\tpulls a body to the surface. Goose. Goose is dead. Maverick \n\treleases the parachute and pulls Goose into the raft on top \n\tof him. He holds Goose in his arms. His mind shuts down \n\tagain.\n\t\n\tFrom high above the ocean, we see the debris on the water. \n\tAn oil slick, pieces of honeycomb titanium, and the small, \n\thelpless figure in the raft.\n\t\n\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\t\n\t86.  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT\n\t\n\tSearchlights skim over the black ocean. A brilliant light \n\tflashes as Maverick pops a pencil flare. Helicopter blades \n\tflick powerfully. The lights of the choppers descend toward \n\tthe wreckage area, scanning the debris, searching for life. \n\tThe spotlights find Maverick and Goose in the raft.\n\t\n\tThe draft from the chopper churns the water. A FROGMAN drops \n\tfrom the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes. He surfaces \n\tand swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered.\n\t\n\tMaverick watches curiously as he starts to examine Goose. He \n\thugs Goose closer and looks threatened.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tFROGMAN\n\tLet him go, sir. Take it easy.\n\t\n\tHe tries to pry Goose free, but Maverick has a death grip on \n\tthe body.\n\t\n\t\t\tFROGMAN\n\tSir! Let him go. It's all right. \n\tLet him go.\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water.\n\t\n\tAnother long moment, then Maverick releases Goose. The \n\tfrogman quickly straps Maverick into the harness. \n\t\n\tHIS POV. - He watches the lifeless body in the water as he \n\tis pulled up and away. He shivers from the cold.\n\t\n\t\n\t87.  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tExtreme CLOSE ON Maverick's face. He is emotionless. His \n\teyes are flat and absolutely without expression. There is \n\tcomplete silence in the room. Then we hear the quiet, calm, \n\tprobing voice of Viper.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tHow do you feel?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tAll right.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tGoose is dead.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI know. I was there.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tNot one sign of emotion from Maverick. Not one tone of \n\texpression. We see Viper now, and his face is strained from a \n\tvery long day.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tIf you fly jets long enough, \n\tsomething like this happens to you. \n\tNo one escapes it. It touches us \n\tall.\n\t\n\tMaverick looks at Viper, and his eyes are very disturbed.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHe was...my responsibility--my RIO.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tMy first squadron in Vietnam, we \n\tlost eight out of eighteen planes. \n\tTen guys. The first one kills you, \n\tbut there'll be others--you can \n\tcount on it.\n\t\n\t\n\tNo reaction from Maverick. He can't quite face up to that \n\treality right now.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tYou've got to put him in the box.\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick is watching Viper, but he doesn't have anything to \n\tsay.\n\t\n\t\n\t88.  EXT. CHARLIE'S SPORTSCAR - NIGHT\n\t\n\tThe RADIO plays John Lennon; \"Stand by Me\". Maverick opens \n\this eyes, doesn't know where he is for a moment.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t...they say you're alright.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI'm fine.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tThis is it, then.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tThe dark side. The price you pay \n\tfor all the fun you're having. You \n\tknew about it, of course. Didn't \n\tyou?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHe was a friend of mine. A good \n\tguy...great guy. It was my \n\tfault.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tThat's not what I hear.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI was flying...my responsibility.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tThat's what you get flight pay for.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tMaybe I shouldn't take it.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t    (In surprise)\n\tWhy? You act like you didn't know \n\tone day this would happen.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNot to me.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou knew it. You all do. It's part \n\tof it. Maybe the most important \n\tpart.\n\t\n\t\n\t88A.  ON THE BEACH - NIGHT AND FOG \n\t\n\tCharlie's car pulls up. They get out and walk down toward \n\tthe water. Maverick seems dazed. She is softly taunting.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhere are we?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWhere are we? You know where we \n\tare. It's called the beach. It's \n\twhere life first crawled up out of \n\tthe sea. I come here sometimes... \n\twhen I feel like crawling back in.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou don't have to do this.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tDo what, show you a good time?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI'm not good company. I should be \n\talone.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI don't think so, but if that's \n\twhat you want...\n\t\n\tThey stand there, not making a move.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNo.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWhat do you want?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI want it back.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWhat?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYesterday.\n\t\n\tShe turns, nods out, past the moon.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou look way out there. Out past \n\tthe date line. West becomes East, \n\tall things change. You cross the \n\tline...today becomes yesterday...or \n\ttomorrow, I forget which.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tThat's what I want.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tOf course the line's just \n\timaginary. You can cross it twenty \n\ttimes...nothing really changes.\n\t\n\tShe turns and walks along the surfline.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tOn the beach... It's what they say \n\twhen Navy men retire...He's \"On The \n\tBeach\". I always liked that. I had \n\ta picture...in my head... all these \n\told guys wandering around here, \n\tlooking out into the past.\n\t\n\tHe walks to the surf, kicks the sand with his bare feet.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIf we knew then, what we know now, \n\twe might never have come up out of \n\tthere.\n\t\n\tHe turns to her. She just looks at him.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou don't believe that.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHardly ever.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tOnly when you're depressed. Then it \n\tpasses.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIt does.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tEverything passes. Immutable law of \n\tthe Universe.\n\t\n\t\n\tHe picks up a piece of flotsam, a twig, worn smooth.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tThis too...shall pass. You put as \n\tmuch life as you can between it and \n\tyou. You start piling up experience \n\tbetween then and now.\n\t\n\tHe turns and walks.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat do you do when you come here?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI sit. I think. I play games.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat kind of games?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI like to play \"reality\".\n\t\n\tShe stops and turns.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHow do you play reality.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tIt's strip reality, actually, like \n\twhat the pilots always want to \n\tplay.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t  (this gets a small laugh)\n\tStrip reality! How do you play \n\tthat?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tIt's like strip poker, only, \n\twithout the bluffing. (he laughs \n\tagain) One person says something \n\tand if the other one accepts that \n\tit's true, the one who says it, \n\tgets to take one item of clothing \n\toff.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou're crazy. (She stops, he goes \n\ton, softer) That's a pretty silly \n\tgame.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tNot as silly as some. You know the \n\tsilliest one? ...that we are gods. \n\tThat we control events on the \n\tbeach... that we can turn back \n\ttime...\n\t\n\tShe moves in close.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWant to play the game? \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHow does it go?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou say the truth. (a beat...)    \n\tGo ahead. Don't be afraid. You want \n\tto win the game, don'tcha?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat truth?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tThe big one. The one that's most on \n\tyour mind.\n\t\n\tA long pause...it comes hard.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tGoose is dead.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t    (she nods)\n\tTrue.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNow?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tTake something off.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tOff me or off you?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tThat's up to you.\n\t\n\t\n\tHe takes the ribbon from her hair. It falls down over her \n\tface and shoulders. Now it's her turn.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tIt's dangerous...what you do.\n\t\n\tHe nods. She slowly loosens his tie and pulls it from around \n\this neck.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIt was my fault.\n\t\n\t\n\tShe says nothing, stands looking into his eyes. He slowly, \n\tas if in a trance, takes her blouse off.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou can't bring him back.\n\t\n\tShe takes off his shirt.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIt was my fault.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tHe starts to reach for her. She pulls back.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tNope. Already used that.\n\t\n\tShe turns and thinks for a moment, looking at the moon.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYour life goes on.\n\t\n\t\n\tRather than struggle his T shirt over his head, she grabs it \n\twith both hands. She leans in close and bites it. She grabs \n\tboth sides of the tear and slowly rips it off his body.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat does it mean?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t   (shakes her head no)\n\tThat wasn't fair. It was a \n\tquestion. Penalty round!\n\t\n\t\n\tShe drops her skirt.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou didn't mean it. You didn't \n\tthink. You'd do anything to take it \n\tback.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tThat's three.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tAnd that's one!\n\t\n\t\n\tShe unbuckles his belt, slowly slides it off. She unzips his \n\tpants, they fall.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tOne more.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYour watch.\n\t\n\tShe unbuckles it.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou owe me one.\n\t\n\t\n\tHe rests his head on her shoulder, unhooks her bra. She \n\tshrugs it off.\n\t\n\tThey stand on the beach in shorts and bikini bottom, looking \n\tinto each other's eyes.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tLooks like a tie.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWho's gonna win?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWe'll say it together. On the count \n\tof three...One...two...\n\t\n\tLeaning in, softer and harder...they both jump the gun.\n\t\n\t\t\tBOTHTOGETHER\n\tI love.ove y.you.\n\t\n\tThey embrace madly and sink to the sand. From the distance \n\tit looks like a strange slithering creature crawling back to \n\tthe sea.\n\t\n\t\n\t89.  INT. GOOSE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tThe lights are out in Goose's room at the Bachelor Officers' \n\tQuarters. The door opens, and Maverick enters. He sets a \n\tcardboard box on the bed.\n\t\n\tSilently, Maverick gathers together Goose's few personal \n\tpossessions. He fills the box with clothes, books, a clock, a \n\tradio, a walkman, and articles from the bathroom. He examines \n\teach closely, like an artifact...as if he might find some \n\tmessage or meaning in them. He fumbles them into the box. He \n\tcan't see too well, his eyes are full of tears.\n\t\n\tMaverick closes the box and carries it to the door. He takes \n\tone last glance around, then leaves and closes the door \n\tbehind him.\n\t\n\t\n\t89A.  INT. BOQ RECEPTION AREA                      *\n\t\n\tCarol and the kid, stand, staring at a silent TV. Carol \n\tlooks dazed, lost. Maverick walks in, finds her. An awkward \n\tsilence while they both try to think of something to say. \n\tMaverick hands the box to Carol.\n\t\n\t90.   OMITTED\n\t\n\t89B.  CLOSE UP - MAVERICK.\n\t\n\tHe sits staring right through us...the thousand-yard stare. \n\tA strange white unreal light washes over him. The only color, \n\tthe Navy and gold of the stripes on his shoulderboards. A low \n\trumbling mumbling filters through the HISS of surf or fans or \n\tsomething...Snatches of low whispered \n\tconversation....disregard of...basic air-safety \n\tprinciples...too aggressive...incident.... 29 July...within \n\tperformance parameters... disciplinary action...tactical \n\tdoctrine.... even reckless at times... \n\tconjecture...unsupported ...benefit of the doubt...\n\t\n\tMaverick's \n\teyes slowly focus. The light attenuates. The surrounding \n\timage becomes denser. Things become real.\n\t\n\t\n\t89C.  INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - MAVERICK'S POV\n\t\n\tA BOARD OF INQUIRY, a COMMANDER and other NAVY OFFICERS \n\tseated behind tables at the front of the room. Maverick faces \n\tthem, wearing dress whites. Viper is also present. The \n\tCommander looks at each of the Officers. They each nod, in \n\tturn, indicating readiness. The Commander turns to Maverick, \n\tand states for the record:\n\t\n\t\t\tCDR.\n\tThe Board of Inquiry finds that Lt. \n\tEvan Mitchell was not at fault in \n\tthe accident of twenty-nine July.\n\t\n\tNo response from Maverick, one way or the other. Viper \n\tstudies his face with concern.\n\t\n\t\t\tCDR.\n\t Lt. Mitchell's record will be \n\tcleared of this incident.\n\t\n\t\n\tStill no response from Maverick.\n\t\n\t\tCDR.\n\tLt. Mitchell is restored to flight \n\tstatus without further delay. These \n\tproceedings are closed.\n\t\n\tMaverick doesn't respond.\n\t\n\t\n\t91.  INT. MAVERICK'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMaverick lies on his bunk and stares at the ceiling. The \n\tphone next to his bed is RINGING.  It RINGS EIGHT OR NINE \n\tTIMES, then stops. He makes no move to reach for it. \n\t\n\t\n\t92. through 95. OMITTED\n\t\n\t\n\t94A.  INT. COCKPIT - F-14 ON FLIGHT LINE\n\t\n\tMaverick sits in the cockpit staring at the controls while \n\tthe ground crew preps the aircraft for flight. Coogan helps \n\thim strap in. He speaks solicitously to Maverick. It is \n\tunheard over the JET NOISE and RADIO BABBLE. Maverick looks \n\tat the cockpit as if it's a strange territory, suddenly \n\tforeign to him. He grabs the stick like it's some peculiar \n\ttalisman. He turns and looks aft. He seems surprised that it \n\tmoves the control surfaces in the tails.\n\t\n\t96.  INT. F-14 - DAY\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tBOGEY AT TEN O'CLOCK LOW. YOU'VE \n\tGOT THE ANGLE -- PIECE OF CAKE.\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick checks ten o'clock low. He is disturbed. He tries \n\tto make the move, but he is a man with no secret: he is \n\tafraid.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tENGAGE, MAVERICK - ANYTIME.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe bogey abruptly turns into him. Maverick hesitates. Then \n\tsuddenly, he jerks the stick hard right and takes the F-14 \n\taway from the bogey at great speed. Fungus is startled.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN \n\tTHE HELL ARE YOU GOING?\n\t\n\t\tMAVERICK\n\tDIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO \n\tLOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNO. NO GOOD.\n\t\n\t\n\t96A.  INT. FLIGHT LINE - DAY\n\t\n\tJester walks up to Viper who waits near an F-5.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tHe just won't engage. He can't do \n\tit, Skipper. He can't get back on \n\tthe horse. \n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tIt's only been a week. Keep sending \n\thim up.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tI've seen this before.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tSo have I.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tSome guys never get it back.\n\t\n\t\n\tHe walks off.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t97. through 102.  OMITTED\n\t\n\t\n\t103.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - IMMEDIATELY AFTER \n\t\n\tMaverick grabs his stuff out of the locker, throws them in a \n\tbag. He glances up as Fungus enters, continues to pack.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWhat are you doing?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tSaving them some paperwork.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tSince when did you care about  \n\tpaperwork? \n\t\n\tMaverick walks away. Fungus hesitates, then follows him.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tIf I could fly like you I'd have \n\teverything I want. If I could fly \n\tat all. I can't fly. I can't fly \n\tlike that. Nobody can. Whatever it \n\tis, you've got it!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNot anymore. \n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tSo, you're scared--so what? You \n\tever get a good look at me in the \n\tback seat, I'm goddamn terrified.\n\t\n\tGrabbing the suitcase, Maverick brushes past Jester and \n\twalks up the corridor. Jester and Fungus watch him go. Fungus \n\tgoes to the phone.\n\t\n\t\n\t104.  EXT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - NIGHT\n\t\n\tCharlie parks her car, jumps out, and runs toward the main \n\tentrance to the terminal.\n\t\n\t\n\t105.  INT. TERMINAL\n\t\n\tCharlie hurries through the crowd, bumping past people, \n\tsearching frantically for Maverick in the huge terminal. She \n\tmoves past bench after bench, and her eyes flick in all \n\tdirections. A quick glance at the souvenir shop, the coffee \n\tshop, and then she heads for the bar.\n\t\n\tMaverick is there, sitting alone in a booth with his \n\tsuitcase beside him, staring into a drink. Charlie composes \n\therself, then walks to the booth and sits down across the \n\ttable from him. Maverick does not look pleased.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tNever liked fighter pilots anyway. \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tHe looks up trying to be angry, but he can't help it, she \n\tmakes him laugh.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou came to the right place.\n\t\n\tThe waitress comes up.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICKWhat are you having?\n\t\n\tTurns to the waitress.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI'll have what he's having... \n\tHemlock, is it?\n\t\n\tThe waitress departs. He tries not to smile, but can't help \n\tit.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou weren't gonna say goodbye?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI was, later. \n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tLong distance? I wouldn't do that \n\tto you. I'd at least talk to you.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI didn't want to see you. I mean, I \n\tdid...but I didn't..\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI know exactly what you mean.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHow could you?\n\t\n\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI've got a gift just like you do. \n\tMy gift is I just know what people \n\tmean, even if they can't say it. It \n\thelps when you're trying to \n\tcommunicate with fighter pilots. \n\tLike what you just said was \"I'm \n\tembarrassed, I feel I've done \n\tsomething wrong, that I've failed, \n\tand I don't think I can live up to \n\tthe expectations of a wonderful \n\tinteresting, intelligent woman like \n\tyourself.\" That about it?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t    (laughs)\n\t...Something like that.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tAnd I'm gonna sneak off, and be by \n\tmyself for awhile, like until I can \n\tthink of a new career...hotel \n\tmanagement or something...\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tBig talk for someone who's never \n\tbeen shot off her computer.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tHey, I never said I was a fighter \n\tpilot...I never claimed to think it \n\twas fun to be shot off the end of a \n\tship in a storm. I can find \n\tcontentment in a good book. I don't \n\thave to roar by someone at Mach two \n\twith my hair on fire. Sometimes...I \n\tjust get happy being with the right \n\tman.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI hope you find him.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI think I have... I could be wrong. \n\tI have been before. Just remember \n\tone thing. If you're not Top Gun, \n\tif you're not fighting jets, you're \n\tnot gonna be able to act like a \n\tfighter pilot... You're gonna have \n\tto act like the rest of us. You're \n\tgonna have to master humility. For \n\tyou guys, that's the toughest \n\tmaneuver of all.\n\t\n\tShe gets up...lays a bill out for the drinks...\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tSo long, Sailor. See you on the \n\tbeach sometime.\n\t\n\t\n\tShe swings away. Her wake sucks in the stares of every man \n\tin the place. Then they look over to Maverick, quick flicks \n\tof envy in their eyes. He stares them back and can't quite \n\tmeet their eyes.\n\t\n\t\n\t106.  EXT. BEACH AT VIPER'S HOUSE - LATER\n\t\n\tViper is tugged down the beach by a three year old kid. They \n\tcome across one creature who's had a bad night...Viper spots \n\thim, he spots Viper, and Viper moves toward him. Tim, Viper's \n\tkid, wants to head for the sea and pulls his father in that \n\tdirection. He stops, puts his hand on his hips like he's seen \n\tthe pilots do. \n\t\n\t\t\tTIM\n\tDad...Of all the aminals in the \n\tocean, which one's the baddest?\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tI don't know, Tim. You'll have to \n\task them.\n\t\n\tViper turns to the creature, Maverick, and shrugs.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tRuns in the family...\n\t\n\tMaverick stands up. \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tSkipper, sorry to bother you.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tNo bother.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI called your house.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tMy wife's house.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tShe said you took your kid to the  \n\teach. Every second Sunday. Zoo or \n\tbeach or the ballgame. Y'have the \n\toption...(Maverick thinks for a \n\tbeat. Segues to the question...) \n\tWhat about me?\n\t\n\tViper turns, they stroll together.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tWe can send you back to your \n\tsquadron with nothing noted on your \n\trecord except \"CNC\" --course not \n\tcompleted, no explanation required. \n\tTheoretically, it doesn't hurt your \n\tcareer, but people always wonder \n\tabout things like that.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tOr....\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tOr you can quit.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t\tI don't know...\n\t \n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tI didn't know either. That's why I \n\ttold Jester to prepare your papers.\n\t\n\tMaverick looks irritated. Viper stops at an icecream vendor \n\tand orders three with a gesture.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou've already made up your mind.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tIt's no disgrace, kid. That spin \n\twas hell. It would wreck anyone's \n\tconfidence. You could be a good \n\tpilot again someday...\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t    (starts to get his back up)\n\tYou think I should quit?!\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tI didn't say that. That's up to \n\tyou. But I have responsibility for \n\tthe other guys up there, not just \n\tyou. They need to know you're all \n\tright...that they can depend on \n\tyou.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe vendor hands them icecream, they take it.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHere, let me get this. We'll be \n\teven.\n\t\n\tHe reaches into his pocket for change, comes out with a \n\thandful. Slams it on the counter, stars picking the proper \n\tchange out. Viper spots something and reaches for \n\tit...Maverick sees and tries to block it, but Viper comes up \n\twith the Navy Cross.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tLucky charm.\n\t\n\tBut Viper recognizes it for what it is.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tSometimes it's luck, but in this \n\tcase, he earned it... I served with \n\tyour old man.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI know.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tVF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me \n\tof him. You're just like he was, \n\tonly better...and worse.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI'm nothing like him.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tYou may not think so, but you are.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHe was by the book, all the way.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tThey waved him off. He thought he \n\tknew better. He hit the \n\tramp.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI never heard that.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tNot something they tell dependents.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tIt's not true.\n\t\n\t\n\tViper looks at him, for a long beat, throws his icecream \n\taway.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tWhy would I lie?\n\t\n\tHe turns, walks away. Maverick stands there for a moment, \n\tthinking, then catches up to him, stops him...struggles with \n\tthe thought...as Viper breaks in...\n\t            \n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tYou start on a wrong heading... the \n\tmore you stick to it, the further \n\tyou get from your target. A good \n\tpilot always questions himself, \n\talways questions his judgments, \n\tstays alert for drift and makes the \n\tcorrections...You may find a little \n\tdiscipline helps with the fear. You \n\tdon't have to be alone up there.\n\t\n\tA pause...quiet intensity.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHow can I go on? I feel so... \n\tresponsible.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tKid, the plain fact is...you are. \n\tI'm not gonna stand here and blow \n\tsunshine up your ass. Technically, \n\tthey absolved you. You and I know \n\twhat really happened. You pushed \n\tit. You are responsible and you'll \n\talways carry that. You know what, \n\tI'll carry it too. I should have \n\ttaken you out of that cockpit.\n\tI guess I'm a hopeless romantic... \n\tI always try to find something \n\tworthwhile in someone's death. It's \n\tno trade-off. It's not one for one. \n\tWhat you learned isn't worth his \n\tdeath. It couldn't be. But maybe \n\tthere is some value in it. I know \n\tit's the first thing I've ever seen \n\tthat's really gotten to you. Now \n\tthe question is, what will you do \n\twith it. If it gets you out of \n\tflight status...so you don't kill \n\tyourself or anybody else...that's \n\tgood. That's one good thing.

The graduation ceremonies are in full \n\tswing...They consist of informal ribbing, laughing, and a lot \n\tof talking with the hands. every now and then, the name Goose \n\tcomes up and a shadow passes across a face. For the most \n\tpart, they press on, having a good time. Fungus shrugs at \n\tsomeone's question and looks around.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tI don't know where he is...\n\t\n\t\t\tPORK\n\tWhat are his plans?\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tI don't know.\n\t\n\tIce stands proudly holding the Top Gun plaque as others \n\tcongratulate him...Hollywood looks up as the door opens, \n\tMaverick is there.

Viper stands \n\tthere, looking pleased but gruff. Maverick walks over, shakes \n\this hand. The party starts to pick up. A real celebration, \n\tnow. \n\t\n\tJester enters, a sheaf of messages in his hand. He takes \n\tViper aside for a word. Viper nods at him. The group's \n\tattention gradually swings onto them. They quiet down \n\tinstinctively. Viper finally turns to them.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tGentlemen, you know how I hate to \n\tbreak up this party before it has a \n\tchance to get really out of hand...\n\t    (more serious)\n\t...but there's a major flap on.\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tWe're being called back?\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tYou're on your way.

This is it. \n\tGet your nose in there.\n\t\n\tMaverick hesitates again. He sees the hornet's nest below; \n\tplanes all over the sky.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tBandit at seven o'clock low--solo. \n\tTake him. Pull on the goddamn \n\tstick, man!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tOkay, okay.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tDon't tell me okay. Do it!\n\t\n\tMaverick draws a breath, then forces himself to pull the \n\tstick over. The F-14 rolls in hard toward the battle. \n\tSuddenly, the cluster breaks apart. The MiGs break in every \n\tdirection as Maverick BLASTS through their formation. \n\tSomething comes up through the clouds. A MiG BLASTS by. \n\tAnother rolls in and locks onto them.\n\t\n\tThe MiGs swarm toward the TOMCATS, coming from every \n\tdirection. CANNON FIRE erupts from one of the MiGs.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tMAVERICK'S EMGAGED. HARD LEFT, ICE, \n\tPADLOCK THE EASTERN SECTION.\n\t\n\tThe F-14's execute a left oblique turn in unison. They come \n\tdown in a section attack with their cannons blazing. From \n\tMaverick's cockpit, everything looks choppy:  MiGs slide past \n\tat incredible speed. Cannons BLAST, as the planes scramble \n\tfor position.\n\t\n\tOut-numbered four to two, Maverick and Ice fight \n\tdefensively. Maverick has the angle on a MIG, when Fungus \n\tspots a missile launch.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tBREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! \n\tFLARES!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tBREAKING LEFT!\n\t\n\tMaverick releases a flare as he takes the F-14 into a hard \n\tleft. The missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out \n\tof the area, missing the Tomcat and falling toward the sea.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tTWO MIGS ON MY TAIL, MAVERICK. I'M \n\tDEFENSIVE.\n\t\n\tMaverick jerks his stick right and streaks toward Ice. He \n\tcuts off one of the MiGs with CANNON FIRE, driving it down \n\ttoward the deck. Ice goes into vertical and comes around to \n\tgain an angle on the other MiG. His RIO is in position to \n\tcheck Mav's rear. \n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tMAVERICK! SIX O'CLOCK!\n\t\n\tMaverick turns to look and jerks a hard left. The MiG is on \n\thim, CANNON BLAZING. Ice Yo Yos inside and cuts the MiG off. \n\t\t\tICE\n\tFOX ONE.\n\t\n\tHe fires a sidewinder. The MiG turns hard, the missile sails \n\taway.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tBANDIT, THREE O'OLOCK HIGH!\n\t\n\tIce's F-14 is suddenly caught in a HAIL OF CANNON FIRE as a \n\tMiG sweeps down from three o'clock. He breaks, dives. The \n\tjets streak across the sky, low to the deck, skimming the \n\tsurface.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tICE'S  DEFENSIVE, HELP HIM OUT.\n\t\n\tMaverick's F-14 Rollaways in and intercepts the bogey on \n\tIce's tail.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tREVERSE RIGHT.\n\t\n\tIce turns right, the MiG bugs and jerks into vertical.  \n\tMaverick swoops after him.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tSTAY WITH HIM. YOUR SIX IS CLEAR.\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick closes, jerking left, right, twisting and turning, \n\tstaying on his tail. \n\t\n\t\n\t122B.  MAVERICK'S COCKPIT\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tONE ON OUR SIX! BUG OUT! BUG OUT!\n\t\n\tBULLETS fly by Maverick's F-14 from the MiG on his six. He \n\tpulls a hard left, then takes the plane straight up. We hear \n\tinstructions shouted by Fungus, but it is all obscured in the \n\tSOUNDS AND FURY OF THE BATTLE. Maverick peels over the top \n\tand comes down like a comet. A series of passes at the MiGs. \n\tAs they come by, one of the MiGs pulls up, \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tOKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH. \n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tLOOK OUT! \n\t\n\t\n\tThey look up. An MiG 21 is coming down, belly to them, close \n\tto a mid-air collision.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tJESUS!\n\t\n\t\n\tHe pushes down. The MiG ROARS BY. The whole airplane goes \n\t\"BOOOMMMM\" it's that close.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tOHHHHH SHIT!\n\t\n\tThe shock, the air pressure SLAMS them as it goes by, \n\tmissing by 4-5 feet. Maverick pulls back in, sees a MiG 21 \n\tbelow. It takes off, bugging out. Ice goes after him. The MiG \n\tmaneuvers, jerking hard left, hard right, twisting  up, down.\n\t\n\tIce is right in his shadow. They come in hard and low over \n\tthe sea. He has the MiG in the diamond.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tGOOD TONE, FOX ONE\n\t\n\tThe MiG starts turning.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tAh Nuts!\n\t\n\t\n\tThe missile goes by the tail.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tSon of a bitch!\n\t\n\tThen his tail comes off, the airplane goes over, a chute \n\tcomes out. The MiG EXPLODES into a thousand small pieces. \n\tThey roar by the MiG pilot hanging in his straps.\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tJESUS!  HEY SPLASH ONE, SPLASH ONE \n\tBANDIT! SPLASH THAT SUCKER!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI GOT ONE HERE. ON THE NOSE.  \n\tCOMING DOWN. \n\t\n\tRolling down on him, good SIDEWINDER TONE. The MiG'S sense \n\thim, they break, one guy down low. \n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tON THE NOSE?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tGOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.\n\t \n\tHe squeezes the trigger.\n\t\n\t\n\t123.  EXT. THE MISSILE STARTS TO GO \n\t\n\tThe vapor trail comes off, the MiG 21 turns like he's been \n\tbounced off a rubber wall, comes around on the missile, beats \n\tit. The missile flies by him. \n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tAH, SHIT! GODDAMN IT!\n\t\n\tMiG comes back turning into him.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tTHERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI GOT ONE COMING UP.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tAND HE'S GUNNING.\n\t\n\tHe looks back. 30 millimeter tracers go by; they just kind \n\tof float. He breaks, hits airbrakes, the trailing MiG dives \n\tthrough.\n\t\n\tSuddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him. \n\tThey close at 900 knots--VABOOOM!--They pass nose to nose, \n\tcanopy to canopy. Both planes pitch straight up, trying for \n\tthe altitude advantage.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tZone 5 burners.\n\t\n\tThe F-14 outclimbs the MiG sitting on its tail, full \n\tthruster, it rockets straight up, away from the planet.  \n\tMaverick has the advantage. Suddenly, his F-14 runs out of \n\tenergy. FUNGUS is the first to call it.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWe're ballistic! Ohhhhhh Shit!\n\t\n\tThe plane backs down on itself, backs into its own smoke as \n\tit flips over, falls away...He catches it, just regains \n\tcontrol, when...A ROAR. He looks up.\n\t\n\tSECOND MIG coming down. Right on him. It fills the Canopy! \n\tInstinctive - A Push to miss him, Maverick breaks fast down \n\tinto him, a last ditch maneuver, and the airplane \n\tDEPARTS...the roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it \n\ttumbles over the top; the airplane just goes end-over-end. \n\tThey are being slammed and rattled all over the \n\tcockpits...bone-jarring, neck-snapping whips. SHRIEKS and \n\tSCREAMS from the airframe. Terriflying?\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tOhhh Mother!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t    (strangely calm)\n\tGoddamnit, Mav, you really are a \n\tslow learner. Don't worry, Fung, \n\tI've got it.\n\t\n\t\n\tFungus is getting his teeth rattled. He's helpless, he has \n\tno controls, there's nothing he can do but hold on.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tDon't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? \n\tAre you CRAZY?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tRoger, I've got it. \n\t\n\tThe plane's gyrations are rattling Fungus's helmet off the \n\tcanopy. \n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tYou've got it?   Good!  Cause for a \n\tminute there, you had me worried.\n\t\n\tIt yaws and rolls, starts into a spin.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tNow have you got it?  Have you \n\tstill got it?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYawing right.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tI know!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tRudder's left, stick's forward.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tSwell! Passing ten thousand!\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI've got it -- hold on!\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tPassing 8. Passing 6. Lock your \n\tharness!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI can recover. Hold on!\n\t\n\tThey're in a progressive spiral, nose low.  The altimeter \n\tunwinds, speed picks up. The G forces are forcing them away \n\tfrom the axis of spin, jamming Maverick against the \n\tinstrument panel at the front of the cockpit. \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou with me?\n\t\n\tFungus, also, is jammed to his panel.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tRight behind you. \n\t\n\tHe is closer to the center of spin and less strongly held. \n\tIt doesn't do much good, however, he can't control the plane. \n\tThe only thing he can reach is the yellow and black loop; the \n\tejection handle. He reaches for it.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tSpeed's up to 150. \n\t\n\tFungus's eyes are wide.  The earth grows larger as it rises \n\ttowards them. G forces flatten them. They've long since lost \n\tthe MiG. Nobody but an idiot would try to follow them in this \n\tmaneuver.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\t5000 feet. Speed two hundred.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tOkay.\n\t\n\t\n\tThe earth grows larger.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\t4500. Critical point.\n\t\n\t\n\tFUNGUS grabs the ejection handle with both hands.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tNo! Not again!\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWhat are you talking about,\n\t\twe gotta go!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI'm not losing it again!\n\t\n\tThe jet is standing on its nose, gaining speed, plunging \n\ttowards the ocean.  \n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tGotta go, man.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t280, 290, 300 knots.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\t3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man.  \n\t3,000 feet, we gotta go!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou go. I'm staying with it.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tI'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...\n\t\n\tThen, just as suddenly, as he's about to pull...Maverick \n\tcatches it. The plane responds. They're out of the spin. He \n\tgets control. Fungus sits there dumbly, hands on handle. \n\tStill not believing...\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tONE....ONE....ONE...\n\t\n\t\n\tSEA LEVEL \n\t\n\tMaverick stops the tumble, pulls the nose up quickly and the \n\tF-l4 sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet \n\tabove the deck. He comes up and looks right at Ice. Ice is \n\tdown low. He comes around, a MiG-21 all over him like a cheap \n\tsuit. A flick, a whip, and Maverick in perfect position, \n\trolls right in on the MiG. Fungus looks like he just saw \n\tJesus. \n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWhat  in  the  Christ...was that? \n\t\n\tHe looks at the Mig target set-up in front of him in awe.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tDid you plan that? Was all that \n\tsomething you planned?\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick's acquired the target and is all business. \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tALL RIGHT, ICE. COME HARD \n\tSTARBOARD, THEN EXTEND TO THE EAST. \n\t\n\t\n\tFungus is still lividly frazzled.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tBecause...if that was... Next time \n\tyou tell me first.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tROG.\n\t\n\tMaverick breaks down, Ice zooms up, breaks in and takes the \n\tMiG the other way. Maverick Yo Yo's in, comes right up behind \n\tthe MiG, as the MiG starts acceleration. \n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick rolls in on Ice and the MiG. \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD \n\tTONE ON IT.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tI CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF  \n\tA SHOT?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI GOT NO TONE.

The MiG's missile follows the \n\tflares. Maverick FIRES. The missile doesn't twitch. It flys \n\tright up the tail pipe of the MiG, the canopy flies off, the \n\tpilot comes out of it, and then the MiG blows up, We go right \n\tthrough the fire ball. VVVARRRUOOMMM!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHe's out! We got him!\n\t\n\tThe MiG rolls into the ground...KABOOM!  They swoop by the \n\tpilot, hanging in his straps...He watches them, dumbly. \n\tFungus waves. \n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWhat a dope! Maybe they'll\n\t\tgive him another plane...and we\n\t\tcan shoot him down again.\n\t\n\tMaverick and Ice join up, light it, stand on their burners \n\tand blast straight for the sun.\n\t\n\t\n\tMAVERICK'S F-14 \n\t\n\tWithout warning, a triple roll, as the elation hits him.\n\t\n\t\n\t125.

What's wrong?\n\t\n\t\n\tFungus nervously looks around at his circuit breakers.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tIs there something I should know?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tJust relax.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tIs it the plane?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tThe plane is fine.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tIs it you?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYeah, I guess it is. We did it! We \n\tdid it...Damn! We sure did it!\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tHELLO MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK. \n\tI'VE GOT A MESSAGE FOR STINGER. \n\t\n\t\t\tSTRIKE \n\t(V.O.) \n\tROGER, MAVERICK.

THE BAD NEWS IS \n\tTHAT MAVERICK GOT TWO!\n\t\n\tHe looks over at Ice.  \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI GOTTA HAVE ONE.\n\t\n\t\n\t126.  INT. ICE'S COCKPIT\n\t\n\t\t\tSLIDER\n\tWe're low on fuel, Ice.\n\t\n\tIce considers for a moment, then responds.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tI know. I know....Aw hell, let's do \n\tit!\n\t\n\t\n\t127.  INT. MAVERICK'S COCKPIT\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tYou're not supposed to...\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tBut I have to!\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tThen...shit! Go ahead. I'm right \n\tbehind you.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tMUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST \n\tA FLYBY.\n\t\n\t\n\t128.  PRI-FLY BRIDGE - (Primary Flight Control)  USS KITTY \n\tHAWK\n\t\n\tThe Air Boss speaks to Maverick over the UHF. The Admiral, \n\tthe XO and other officers watch and listen.\n\t\n\t\t\tAIR BOSS\n\tNEGATIVE, GHOST RIDER, THE \n\tPATTERN'S FULL.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK (V.O. filtered)\n\tMUSTANG, THIS IS GHOST RIDER. \n\tREQUEST A FLYBY FOR TWO.\n\t\n\t\t\tOFFICER\n\tWho is that guy?\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tADMIRAL\n\tMitchell...\n\t\n\t\t\tXO\n\t   (surpressing a grin)\n\t...Likes to break at 600, 'stead of \n\t300 knots. The Air Boss hates him. \n\tOne time, he came over the deck at \n\ttwo hundred, shakes the shit out of \n\tthe bridge. Lifted Johnson right \n\toff his feet.\n\t\n\t\n\t129.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14\n\t\n\tHe glances over at Ice, who gives him thumbs up.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tBOSS, YOU BETTER CLEAR IT OUT,\n\t\tWE'RE FIVE MINUTES OUT\n\t\tAND WE'RE DOING IT!\n\t\n\t\n\t130.

He slides into his (borrowed) command chair, looks into \n\tthe wind. On the back of the chair, a clue; his name and \n\trank:  RADM. Buford Clancy, \"BOOMER\"\n\t\n\tThe AIR BOSS burns, but has no choice. \n\t\n\t\t\tAIR BOSS\n\t    (really pissed off)\n\t ROGER, GHOST RIDER, YOU'RE CLEAR.\n\t\n\t131.  EXT. \n\tKITTY HAWK DAY\n\t\n\tSailors line the deck and search the sky. They crane their \n\tnecks from their battle stations, sweating into the sun, \n\twatching for the approach of F-14's. Someone sees it--he \n\tpoints and SHOUTS. The F-14 appears, and every man stands and \n\tCHEERS.\n\t\n\t\n\t132. POV -\n\t\n\tWE COME SCREAMING IN, 5 FEET OVER THE WATER, throwing up \n\trooster tails behind. WE SPLIT OFF and ZOOM along each side \n\tof the carrier, at 100 feet and ROLL IT.\n\t\n\t\n\t133.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE--VVVAAAAABBOOOOM!\n\t\n\tIt lifts the Air Boss right off his feet. The walls warp, \n\tdust sifts from the overhead. The whole tower just goes BOOM!\n\t\n\t\t\tAIR BOSS\n\tGoddamn that guy!\"\n\t\n\t\n\t134.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK\n\t\n\tThey break at 500 knots. Ice is first down over the ramp, \n\twaved in.  The F-14 comes in a little rocky. It bounces hard \n\tbut grabs the wire, then jerks to a sudden halt. The sailors \n\tCHEER AND APPLAUD, throwing fists of victory into the air, \n\tstraining to get a look at Ice as the crew directs his plane \n\toff to the side. Opening the canopy, Ice and Slider unstrap. \n\tStinger and the others are there. Guys are climbing up, \n\tclimbing all over the airplane. They're already painting a \n\tMiG on the side, and they're looking at Ice in awe.\n\t\n\t\n\t135.  POV - MAVERICK - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - AS HE LANDS\n\t\n\tHe catches the wire, the view slams down toward the deck as \n\tthe plane arrests, then comes up...He releases the cockpit \n\tand can hear the ROAR OF THE CROWD...\n\t\n\t\n\t136.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK\n\t\n\tHe swings the nose around past Ice's. Ice's plane is covered \n\tin colored jerseys as the ground crew pulls him out. \n\tMaverick's plane swings towards the PRI-FLY BRIDGE. Pilots in \n\tflightsuits pour from the deck hatch APPLAUDING... \n\t\n\t\n\t137.  HE CUTS HIS ENGINES AS THE GROUND CREW SWARMS\n\t\n\tAs Maverick and Fungus climb down, they see their wingmen on \n\tthe deck. Ice is looking in Maverick's direction. His face is \n\tinscrutable. Maverick gets mobbed, but pushes over to Ice. \n\tThey stare at each other for a moment, eye to eye even as \n\tthey are buffeted by the crowd. Finally, Ice breaks...a grin.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tI guess I owe you one.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tYou don't owe me anything.\n\t\tWe're on the same team. \n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tYou saved our lives. You did it! \n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWe did it.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tYou're a hell of a flyer.\n\t\t    (he can't resist)\n\t\tYou can be my wingman any time.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t    (laughs)\n\tNo. You can be mine!\n\t\n\tNow Ice laughs. Nobody's ever gonna win on this one. But Ice \n\tsmiles at him...It's now a running joke between them.\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tWhatever you say, Commander.\n\t\n\t\n\tHe and Slider snap to and proudly salute. Maverick \n\thesitates, then returns it. As Ice and Slider snap it off, it \n\tturns into the pilot's salute, they give them the bird. \n\tMaverick and Fungus laugh and return the compliment. \n\t\n\tAs they are mobbed by sailors, Maverick is elated to see two \n\tfamiliar figures: Hollywood and Wolfman turn from their \n\tbattle damaged TOMCAT on the forward elevator as it sinks out \n\tof sight below decks.\n\t\n\t\n\t138.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWhat happened to you?\n\t\n\t\t\tWOLFMAN\n\tHe got our radio, and an engine. We \n\twere lucky to make it back.\n\t\n\t\t\tHOLLYWOOD\n\tNot luck. Skill.\n\t\n\t\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\t\n\tStinger rushes up, grabs Ice and Maverick in a bear hug.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tMiG killers! You name it, boy. \n\tSky's the limit. You name it. A \n\tmedal. Anything you want. Anything.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tICE\n\tMiG killers!  What else is there?\n\t\n\tMaverick grins, turns away from them.  He he looks out, at \n\tthe dying sun glinting over the sea. He thinks how beautiful \n\tit is out here! Fungus grabs him from behind.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tYou hear that? Anything we want. \n\tAnything...Well???\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWell what?\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWhat do you want?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWhat do I want?\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWhat do you want?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\t     (he thinks.)\n\tAny more MiGs?\n\t\n\tStinger shakes his head no.\n\t\n\t\t\tSTINGER\n\tThey don't seem to want to come up \n\tanymore. There's nothing on the \n\tscopes. In fact, everybody's \n\tdenying the incident ever happened. \n\tSo...what is it?  What do you want?\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick turns away, considering the options.\n\t\n\t\n\t139.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK - ANOTHER ANGLE\n\t\n\tAnother Tomcat rolls up to park nearby. He looks \n\tat the plane. Over the deck LOUDSPEAKER, comes the \n\tfinal call to the F-14:\n\t\n\t\t\tLSO (V.O. filtered)\n\t    (a touch of sarcasm)\n\tOKAY, GENTLEMEN. YOU CAN CUT YOUR \n\tENGINES...YOU HAVE ARRIVED....\n\t\n\t\n\tWWHHHEEEEZZZZEEERRRRRUUUUUMMMMMMMMM...\n\t\n\tAS THE ENGINES FADE, SO DOES THE PICTURE.\n\t\n\t\n\tFADE IN - WEEKS LATER\n\t\n\t140.  EXT. DAY - FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - TOPGUN\n\t\n\tViper, Jester and others walk out of hangar to watch a wing \n\treturn.\n\t\n\t\n\t141A.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY\n\t\n\tTHEIR POV. Suddenly an F-14 breaks, ROARS in over the field \n\tinverted, a hundred feet off the ground.\n\t\n\t\n\t142.  FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - DAY\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tWho's the hell is that?\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tThree guesses.\n\t\n\t\t\tJESTER\n\tWell, he's in trouble and he didn't \n\teven get here yet.\n\t\n\t\n\tJester looks over at an admiral, who steps out of a staff \n\tcar, squints up at the swooping plane, turns, barks an order \n\tto his driver, jumps in the car and SLAMS the door, the car \n\ttakes off.\n\t\n\t\n\t143.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - FURTHER DOWN THE RUNWAY\n\t\n\tMP jeeps - lights flashing, pull out and head for the flight \n\tline.\n\t\n\t\t\tVIPER\n\tCome on.\n\t\n\tThey head for the hangar\n\t\n\t\n\t144.  OVER THE END OF THE RUNWAY\n\t\n\tThe jet breaks at 500 knots and sets down neatly on the \n\ttarmac. The rest of his flight follows in perfect formation.\n\t\n\t\n\t145.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - MAVERICK'S JET -PULLING UP\n\t\n\tHe unbuckles his straps, takes his helmet off. He looks over \n\tat the approaching caravan.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tI think they know we're here.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tLet me do the talking.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tOh, no. You did the flying, I'll do \n\tthe talking! \n\t\n\tHe stands up in the cockpit, gives a snappy salute.\n\t\n\t\t\tFUNGUS\n\tWhy Admiral....How really good it \n\tis to see you!\n\t\n\t\n\tMaverick turns away. As he backs down the steps, a jeep \n\tscreeches up, doors slam open, footsteps.\n\t\n\t\t\tA VOICE\n\tWho's in charge here?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tI am.\n\t\n\tHe's answered automatically, but now it hits him. He knows \n\tthe voice. He turns.\n\t\n\tHIS POV - CHARLIE, HANDS ON HIPS\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tNot for long, you keep that up.\n\t\n\tHe hops down, stands there speechless, grinning happily at \n\ther.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tWell?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tWell what?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tYou got your F-14, you got Top Gun, \n\tyou got your MiGs....You're our new \n\tTop Gun instructor...Now what?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tOh...I'll think of something... \n\tWhat are you doing here?\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tI live here, remember?\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tRight on the flight line?\n\t\n\tHe's got her on that one. She laughs.\n\t\n\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\tEverybody's got to be somewhere.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tMaybe your somewhere's with me...\n\t\n\tHe puts his arms around her. Self-conscious, she pulls away, \n\ta little embarrassed to show this on the flight line. He \n\tlaughs.\n\t\n\t\t\tMAVERICK\n\tThat's okay. I always look forward \n\tto a challenge. \n\t\n\t\n\tNow she laughs back and puts her arms around him. She kisses \n\thim and now she doesn't give a damn who sees it.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tTOP GUN\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tChip Proser\n\tHollywood \n\tApril 19, 1985\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Gun\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Chip Proser\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:37:27.439289"}
