From somewhere within the wind\ncomes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters\nsinging \"My Favorite Things.\" A series of sepia images of\nanti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after\nanother on the screen.\n\nIn the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title\nFEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.

ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nTHE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred\nmiles an hour.  THE STONES' \"Sympathy For the Devil\" blares.\n\nAT THE WHEEL\n\nSTRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,\nBEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.\n\nBESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND\nWRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY\nUNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR.

There is nothing\n            in the world more helpless and\n            irresponsible and depraved than a\n            man in the depths of an ether binge.\n            And I knew we'd get into that\n            rotten stuff pretty soon.\n\nThe radio news wars with \"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL\" on a tape\nrecorder.\n\n                         RADIO NEWS\n            An overdose of heroin was listed as\n            the official cause of death for\n            pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby\n            whose body was found stuffed in a\n            refrigerator last week...\n\nGONZO changes the station - \"ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET\nJESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE\" vies with \"SYMPATHY\"...

I never rode in a\n            convertible before!\n\nThen the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the\nsight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-\nNORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.\n\n                         DUKE\n            Is that right?  Well, I guess\n            you're about ready, eh?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER hesitates.\n\n                         GONZO\n            We're your friends.

How long before one of\n            us starts raving and jabbering at\n            this boy?  What will he think then?\n            This same lonely desert was the\n            last known home of the Manson family.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling\ndown GONZO's neck.\n\n                         DUKE (V/O)\n            Would he make that grim connection\n            when my attorney starts screaming\n            about bats and huge manta rays\n            coming down on the car?\n\nDUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with\nthe words, sometimes not.\n\n                         DUKE (V/O)\n            If so - well, we'll just have to\n            cut his head off and bury him\n            somewhere.

GONZO\nJUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.\n\nDUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.\n\n                         DUKE\n            Hey!\n\nGONZO stops -- turns.\n\n                         DUKE\n            Don't take any guff from those\n            swine.  Remember, if you have any\n            trouble you can always send a\n            telegram to the Right People.\n\n                         GONZO\n            Yeah... Explaining my Position.\n            Some asshole wrote a poem about\n            that once...\n\nGONZO pauses.\n\n                         GONZO\n            Probably good advice, if you have\n            shit for brains.\n\nGONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT\nTO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND\nLEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.\n\n                         DUKE (V/O)\n            There he goes -- one of God's own\n            prototypes -- a high powered mutant\n            of some kind never even considered\n            for mass production.  Too weird to\n            live and too rare to die.\n\n                                                          107.\n\n\nDUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH\nTHE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT\n\nOn the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find\nDUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his\ntypewriter.\n\n                         DUKE\n            We are all wired into a survival\n            trip now.  No more of the speed\n            that fueled that 60's.  That was\n            the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.\n            He crashed around America selling\n            \"consciousness expansion\" without\n            ever giving a thought to the grim\n            meat-hook realities that were lying\n            in wait for all the people who took\n            him seriously...\n\nDUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly\nrises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT\nIMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.\n\n                         DUKE\n            All those pathetically eager acid\n            freaks who thought they could buy\n            Peace and Understanding for three\n            bucks a hit.  But their loss and\n            failure is ours too.  What Leary\n            took down with him was the central\n            illusion of a whole life-style that\n            he helped create...\n\nRISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30\nFEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE\nCAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...\n\n                         DUKE\n            ... a generation of permanent\n            cripples, failed seekers, who never\n            understood the essential old-mystic\n            fallacy of the Acid Culture: the\n            desperate assumption that somebody...\n            or at least some force -- is\n            tending the light at the end of the\n            tunnel.\n\nHIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX\nSURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON\nSIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT\nLIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.\n\n                                                          108.\n\n\nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY\n\nA BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE\nDRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out\nof the back seat as he takes a bump.\n\n                         DUKE (V/O)\n            There was only one road back to L.A.\n            US Interstate 15, just a flat-out\n            high speed burn through Baker and\n            Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the\n            Hollywood Freeway straight into\n            frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,\n            just another freak in the Freak\n            Kingdom.\n\nDUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING\nfacing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon\nsign that flashes beer.\n\n                         DUKE\n            Ahhh.  Wonderful.\n\nDUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.\n\nINT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY\n\nDUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all\nabout the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON\nWHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE\nRAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD\nMAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden\nbar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.\n\n                         PROPRIETOR\n            What'll you have?\n\nDUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.\n\n                         DUKE\n                   (doubtfully)\n            Ballantine Ale...?\n\nTHE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND\nRELAXES.\n\n                         DUKE\n            Hard to find it served like this\n            anymore.\n\nAs he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE\nAMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY\nPIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack\nreads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.\n\n                                                          109.\n\n\n                         PROPRIETOR\n            Where ya comin' from, young man?\n\n                         DUKE\n            Las Vegas.\n\n                         PROPRIETOR\n            A great town, that Vegas.  I bet\n            you had good luck there.  You're\n            the type.\n\n                         DUKE\n            I know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.\n\n                         PROPRIETOR\n                   (trustingly)\n            That's a fine combination.  You\n            can't lose.\n\nA LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS\nREALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...\nKISSES THE PROPRIETOR.\n\n                         DUKE\n                   (caught off guard... muttering)\n            Oh, my God!...\n\n                         PROPRIETOR\n                   (not understanding)\n            This is my granddaughter...\n\n                         DUKE\n                   (recovering)\n            Don't worry...\n                   (leans forward in confidence)\n            ... and I'm actually the District\n            Attorney from Ignoto County.\n                   (winks)\n            Just another good American like\n            yourself.\n\nA MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.\n\nWordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the\nback of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.\n\nWHO FEELS ASHAMED.\n\nDUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.\n\nEXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY\n\nA CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.\nGets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...\n\n                                                          110.\n\n\nA state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.\n\nSomberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags\nstep off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...\n\nDUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the\ntrembling dash... DUKE catches it...\n\nONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...\n\nDUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --\nTEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.\n\n                         DUKE\n            HOLY SHIT!!!\n\nDUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT\nTHE MARINES.\n\n                         DUKE\n            GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!\n\nDUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS\nIN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE\nCONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nThe TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.\n\nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY\n\nDUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!\n\nDUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.\n\n                         DUKE (V/O)\n            My heart was filled with joy.  I\n            felt like a monster reincarnation\n            of Horatio Alger... a man on the\n            move... and just sick enough to be\n            totally confident.\n\nThe WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\n                             END\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Terry Gilliam\u00a0\u00a0Tony Grisoni\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:05.858623"}
