This time, Ronnie\n          tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too\n          fast. Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges\n          and ducks. Ronnie hits the brake. The skater thinks he\n          has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his\n          way.

I think the best thing\n                       at this point is to just follow up\n                       with the other ladies who saw the\n                       perpetrator yesterday and see if\n                       they remember anything.\n          \n                                     BRANDI                               \n                       What if he comes back?                             \n                                                                          \n                                     DETECTIVE HARRISON\n                       That's highly unlikely.

Now, this Toyota                   \n                       runs really good. It always                        \n                       starts when you need it to and it                  \n                       gets good gas mileage and you                      \n                       don't have to do much to maintain                  \n                       it.

Now let's say that                     \n                       somebody offers you a chance to                    \n                       get rid of that Toyota and instead                 \n                       you get a Ferrari. It may be more                  \n                       expensive and harder to drive, but                 \n                       I mean, it just looks good as                      \n                       hell.
