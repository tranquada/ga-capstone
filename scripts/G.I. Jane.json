SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY\n\nBlinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit\nin the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES,\na 50-year-old civilian.  This is his confirmation hearing.\nReading from prepared material:\n\n                         HAYES\n          ... last few years have brought many\n          advances in the interests of women\n          in naval service, particularly in\n          the land-based maritime specialties.\n          What's more, the Navy has instituted\n          special sensitivity courses with an\n          eye on --\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          Whoa, whoa, whoa.  \"Land-based\n          maritime specialties.\" Gimme a\n          second here to de-euphemize that...\n\nAt the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to\nponder the ceiling of the hearing room.  Her plaque card\nreads \"CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE.\" DeHaven is a\ntough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60.\nIn her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades --\nand she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          Would that be anything like\n          \"typing\"?  \"Restocking the\n          cupboards\"?  That sort of thing, Mr.\n          Hayes?\n\nCHUCKLES from the packed gallery.  The flag officers go\nstone-faced.  Hayes forces a smile.\n\n                         HAYES\n          Hardly the case, Senator.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          Well, I'm just an old dame without\n          much time left, so you'll pardon me\n          if I jump right in here before they\n          discontinue my blood-type.  I am\n          deeply concerned over the Navy's\n          seemingly incontrovertible attitude\n          toward women in the military.  Case\n          in point...\n\nOn cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members\nof the dais.  Hayes gets a copy, too.

She's roasting his nuts over an open\nfire, and everyone knows it.\n\n                         HAYES\n          The commission concluded that the\n          aviator in question failed to\n          execute a proper approach to the\n          carrier.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          That aside for the moment, I'm\n          struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit\n          of your report... the degrading\n          remarks by other aviators...\n          innuendo about her performance in\n          unrelated situations... even a\n          reference to her sexual activity the\n          weekend prior.\n                  (closing report)\n          In my seven years on this committee,\n          I've never seen a downed aviator\n          treated like this.  Never.  I'm\n          deeply disturbed by this report, Mr.\n          Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for\n          women in the military -- but for\n          your own confirmation as well.\n\n\nINT.

And we're gonna hog the\n          bathroom, too.\n\nDEHAVEN'S AIDE catches up, pulls her aside.\n\n                         DEHAVEN'S AIDE\n          White House boys want a private\n          meeting.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          I'll act surprised.\n\n\nINT.

The task, as the\n          Administration sees it, is to\n          acknowledge changing realities\n          without losing traditional values.\n\nA beat.

The Court\n          cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws\n          as a legal foundation for keeping\n          women ineligible.  That decision\n          held for all these years -- until\n          the White House, 10 days ago, moved\n          to have the Exclusion Laws voided.\n          To demolish that legal foundation.\n\n                         JORDAN\n          So?

Because he knows what I\n          know -- that American families are\n          not prepared to put their daughters\n          in harm's way.\n\n                         JORDAN\n          You don't know that.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          In face, I do:  Roper, Harris,\n          Gallop -- they all come back the\n          same.\n\n                         JORDAN\n          What are you saying?

He will fry me six\n          ways to Sunday for sending daughters\n          and young mothers off to war -- and,\n          quite possibly, for bringing them\n          back in body bags.\n\nJordan shakes her head in disbelief.

I don't expect you to fully\n          understand this -- but sometimes\n          there's more to be gained from the\n          fight than the victory.\n\n                         JORDAN\n          So the rhetoric gets you headlines.\n          But the reality gets you in trouble.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          The reality is this:  We send far\n          too many men off to war.  I don't\n          need to compound the problem with\n          women.\n                  (off Jordan's look)\n          Can you honestly tell me you wanted\n          that life?

By 18-hundred he was\n          gone.  Out of the Navy.\n\n                         JORDAN\n                  (knowing better)\n          Just a coincidence?\n\n                         INSTRUCTOR PYRO\n          Maybe it's not my place to speculate\n          on his private thoughts.  But I\n          think the Chief knew that his way --\n          his world -- had come and gone.\n\nJordan nods, understanding.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY\n\nDeHaven.  She's holding a press conference, trying to turn\npiss into wine -- and doing a pretty good job:\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          ... of course, we always prefer\n          peace to war.  But if we're going to\n          war, give women a piece.  Give them\n          the choice to defend their country.\n          And if the President doesn't like\n          that idea -- if he wants to continue\n          to deny women their equal rights --\n          then I'll be happy to step out back\n          with him any time, anywhere...\n\nJordan approaches.  Spotting her, the PRESS PLEADS for a\nphoto-op with both women.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          Jordan?  Jordan, dear...\n\nLetting silence be the ultimate expression of scorn,\nJordan walks right past DeHaven...\n\nAnd joins Royce.  Together they turn and leave.\n\n                         C.O.\n          Senator, perhaps this would be a\n          good time for that lunch.  Will the\n          America's Cup team be joining us?\n\n\nEXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY\n\nJordan and Royce walk hand in hand, strolling the same\nbeach she trained on.\n\n                         JORDAN\n          So here we are again.  Staring three\n          years of operational duty in the\n          face.\n\n                         ROYCE\n          Look.  It's not like you'd be\n          completely out of reach.  And maybe\n          we could call in a few favors, get\n          you stationed at Norfolk instead of\n          Coronado.  There are ways of dealing\n          with these things -- I mean, if\n          people are so inclined.\n\n                         JORDAN\n                  (warily)\n          Which is guy-speak for...\n\n                         ROYCE\n          \"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no\n          matter how long.\"\n\nFinally, the right answer.\n\n\nEXT.  AIR STATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY\n\nSTART TIGHT on Jordan's face.  Even beneath the camouflage\npaint, we can see her exhilaration.  PULL BACK to find her\nin a line of commandos boarding an IDLING C-130:  She's\nembarking on her first mission.  KEEP PULLING BACK until\nwe've lost her completely -- until she's just one soldier\namong many, indistinguishable from the rest.\n\n                                            FADE OUT.\n\n                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG.I.
