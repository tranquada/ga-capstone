Without interrupting this, he speaks with \n               tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to \n               his chest. (It is 8:00 a.m.)\n\n               (In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build \n               to an exciting crescendo).\n\n<b>               EXT. FIELD - HONG KONG - MED. SHOT - DAY\n</b>\n               A group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, \n               are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which \n               is tracking a target. The radar operator says something to \n               another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field \n               telephone. (It is 5:00 a.m.)\n\n<b>               INT. INDIAN RADIO STATION - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The microphone bears the word CALCUTTA. An Indian announcer, \n               his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into \n               the mike in a native tongue. A clock on the wall indicates \n               that it is 2:26\n\n<b>               EXT.

RUSSIAN BOMBER - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope. He \n               points it out excitedly to the pilot. The pilot adjusts his \n               microphone and starts making a report back to his base in \n               Russian.\n\n<b>               EXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - STREET CORNER - MED.

They exchange uneasy glances. One old man crosses \n               himself.\n\n<b>               SPLIT SCREEN SHOT\n</b>\n<b>               RIGHT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT.

On the wall behind \n               him is a clock which reads 3:32.\n\n<b>               LEFT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. BRITISH RADIO STATION - \n</b><b>               NIGHT\n</b>\n               A clock shows the time to be 8:32. The British announcer \n               tries to maintain his traditional BBC calm, but finds it \n               almost impossible to control his excitement.\n\n<b>                                     BRITISH ANNOUNCER\n</b>                         Reports are coming in from all over \n                         the Empire -- from all over the world. \n                         The Government have not yet issued a \n                         statement, but there seems to be no \n                         question that there actually is a \n                         large, unidentified object circling \n                         the earth at incredible speed.\n\n               This announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and \n               now we hear the words the American announcer is saying...\n\n<b>                                     AMERICAN ANNOUNCER\n</b>                              (staccato with \n                              excitement)\n                         We still don't know what it is or \n                         where it's from \u0096- but we do know \n                         there's something there.

THE MALL - MED. LONG SHOT - DAY\n</b>\n               We are at the actual location now, not looking at TV. We see \n               the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two \n               artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns. Some distance \n               away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by \n               police. Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television \n               cameras. OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED. SHOT. As it does so, we \n               see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of \n               the ship. One, which is an oddly-designed coil of wire, slides \n               up and revolves slowly.

SHOT - THE SHIP\n</b>\n               After a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of \n               the side of the ship and slides down to the ground. There is \n               an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp. He \n               looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity. \n               This is KLAATU. He is completely human in appearance. The \n               only unearthly thing about him is his clothing. He wears a \n               tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time \n               thoroughly comfortable and practical. On his head is a metal \n               helmet that obscures most of his face. (It would be impossible \n               to identify him later.) The design of this helmet gives the \n               impression that it is more a formal headdress than for \n               protection. Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man \n               of tremendous dignity and presence. He has the tolerant \n               superiority that comes with absolute knowledge.\n\n<b>               INDIVIDUAL REACTION CUTS\n</b>\n               of soldiers, people in the crowd, and policemen.

CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n</b>\n               After an impressive moment, he raises his arms in the \n               universal gesture of neutrality. Then he speaks, in perfect \n               English, his voice amplified as though through an enunciator.\n\n<b>                                     KLAATU\n</b>                         We have come to visit you in peace -- \n                         and with good will.\n\n               Klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers. As he \n               does so, he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking \n               object, longish and tubular. It might be a a telescope -- or \n               it might be some strange kind of weapon.\n\n<b>               MED. SHOT\n</b>\n               shooting from the side, showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward \n               the line of soldiers. He holds out the mysterious object in \n               front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering \n               but could be misinterpreted as menacing. There is a growing, \n               uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as Klaatu \n               advances. They are clearly frightened of what he may do.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - PLATOON LEADER\n</b>\n               A young second lieutenant, standing in front of his platoon. \n               As Klaatu advances, the lieutenant unslings his carbine.\n\n<b>               MED.

CLOSE SHOT\n</b>\n               of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank. He \n               is watching Klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and \n               he has drawn his pistol. Convinced that the lieutenant is in \n               jeopardy, the tank commander aims at Klaatu and fires.\n\n<b>               MED. SHOT\n</b>\n               as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded. The object he was \n               holding has dropped from his hand and smashed. The soldiers \n               start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there \n               appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot. There \n               is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw \n               back at sight of him. The robot is ten feet tall, is made in \n               the almost-perfect image of a man. He is to be played by an \n               actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal. \n               His eyes flash as though lighted internally. His perfectly-\n               fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth. \n               This is GORT.\n\n               There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously, \n               down the ramp to the ground. As he does so, the ramp closes \n               behind him. Gort's face is, and always remains, utterly \n               expressionless. He stops to look at Klaatu, lying on the \n               ground. Then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and \n               guns. All the guns have been traversing to follow him.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n</b>\n               From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as \n               though power were being generated within him. His eyes flash \n               toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot.\n\n<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TANK\n</b>\n               There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is \n               suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely \n               disintegrated. Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun \n               barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what \n               had been there. The tank's crew has remained unharmed.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n</b>\n               The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in \n               a semicircle taking in all the troops.\n\n<b>               MED.

In a growing \n               crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is \n               destroyed. The two machine guns are little heaps of junk. \n               The 75's are larger heaps. The second tank, like the first, \n               is a three-foot pile of scrap. Rifles have dropped from the \n               soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of \n               wood and metal. None of the men has been harmed, but their \n               faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.\n\n<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TROOPS\n</b>\n               as they react to the full shock of what has happened. Most \n               of them stand rooted to the ground. Several laugh \n               hysterically. A few break and run wildly.\n\n<b>               MED.

Utterly terrified by what \n               they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, \n               screaming mob, concerned only with escape.\n\n<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n</b>\n               He is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the \n               tank commander who fired on Klaatu. Standing by the debris \n               of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. The robot \n               starts to reach out to grab him.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n</b>\n               lying on the ground.

Dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains \n               that way.\n\n<b>               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n</b>\n               He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, \n               his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. The two \n               platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by \n               the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. They are \n               uncertain as to what they should do. The platoon leader eyes \n               the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns \n               questioningly to Klaatu. With great dignity, Klaatu picks up \n               the broken object, which we see well for the first time. It \n               is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed. On it \n               are indications of small electronic gadgets.\n\n<b>                                     KLAATU\n</b>                         It was a gift.

As he does so, a colonel and a captain \n               come into scene.\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL\n</b>                              (to the lieutenants)\n                         Is he all right?\n\n<b>                                     FIRST PLATOON LEADER\n</b>                         Got hit in the shoulder, sir.\n\n               The three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and \n               look to the colonel, who thinks for a moment before making \n               his decision.\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL\n</b>                         Send for an ambulance.

As he passes, from the open windows of the \n               houses come the voices of radio announcers. We get a sentence \n               or two from one house and then, as the man and our CAMERA \n               pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up.

SHOT - THE DELEGATES\n</b>\n               watching breathless, stunned by what they have heard and \n               seen.\n\n<b>               MED. LONG SHOT - THE SHIP\n</b>\n               As the sound from inside it builds to a climax, the great \n               ship takes off with a tremendous roar.\n\n<b>               REACTION CUTS OF DELEGATES\n</b>\n               All are deeply moved and impressed. In the mind of each is \n               the burning question that Klaatu has posed for them.\n\n<b>               LONG SHOT - THE SHIP\n</b>\n               as it soars away into the inky blackness of the outer spaces \n               from which it came.\n\n<b>                                                                  FADE OUT:\n</b>\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b>\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Day the Earth Stood Still, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Edmund H.
