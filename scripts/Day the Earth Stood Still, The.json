SHOT - DAY\n\n               Backgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf, an American \n               army radar operator sits at his huge instrument, intently \n               tracking a target. Without interrupting this, he speaks with \n               tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to \n               his chest. (It is 8:00 a.m.)\n\n               (In this and the subsequent scenes, music and cutting build \n               to an exciting crescendo).\n\n               EXT. FIELD - HONG KONG - MED. SHOT - DAY\n\n               A group of British soldiers, in shorts and tropical gear, \n               are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment, which \n               is tracking a target. The radar operator says something to \n               another soldier, who turns and speaks excitedly into a field \n               telephone. (It is 5:00 a.m.)\n\n               INT. INDIAN RADIO STATION - NIGHT\n\n               The microphone bears the word CALCUTTA. An Indian announcer, \n               his expression one of excitement and terror, jabbers into \n               the mike in a native tongue. A clock on the wall indicates \n               that it is 2:26\n\n               EXT. RUSSIAN BOMBER IN FLIGHT - (STOCK) - NIGHT\n\n               The plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage.\n\n               INT. RUSSIAN BOMBER - NIGHT\n\n               The radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope. He \n               points it out excitedly to the pilot. The pilot adjusts his \n               microphone and starts making a report back to his base in \n               Russian.\n\n               EXT. FRENCH VILLAGE - STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT - \n               NIGHT\n\n               A group of French farmers is collected around a radio, \n               listening wide-eyed to the keyed-up voice which is telling \n               them, in French, of a strange object that has been seen in \n               the sky. They exchange uneasy glances. One old man crosses \n               himself.\n\n               SPLIT SCREEN SHOT\n\n               RIGHT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. AMERICAN RADIO STATION - \n               DAY\n\n               A breathless American radio reporter is speaking into his \n               mike, but we can't hear what he's saying. On the wall behind \n               him is a clock which reads 3:32.\n\n               LEFT SECTION OF SCREEN SHOWS INT. BRITISH RADIO STATION - \n               NIGHT\n\n               A clock shows the time to be 8:32. The British announcer \n               tries to maintain his traditional BBC calm, but finds it \n               almost impossible to control his excitement.\n\n                                     BRITISH ANNOUNCER\n                         Reports are coming in from all over \n                         the Empire -- from all over the world. \n                         The Government have not yet issued a \n                         statement, but there seems to be no \n                         question that there actually is a \n                         large, unidentified object circling \n                         the earth at incredible speed.\n\n               This announcer keeps talking, but his voice fades out, and \n               now we hear the words the American announcer is saying...\n\n                                     AMERICAN ANNOUNCER\n                              (staccato with \n                              excitement)\n                         We still don't know what it is or \n                         where it's from \u0096- but we do know \n                         there's something there.

NEW YORK TAXI - DRIVER AND FARE \u0096 DAY\n\n               The driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio, \n               as we hear the voice of another radio reporter.\n\n                                     2ND RADIO REPORTER\n                              (voice off scene)\n                         This is not another \"flying saucer\" \n                         scare. Scientists and military men \n                         have already agreed on that. Whatever \n                         this is -- it's something real.\n\n               EXT. SUBURBAN GAS STATION\n\n               The attendant, who is filling a car with gas, leans around \n               to hear the car's radio, oblivious to the fact that the car's \n               tank is overflowing.\n\n                                     3RD RADIO REPORTER\n                              (voice off scene)\n                         We interrupt this program to give \n                         you a bulletin just received from \n                         one of our naval units at sea. \"A \n                         large object, traveling at supersonic \n                         speed, is headed over the North \n                         Atlantic toward the east coast of \n                         the United States.\"\n\n               Music builds to a climax and ends.\n\n               INT.

As a matter of fact, \n                         there are signs of normalcy that \n                         seem strangely out of place; the \n                         beautiful spring weather, the tourist \n                         crowds at the various monuments and \n                         public buildings...\n\n               EXT.

WASHINGTON MONUMENT - LONG SHOT (STOCK)\n\n               Under this shot a barely audible, distant hum is heard. It \n               grows in volume so imperceptibly in this and the next two \n               shots that we are unconscious of it.\n\n               EXT. JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)\n\n               EXT. THE MALL - LONG SHOT\n\n               Crowds are strolling on the Mall and across the well-kept \n               lawns in front of the Smithsonian Institution with the \n               leisurely, meandering quality that distinguishes sight-seers.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               Including several small groups of people moving toward the \n               Smithsonian. Their attention is attracted as the hum off \n               scene becomes a roar. The sound is unearthly in its intensity \n               and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume. The \n               people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               Several people on the steps of the Smithsonian have turned \n               to look. There is cold, frozen fear in their eyes. The awful \n               sound keeps increasing in volume.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               A man, following the progress of a huge object in the sky \n               with his eyes.

The \n               tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the \n               great ship settles gently to a perfect landing.\n\n               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP\n\n               The gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind -- \n               no windows, no ports, not even the outline of a hatch. It is \n               a fearsome, terrifying object, giving no evidence of its \n               source or its intention.\n\n               LONG SHOT - (FROM PARALLEL)\n\n               Shooting down on a section of lawn, showing the varying \n               reactions of people to the landing. Some are still running \n               madly away; others, singly and in little groups, stand as \n               though rooted, staring at the ship from a respectful distance.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - MAN\n\n               As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror. He'd \n               like to run but he can't. His mouth twitches and he emits a \n               nervous little laugh.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               A woman is holding a two-year-old child by the hand as she \n               watches the ship, awe-struck. Several people run past them. \n               Suddenly the woman grabs up the child with a little sob, \n               turns and runs away.\n\n               MED.

THE MALL - MED. LONG SHOT - DAY\n\n               We are at the actual location now, not looking at TV. We see \n               the ship surrounded by soldiers, two medium tanks, two \n               artillery pieces, and a couple of machine guns. Some distance \n               away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians, held back by \n               police. Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television \n               cameras. OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED. SHOT. As it does so, we \n               see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of \n               the ship. One, which is an oddly-designed coil of wire, slides \n               up and revolves slowly. The other is a section of vented \n               pipe with a convex cap on it.\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE\n\n               on the soldiers, their eyes glued to this first sign of \n               activity from the ship. They shift uneasily, gripping their \n               rifles more firmly.\n\n               MED. SHOT - THE SHIP\n\n               After a long, tense moment, a ramp appears silently out of \n               the side of the ship and slides down to the ground. There is \n               an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp. He \n               looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity. \n               This is KLAATU. He is completely human in appearance. The \n               only unearthly thing about him is his clothing. He wears a \n               tunic that is very good looking, but at the same time \n               thoroughly comfortable and practical. On his head is a metal \n               helmet that obscures most of his face. (It would be impossible \n               to identify him later.) The design of this helmet gives the \n               impression that it is more a formal headdress than for \n               protection. Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man \n               of tremendous dignity and presence. He has the tolerant \n               superiority that comes with absolute knowledge.\n\n               INDIVIDUAL REACTION CUTS\n\n               of soldiers, people in the crowd, and policemen. The newsreel \n               and TV men are busy at their cameras.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               After an impressive moment, he raises his arms in the \n               universal gesture of neutrality. Then he speaks, in perfect \n               English, his voice amplified as though through an enunciator.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         We have come to visit you in peace -- \n                         and with good will.\n\n               Klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers. As he \n               does so, he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking \n               object, longish and tubular. It might be a a telescope -- or \n               it might be some strange kind of weapon.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               shooting from the side, showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward \n               the line of soldiers. He holds out the mysterious object in \n               front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering \n               but could be misinterpreted as menacing. There is a growing, \n               uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as Klaatu \n               advances. They are clearly frightened of what he may do.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - PLATOON LEADER\n\n               A young second lieutenant, standing in front of his platoon. \n               As Klaatu advances, the lieutenant unslings his carbine.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               Klaatu starts toward the platoon leader, raising the object \n               he holds toward the man, trying to make clear his intentions. \n               Misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture, the platoon leader \n               raises his carbine to his shoulder.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank. He \n               is watching Klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and \n               he has drawn his pistol. Convinced that the lieutenant is in \n               jeopardy, the tank commander aims at Klaatu and fires.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded. The object he was \n               holding has dropped from his hand and smashed. The soldiers \n               start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there \n               appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot. There \n               is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw \n               back at sight of him. The robot is ten feet tall, is made in \n               the almost-perfect image of a man. He is to be played by an \n               actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal. \n               His eyes flash as though lighted internally. His perfectly-\n               fashioned, muscular body is covered only with a loincloth. \n               This is GORT.\n\n               There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously, \n               down the ramp to the ground. As he does so, the ramp closes \n               behind him. Gort's face is, and always remains, utterly \n               expressionless. He stops to look at Klaatu, lying on the \n               ground. Then he looks around at the soldiers, the tanks and \n               guns. All the guns have been traversing to follow him.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n\n               From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound, as \n               though power were being generated within him. His eyes flash \n               toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TANK\n\n               There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is \n               suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal, its parts completely \n               disintegrated. Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun \n               barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what \n               had been there. The tank's crew has remained unharmed.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n\n               The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in \n               a semicircle taking in all the troops.\n\n               MED. SHOT - THE TROOPS\n\n               SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Gort, with the back of his head in f.g., \n               CAMERA PANS to follow Gort's sweeping gaze. In a growing \n               crash and clatter of metal, every weapon in sight is \n               destroyed. The two machine guns are little heaps of junk. \n               The 75's are larger heaps. The second tank, like the first, \n               is a three-foot pile of scrap. Rifles have dropped from the \n               soldier's hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of \n               wood and metal. None of the men has been harmed, but their \n               faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TROOPS\n\n               as they react to the full shock of what has happened. Most \n               of them stand rooted to the ground. Several laugh \n               hysterically. A few break and run wildly.\n\n               MED. SHOT - CROWD OF CIVILIANS\n\n               Sudden pandemonium breaks out. Utterly terrified by what \n               they have witnessed, the crowd becomes a wild, milling, \n               screaming mob, concerned only with escape.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n\n               He is walking slowly, deliberately, menacingly toward the \n               tank commander who fired on Klaatu. Standing by the debris \n               of his tank, the man is immobilized with terror. The robot \n               starts to reach out to grab him.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               lying on the ground. He speaks to Gort sharply, in a strange \n               language.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         Gort! Deglet ovrosco!\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n\n               He pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank \n               commander. Dropping his arms, he stands motionless and remains \n               that way.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground, \n               his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain. The two \n               platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly, badly shaken by \n               the awesome demonstration of power they have seen. They are \n               uncertain as to what they should do. The platoon leader eyes \n               the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns \n               questioningly to Klaatu. With great dignity, Klaatu picks up \n               the broken object, which we see well for the first time. It \n               is a delicately-made tubular telescope, badly smashed. On it \n               are indications of small electronic gadgets.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         It was a gift. For your President.\n                              (glances at the broken \n                              object ruefully)\n                         With this he could have studied life \n                         on other planets.\n\n               Klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation. \n               The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment. \n               Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully, holding \n               his wounded shoulder. As he does so, a colonel and a captain \n               come into scene.\n\n                                     COLONEL\n                              (to the lieutenants)\n                         Is he all right?\n\n                                     FIRST PLATOON LEADER\n                         Got hit in the shoulder, sir.\n\n               The three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and \n               look to the colonel, who thinks for a moment before making \n               his decision.\n\n                                     COLONEL\n                         Send for an ambulance.

SITTING ROOM - WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT\n\n               There is a door to the corridor and a door to Klaatu's room. \n               In the small sitting room, talking in tones of hushed concern, \n               is a group of men. There's a Major General, a likable man \n               with a chest full of ribbons. There are also a Colonel in \n               command of the hospital, a high-ranking police officer, a \n               couple of medical officers and two civilians. The conversation \n               is interrupted by the entrance from Klaatu's room of a Medical \n               Corps Major, followed by an Army Nurse.\n\n                                     GENERAL\n                              (to Major)\n                         How is he?\n\n                                     MAJOR WHITE\n                         He's all right, General...

He \n               finds Klaatu staring out the window.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               As he looks out the window thoughtfully. What he sees has \n               given him an idea.\n\n               MED. SHOT - HOSPITAL GROUNDS\n\n               shooting down, from Klaatu's viewpoint, at people strolling \n               about the hospital grounds. Most of them are civilian \n               visitors, but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory \n               patients.\n\n               FULL SHOT - HOSPITAL ROOM\n\n               As Klaatu turns back to Harley, he speaks thoughtfully, \n               incisively.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         Before making any decisions, I think \n                         I should get out among your people -- \n                         become familiar with the basis for \n                         these strange, unreasoning attitudes.\n\n                                     HARLEY\n                         Under the circumstances I'm afraid \n                         that will be impossible.\n\n               Harley has paused near the door, a little embarrassed by \n               Klaatu's level gaze.\n\n                                     HARLEY\n                         I must ask that you don't attempt to \n                         leave the hospital. Our military \n                         people have insisted on this. I'm \n                         sure you'll understand.\n\n               With a polite nod, he goes out. Klaatu stares after him as \n               he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner. He shakes his \n               head slowly, thoughtfully. The ways of this planet are strange \n               indeed.\n\n               INT. SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR\n\n               Harley has paused to watch as the M.P. takes out a key and \n               inserts it in the lock of Klaatu's door.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               As he hears the click of the lock, he turns toward the door. \n               Realizing they've locked him in, he smiles with tolerant \n               amusement.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL SITTING ROOM - MED CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT\n\n               In the dim light of one lamp, the door to the corridor opens \n               and a nurse enters carrying a tray of medication. She is \n               accompanied by the same M.P. as previously seen. The nurse \n               pauses as the M.P. takes out a key and inserts it in the \n               lock of Klaatu's door. To his surprise he finds that the \n               door is not locked. He exchanges a glance with the nurse, \n               then pulls the door open and hurries inside.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM\n\n               as the M.P. crosses the unlighted room toward the bed. The \n               only light cones from the open door to the sitting room. The \n               M.P.'s eyes go wide as he looks at the bed. It is unmade and \n               unoccupied. Terrified, the M.P. turns to the nurse, who is \n               standing in the doorway.\n\n               M.P.  He's gone!\n\n               The M.P. dashes out of the room, through the doorway past \n               the nurse. She turns to follow him as we--\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               MONTAGE - NIGHT\n\n               A series of short DISSOLVES, showing:\n\n               1. The M.P. excitedly reporting Klaatu's disappearance to \n               the Officer of the Day.\n\n               2. The hospital guard detail hurrying out of the guardhouse \n               to form up in front of the Sergeant of the guard.\n\n               3. A high-level military conference gathered at a table, \n               discussing the matter with great concern.\n\n               4. A street corner newsstand, with people eagerly grabbing \n               papers. The headline reads: \"MAN FROM MARS\" ESCAPES FROM \n               ARMY HOSPITAL!\n\n               5. Radio announcers chattering excitedly into their \n               microphones\n\n               6. A series of close-ups of people listening to the radio. \n               Their faces reveal their awestruck terror.\n\n               7. A terrified mother drags her two children in from the \n               street through the front door, slams the door and bolts it.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT\n\n               CAMERA is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit, \n               who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted, almost \n               deserted, middle-class street. He carries a suitcase and he \n               glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old \n               two-story houses. As he passes, from the open windows of the \n               houses come the voices of radio announcers. We get a sentence \n               or two from one house and then, as the man and our CAMERA \n               pass on, this voice fades and another is picked up. We get \n               the impression that everyone is glued to his radio.\n\n                                     RADIO VOICES\n                              (over scene)\n                         --authorities at Walter Reed Hospital \n                         refused to comment on how he managed \n                         to escape, or what measures might be \n                         taken to apprehend him.\n\n               --these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced \n               as rumor by police Chief Walter Baxter. He is not eight feet \n               tall, as reported -- nor does he have tentacles in place of \n               arms--\n\n               --there's no denying that there is a monster at large -- \n               that we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and \n               power. The public is urged to take ordinary precautions and \n               to remain calm, as we await further developments--\n\n               --three separate reports of people who claim to have seen \n               the \"space man\" in the past hour. One from Des Moines, Iowa; \n               one from a village in northern Florida; and one from Chicago.\n\n               CAMERA OVERTAKES the man as he pauses under the light of a \n               street lamp, and reveals that it is Klaatu. He has stopped \n               to look at something out of scene.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               from Klaatu's viewpoint, of a sign on one of the houses, \n               reading: ROOM FOR RENT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               He seems to hesitate, debating a plan he has in mind. He \n               raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully, and \n               notices for the first time a small tag, or ticket, attached \n               to the inside of the right forearm of the coat he is wearing. \n               Puzzled, he pulls off the ticket and looks at it.\n\n               INSERT - TICKET\n\n               It is the sort of tag a cleaning establishment attaches to \n               clothing. Printed on it is the legend: CAPITOL DRY CLEANING \n               SERVICE. Scrawled in a penciled hand is the notation: Dr. \n               Carpenter, Bldg. A - Walter Reed Hospital. Cl. & pr. $1.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               He smiles wryly at this reminder of where he got the suit, \n               and he destroys the ticket. He glances down at the suitcase \n               beside him.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - SUITCASE\n\n               It bears the initials L.M.C. Klaatu's hand comes into scene \n               and lifts up the suitcase. CAMERA HOLDS as Klaatu carries \n               the bag toward the house and mounts the stone steps to the \n               entrance.\n\n               INT. BOARDINGHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               There 's no light in the room except what splashes in from \n               the hall. Gathered around a television set are five adults \n               and a little boy, their faces eerie in the reflected light \n               from the screen. The room is done in average boardinghouse \n               style -- antimacassars and all. The attention of the people \n               is riveted on the television screen, where a newscaster is \n               reading a bulletin.\n\n                                     TELEVISION COMMENTATOR\n                         --while the President made no effort \n                         to minimize the crisis, he urged \n                         people all over the country to remain \n                         calm. He said the entire facilities \n                         of FBI and other federal agencies \n                         are being bought to bear. He pointed \n                         out, however, that this is no ordinary \n                         man hunt. He warned we may be up \n                         against powers that are beyond our \n                         control.\n\n               FULL SHOT\n\n               The landlady, a stern-faced woman of middle age, named MRS. \n               CROCKETT, rises nervously and crosses to the television set.\n\n                                     MRS. CROCKETT\n                              (tensely)\n                         I can't stand any more of this. It's \n                         enough to drive a person crazy.\n\n               She snaps off the set sharply.\n\n               TWO SHOT\n\n               BOBBY BENSON, a bright-eyed, eleven-year-old, is seated beside \n               his mother, HELEN BENSON, an attractive girl of thirty. \n               Disappointed that the set has been turned off, Bobby's roving \n               eye has fallen on something in the doorway to the hall... \n               Wide-eyed, he nudges his mother and points.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         Hey, Mom -- who's that?\n\n               FULL SHOT\n\n               including the doorway to the hall. Silhouetted motionless \n               against the light from the hall is the figure of a man. All \n               eyes follow Hobby's pointed finger, and there is a stifled \n               gasp as they are startled out of their preoccupation. One of \n               the men turns on the lights and Klaatu is revealed standing \n               calmly in the doorway. There is a shocked silence for a \n               moment, then Mrs. Crockett speaks.\n\n                                     MRS.

Mrs. Barley is a middle-class Helen Hokinson lady, \n               form and unrelenting. Her husband is a born complainer. Mr. \n               Krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. \n               As they finish their coffee, all except Helen are immersed \n               in the Sunday papers. Helen seems preoccupied with her own \n               thoughts. From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel \n               Heater's voice.\n\n                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE\n                         --and so, this Sunday morning, we \n                         ask the question that's been plaguing; \n                         the entire nation for two days now: \n                         \"Where is this creature and what is \n                         he up to?\" If he can build a space \n                         ship that can fly to Earth -- and a \n                         robot that can destroy our tanks and \n                         guns -- what other terrors can he \n                         unleash at will? ...Obviously we \n                         must find this monster. We must track \n                         him down like a wild animal and \n                         destroy him.\n\n               INSERT - NEWSPAPER PAGE IN MRS. BARLEY'S HANDS\n\n               It is a full page layout, in the style of the American Weekly, \n               showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of \n               space ships. Weird-looking creatures are slaughtering Earth \n               people with ray guns. The caption at the top of the image \n               reads: \"Are We Long For This World?\" (Gabriel Heater's voice \n               continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes.)\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               He is reading his paper with considerable interest.\n\n               INSERT - NEWSPAPER STORY\n\n               The third-page story reads: SAVANT CALLS MEETING TO STUDY \n               SPACE SHIP. Professor Jacob Barnhardt, world-famous scientist \n               and Nobel Prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from \n               all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study \n               the recently landed \"Space Ship.\"\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               His face is thoughtful as he finishes reading. This story \n               seems to impress and interest him. Then suddenly he finds \n               his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying.\n\n                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE\n                         But where would such a creature hide \n                         himself? Would he disappear into the \n                         north woods? Or would he slither off \n                         into the sewers of some great city?\n\n               Klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously \n               distasteful idea.\n\n               GROUP SHOT\n\n               AS THE RADIO VOICE CONTINUES:\n\n                                     GABRIEL HEATER'S VOICE\n                         There is grave danger -- everyone \n                         agrees to that. The question is what \n                         can we do to protect ourselves? What \n                         measures can we take that will--\n\n               During the above, Mrs. Barley has turned to her husband in \n               sharp annoyance.\n\n                                     MRS.

Bobby looks \n               up at him.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         You think they'll ever find him?\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                              (alter a moment's \n                              pause)\n                         I don't know, Bobby.

He \n               glances up at Klaatu blankly.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         I'll bet that's the way Professor \n                         Barnhardt talks.\n\n               Pulled out of his reverie, Klaatu glances down at Bobby and \n               smiles apologetically. Bobby grins back at him. Then, as \n               they walk on a few more steps, Klaatu stops and speaks \n               thoughtfully.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         Bobby -- I have an idea.

SHOT - DAY\n\n               The house is an unimposing old-fashioned structure, shouldered \n               on either side by similar one-family dwellings. There is a \n               flight of stone steps leading up to the entrance and a large \n               porch across the front of the house. Klaatu and Bobby walk \n               into scene and pause, Klaatu glances at Bobby and Bobby nods \n               toward the house. They move on up the steps to the entrance.\n\n               MED. CHOOSE SHOT - AT FRONT DOOR\n\n               Bobby, all eagerness and excitement, presses the bell. They \n               wait a moment and there is no answer.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                              (disappointed at the \n                              thought)\n                         Gee -- maybe he isn't home.\n\n               Bobby wanders down the porch and looks into a window. \n               Fascinated by what he sees, he gestures to Klaatu.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         Betcha this is where he works--\n\n               After a glance at the front door, Klaatu joins Bobby at the \n               window and looks in.\n\n               FULL SHOT - BARNHARDT'S STUDY\n\n               SHOOTING through the window, over the heads of Klaatu and \n               Bobby. The room is more of a workroom than a study. It is in \n               comfortably shabby disarray, with papers and books everywhere. \n               There's a battered old desk and a day bed. One wall is solid \n               bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered \n               with a fantastic array of complex equations, graphs and \n               diagrams.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               His attention has been caught by one of the blackboards and \n               he studies it with great interest and curiosity.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - SECTION OF BLACKBOARD\n\n               It is covered with a particularly complicated series of \n               equations in a chalky scrawl, involving angles of vector, \n               Keplerian ellipses, etc. The final equations are unsolved; \n               they have no answers after the \"equals\" sign. Across are \n               little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading: \"Don't \n               erase!\" and \"Don't touch!\"\n\n               TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY\n\n               Bewildered, Bobby looks from the blackboard up at Klaatu. \n               Still studying the blackboard, Klaatu is shaking his head \n               and clucking his tonsure as one might at the attempts of a \n               child to solve a problem in arithmetic.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                              (indicating the \n                              equations)\n                         What does that mean?\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         It's a problem in celestial mechanics.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         Bet he's the only one in the world \n                         knows the answer.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                              (he shakes his head, \n                              smiling)\n                         He doesn't know the answer. And he'll \n                         never get it that way.\n\n               Bobby moves over to a pair of French doors beyond the window \n               and tries to peer in through the curtained doors. He absently \n               tries the doors and finds them locked. Then he turns away \n               with a disappointed but philosophical shrug.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         We probably couldn't get to see him \n                         even if he was home.\n\n               As Bobby moves away from the doors dejectedly, Klaatu puts \n               his hand on the knob.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY\n\n               He's watching Klaatu and his eyes widen at what he sees.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                              (in complete surprise)\n                         Hey -- where you going?\n\n               CHOOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               He has opened the door and is standing in the doorway, his \n               hand, still on the knob. He is smiling at Bobby with secret \n               amusement. He's got an idea.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         If he's that difficult to see, perhaps \n                         we ought to leave a calling card.\n\n               Klaatu disappears into the study. Amazed, Bobby follows.\n\n               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY\n\n               Bobby watches as Klaatu walks to the blackboard and picks up \n               a piece of chalk. As though correcting a schoolboy's work, \n               he makes large check marks at several points in each equation.\n\n               EXT. PORCH - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE\n\n               An efficient-looking middle-aged woman is mounting the steps \n               to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, \n               when her eye falls on the French doors, which are standing \n               ajar. Puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors. \n               This woman is Barnhardt's secretary and her name is HILDA.\n\n               Bobby is watching as Klaatu writes across the blackboard in \n               a bold hand: Differentiate the equation ( ).\n\n               Klaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke, when a \n               stern voice is heard off screen.\n\n                                     HILDA'S VOICE\n                         What are you doing in here?\n\n               FULL SHOT\n\n               as Klaatu and Bobby turn in surprise. Standing in the open \n               French doors is Hilda, eyeing them with stern suspicion.\n\n                                     HILDA\n                              (outraged by Klaatu's \n                              desecration of the \n                              sacred blackboard)\n                         How dare you write on that blackboard!\n                              (Klaatu eyes her mildly)\n                         Do you realize the Professor has \n                         been working on that problem for \n                         weeks?\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                              (pleasantly)\n                         He'll catch on to it in no time now.\n\n                                     HILDA\n                              (controlling herself \n                              with an effort)\n                         How did you get in here?

And he won't be \n                         back till this evening.\n                              (sternly)\n                         I think you'd better leave now. \n                         Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk \n                         and scribbles something on a scratch \n                         pad. He tears off the piece of paper \n                         and hands it to Hilda.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         You might keep this.\n                              (with easy assurance)\n                         I think the professor will want to \n                         get in touch with me.\n\n               With a polite nod he goes out the French doors, followed by \n               Bobby. Hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down \n               at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this \n               stranger. Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks \n               up an eraser, debating whether to erase Klaatu's corrections. \n               At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his \n               head in. Startled, Hilda drops the eraser.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                              (pointing to the \n                              blackboard)\n                         I wouldn't erase that. The Professor \n                         needs it very badly.\n\n               And he disappears, leaving Hilda to glare after him in \n               impotent rage. Deciding that this man is either a crackpot \n               or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts \n               dialing a number.\n\n               EXT.

They are talking and laughing together, but we \n               can't hear their conversation. CAMERA PANS with them as they \n               move on up the sidewalk, revealing two kids playing hopscotch. \n               Klaatu watches, fascinated, as he walks by. Then, having \n               passed the kids, he tries the one-footed, then two-footed \n               hop that characterizes the game.\n\n               INT.

POLICE STATION - FULL SHOT - NIGHT\n\n               The place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but \n               well-ordered activity. Unidentified people who have been \n               picked up in the search for the space man are being screened \n               by the police. They are all men -- all between forty and \n               sixty years old -- and they are from all walks of life. A \n               series of desks have been arranged in a row, with signs over \n               them reading IDENTIFICATION. At each desk is a team of cops \n               and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened. \n               At the far end of the room Klaatu can be seen at the desk of \n               a Police Lieutenant, with the detective who picked him up.\n\n               MED.

As they go they pass a Military Police Captain, who \n               makes his way straight to the Lieutenant's desk.\n\n               EXT. POLICE STATION - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND DETECTIVE\n\n               as they come out of the station. Klaatu hesitates a moment, \n               looks around. His face reveals nothing, but he seems to be \n               momentarily considering the idea of making a break. The \n               Detective, sensitive to such a possibility, hooks his arm \n               under Klaatu's and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent \n               command. Klaatu allows himself to be led off.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               as the Detective leads Klaatu across the sidewalk to the \n               curb, where a police car is standing. Parked just behind it \n               is an Army staff car.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO POLICE STATION\n\n               as the M.P. Captain appears in the entrance, accompanied by \n               the Police Lieutenant. They see Klaatu and the Detective \n               approaching the police car and hurry out of scene after them.\n\n               MED.

SHOT\n\n               as Klaatu gets out of the police car and the Captain escorts \n               him toward the staff car. Passing the Lieutenant, Klaatu \n               speaks with a polite smile, a smile that might be one of \n               mild triumph.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         Sorry to trouble you, Lieutenant.\n\n               The Lieutenant reacts with impatient exasperation as the \n               Captain holds the staff car door open for Klaatu, who steps \n               into the Army vehicle, as we--\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. HALLWAY - BARNHARDT'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               as the M.P. Captain and Klaatu enter the front door, which \n               is held open for then by Hilda. She gestures them toward the \n               half-open door of Barnhardt's study, where Barnhardt can be \n               seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard. The Captain \n               knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters \n               with Klaatu.\n\n               INT. BARNHARDT'S STUDY\n\n               Barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the blackboard, \n               chalk in hand.\n\n                                     M.P.

CAPTAIN\n                         I'll wait outside.\n\n               He steps out into the hall, closing the door. Barnhardt \n               continues to study Klaatu for a moment, then points to the \n               notations he made on the blackboard. There is a controlled \n               but anxious excitement in Barnhardt's attitude.\n\n                                     BARNHARDT\n                         You wrote this?\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                              (nodding easily)\n                         It was a clumsy way to introduce \n                         myself -- but I understand you're a \n                         difficult man to see.\n                              (glancing at the \n                              blackboard \n                              reproachfully)\n                         I thought you'd have the solution by \n                         this time.\n\n                                     BARNHARDT\n                         Not yet.

Then he points to one of the expressions in an \n               equation.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         All you have to do now is substitute \n                         this expression--\n                              (pointing to a specific \n                              place)\n                         --at this point.\n\n               Impressed and interested, Barnhardt tugs at his chin as he \n               studies and weighs the results.\n\n                                     BARNHARDT\n                              (slowly, thoughtfully)\n                         Yes -- that will reproduce the first-\n                         order terms.

She is dressed to go \n               out. A corner of the dining room can be seen, where Mr. and \n               Mrs. Barley are playing cards with Mr. Krull. Mrs. Crockett, \n               the landlady, enters from the hall on her way to the dining \n               room and notices Helen.\n\n                                     MRS.

He's my best friend... \n                         And he's awful good in arithmetic. \n                         He even helps Professor Barnhardt.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go \n                         to see Professor Barnhardt?\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         Sure we did! He wasn't there but we \n                         went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter \n                         showed him how to do his arithmetic.\n\n               Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatu's \n               story. Sensing his mother's uneasiness, the boy looks for \n               something intriguing -- some deep, dark secret.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                              (shrewdly)\n                         Mom -- is there something wrong with \n                         Mr. Carpenter?\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         What do you mean, dear?\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         I mean -- on account of that policeman \n                         last night.\n                              (his eyes light up \n                              hopefully)\n                         You think he's a bank robber, maybe? \n                         Or a gangster?\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         No, dear, of course not.

Bobby stands thinking \n               for a moment, his mind still speculating on all sorts of \n               wonderful possibilities. Still preoccupied, he drifts over \n               to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes. He drops the \n               first one to the floor and is starting on the other, when \n               there is a light rap on his door. The door opens and Klaatu \n               appears.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         Bobby -- have you a flashlight?\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                              (surprised by his \n                              appearance and his \n                              request)\n                         Yeah -- sure.\n                              (he goes to a drawer \n                              and gets a large \n                              hand flashlight)\n                         It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.\n\n               Bobby hands him the light, studying his face with eager \n               curiosity.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         What do you want it for, Mr. \n                         Carpenter?\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                              (evasively)\n                         Why -- the light in my room went \n                         out.\n                              (cutting off further \n                              questions)\n                         Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.\n\n               Klaatu goes out, closing the door behind him. Bobby hesitates \n               a moment, puzzled and curious. Then he goes over to the door, \n               flips off the lights, and slowly, noiselessly opens the door \n               a crack so he can peer out into the hall.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               shooting down the hall through the crack in Bobby's door.\n\n               Klaatu's door is ajar and through it the lights in his room \n               can be seen burning brightly. Klaatu goes to his door, reaches \n               in and flips off the lights and closes the door. He then \n               scans the hall in both directions. Satisfied he isn't seen, \n               he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs, \n               still carrying the flashlight.\n\n               MED CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY\n\n               as he closes his door carefully, an expression of intense \n               excitement on his face. What he has seem is certainly, \n               unmistakably suspicious. Why did Mr. Carpenter lie to him? \n               What does he want the flashlight for and where is he going? \n               Bobby decides he's got to find out. Hurriedly he laces on \n               the shoe he had taken off, and peers out the door to find \n               the hall clear. He slips out the door, closing it behind \n               him.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. STREET - MED. CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT\n\n               Klaatu is walking down the dark, semi-deserted street with \n               the determined stride of a man with a definite objective.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY\n\n               Half a block behind, he's following Klaatu, eagerly, flushed \n               with a sense of excitement and adventure.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER - NIGHT\n\n               Walking along the sidewalk, Klaatu turns into a side street, \n               disappearing from view around the corner. In a moment, Bobby \n               hurries into scene breathlessly. He pulls up for a moment to \n               rest. Then, getting his breath, he dashes on around the corner \n               after Klaatu.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. LARGE TEMPORARY BUILDING - LONG SHOT - NIGHT\n\n               This is a temporary structure that has been erected to enclose \n               the space ship and Gort. In front of the one small door are \n               two soldiers, standing guard. Concealed in some foreground \n               foliage, studying the layout, is Klaatu. Nearby 's a sign \n               reading: KEEP OUT! This area OFF LIMITS to the public. U.S. \n               ARMY.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY\n\n               He is a short distance away, watching Klaatu eagerly.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               as he studies the situation.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               shooting over Klaatu's shoulder. As he watches, a Jeep filled \n               with armed soldiers -- apparently regular patrol -- drives \n               up to the entrance of the building. They stop for a moment \n               while their Sergeant checks with the guards. Assured that \n               everything is under control, the Sergeant signals his driver \n               and the Jeep moves off.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               Scanning the side of the building, he sees what he's looking \n               for. Waiting until the Jeep disappears, he starts toward one \n               side of the building, keeping himself concealed in the \n               foliage.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY\n\n               puzzled and interested, as he watches Klaatu.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               The two sentries standing in front of the building.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               as Klaatu maneuvers around the side of the building, where \n               there is a window. It has no glass in it but is heavily \n               barred.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               as he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear, \n               grassy area surrounding the building. He stops and tries to \n               see through the window.\n\n               MED. SHOT - GORT\n\n               shooting through the barred window into the building. The \n               huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a \n               couple of naked work-lights. His head is angled, away from \n               the window.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               as Klaatu approaches the window. Aiming his flashlight at \n               Gort, he flashes the light intermittently, as though \n               signaling. (This should not approximate any known code.)\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n\n               As we watch, the intermittent flashes of Klaatu's light appear \n               on the wall ahead of Gort. Slowly, evenly, the robot's head \n               turns to face the window.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               from Gort's viewpoint, of the window, with Klaatu's light \n               flashing its signals.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               shooting on his back, as he finishes signaling and cuts off \n               the flashlight. He turns ant starts back for the concealment \n               of the foliage.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY\n\n               craning his neck to look for Klaatu, who has eluded his view. \n               Suddenly he sees Klaatu again.\n\n               MED. SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               making his way behind the foliage toward the front of the \n               building. Arriving at a point opposite the entrance, Klaatu \n               waits and watches.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BUILDING\n\n               The two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of \n               relaxed alertness. Suddenly, inside the building behind them, \n               the giant figure of Gort looms silently in the doorway. His \n               two great arms reach out, grab the two guards and drag then \n               back inside the building.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY\n\n               He lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this. Bug-eyed, he \n               glances quickly to the point where he last saw Klaatu. He is \n               amazed at what he sees.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               from Bobby's viewpoint. Klaatu has emerged from the \n               concealment of the tree-lined path and is making his way \n               calmly toward the entrance of the building.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY\n\n               As he watches Klaatu enter the building, his curiosity \n               conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the \n               structure.\n\n               INT. BUILDING - FULL SHOT\n\n               as Klaatu enters. The huge shapes of the space ship and Gort \n               loom large and eerie. Klaatu starts across the barren \n               enclosure toward the ship.\n\n               EXT. ENTRANCE TO BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               as Bobby approaches the door, fearful but fascinated. He \n               peers cautiously inside and his eyes grow wide as saucers.\n\n               EXT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT\n\n               In *f.g., near the door, the two guards lie unconscious. As \n               Klaatu walks toward the ship Gort slowly turns his head to \n               follow him with him with eyes. Klaatu touches a point on the \n               unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings \n               out and down to the ground. Klaatu mounts the ramp and \n               disappears inside the ship, whereupon the ramp silently \n               closes.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - BOBBY\n\n               as he watches this; his eyes bulging. He can scarcely believe \n               what he has seen. Suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps \n               over him. Scrambling to his feet, he turns and runs wildly \n               away.\n\n               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP\n\n               CAMERA FOLLOWS Klaatu as he moves down the tiny, dimly lighted \n               entrance corridor. He steps into the main cabin of the ship \n               and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused, \n               shadowless light. The walls are lined with a complex of \n               mysterious gadgetry -- knobs, dials, indicators, etc. All of \n               this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible, \n               while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced \n               engineering.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               as Klaatu moves to the communications panel, flipping switches \n               and turning dials. Indicators light up. There are crackling, \n               whirring and buzzing sounds. Klaatu starts speaking into a \n               built-in microphone in his own strange language. He speaks \n               in rapid-fire explanation, continuing to talk, as we--\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT\n\n               as Klaatu walks calmly away from the ship, past the two \n               unconscious guards and disappears out of the door.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT THE TWO GUARDS\n\n               as one of them slowly regains consciousness. Looking around, \n               he sees the great figure of Gort and is terror-stricken. He \n               shakes his companion frantically in an effort to bring him \n               to.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM BOARDINGHOUSE NIGHT\n\n               Bobby is curled up in a chair waiting for his mother to come \n               home. He's sleepy, but the excitement of what he has seen \n               precluded any such possibility.

The office is small and unpretentious, the business \n               habitat of a man who works in a big insurance agency. Tom's \n               secretary is on the phone, reflecting the world-wide terror \n               of the moment.\n\n                                     SECRETARY\n                              (into phone, nervous \n                              and jittery)\n                         --Honest, Mary, I'm so scared I can't \n                         sit still.

The cab waits as Helen jumps out and runs up \n               the steps to the front door.

As the convoy reaches each intersection, \n               the last vehicle peels off the column and, turns into the \n               side street.\n\n               MED.

It turns around in the side street and draws up \n               facing the intersection, its motor still running.

In a moment, \n               Helen rushes into scene, dropping down to hold Klaatu's head \n               in her arms. He looks up at her with a feeble smile.

SHOT - GORT - \n               NIGHT\n\n               In the eerie light of the huge building, the great robot \n               stands encased in a solid block of clear, transparent plastic. \n               As CAMERA MOVES IN slowly, we hear a low whirring sound, as \n               of power being generated. A faint glow, visible through the \n               plastic, emanates from Gort's body. His eyes, which seem to \n               express rage, shifts as though he were straining to break \n               out. As the whirring sound and the glow of Gort's body \n               increase in intensity, the sharp edges at the top of the ice-\n               like block melt into roundness and the plastic starts to \n               drip away. (About 150 folding chairs are arranged on the \n               floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight.)\n\n               EXT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS\n\n               The whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside. The two \n               soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen \n               apprehensively. The two men exchange an uneasy glance. After \n               hesitating a moment, one of them decides to investigate. He \n               turns and goes inside the door.\n\n               INT. BUILDING - MED.

His head is free \n               now and he seems to be straining against the plastic, which \n               is dripping down the sides of the block.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER\n\n               He glances around nervously to see that his companion has \n               entered the building and is staring up at the robot, bug-\n               eyed. Slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first. \n               Wordlessly, they bring their rifles up to the ready and click \n               them off safety. In spite of their terror, they advance slowly \n               toward the robot.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n\n               The whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly. \n               And his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS\n\n               as they move toward Gort.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n\n               From inside him comes a new and terribly sharp crackling. \n               sound. And from his eyes two pencils of light dart out. After \n               a moment the crackling sound stops and the light goes off.\n\n               REVERSE SHOT\n\n               from same angle as scene before last. But the two soldiers \n               have utterly disappeared.\n\n               FULL SHOT\n\n               as Gort resumes breaking out of the plastic. There is no \n               sign of the two soldiers.\n\n               EXT. MALL - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN - NIGHT\n\n               Hurrying along a footpath, nervous and distraught, she pauses \n               for a moment, looking at the entrance of the building. Then \n               she starts determinedly across the grass toward the entrance.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               PANNING with Helen as she approaches the entrance fearfully. \n               Rallying all her courage and determination, she forces herself \n               to step inside.\n\n               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN\n\n               as she enters the huge, weirdly lighted building. She stops \n               short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of Gort. \n               Loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run -- but \n               she realizes she can't.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT -GORT\n\n               He has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her. His \n               upper body and arms are free now, and the plastic is rapidly \n               melting away.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN\n\n               She is held fascinated by the robot's staring eyes. For \n               another moment it looks as if she would, break and run. But \n               she summons all her courage, and moves slowly toward Gort, \n               whose legs are still held captive.\n\n               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT\n\n               as she moves slowly, fearfully toward him.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n\n               The plastic is dripping off his legs now. With great effort, \n               he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff. A huge \n               figure in the heavy shadows, he moves slowly and menacingly \n               toward Helen.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN\n\n               as she stops advancing, rooted to the spot in fear. Then she \n               starts backing away, keeping her eyes on him.\n\n               MED. SHOT - HELEN AND GORT\n\n               As the great, hulking figure approaches, Helen can't stand \n               her ground. She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of \n               the building. Gort follows her with unhurried, inescapable \n               strides. Unwittingly, Helen has run into a corner, and the \n               robot is closing in on her.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - HELEN\n\n               Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes she's trapped. \n               In a wild effort to run around him, she stumbles and falls \n               to the floor. Immobilized with fright, she lies breathless, \n               looking up at him. Then she gives a piercing scream.\n\n               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT\n\n               as the great robot bends over her menacingly, arms \n               outstretched as though to grab or smash her.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN\n\n               All hope gone, she is blessed with a moment of lucidity, and \n               she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Gort--!\n                              (with desperate clarity)\n                         Klaatu -- barada -- nikto.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - GORT\n\n               He pauses as he hears the words. His face doesn't change \n               expression, but the words obviously have an effect on him. \n               He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment.\n\n               TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT\n\n               Helen watches him in an agony of suspense. Then the robot \n               slowly bends down, picks her up in his arms and starts walking \n               toward the space ship.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               PANNING with Gort as he carries Helen, speechless with fright, \n               to the side of the ship. He touches the side, and the ramp \n               moves slightly out. He mounts the ramp, still carrying Helen, \n               and disappears into the ship with her. And the ramp closes \n               silently behind them.\n\n               INT. SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP\n\n               CAMERA FOLLOWS as Gort carries Helen through the dimly lighted \n               corridor into the main cabin, where he flips a switch that \n               lights up the cabin. The robot proceeds to a small door \n               leading off the main cabin and disappears with Helen inside \n               it.\n\n               INT. SMALL CABIN - FULL SHOT\n\n               This is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory, the walls \n               of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical \n               and electronic apparatus. Gort sets Helen down on a stool \n               and indicates for her to stay there. Too terrified to move, \n               Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus. He \n               starts flipping switches and turning dials. As a result, \n               lights begin to flash and there's a strange series of \n               mechanical noises.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN\n\n               Unable to guess the reason for these preparations, she is \n               gripped with a terrible fear.\n\n               FULL SHOT\n\n               Ignoring Helen completely, Gort finishes his work. Then he \n               moves to the door and goes out, closing the door behind him. \n               Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the \n               knob -- only to find, to her terror, that there is none. \n               Frenziedly she beats on the solid metal door.\n\n               EXT. SPACE SHIP - MED. SHOT\n\n               as the ramp comes down and Gort steps out. With grim, \n               determined strides he starts toward the entrance of the \n               building as the ramp silently closes.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT\n\n               The Colonel who was in charge of Klaatu's apprehension is \n               speaking into a phone at the desk of the Police Sergeant. \n               Standing by are three or four Army officers, among them a \n               Captain and a Lieutenant.\n\n                                     COLONEL\n                              (into phone)\n                         Yes, sir, we've got the body here \n                         now.

Yes -- I \n                         understand.\n\n               The General has apparently hung up and the Colonel does \n               likewise, turning to the officers in the room.\n\n                                     COLONEL\n                         General Cutler's coming down here \n                         right away.\n                              (to the Lieutenant)\n                         Take a squad of men, Lieutenant, and \n                         post a guard around that cell.\n                              (to Captain)\n                         Captain, don't let anyone in or out \n                         of the building.\n\n               The two officers mutter their \"yes, sirs\" and start off about \n               their business.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\n               A squad of armed soldiers, led by the lieutenant, is admitted \n               to the corridor by a Police guard and they start marching \n               down the corridor toward a cell at the far end.\n\n               INT. CELL - POLICE STATION\n\n               This is a cell on the ground floor. In the far wall is a \n               heavily barred window, beyond which is as alley. In f.g. are \n               Klaatu's feet, stretched out on a crude table. As CAMERA \n               HOLDS, the huge figure of Gort appears outside the barred \n               window, Seeing Klaatu, he reaches up and yanks out the steel \n               bars as though they were chicken wire. With a crushing blow \n               of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window \n               and steps inside the cell. He moves without interruption \n               toward the body of Klaatu.\n\n               INT. JAIL CORRIDOR\n\n               Hearing the sounds of clattering metal and mortar, the \n               soldiers race down the corridor toward the cell.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               shooting over the backs of the soldiers as they reach the \n               cell and look inside. There they see the giant robot picking \n               up the body of Klaatu and starting deliberately toward the \n               gaping hole in the side of the building. They raise their \n               weapons and fire at Gort, but the bullets have no effect on \n               him. Continuing uninterruptedly, he steps over the debris \n               and disappears, carrying Klaatu in his arms.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT.

LABORATORY CABIN IN SPACE SHIP\n\n               Alone in the cabin, Helen is still terrified. She looks up, \n               startled as the door opens and Gort enters, carrying Klaatu's \n               body over to a long counter. Once again he starts fiddling \n               with knobs, switches and dials. As Helen watches, speechless, \n               he starts to fasten strange-looking electrodes to Klaatu's \n               wrist and ankle.\n\n               EXT. POLICE PRECINCT STATION - NIGHT\n\n               shooting from the outside, near the front entrance to the \n               building, through a window into the main room where the Police \n               Sergeant's desk is. The Lieutenant who was ordered to guard \n               Klaatu's cell is excitedly reporting to the Colonel how Gort \n               broke in and took Klaatu's body. Considerably agitated, the \n               Colonel snaps orders to the other officers, glances at his \n               watch and motions for the Lieutenant to follow him. He and \n               the Lieutenant cross to the door and CAMERA PANS with them \n               as they come outside the building, hurry down the steps and \n               get into a staff car. Several other Army vehicles join the \n               staff car as it roars away from the curb.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. SPACE SHIP BUILDING - MED. SHOT - NIGHT\n\n               A good many of the 150 chairs are filled, and more guests \n               are still arriving. There is no one to greet them at the \n               door, so they wander in and seat themselves.\n\n               INT. LABORATORY IN SPACE SHIP\n\n               Gort is still working over the body of Klaatu. From a socket \n               in the wall he pulls a strange-looking hypodermic needle on \n               the end of a cord or tube and gives Klaatu a shot in the \n               arm.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - HELEN\n\n               as she watches, fascinated in spite of her terror.\n\n               FULL SHOT\n\n               Gort fiddles with the dials again and there are electrical \n               cracklings and sputterings. Suddenly he flips a switch and \n               all sound ceases. Gort removes the electrodes and watches \n               Klaatu. CAMERA MOVES IN on Klaatu and we see him start to \n               breathe. In a moment his eyelids flutter. Then his eyes open \n               and he looks around.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               as Klaatu slowly lifts himself to a sitting position. Helen \n               watches breathlessly as he glances around the room, as though \n               to orient himself. Then he lowers his feet to the floor and \n               stands up.

SPACE SHIP - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND HELEN\n\n               as Klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he \n               has changed into his \"other world\" tunic.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         Gort and I will be leaving soon.\n\n               Helen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and \n               the knowledge that he is to die. There is a compelling warmth \n               of feeling between these two.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                              (simply, sincerely)\n                         We'll miss you very much -- Bobby \n                         and I.\n                              (smiling to conceal \n                              her real feelings)\n                         He won't have anyone to play with.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         He'll have you -- and Tom.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                              (quietly -- definitely)\n                         No. That's all finished.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         I'm sorry.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                              (she is sensible and \n                              objective, but not \n                              unfeeling)\n                         I think I'm very lucky.

Then he \n               moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch. Suddenly \n               an entire section of the side wall is made transparent. \n               Through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the \n               building. Most of the chairs are already occupied, and \n               latecomers are still moving in through the door. Facing the \n               group, on a little dais, is Barnhardt. As Klaatu and Helen \n               watch, Barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak. His \n               voice comes in the ship through a speaker.\n\n                                     BARNHARDT\n                         Ladies and Gentlemen--\n\n               INT. BUILDING - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BARNHARDT\n\n               He addresses them gravely, with a note of terrible \n               disappointment in his voice.\n\n                                     BARNHARDT\n                         I called you from your work and from \n                         your homes all over the world because \n                         we were to meet here tonight with a \n                         man from another planet -- the man \n                         who came here in this ship.\n                              (there are audible \n                              exclamations of \n                              surprise and \n                              disappointment)\n                         As you all know, this is no longer \n                         possible. I can only say that I share \n                         the bitterness of your disappointment.\n\n               INTERCUT with the above are group and individual shots of \n               the people in the meeting. They are the cream of Earth's \n               intellectuals -- scientists, churchmen, educators, leaders \n               of social and political thought. There are several women \n               among them. There are turbaned Indians, Chinese, Japanese, \n               several Negroes. All religions are represented. Every \n               important world power is represented.\n\n               INT. MAIN CABIN - SPACE SHIP\n\n               Klaatu and Helen are watching and listening, as the last \n               sentence of Barnhardt's speech above comes over the speaker. \n               Klaatu flips off the switch, which cuts off the view of the \n               meeting and also Barnhardt's voice. At this moment Gort moves \n               across the cabin and Klaatu speaks to him.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                         Gort -- berengo.\n\n               Gort moves off obediently.\n\n               INT.

And, since their concern \n                         is for our safety, I can do nothing \n                         but suggest that we comply--\n\n               Barnhardt is interrupted by the sudden and unexpected \n               appearance of the ramp, silently opening out of the side of \n               the space ship.\n\n               MED. SHOT - BARNHARDT'S AUDIENCE\n\n               as they react in startled amazement to the mysterious \n               appearance of the ramp. Then, as they watch, there is a sudden \n               gasp of terror.\n\n               MED. SHOT - AT SHIP\n\n               as Gort appears on the ramp and walks slowly down to the \n               ground. In a moment, Klaatu and Helen appear at the entrance \n               of the ship. Helen comes down the ramp to join Barnhardt, \n               while Klaatu remains at the head of the ramp.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT COLONEL AND SOLDIERS\n\n               The Colonel stands near the door, flanked by a group of \n               soldiers, their rifles at the ready. The Colonel is startled \n               by what he sees. His eyes are on the revered figure of Klaatu \n               and he's debating what he should do.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU\n\n               He is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld \n               tunic. He stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers, \n               as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality. \n               He turns to look out at the audience, which is held \n               spellbound. Then, after a breathless moment, he speaks.\n\n                                     KLAATU\n                              (straightforwardly, \n                              with almost stern \n                              authority)\n                         I am leaving soon and you will forgive \n                         me if I speak bluntly.\n                              (he pauses, studying \n                              the faces)\n                         The Universe grows smaller every day -- \n                         and the threat of aggression by any \n                         group -- anywhere -- can no longer \n                         be tolerated.\n\n               MED.

The entire layout -- delegates, space ship \n               and all -- remain exactly as they were except that instead \n               of being under a roof they are out in the open Mall under a \n               starry sky.
