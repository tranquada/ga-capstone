Soon after, \n                         Austin Powers volunteered to have \n                         himself frozen, in the event Dr. \n                         Evil should ever return.

That is, unless the world pays us a \n               hefty ransom.\n\n               There is another uncomfortable silence.\n\n                                     NUMBER TWO\n                         Umm, that also has already happened.\n\n                                     DR.

I never knew him growing up.  \n                         He comes back and now he wants me to \n                         take over the family business.\n\n                                     THERAPIST\n                         And how do you feel about that?\n\n                                     SCOTT EVIL\n                         I don't wanna take over the family \n                         business.\n\n                                     DR.

Please, \n                         tell us about your childhood.\n\n                                     GROUP\n                         Yes, of course.  Go ahead, etc.\n\n                                     DR. EVIL\n                         Very well, where should I begin?  My \n                         father was a relentlessly self-\n                         improving boulangerie owner from \n                         Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy \n                         and a penchant for buggery.  My mother \n                         was a fifteen-year-old French \n                         prostitute named Chloe with webbed \n                         feet.  My father would womanize, he \n                         would drink, he would make outrageous \n                         claims, like he invented the question \n                         mark.  Sometimes he would accuse \n                         chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of \n                         general malaise that only the genius \n                         possess and the insane lament.  My \n                         childhood was typical.\n\n               Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make \n               meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap \n               bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the \n               age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the\n\n               age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically \n               shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn \n               scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical \n               school.  From there...\n\n               ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP.

Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the \n               floss.  He keeps pulling out floss.\n\n               More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.
