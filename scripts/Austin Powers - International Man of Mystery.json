My \n                         father was a relentlessly self-\n                         improving boulangerie owner from \n                         Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy \n                         and a penchant for buggery.  My mother \n                         was a fifteen-year-old French \n                         prostitute named Chloe with webbed \n                         feet.  My father would womanize, he \n                         would drink, he would make outrageous \n                         claims, like he invented the question \n                         mark.  Sometimes he would accuse \n                         chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of \n                         general malaise that only the genius \n                         possess and the insane lament.  My \n                         childhood was typical.\n\n               Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make \n               meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap \n               bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the \n               age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the\n\n               age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically \n               shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn \n               scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical \n               school.  From there...\n\n               ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP.
