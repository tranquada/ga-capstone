He then takes her hand, and places\r\n      something inside of it.\r\n\r\n      Tatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a\r\n      small bag of fruit snacks. She looks up at Oscar with a\r\n      bright eyed expression. But Oscar quickly places his finger\r\n      over his lips.\r\n\r\n      Tatiana nods in agreement, trying to hold back a huge smile.\r\n      She gives him a swift kiss on the cheek.

He comes to a red light.\r\n\r\n       He looks at the car radio clock: 8:58 AM.\r\n\r\n       He thinks to himself for a beat, he looks dissatisfied. He\r\n       turns his music up for a beat and listens to it. He looks\r\n       around, still not at ease. He turns off his music and pulls\r\n       out his cellphone. He takes a quick look around to see what\r\n       cars are around, before dialing numbers. CALLING MOM flashes\r\n       on the screen.

He passes by an OLDER\r\n       COUPLE, white 40's. This is MR. and MRS. ZAFIRATOS. They\r\n       stand next to their SON (9)and DAUGHTER (14).\r\n\r\n       As Oscar pushes past him, Mr. Zafiratos gives Oscar an\r\n       unwelcome look. He pulls his daughter away as to avoid Oscar\r\n       bumping up against her. Oscar exchanges a look with him\r\n       briefly, and continues to push towards the space.\r\n\r\n                           BART ANNOUNCEMENT VOICE\r\n                 Now approaching Lake Merritt\r\n                 Station.\r\n\r\n       The Train comes to a stop, and commuters crush onto the car.\r\n\r\n       We see Katie, from Farmer Joe's, standing a few people in\r\n       front of Oscar wearing a jacket over the same outfit. She's\r\n       hugged up with JOE, a handsome white man in his 20's wearing\r\n       a CAL sweatshirt.

Katie opens her eyes, and sees that the passenger is\r\n       Oscar.
