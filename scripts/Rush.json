His\r\n    name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.\r\n\r\n                         NIKI (V/O)\r\n               My grandfather always said history is\r\n               cruel and reductive and no matter how\r\n               long we live, or how much we achieve -\r\n               we are remembered for very little. So\r\n               make sure it's the right things.\r\n\r\n    NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.\r\n    Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...\r\n\r\n    Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be\r\n    using slicks or wets?\r\n\r\n\r\n5   EXT.

An\r\n    OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, \"One\r\n    Minute\"...\r\n\r\n    Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.\r\n\r\n                           NIKI\r\n                 This is bullshit. We have no control\r\n                 over our legacy. We cannot choose what\r\n                 we are remembered for...\r\n\r\n    A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian\r\n    above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...\r\n\r\n                           MECHANIC\r\n                 Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare\r\n                 anche tu?\r\n                     (Mass is going on slicks. You\r\n                      want to change?)\r\n\r\n    NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white\r\n    helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of\r\n    MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.\r\n\r\n                           NIKI\r\n                 Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for\r\n                 my rivalry with this asshole. And the\r\n                 1976 season.\r\n\r\n    NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.\r\n    Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...\r\n\r\n                           NIKI\r\n                 What about Hunt? Has he changed?\r\n\r\n                           MECHANIC\r\n                 No, he's going on wets.\r\n\r\n    The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,\r\n    mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..\r\n\r\n    The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but\r\n    HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.\r\n\r\n    NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's\r\n    glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,\r\n    flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..\r\n\r\n                           NIKI\r\n                 I don't know why it became such a big\r\n                 thing. We were just drivers. Busting\r\n                 each other's balls. To me this is\r\n                 perfectly normal. But other people saw\r\n                 it differently.\r\n                           (MORE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                         3\r\n5   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   5\r\n\r\n                         NIKI (cont\u00edd)\r\n               That whatever it was between us went\r\n               deeper. And changed us both somehow.\r\n               Forever.\r\n\r\n    NIKI stares, then...\r\n\r\n                         NIKI\r\n               Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da\r\n               bagnato.\r\n                   (Then we go on wets, too.)\r\n\r\n    The ten-second board is held up.\r\n\r\n    NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a\r\n    split-second, eyes staring...\r\n\r\n    NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the\r\n    engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000\r\n    RPM.\r\n\r\n                         NIKI\r\n               Maybe that explains the state of mind\r\n               I was in. And why it happened. The\r\n               other thing I'm remembered for.\r\n                   (a beat)\r\n               On August 1st, that same year...\r\n\r\n    CAPTION: \"AUGUST 1st, 1976\".\r\n\r\n    The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI's foot hits the floor - his\r\n    engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch\r\n    scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.\r\n\r\n    NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin\r\n    leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..\r\n\r\n    NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's\r\n    a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.\r\n\r\n    His arch-rival. HUNT.\r\n\r\n    But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.\r\n    Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.\r\n\r\n    NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong\r\n    decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to\r\n    change tyres...\r\n\r\n    NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari's pit is right at\r\n    one end...\r\n                                                                          4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6   INT. PITS - DAY                                                   6\r\n\r\n    Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the\r\n    crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the\r\n    pits to change to dry tyres.\r\n\r\n    It's chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...\r\n\r\n    The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI's tyres. Four\r\n    men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same\r\n    Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..\r\n\r\n                         MECHANIC\r\n               Hair visto?

Into 13th place\r\n    now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.\r\n\r\n    NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering\r\n    wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven\r\n    any harder.\r\n\r\n    NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of\r\n    the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed.\r\n    And tight. Too tight. A mistake...\r\n\r\n    \"Thump\", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the\r\n    inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155\r\n    mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..\r\n\r\n    \"Crunch\", hits the embankment, then \"Bang\", hits the barrier,\r\n    and is thrown across the track..\r\n\r\n    Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI's eyes widen in horror,\r\n    with another car bearing down upon him...\r\n\r\n                          NIKI\r\n                 No...!\r\n\r\n    The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, \"Crash\", a\r\n    sickening, terrifying impact.\r\n\r\n    The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane\r\n    gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his\r\n    seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace.\r\n\r\n    NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees\r\n    temperature. Trapped inside his car.\r\n\r\n    Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...\r\n\r\n    Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV\r\n    commentators helplessly describe what's happening..\r\n\r\n    NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable\r\n    figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..\r\n\r\n    Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully\r\n    to undo NIKI's seatbelt..\r\n\r\n    Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers.\r\n    Covering NIKI's helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out\r\n    in agony, inhaling the powder..\r\n\r\n    Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. On the side of the car,\r\n    the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                          6\r\n8   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   8\r\n\r\n\r\n    Then sound fades.

Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor\r\n     student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer\r\n     cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two\r\n     budgerigars.\r\n\r\n     A mattress on the floor.\r\n\r\n     Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's\r\n     crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the\r\n     government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition,\r\n     leaving behind its strong, imperial past.\r\n\r\n     JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half-\r\n     dressed, but already passionately making love...\r\n\r\n                            JAMES (V/O)\r\n                  I have a theory why women like racing\r\n                  drivers.

It's a\r\n                  wonderful way to live...and the ONLY\r\n                  way to drive. The only way to get that\r\n                  tenth of a second on everyone else...\r\n\r\n     The lovemaking becomes more intense...\r\n\r\n                            JAMES (V/O)\r\n                  To dare to be one step bolder...one\r\n                  step faster...\r\n\r\n     JAMES is covered in perspiration, out on the edge...\r\n\r\n                            JAMES (V/O)\r\n                  Sure one step closer to death...\r\n\r\n     JAMES and the NURSE, both screaming as they approach orgasm...\r\n\r\n                            JAMES (V/O)\r\n                  But one step closer to victory, too...\r\n\r\n     JAMES and the NURSE both climax together...and collapse on the\r\n     bed.

My brothers are the\r\n                success stories. I get bored easily. I\r\n                have a hot head, an inability to\r\n                tolerate discipline. I fall out with\r\n                people left and right. I'm quick to\r\n                settle matters with my fists. The only\r\n                creatures I've ever loved and treated\r\n                well, are budgerigars. In any normal\r\n                area of life, I'd be...or AM...a total\r\n                liability. All I've got going for me\r\n                is I'm quick in a car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                          20\r\n28   CONTINUED:                                                     28\r\n\r\n\r\n     A good-looking woman calls out..\r\n\r\n                            WOMAN\r\n                  That's not all!\r\n\r\n     Laughter.\r\n\r\n                            JAMES\r\n                  So thank you for acknowledging that.\r\n                  And giving me this...\r\n                      (indicating trophy)\r\n                  I'm going to give it to my Dad, and\r\n                  tell him to put it on the mantle-piece\r\n                  and imagine it's a first class degree\r\n                  in medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n29   INT.

A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the\r\n   tyres to bald, dry tyres - ('slicks').

The\r\n   car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black\r\n   scars on the asphalt..\r\n\r\n   JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck,\r\n   but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them,\r\n   gaining fast.\r\n\r\n   JAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white\r\n   helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres.\r\n\r\n   MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out.

They didn't just survive, MASAHIRO HASEMI\r\n   got the fastest lap of the race, and NORITAKE TAKAHARA came\r\n   9th...\r\n\r\n   And at that moment, magically, the sun breaks through, and the\r\n   snowy peak of Mount Fuji is finally revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n203 A QUICKFIRE MONTAGE                                            203\r\n\r\n   Of newspaper headlines, television talk shows, lucrative\r\n   endorsements, TV commercials, sponsorship, public billboards.\r\n\r\n   JAMES's world championship victory has made him a rich man.\r\n   His movie star looks make him an international STAR and\r\n   marketing man's dream.\r\n\r\n   Girls, more girls, and even more girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                         102\r\n203 CONTINUED:                                                     203\r\n\r\n\r\n   JAMES, dashing in a white suit, plays trumpet on the UK's most\r\n   famous talk show...\r\n\r\n                                                        FADE TO BLACK:\r\n\r\n\r\n204 EXT. RUNWAY - DAY                                               204\r\n\r\n   We're on the runway of an airport in Northern Italy.\r\n\r\n   CAPTION: \"THREE MONTHS LATER\"\r\n\r\n   A stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac.\r\n\r\n   A still-drunk JAMES HUNT and several good-looking WOMEN, rowdy\r\n   FRIENDS (and hangers-on) spill out of the limo...\r\n\r\n   They cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet,\r\n   passing other jets, when JAMES stops.\r\n\r\n   He's seen something that has caught his eye.\r\n\r\n   JAMES sends his FRIENDS on ahead to their waiting jet, and\r\n   walks over to a small private jet, (a Learjet 35)...\r\n\r\n                           JAMES\r\n                 I heard you were spending more and\r\n                 more time in one of these...\r\n\r\n   A hunched PILOT doing final checks. The figure turns. It's\r\n   NIKI. His wounds have healed a little, but it's still a\r\n   painful sight...\r\n\r\n                           NIKI\r\n                 Do you fly?\r\n\r\n                           JAMES\r\n                 No.\r\n\r\n                           NIKI\r\n                 You should try it. If something goes\r\n                 wrong up there, you're on the edge,\r\n                 but have to stay within the rules.\r\n                 Stick to regulations. Suppress the\r\n                 ego. It's good discipline for the\r\n                 racing.\r\n\r\n                           JAMES\r\n                 And there I was thinking you were\r\n                 about to wax lyrical about the romance\r\n                 of flight. I should have known better.\r\n\r\n                           NIKI\r\n                 What brings you here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                        103\r\n204 CONTINUED:                                                    204\r\n\r\n\r\n   JAMES indicates his rowdy, cool-looking friends..\r\n\r\n                           JAMES\r\n                 A friend's wedding. At least I think\r\n                 it was a wedding. Might have been a\r\n                 birthday. All a bit of a blur. How\r\n                 about you? Been at Fiorano?\r\n\r\n                           NIKI\r\n                 Pre-season testing.\r\n\r\n                           JAMES\r\n                 Already? In February? You're\r\n                 relentless.\r\n\r\n                              NIKI\r\n                 Thank you.\r\n\r\n                           JAMES\r\n                 I'm not sure I meant it as a\r\n                 compliment.\r\n\r\n                           NIKI\r\n                 But it is one. Relentlessness is good.\r\n                 Means you're a fighter. That you never\r\n                 give up. Behind my back I know some of\r\n                 you guys call me `The Rat.' Because I\r\n                 look like one. It's meant as an\r\n                 insult. But I don't mind it. Rats are\r\n                 ugly, sure. And no one likes them. But\r\n                 they're intelligent. With a strong\r\n                 survival instinct.\r\n\r\n   JAMES can't help smiling.

I didn't just win the\r\n                 biggest thing of my life so I could\r\n                 get right back to work.\r\n\r\n                           NIKI\r\n                 Why? You need to.

Because of your\r\n                 accident? Is that other people, Niki?\r\n                 Or you? I won. On the all important\r\n                 day when it came down to it, we raced\r\n                 on equal terms in equally good cars.\r\n                           (MORE)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                        104\r\n204 CONTINUED: (2)                                                204\r\n\r\n                         JAMES (cont\u00edd)\r\n               You bottled and I had the guts to see\r\n               it through.\r\n\r\n                         NIKI\r\n               It's true. You won that race. And\r\n               believe me if I had to lose that title\r\n               to anyone, I'm happy it was you. But\r\n               that doesn't change the fact you have\r\n               to win again.\r\n\r\n                         JAMES\r\n               Why?\r\n\r\n                         NIKI\r\n               Because that's what it means to be a\r\n               winner, no? It's a permanent\r\n               condition. Never stops or goes away.\r\n               It stays with you always.\r\n\r\n                         JAMES\r\n               That's winning? Sounds like losing to\r\n               me. Some of life needs to be for\r\n               pleasure, Niki. What's the use of\r\n               having a million cups and medals if\r\n               you never have any fun? How is that\r\n               winning?\r\n\r\n   The plane load of JAMES's friends call out...\"C'mon, James!\"\r\n\r\n                         NIKI\r\n               You're right. I could learn from you.\r\n               In hospital the toughest part of my\r\n               treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the\r\n               shit out of my lungs. It was agony.\r\n               While doing it, I was watching\r\n               television...you winning all those\r\n               races...and I was cursing you.. \"That\r\n               bastard, Hunt\", I would shout, \"I hate\r\n               that guy.\" one day the doctor said,\r\n               \"Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of\r\n               advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse\r\n               to have been given an enemy in life.\r\n               It can be a blessing, too.\" I said,\r\n               \"Who are you, Confucius?\" He said, \"A\r\n               wise man gets more from his enemies\r\n               than a fool from his friends.\" And you\r\n               know, he's right. Look at us. We were\r\n               a pair of kids when we first met.\r\n               Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed\r\n               nowhere.
