You won that race. And\r\n               believe me if I had to lose that title\r\n               to anyone, I'm happy it was you. But\r\n               that doesn't change the fact you have\r\n               to win again.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JAMES\r\n</b>               Why?\r\n\r\n<b>                         NIKI\r\n</b>               Because that's what it means to be a\r\n               winner, no? It's a permanent\r\n               condition. Never stops or goes away.\r\n               It stays with you always.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JAMES\r\n</b>               That's winning? Sounds like losing to\r\n               me. Some of life needs to be for\r\n               pleasure, Niki. What's the use of\r\n               having a million cups and medals if\r\n               you never have any fun? How is that\r\n               winning?\r\n\r\n   The plane load of JAMES's friends call out...\"C'mon, James!\"\r\n\r\n<b>                         NIKI\r\n</b>               You're right. I could learn from you.\r\n               In hospital the toughest part of my\r\n               treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the\r\n               shit out of my lungs. It was agony.\r\n               While doing it, I was watching\r\n               television...you winning all those\r\n               races...and I was cursing you.. \"That\r\n               bastard, Hunt\", I would shout, \"I hate\r\n               that guy.\" one day the doctor said,\r\n               \"Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of\r\n               advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse\r\n               to have been given an enemy in life.\r\n               It can be a blessing, too.\" I said,\r\n               \"Who are you, Confucius?\" He said, \"A\r\n               wise man gets more from his enemies\r\n               than a fool from his friends.\" And you\r\n               know, he's right. Look at us. We were\r\n               a pair of kids when we first met.\r\n               Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed\r\n               nowhere. Now we're both Champions of\r\n               the world.

And so should you. You\r\n               think you can?\r\n\r\n   NIKI stares.

Champ.\r\n\r\n   JAMES goes. NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his\r\n   laughing, cool FRIENDS. An unmistakable flicker of envy in his\r\n   eyes.\r\n\r\n   Then NIKI turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>205 EXT.
