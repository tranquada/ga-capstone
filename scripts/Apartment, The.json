I know facts\n            like this because I work for an\n            insurance company --\n\n<b>THE INSURANCE BUILDING - A WET, FALL DAY\n</b>\nIt's a big mother, covering a square block in lower\nManhattan, all glass and aluminum, jutting into the leaden\nsky.\n\n<b>                         BUD (V.O.)\n</b>            -- Consolidated Life of New York.\n            We are one of the top five companies\n            in the country -- last year we\n            wrote nine-point-three billion\n            dollars worth of policies.  Our\n            home office has 31,259 employees --\n            which is more than the entire\n            population of Natchez, Mississippi,\n            of Gallup, New Mexico.\n\n<b>INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR\n</b>\nAcres of gray steel desk, gray steel filing cabinets, and\nsteel-gray faces under indirect light.  One wall is lined\nwith glass-enclosed cubicles for the supervisory personnel.\nIt is all very neat, antiseptic, impersonal.  The only human\ntough is supplied by a bank of IBM machines, clacking away\ncheerfully in the background.\n\n<b>                         BUD (V.O.)\n</b>            I work on the nineteenth floor --\n            Ordinary Policy Department -\n            Premium Accounting Division -\n            Section W -- desk number 861.\n<b>DESK 861\n</b>\nLike every other desk, it has a small name plate attached to\nthe side.  This one reads C.C. BAXTER.\n\n<b>                         BUD (V.O.)\n</b>            My name is C.C. Baxter - C. for\n            Calvin, C. for Clifford -- however,\n            most people call me Bud. I've been\n            with Consolidated Life for three\n            years and ten months.  I started in\n            the branch office in Cincinnati,\n            then transferred to New York.  My\n            take-home pay is $94.70 a week, and\n            there are the usual fringe benefits.\n\nBAXTER is about thirty, serious, hard-working, unobtrusive.\nHe wears a Brooks Brothers type suit, which he bought\nsomewhere on Seventh Avenue, upstairs.  There is a stack of\nperforated premium cards in front of him, and he is totaling\nthem on the computing machine.  He looks off.\n\n<b>ELECTRIC WALL CLOCK\n</b>\nIt shows 5:19.  With a click, the minute hand jumps to 5:20,\nand a piercing bell goes off.\n\n<b>                         BUD (V.O.)\n</b>            The hours in our department are\n            8:50 to 5:20 --\n\n<b>FULL SHOT - OFFICE\n</b>\nInstantly all work stops.  Papers are being put away,\ntypewriters and computing machines are covered, and everybody\nstarts clearing out.  Within ten seconds, the place is\nempty -- except for Bud Baxter, still bent over his work,\nmarooned in a sea of abandoned desks.\n\n<b>                         BUD (V.O.)\n</b>            -- they're staggered by floors, so\n            that sixteen elevators can handle\n            the 31,259 employees without a\n            serious traffic jam.  As for\n            myself, I very often stay on at the\n            office and work for an extra hour\n            or two -- especially when the\n            weather is bad.  It's not that I'm\n            overly ambitious -- it's just a way\n            of killing time, until it's all\n            right for me to go home.\n            You see, I have this little problem\n            with my apartment --\n\n<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>STREET IN THE WEST SIXTIES - EVENING\n</b>\nBud, wearing a weather-beaten Ivy League raincoat and a\nnarrow-brimmed brown hat, comes walking slowly down the\nstreet skirting the puddles on the sidewalk.  He stops in\nfront of a converted brownstone, looks up.\n\n<b>                         BUD (V.O.)\n</b>            I live in the West Sixties - just\n            half a block from Central Park.  My\n            rent is $84 a month.  It used to be\n            eighty until last July when Mrs.\n            Lieberman, the landlady, put in a\n            second-hand air conditioning unit.\n\nThe windows on the second floor are lit, but the shades are\ndrawn.  From inside drifts the sound of cha cha music.\n\n<b>                         BUD (V.O.)\n</b>            It's a real nice apartment -\n            nothing fancy -- but kind of\n            cozy -- just right for a bachelor.\n            The only problem is - I can't\n            always get in when I want to.\n\n<b>INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING\n</b>\nWhat used to be the upstairs parlor of a one-family house in\nthe early 1900's has been chopped up into living room,\nbedroom, bathroom and kitchen.  The wallpaper is faded, the\ncarpets are threadbare, and the upholstered furniture could\nstand shampooing.  There are lots of books, a record player,\nstacks of records, a television set (21 inches and 24\npayments), unframed prints from the Museum of Modern Art\n(Picasso, Braque, Klee) tacked up on the walls.\n\nOnly one lamp is lit, for mood, and a cha cha record is\nspinning around on the phonograph.  On the coffee table in\nfront of the couch are a couple of cocktail glasses, a\npitcher with some martini dregs, an almost empty bottle of\nvodka, a soup bowl with a few melting ice cubes at the\nbottom, some potato chips, an ashtray filled with cigar\nstubs and lipstick-stained cigarette butts, and a woman's\nhandbag.\n\nMR. KIRKEBY, a dapper, middle-aged man, stands in front of\nthe mirror above the fake fireplace, buttoning up his vest.\nHe does not notice that the buttons are out of alignment.\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>                   (calling off)\n            Come on, Sylvia.  It's getting late.\n\nSYLVIA, a first baseman of a dame, redheaded and saftig,\ncomes cha cha-ing into the room, trying to fasten a necklace\nas she hums along with the music.  She dances amorously up\nto Kirkeby.\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>            Cut it out, Sylvia.  We got to get\n            out of here.\n\nHe helps her with the necklace, then turns off the phonograph.\n\n<b>                         SYLVIA\n</b>            What's the panic?  I'm going to\n            have another martooni.\n\nShe crosses to the coffee table, starts to pour the remnants\nof the vodka into the pitcher.\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>            Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to\n            nine!\n\n<b>                         SYLVIA\n</b>                   (dropping slivers of\n                   ice into the pitcher)\n            First you can't wait to get me up\n            here, and now -- rush, rush, rush!\n            Makes a person feel cheap.\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>            Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not\n            that -- but I promised the guy I'd\n            be out of here by eight o'clock,\n            positively.\n\n<b>                         SYLVIA\n</b>                   (pouring martini)\n            What guy?  Whose apartment is this,\n            anyway?\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>                   (exasperated)\n            What's the difference?  Some\n            schnook that works in the office.\n\n<b>EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - EVENING\n</b>\nBud is pacing back and forth, throwing an occasional glance\nat the lit windows of his apartment.  A middle-aged woman\nwith a dog on a leash approaches along the sidewalk.\n\nShe is MRS. LIEBERMAN, the dog is a Scottie, and they are\nboth wearing raincoats.  Seeing them, Bud leans casually\nagainst the stoop.\n\n<b>                         MRS. LIEBERMAN\n</b>            Good evening, Mr. Baxter.\n\n<b>                         BUD\n</b>            Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.\n\n<b>                         MRS.

LIEBERMAN\n</b>            Good night, Mr. Baxter.\n\nShe and the Scottie disappear into the house.  Bud resumes\npacing, his eyes on the apartment windows.  Suddenly he\nstops -- the lights have gone out.\n\n<b>INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING\n</b>\nKirkeby, in coat and hat, stands in the open doorway of the\ndarkened apartment.\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>            Come on -- come on, Sylvia!\n\nSylvia comes cha cha-ing out, wearing an imitation Persian\nlamb coat, her hat askew on her head, bag, gloves, and an\numbrella in her hand.\n\n<b>                         SYLVIA\n</b>            Some setup you got here.

Kirkeby looks down, sees\nthat the buttons are out of line.  He starts to rebutton\nthem as they move down the narrow, dimly-lit stairs.\n\n<b>                         SYLVIA\n</b>            You got to watch those things.\n            Wives are getting smarter all the\n            time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the\n            Claims Department -- came home one\n            night with lipstick on his shirt --\n            told his wife he had a shrimp\n            cocktail for lunch -- so she took\n            it out to the lab and had it\n            analyzed -- so now she has the\n            house in Great Neck and the children\n            and the new Jaguar --\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>            Don't you ever stop talking?\n\n<b>EXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - EVENING\n</b>\nBud, standing on the sidewalk, sees the front door start to\nopen.  He moves quickly into the areaway, almost bumping\ninto the ashcans, stands in the shadow of the stoop with his\nback turned discreetly toward Kirkeby and Sylvia as they\ncome down the steps.\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>            Where do you live?\n\n<b>                         SYLVIA\n</b>            I told you -- with my mother.\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>            Where does she live?\n\n<b>                         SYLVIA\n</b>            A hundred and seventy-ninth\n            street -- the Bronx.\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>            All right -- I'll take you to the\n            subway.\n\n<b>                         SYLVIA\n</b>            Like hell you will.

I'm a happily\n            married man.\n\nThey move down the street.  Bud appears from the areaway,\nglances after them, then mounts the steps, goes through the\nfront door.\n\n<b>INT. VESTIBULE - EVENING\n</b>\nThere are eight mailboxes.  Bud opens his, takes out a\nmagazine in a paper wrapper and a few letters, proceeds up\nthe staircase.\n\n<b>INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING\n</b>\nBud, glancing through his mail, comes up to the door of his\napartment.  As he bends down to lift the doormat, the door\nof the rear apartment opens and MRS. DREYFUSS, a jovial\nwell-fed middle-aged woman, puts out a receptacle full of\nold papers and empty cans.  Bud looks around from his bent\nposition.\n\n<b>                         BUD\n</b>            Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.\n\n<b>                         MRS.

THE APARTMENT - EVENING\n</b>\nBud snaps on the lights, drops the mail and the key on a\nsmall table, looks around with distaste at the mess his\nvisitors have left behind.  He sniffs the stale air, crosses\nto the window, pulls up the shade, opens it wide.  Now he\ntakes off his hat and raincoat, gathers up the remains of\nthe cocktail party from the coffee table.  Loaded down with\nglasses, pitcher, empty vodka bottle, ice bowl and potato\nchips, he starts toward the kitchen.\n\nThe doorbell rings.  Bud stops, undecided what to do with\nthe stuff in his hands, then crosses to the hall door,\nbarely manages to get it open.  Mr. Kirkeby barges in past\nhim.\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>            The little lady forgot her galoshes.\n\nHe scours the room for the missing galoshes.\n\n<b>                         BUD\n</b>            Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to\n            complain -- but you were supposed\n            to be out of here by eight.\n\n<b>                         KIRKEBY\n</b>            I know, Buddy-boy, I know.

On the drainboard are\nan empty vermouth bottle, some ice-cube trays, a jar with\none olive in it, and a crumpled potato-chip bag.\n\nBud comes in, dumps his load on the drainboard, opens the\nold-fashioned refrigerator.  He takes out a frozen chicken\ndinner, turns the oven on, lights it with a match, rips the\nprotective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in.\n\nNow he starts to clean up the mess on the drainboard.  He\nrinses the cocktail glasses, is about to empty the martini\npitcher into the sink, thinks better of it.  He pours the\ncontents into a glass, plops the lone olive out of the jar,\nscoops up the last handful of potato chips, toasts an\nimaginary companion, and drinks up.  Then he pulls a\nwastebasket from under the sink.\n\nIt is brimful of liquor bottles, and Bud adds the empty\nvodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar.  Picking up\nthe heavy receptacle, he carries it through the living room\ntoward the hall door.\n\n<b>INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING\n</b>\nThe door of Bud's apartment opens, and Bud comes out with\nthe wastebasket full of empty bottles.  Just then, DR.

He is a tall, heavy-set man of fifty, with a bushy\nmustache, wearing a bulky overcoat and carrying an aged\nmedical bag.\n\n<b>                         DR.

THE APARTMENT - EVENING\n</b>\nBud, loosening his tie, goes into the kitchen, opens the\noven, turns off the gas.  He takes a coke out of the\nrefrigerator, uncaps it, gets a knife and fork from a\ndrawer, and using his handkerchief as a potholder, pulls the\nhot aluminum tray out of the oven.  He carries everything\nout into the living room.\n\nIn the living room, Bud sets his dinner down on the coffee\ntable, settles himself on the couch.  He rears up as\nsomething stabs him, reaches under his buttocks, pulls out a\nhairpin.  He drops it into an ashtray, tackles his dinner.\nWithout even looking, he reaches over to the end table and\npresses the remote TV station-selector.  He takes a sip from\nthe coke bottle, his eyes on the TV screen across the room.\n\nThe picture on the TV set jells quickly.  Against a\nbackground of crisscrossing searchlights, a pompous announcer\nis making his spiel.\n\n<b>                         ANNOUNCER\n</b>            -- from the world's greatest\n            library of film classics, we\n            proudly present --\n                   (fanfare)\n            Greta Garbo -- John Barrymore --\n            Joan Crawford -- Wallace Beery --\n            and Lionel Barrymore in --\n                   (fanfare)\n<b>            GRAND HOTEL!\n</b>\nThere is an extended fanfare.  Bud leans forward, chewing\nexcitedly on a chicken leg.\n\n<b>                         ANNOUNCER\n</b>            But first, a word from our sponsor.\n            If you smoke the modern way, don't\n            be fooled by phony filter claims --\n\nBud, still eating, automatically reaches for the station-\nselector, pushes the button.\n\nA new channel pops on.  It features a Western -- Cockamamie\nIndians are attacking a stagecoach.\n\nThat's not for Bud.  He switches to another station.  In a\nfrontier saloon, Gower Street cowboys are dismantling the\nfurniture and each other.\n\nBud wearily changes channels.  But he can't get away from\nWesterns -- on this station, the U.S. Cavalry is riding to\nthe rescue.  Will they get there in time?\n\nBud doesn't wait to find out.  He switches channels again,\nand is back where he started.\n\nOn the screen, once more, is the announcer standing in front\nof the crisscrossing searchlights.\n\n<b>                         ANNOUNCER\n</b>            And now, Grand Hotel -- starring\n            Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan\n            Crawford --\n                   (Bud is all eyes and\n                   ears again)\n            -- Wallace Beery, and Lionel\n            Barrymore.

Bud turns the set off in disgust.\n\nThe TV screen blacks out, except for a small pinpoint of\nlight in the center, which gradually fades away.\n\nIn the bathroom, Bud, in pajamas by now, is brushing his\nteeth.  From the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on\nstretchers.  Bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf,\nshakes out a sleeping pill, washes it down with a glass of\nwater.  He turns the light off, walks into the bedroom.\n\nIn the bedroom, the single bed is made, and the lamp on the\nnight table is on.  Bud plugs in the electric blanket, turns\nthe dial on.  Then he climbs into bed, props up the pillow\nbehind him.  From the night table, he picks up the magazine\nthat arrived in the mail, slides it out of the wrapper,\nopens it.  It's the new issue of PLAYBOY.  Bud leafs through\nit till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine.\nHe unfolds the overleaf, glances at it casually, refolds it,\nthen turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read.\n\nWhat he is so avidly interested in is the men's fashion\nsection.  There is a layout titled WHAT THE YOUNG EXECUTIVE\nWILL WEAR with a sub-head reading The Bowler is Back.\nIllustrating the article are several photographs of male\nmodels wearing various styles of bowlers.\n\nBud is definitely in the market for a bowler, but somehow\nhis mind starts wandering.  He turns back to the overleaf\nagain, unfolds it, studies it, then holds the magazine up\nvertically to get a different perspective on the subject.\nBy now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect, and he\nyawns.  He drops the magazine on the floor, kills the light,\nsettles down to sleep.  The room is dark except for the glow\nfrom the dial of the electric blanket.\n\nThree seconds.  Then the phone jangles shrilly in the living\nroom.  Bud stumbles groggily out of bed, and putting on his\nslippers, makes his way into the living room.  He switches\non the light, picks up the phone.\n\n<b>                         BUD\n</b>            Hello? -- Hello? -- yes, this is\n            Baxter.\n\n<b>INT.

The other girls immediately abandon\ntheir posts, and dash after her.\n\n<b>INT. NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY\n</b>\nIt's a swinging party, all right. Nobody is working. Several\ndesks have been cleared and pushed together, and on top of\nthis improvised stage four female employees and Mr. Dobisch,\nwith his pants-legs rolled up, are doing a Rockette kick\nroutine to the tune of JINGLE BELLS. Employees are ringed\naround the performers, some drinking out of paper cups,\nothers singing and clapping in rhythm.\n\nOne of the cubicles has been transformed into a bar, and it\nis jammed with people. Mr. Kirkeby and Mr. Vanderhof are\npouring -- each has a couple of bottles of liquor in his\nhands, and is emptying them into the open top of a water-\ncooler.\n\nBut the stuff is flowing out as fast as it flows in --\neverybody is in line with a paper cup waiting for a refill.\n\nBud comes shouldering his way out of the crowded cubicle,\nholding aloft two paper cups filled with booze. Since his\npromotion he has bought himself a new suit, dark flannel,\nand with it he wears a white shirt with a pinned round\ncollar, and a foulard tie. He also has quite a glow on.\nDetouring past necking couples, he heads in the direction of\nthe elevators.\n\nThe doors of Fran's elevator are just opening, and the\nswitchboard operators, led by Sylvia, come streaming out.\n\n<b>                         SYLVIA\n</b>                   (to a colleague)\n            -- so I said to him: Never again! --\n            either get yourself a bigger car or\n            a smaller girl --\n\nAs they head for the party, they pass Bud, who is approaching\nthe elevator with the two drinks.

CHEAP BAR - COLUMBUS AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - EVENING\n</b>\nIt is six o'clock, and the joint is crowded with customers\nhaving one for the road before joining their families for\nChristmas Eve. There are men with gaily wrapped packages,\nsmall trussed-up Christmas trees, a plucked turkey in a\nplastic bag. Written across the mirror behind the bar, in\nglittering white letters, is HAPPY HOLIDAYS. Everybody is in\nhigh spirits, laughing it up and toasting each other.\n\nEverybody except Bud Baxter. He is standing at the bar in\nhis chesterfield and bowler, slightly isolated, brooding\nover an almost empty martini glass. The bartender comes up,\nsets down a fresh martini with an olive on a toothpick,\ntakes his payment from a pile of bills and coins lying in\nfront of Bud. Bud fishes out the olive, adds it to half a\ndozen other impaled olives neatly arranged in fan shape on\nthe counter. He is obviously trying to complete the circle.\n\nA short, rotund man dressed as Santa Claus hurries in from\nthe street, and comes up to the bar beside Bud.\n\n<b>                         SANTA CLAUS\n</b>                   (to bartender)\n            Hey, Charlie -- give me a shot of\n            bourbon -- and step on it -- my\n            sleigh is double parked.\n\nHe laughs uproariously at his own joke, nudges Bud with his\nelbow. Bud stares at him coldly, turns back to his martini.\nThe laughter dies in Santa Claus' throat. He gets his short\nof bourbon, moves down the bar to find more convivial company.\n\nStanding near the end of the curved bar is a girl in her\nmiddle twenties wearing a ratty fur coat. Her name is MARGIE\nMacDOUGALL, she is drinking a Rum Collins through a straw,\nand she too is alone. From a distance, she is studying Bud\nwith interest. On the bar in front of her is a container of\nstraws in paper wrappers. She takes one of them out, tears\noff the end of the paper, blows through the straw -- sending\nthe wrapper floating toward Bud. The paper wrapper passes\nright in front of Bud's nose. He doesn't notice it.\n\nMargie, undaunted, lets go with another missile.\n\nThis time the wrapper lands on the brim of Bud's bowler. No\nreaction. Another wrapper comes floating in, hits Bud's\ncheek. He never takes his eye off his martini.\n\nMargie leaves her place, and carrying her handbag and her\nempty glass, comes up alongside Bud. Without a word, she\nreaches up and removes the wrapper from Bud's bowler.\n\n<b>                         MARGIE\n</b>            You buy me a drink, I'll buy you\n            some music.\n                   (sets the glass down)\n            Rum Collins.\n\nNot waiting for an answer, she heads for the juke box.

The music starts -- ADESTE FIDELIS. She rejoins\nBud at the bar just as the bartender is putting down their\ndrinks in front of them. Bud removes the new olive, adds it\nto the pattern on the counter in front of him. They both\ndrink, staring straight ahead. For quite a while, there is\ncomplete silence between them.\n\n<b>                         MARGIE\n</b>                   (out of nowhere)\n            You like Castro?\n                   (a blank look from Bud)\n            I mean -- how do you feel about\n            Castro?\n<b>                         BUD\n</b>            What is Castro?\n\n<b>                         MARGIE\n</b>            You know, that big-shot down in\n            Cuba with the crazy beard.\n\n<b>                         BUD\n</b>            What about him?\n\n<b>                         MARGIE\n</b>            Because as far as I'm concerned,\n            he's a no good fink.

Halfway\nthere, he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on.\nHe detours to the phonograph, switches it off, continues\ninto the bedroom.\n\nIn the bedroom, the overhead light is on, and Dr. Dreyfuss\nis working on the unconscious Fran. He has removed her coat,\nand is shining a flashlight into her eyes, examining her\npupils. Bud approaches the bed worriedly.\n\n<b>                         BUD\n</b>            She going to be all right, Doc?\n\n<b>                         DR.

You better\n            put some coffee on -- and pray.\n\nBud starts away as Dr. Dreyfuss takes Fran into the bathroom.\n\nBud loses no time getting into the kitchen. He fills an\naluminum kettle with water, strikes a match, lights the gas\nburner, puts the kettle on. Then he takes a jar of instant\ncoffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard, shakes\nan excessive portion of coffee into the mug, sticks a spoon\nin it. He watches the kettle for a moment, mops his brow\nwith a handkerchief, then starts back toward the bedroom.\n\nBud crosses the bedroom to the half-open door of the\nbathroom, looks in anxiously. From inside come the sounds of\na coughing spasm and running water. Bud turns away, undoes\nhis tie and collar, paces the bedroom floor. Something on\nthe night table attracts his attention -- resting against\nthe base of the lamp is a sealed envelope. Bud picks it\nup -- on it, in Fran's handwriting, is one word, JEFF. He\nturns the letter over in his hand, trying to decide what to\ndo with it.\n\nDr. Dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom, carrying a pale,\nstill unconscious Fran. Bud quickly conceals the suicide\nnote behind his back.\n\n<b>                         DR. DREYFUSS\n</b>            Bring my bag.\n\nHe lugs Fran into the living room. Bud stashes the letter in\nhis back pocket, picks up the medical bag, follows them.\n\nIn the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss lowers Fran into a chair.\nHer chin falls to her chest. Dreyfuss takes the bag from\nBud, fishes out a hypodermic syringe, draws 2 c.c.'s from a\nbottle of picrotoxin.\n\n<b>                         DR.

Fran stirs slightly, and\nfrom her parched lips comes a low moan. Dr. Dreyfuss grabs\nher by the hair, lifts her head up.\n\n<b>                         DR. DREYFUSS\n</b>            If you'd come home half an hour\n            later, you would have had quite a\n            Christmas present.\n\nWith his free hand, Dr. Dreyfuss slaps Fran viciously across\nthe face. Bud winces. Dreyfuss, still holding Fran by the\nhair, takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag. He\ncrushes one of the ampules in his hand, passes it under her\nnose. Fran tries to turn her head away. Dreyfuss slaps her\nagain, hard, crushes another ampule, repeats the process.\n\nBud is watching tensely. From the kitchen comes the whistle\nof the boiling kettle, but Bud pays no attention.\n\n<b>                         DR. DREYFUSS\n</b>            Get the coffee.\n\nBud hurries into the kitchen. He turns off the gas, pours\nthe boiling water into the mug with the instant coffee,\nstirs it. From off, come the sounds of more slapping and\nsome moaning. Bud carries the coffee out.\n\nIn the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss is working another ammonia\nampule under Fran's nose. Her eyes start fluttering. Dreyfuss\ntakes the coffee mug from Bud, forces it between Fran's\nlips, pours coffee into her mouth. Fran resists\ninstinctively, half the coffee dribbling over her chin and\ndress, but Dr. Dreyfuss keeps at it.\n\n<b>                         DR. DREYFUSS\n</b>            Let's get some air in here.

SHELDRAKE'S ANTEROOM - DAY\n</b>\nBud comes out of his office, carrying his bowler, strides\npast the secretaries and through the glass doors to the\nfoyer. An elevator is just unloading, and beside it a\nhandyman is cleaning out one of the cigarette receptacles.\nBud crosses to the elevator, and as he passes the handyman,\nhe jams his bowler on the man's head -- surrendering his\ncrown, so to speak. The elevator doors close. The handyman\nstraightens up, looks around in bewilderment.\n\n<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.

The art posters are off the walls, the\nbric-a-brac has been removed from the shelves, and Bud is\nstowing away the last of his books and records. He crosses\nto the fireplace, opens one of the drawers in the cabinet\nabove it, takes out a forty-five automatic. He holds the gun\nin the palm of his hand, studies it appraisingly.\n\nThe doorbell rings. Bud snaps out of his reverie, drops the\ngun into one of the cartons, goes to the door and opens it.\nStanding outside is Dr. Dreyfuss, with a plastic ice bucket\nin his hand.\n\n<b>                         DR.

There are two champagne glasses on\nthe table, and the usual noisemakers, but the chair opposite\nher is empty. Above the general hubbub, the Chinese pianist\ncan be heard playing. After a moment, Fran glances off.\n\nThreading his way through the merrymakers crowding the bar\nand overflowing from the booths is Sheldrake. He is in\ndinner clothes, topped by a paper hat.
