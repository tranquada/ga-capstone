I know facts\n            like this because I work for an\n            insurance company --\n\nTHE INSURANCE BUILDING - A WET, FALL DAY\n\nIt's a big mother, covering a square block in lower\nManhattan, all glass and aluminum, jutting into the leaden\nsky.\n\n                         BUD (V.O.)\n            -- Consolidated Life of New York.\n            We are one of the top five companies\n            in the country -- last year we\n            wrote nine-point-three billion\n            dollars worth of policies.  Our\n            home office has 31,259 employees --\n            which is more than the entire\n            population of Natchez, Mississippi,\n            of Gallup, New Mexico.\n\nINT. NINETEENTH FLOOR\n\nAcres of gray steel desk, gray steel filing cabinets, and\nsteel-gray faces under indirect light.  One wall is lined\nwith glass-enclosed cubicles for the supervisory personnel.\nIt is all very neat, antiseptic, impersonal.  The only human\ntough is supplied by a bank of IBM machines, clacking away\ncheerfully in the background.\n\n                         BUD (V.O.)\n            I work on the nineteenth floor --\n            Ordinary Policy Department -\n            Premium Accounting Division -\n            Section W -- desk number 861.\nDESK 861\n\nLike every other desk, it has a small name plate attached to\nthe side.  This one reads C.C. BAXTER.\n\n                         BUD (V.O.)\n            My name is C.C. Baxter - C. for\n            Calvin, C. for Clifford -- however,\n            most people call me Bud. I've been\n            with Consolidated Life for three\n            years and ten months.  I started in\n            the branch office in Cincinnati,\n            then transferred to New York.  My\n            take-home pay is $94.70 a week, and\n            there are the usual fringe benefits.\n\nBAXTER is about thirty, serious, hard-working, unobtrusive.\nHe wears a Brooks Brothers type suit, which he bought\nsomewhere on Seventh Avenue, upstairs.  There is a stack of\nperforated premium cards in front of him, and he is totaling\nthem on the computing machine.  He looks off.\n\nELECTRIC WALL CLOCK\n\nIt shows 5:19.  With a click, the minute hand jumps to 5:20,\nand a piercing bell goes off.\n\n                         BUD (V.O.)\n            The hours in our department are\n            8:50 to 5:20 --\n\nFULL SHOT - OFFICE\n\nInstantly all work stops.  Papers are being put away,\ntypewriters and computing machines are covered, and everybody\nstarts clearing out.  Within ten seconds, the place is\nempty -- except for Bud Baxter, still bent over his work,\nmarooned in a sea of abandoned desks.\n\n                         BUD (V.O.)\n            -- they're staggered by floors, so\n            that sixteen elevators can handle\n            the 31,259 employees without a\n            serious traffic jam.  As for\n            myself, I very often stay on at the\n            office and work for an extra hour\n            or two -- especially when the\n            weather is bad.  It's not that I'm\n            overly ambitious -- it's just a way\n            of killing time, until it's all\n            right for me to go home.\n            You see, I have this little problem\n            with my apartment --\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\nSTREET IN THE WEST SIXTIES - EVENING\n\nBud, wearing a weather-beaten Ivy League raincoat and a\nnarrow-brimmed brown hat, comes walking slowly down the\nstreet skirting the puddles on the sidewalk.  He stops in\nfront of a converted brownstone, looks up.\n\n                         BUD (V.O.)\n            I live in the West Sixties - just\n            half a block from Central Park.  My\n            rent is $84 a month.  It used to be\n            eighty until last July when Mrs.\n            Lieberman, the landlady, put in a\n            second-hand air conditioning unit.\n\nThe windows on the second floor are lit, but the shades are\ndrawn.  From inside drifts the sound of cha cha music.\n\n                         BUD (V.O.)\n            It's a real nice apartment -\n            nothing fancy -- but kind of\n            cozy -- just right for a bachelor.\n            The only problem is - I can't\n            always get in when I want to.\n\nINT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING\n\nWhat used to be the upstairs parlor of a one-family house in\nthe early 1900's has been chopped up into living room,\nbedroom, bathroom and kitchen.  The wallpaper is faded, the\ncarpets are threadbare, and the upholstered furniture could\nstand shampooing.  There are lots of books, a record player,\nstacks of records, a television set (21 inches and 24\npayments), unframed prints from the Museum of Modern Art\n(Picasso, Braque, Klee) tacked up on the walls.\n\nOnly one lamp is lit, for mood, and a cha cha record is\nspinning around on the phonograph.  On the coffee table in\nfront of the couch are a couple of cocktail glasses, a\npitcher with some martini dregs, an almost empty bottle of\nvodka, a soup bowl with a few melting ice cubes at the\nbottom, some potato chips, an ashtray filled with cigar\nstubs and lipstick-stained cigarette butts, and a woman's\nhandbag.\n\nMR. KIRKEBY, a dapper, middle-aged man, stands in front of\nthe mirror above the fake fireplace, buttoning up his vest.\nHe does not notice that the buttons are out of alignment.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n                   (calling off)\n            Come on, Sylvia.  It's getting late.\n\nSYLVIA, a first baseman of a dame, redheaded and saftig,\ncomes cha cha-ing into the room, trying to fasten a necklace\nas she hums along with the music.  She dances amorously up\nto Kirkeby.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Cut it out, Sylvia.  We got to get\n            out of here.\n\nHe helps her with the necklace, then turns off the phonograph.\n\n                         SYLVIA\n            What's the panic?  I'm going to\n            have another martooni.\n\nShe crosses to the coffee table, starts to pour the remnants\nof the vodka into the pitcher.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to\n            nine!\n\n                         SYLVIA\n                   (dropping slivers of\n                   ice into the pitcher)\n            First you can't wait to get me up\n            here, and now -- rush, rush, rush!\n            Makes a person feel cheap.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not\n            that -- but I promised the guy I'd\n            be out of here by eight o'clock,\n            positively.\n\n                         SYLVIA\n                   (pouring martini)\n            What guy?  Whose apartment is this,\n            anyway?\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n                   (exasperated)\n            What's the difference?  Some\n            schnook that works in the office.\n\nEXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - EVENING\n\nBud is pacing back and forth, throwing an occasional glance\nat the lit windows of his apartment.  A middle-aged woman\nwith a dog on a leash approaches along the sidewalk.\n\nShe is MRS. LIEBERMAN, the dog is a Scottie, and they are\nboth wearing raincoats.  Seeing them, Bud leans casually\nagainst the stoop.\n\n                         MRS. LIEBERMAN\n            Good evening, Mr. Baxter.\n\n                         BUD\n            Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.\n\n                         MRS. LIEBERMAN\n            Some weather we're having.  Must be\n            from all the meshugass at Cape\n            Canaveral.\n                   (she is half-way up\n                   the steps)\n            You locked out of your apartment?\n\n                         BUD\n            No, no.  Just waiting for a friend.\n            Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.\n\n                         MRS. LIEBERMAN\n            Good night, Mr. Baxter.\n\nShe and the Scottie disappear into the house.  Bud resumes\npacing, his eyes on the apartment windows.  Suddenly he\nstops -- the lights have gone out.\n\nINT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING\n\nKirkeby, in coat and hat, stands in the open doorway of the\ndarkened apartment.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Come on -- come on, Sylvia!\n\nSylvia comes cha cha-ing out, wearing an imitation Persian\nlamb coat, her hat askew on her head, bag, gloves, and an\numbrella in her hand.\n\n                         SYLVIA\n            Some setup you got here.  A real,\n            honest-to-goodness love nest.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Sssssh.\n\nHe locks the door, slips the key under the doormat.\n\n                         SYLVIA\n                   (still cha cha-ing)\n            You're one button off, Mr. Kirkeby.\n\nShe points to his exposed vest.  Kirkeby looks down, sees\nthat the buttons are out of line.  He starts to rebutton\nthem as they move down the narrow, dimly-lit stairs.\n\n                         SYLVIA\n            You got to watch those things.\n            Wives are getting smarter all the\n            time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the\n            Claims Department -- came home one\n            night with lipstick on his shirt --\n            told his wife he had a shrimp\n            cocktail for lunch -- so she took\n            it out to the lab and had it\n            analyzed -- so now she has the\n            house in Great Neck and the children\n            and the new Jaguar --\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Don't you ever stop talking?\n\nEXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - EVENING\n\nBud, standing on the sidewalk, sees the front door start to\nopen.  He moves quickly into the areaway, almost bumping\ninto the ashcans, stands in the shadow of the stoop with his\nback turned discreetly toward Kirkeby and Sylvia as they\ncome down the steps.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Where do you live?\n\n                         SYLVIA\n            I told you -- with my mother.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Where does she live?\n\n                         SYLVIA\n            A hundred and seventy-ninth\n            street -- the Bronx.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            All right -- I'll take you to the\n            subway.\n\n                         SYLVIA\n            Like hell you will.  You'll buy me\n            a cab.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Why do all you dames have to live\n            in the Bronx?\n\n                         SYLVIA\n            You mean you bring other girls up\n            here?\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Certainly not.  I'm a happily\n            married man.\n\nThey move down the street.  Bud appears from the areaway,\nglances after them, then mounts the steps, goes through the\nfront door.\n\nINT. VESTIBULE - EVENING\n\nThere are eight mailboxes.  Bud opens his, takes out a\nmagazine in a paper wrapper and a few letters, proceeds up\nthe staircase.\n\nINT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING\n\nBud, glancing through his mail, comes up to the door of his\napartment.  As he bends down to lift the doormat, the door\nof the rear apartment opens and MRS. DREYFUSS, a jovial\nwell-fed middle-aged woman, puts out a receptacle full of\nold papers and empty cans.  Bud looks around from his bent\nposition.\n\n                         BUD\n            Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.\n\n                         MRS. DREYFUSS\n            Something the matter?\n\n                         BUD\n            I seem to have dropped my key.\n                   (faking a little search)\n            Oh -- here it is.\n\nHe slides it out from under the mat, straightens up.\n\n                         MRS. DREYFUSS\n            Such a racket I heard in your\n            place -- maybe you had burglars.\n\n                         BUD\n            Oh, you don't have to worry about\n            that -- nothing in there that\n            anybody would want to steal...\n                   (unlocking door quickly)\n            Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.\n\nHe ducks into the apartment.\n\nINT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING\n\nBud snaps on the lights, drops the mail and the key on a\nsmall table, looks around with distaste at the mess his\nvisitors have left behind.  He sniffs the stale air, crosses\nto the window, pulls up the shade, opens it wide.  Now he\ntakes off his hat and raincoat, gathers up the remains of\nthe cocktail party from the coffee table.  Loaded down with\nglasses, pitcher, empty vodka bottle, ice bowl and potato\nchips, he starts toward the kitchen.\n\nThe doorbell rings.  Bud stops, undecided what to do with\nthe stuff in his hands, then crosses to the hall door,\nbarely manages to get it open.  Mr. Kirkeby barges in past\nhim.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            The little lady forgot her galoshes.\n\nHe scours the room for the missing galoshes.\n\n                         BUD\n            Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to\n            complain -- but you were supposed\n            to be out of here by eight.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But\n            those things don't always run on\n            schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.\n\n                         BUD\n            I don't mind in the summer -- but\n            on a rainy night -- and I haven't\n            had any dinner yet --\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in\n            a good word for you with Sheldrake,\n            in Personnel.\n\n                         BUD\n                   (perking up)\n            Mr. Sheldrake?\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            That's right.  We were discussing\n            our department -- manpower-wise --\n            and promotion-wise --\n                   (finds the galoshes\n                   behind a chair)\n            -- and I told him what a bright boy\n            you were.  They're always on the\n            lookout for young executives.\n                         BUD\n            Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n                   (starting toward door)\n            You're on your way up, Buddy-boy.\n            And you're practically out of liquor.\n\n                         BUD\n            I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the\n            Mortgage Loan Department -- last\n            night he had a little Halloween\n            party here --\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Well, lay in some vodka and some\n            vermouth -- and put my name on it.\n\n                         BUD\n            Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me\n            for the last two bottles --\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            I'll pay you on Friday.\n                   (in the open doorwaY)\n            And whatever happened to those\n            little cheese crackers you used to\n            have around?\n\nHe exits, shutting the door.\n\n                         BUD\n                   (making a mental note)\n            Cheese crackers.\n\nHe carries his load into the kitchen.\n\nThe kitchen is minute and cluttered.  On the drainboard are\nan empty vermouth bottle, some ice-cube trays, a jar with\none olive in it, and a crumpled potato-chip bag.\n\nBud comes in, dumps his load on the drainboard, opens the\nold-fashioned refrigerator.  He takes out a frozen chicken\ndinner, turns the oven on, lights it with a match, rips the\nprotective paper off the aluminum tray and shoves it in.\n\nNow he starts to clean up the mess on the drainboard.  He\nrinses the cocktail glasses, is about to empty the martini\npitcher into the sink, thinks better of it.  He pours the\ncontents into a glass, plops the lone olive out of the jar,\nscoops up the last handful of potato chips, toasts an\nimaginary companion, and drinks up.  Then he pulls a\nwastebasket from under the sink.\n\nIt is brimful of liquor bottles, and Bud adds the empty\nvodka and vermouth bottles and the olive jar.  Picking up\nthe heavy receptacle, he carries it through the living room\ntoward the hall door.\n\nINT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - EVENING\n\nThe door of Bud's apartment opens, and Bud comes out with\nthe wastebasket full of empty bottles.  Just then, DR. DAVID\nDREYFUSS, whose wife we met earlier, comes trudging up the\nstairs.

DREYFUSS\n            Slow down, kid.\n\nHe starts into the rear apartment as Bud closes the door.\n\nINT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING\n\nBud, loosening his tie, goes into the kitchen, opens the\noven, turns off the gas.  He takes a coke out of the\nrefrigerator, uncaps it, gets a knife and fork from a\ndrawer, and using his handkerchief as a potholder, pulls the\nhot aluminum tray out of the oven.  He carries everything\nout into the living room.\n\nIn the living room, Bud sets his dinner down on the coffee\ntable, settles himself on the couch.  He rears up as\nsomething stabs him, reaches under his buttocks, pulls out a\nhairpin.  He drops it into an ashtray, tackles his dinner.\nWithout even looking, he reaches over to the end table and\npresses the remote TV station-selector.  He takes a sip from\nthe coke bottle, his eyes on the TV screen across the room.\n\nThe picture on the TV set jells quickly.  Against a\nbackground of crisscrossing searchlights, a pompous announcer\nis making his spiel.\n\n                         ANNOUNCER\n            -- from the world's greatest\n            library of film classics, we\n            proudly present --\n                   (fanfare)\n            Greta Garbo -- John Barrymore --\n            Joan Crawford -- Wallace Beery --\n            and Lionel Barrymore in --\n                   (fanfare)\n            GRAND HOTEL!\n\nThere is an extended fanfare.  Bud leans forward, chewing\nexcitedly on a chicken leg.\n\n                         ANNOUNCER\n            But first, a word from our sponsor.\n            If you smoke the modern way, don't\n            be fooled by phony filter claims --\n\nBud, still eating, automatically reaches for the station-\nselector, pushes the button.\n\nA new channel pops on.  It features a Western -- Cockamamie\nIndians are attacking a stagecoach.\n\nThat's not for Bud.  He switches to another station.  In a\nfrontier saloon, Gower Street cowboys are dismantling the\nfurniture and each other.\n\nBud wearily changes channels.  But he can't get away from\nWesterns -- on this station, the U.S. Cavalry is riding to\nthe rescue.  Will they get there in time?\n\nBud doesn't wait to find out.  He switches channels again,\nand is back where he started.\n\nOn the screen, once more, is the announcer standing in front\nof the crisscrossing searchlights.\n\n                         ANNOUNCER\n            And now, Grand Hotel -- starring\n            Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan\n            Crawford --\n                   (Bud is all eyes and\n                   ears again)\n            -- Wallace Beery, and Lionel\n            Barrymore.  But first -- a word\n            from our alternate sponsor.\n                   (unctuously)\n            Friends, do you have wobbly\n            dentures -- ?\n\nThat does it.  Bud turns the set off in disgust.\n\nThe TV screen blacks out, except for a small pinpoint of\nlight in the center, which gradually fades away.\n\nIn the bathroom, Bud, in pajamas by now, is brushing his\nteeth.  From the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on\nstretchers.  Bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf,\nshakes out a sleeping pill, washes it down with a glass of\nwater.  He turns the light off, walks into the bedroom.\n\nIn the bedroom, the single bed is made, and the lamp on the\nnight table is on.  Bud plugs in the electric blanket, turns\nthe dial on.  Then he climbs into bed, props up the pillow\nbehind him.  From the night table, he picks up the magazine\nthat arrived in the mail, slides it out of the wrapper,\nopens it.  It's the new issue of PLAYBOY.  Bud leafs through\nit till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine.\nHe unfolds the overleaf, glances at it casually, refolds it,\nthen turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read.\n\nWhat he is so avidly interested in is the men's fashion\nsection.  There is a layout titled WHAT THE YOUNG EXECUTIVE\nWILL WEAR with a sub-head reading The Bowler is Back.\nIllustrating the article are several photographs of male\nmodels wearing various styles of bowlers.\n\nBud is definitely in the market for a bowler, but somehow\nhis mind starts wandering.  He turns back to the overleaf\nagain, unfolds it, studies it, then holds the magazine up\nvertically to get a different perspective on the subject.\nBy now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect, and he\nyawns.  He drops the magazine on the floor, kills the light,\nsettles down to sleep.  The room is dark except for the glow\nfrom the dial of the electric blanket.\n\nThree seconds.  Then the phone jangles shrilly in the living\nroom.  Bud stumbles groggily out of bed, and putting on his\nslippers, makes his way into the living room.  He switches\non the light, picks up the phone.\n\n                         BUD\n            Hello? -- Hello? -- yes, this is\n            Baxter.\n\nINT.

He picks up a pad and pencil from the\ntable, prints something in block letters.  Tearing off the\ntop sheet, he impales it on the spindle of the phonograph,\nthen walks out, closing the door behind him.

Bud ducks discreetly into\nthe areaway.  Mr. Dobisch, bareheaded, emerges cautiously\nfrom the cab.  Between the fingers of his hands he is\ncarrying four long-stemmed glasses, brimful of stingers.\nThe blonde steps out, holding his hat.\n\n                         BLONDE\n            This the place?\n\n                         DOBISCH\n            Yeah.\n                   (to cab driver)\n            How much?\n\n                         CABBIE\n            Seventy cents.\n\nDobisch, his hands full of stingers, turns to the blonde,\nindicates his pants pocket.\n\n                         DOBISCH\n            Get the money, will you?\n\nThe blonde plants the hat on top of his head, unbuttons his\novercoat, reaches into his pants pocket.

CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT\n\nBud, in raincoat and slippered feet, turns in off the\nstreet, plods along a path in the deserted park.  He stops\nat a damp bench under a lamp post, sits.  In the background,\nlights shine from the towering buildings on Central Park\nSouth.\n\nBud huddles inside his raincoat, shivering.  He is very\nsleepy by now.  His eyes close and his head droops.  A gust\nof wind sends wet leaves swirling across the bench.  Bud\ndoesn't stir.  He is all in.\n\n                                            FADE OUT.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nINT. LOBBY INSURANCE BUILDING - DAY\n\nIt's a quarter to nine of a gray November morning, and work-\nbound employees are piling in through the doors.  Among them\nis Bud, bundled up in a raincoat, hat, heavy muffler and\nwool gloves, and carrying a box of Kleenex.  He coughs,\npulls out a tissue, wipes his dripping nose.  He has a bad\ncold.\n\nThe lobby is an imposing, marbled affair, as befits a\ncompany which last year wrote 9.3 billion dollars worth of\ninsurance.  There are sixteen elevators, eight of them\nmarked LOCAL - FLOORS 1-18, and opposite them eight marked\nEXPRESS - FLOORS 18-37.  The starter, a uniformed Valkyrie\nwielding a clicker, is directing the flow of traffic into\nthe various elevators.\n\nBud joins the crowd in front of one of the express elevators.\nAlso standing there is Mr. Kirkeby, reading the Herald-\nTribune.\n\n                         BUD\n                   (hoarsely)\n            Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n                   (as if he just knew\n                   him vaguely)\n            Oh, how are you, Baxter.

They are indeed.\n                   (he sniffs)\n\nThe elevator doors open, revealing the operator.  She is in\nher middle twenties and her name is FRAN KUBELIK.

There is\nlots of leather, and a large desk behind which sits MR.\nSHELDRAKE. He is a substantial looking, authoritative man in\nhis middle forties, a pillar of his suburban community, a\nblood donor and a family man. The latter is attested to by a\nframed photograph showing two boys, aged 8 and 10, in\nmilitary school uniforms.\n\nAs Baxter comes through the door, Sheldrake is leafing\nthrough Dobisch's efficiency report.

NINETEENTH FLOOR - DAY\n\nThe party has picked up tempo. On top of the desks, Sylvia\nis doing a mock strip tease -- without taking any clothes\noff. There is hollering, drinking and clapping all around her.\n\nBud moves past the floor show, paying no attention. Kirkeby\nspots him, detaches himself from the cheering section around\nSylvia.\n\n                         KIRKEBY\n            Where you going, Buddy-boy?

CHEAP BAR - COLUMBUS AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - EVENING\n\nIt is six o'clock, and the joint is crowded with customers\nhaving one for the road before joining their families for\nChristmas Eve. There are men with gaily wrapped packages,\nsmall trussed-up Christmas trees, a plucked turkey in a\nplastic bag. Written across the mirror behind the bar, in\nglittering white letters, is HAPPY HOLIDAYS. Everybody is in\nhigh spirits, laughing it up and toasting each other.\n\nEverybody except Bud Baxter. He is standing at the bar in\nhis chesterfield and bowler, slightly isolated, brooding\nover an almost empty martini glass. The bartender comes up,\nsets down a fresh martini with an olive on a toothpick,\ntakes his payment from a pile of bills and coins lying in\nfront of Bud. Bud fishes out the olive, adds it to half a\ndozen other impaled olives neatly arranged in fan shape on\nthe counter. He is obviously trying to complete the circle.\n\nA short, rotund man dressed as Santa Claus hurries in from\nthe street, and comes up to the bar beside Bud.\n\n                         SANTA CLAUS\n                   (to bartender)\n            Hey, Charlie -- give me a shot of\n            bourbon -- and step on it -- my\n            sleigh is double parked.\n\nHe laughs uproariously at his own joke, nudges Bud with his\nelbow. Bud stares at him coldly, turns back to his martini.\nThe laughter dies in Santa Claus' throat. He gets his short\nof bourbon, moves down the bar to find more convivial company.\n\nStanding near the end of the curved bar is a girl in her\nmiddle twenties wearing a ratty fur coat. Her name is MARGIE\nMacDOUGALL, she is drinking a Rum Collins through a straw,\nand she too is alone. From a distance, she is studying Bud\nwith interest. On the bar in front of her is a container of\nstraws in paper wrappers. She takes one of them out, tears\noff the end of the paper, blows through the straw -- sending\nthe wrapper floating toward Bud. The paper wrapper passes\nright in front of Bud's nose. He doesn't notice it.\n\nMargie, undaunted, lets go with another missile.\n\nThis time the wrapper lands on the brim of Bud's bowler. No\nreaction. Another wrapper comes floating in, hits Bud's\ncheek. He never takes his eye off his martini.\n\nMargie leaves her place, and carrying her handbag and her\nempty glass, comes up alongside Bud. Without a word, she\nreaches up and removes the wrapper from Bud's bowler.\n\n                         MARGIE\n            You buy me a drink, I'll buy you\n            some music.\n                   (sets the glass down)\n            Rum Collins.\n\nNot waiting for an answer, she heads for the juke box. Bud\nlooks after her noncommittally, then turns to the bartender.\n\n                         BUD\n            Rum Collins.\n                   (indicating martini glass)\n            And another one of these little\n            mothers.\n\nAt the juke box, Margie has dropped a coin in and made her\nselection. The music starts -- ADESTE FIDELIS. She rejoins\nBud at the bar just as the bartender is putting down their\ndrinks in front of them. Bud removes the new olive, adds it\nto the pattern on the counter in front of him. They both\ndrink, staring straight ahead. For quite a while, there is\ncomplete silence between them.\n\n                         MARGIE\n                   (out of nowhere)\n            You like Castro?\n                   (a blank look from Bud)\n            I mean -- how do you feel about\n            Castro?\n                         BUD\n            What is Castro?\n\n                         MARGIE\n            You know, that big-shot down in\n            Cuba with the crazy beard.\n\n                         BUD\n            What about him?\n\n                         MARGIE\n            Because as far as I'm concerned,\n            he's a no good fink.

Fran stands there for a while, blinking\nback tears, then takes the long-playing record out of its\nenvelope, crosses to the phonograph. She puts the record on,\nstarts the machine -- the music is JEALOUS LOVER. As it\nplays, Fran wanders aimlessly around the darkened room, her\nbody wracked by sobs. Finally she regains control of herself,\nand picking up her handbag, starts through the bedroom\ntoward the bathroom.\n\nIn the bathroom, Fran switches on the light, puts her bag on\nthe sink, turns on the faucet. Scooping up some water, she\nwashes the smeared mascara away, then turns the faucet off,\npicks up a towel As she is drying her face, she notices in\nthe pull-away shaving mirror the magnified reflection of a\nvial of pills on the medicine shelf. Fran reaches out for\nthe vial, turns it slowly around in her hand. The label\nreads: SECONAL - ONE AT BEDTIME AS NEEDED FOR SLEEP.\n\nFran studies the label for a second, then returns the vial\nto the shelf. She opens her handbag, takes out a lipstick.\nAs she does so, she sees the hundred dollar bill Sheldrake\nleft in the bag. Her eyes wander back to the vial on the\nmedicine shelf. Then very deliberately she picks up Bud's\nmouthwash glass, removes the two toothbrushes from it, turns\non the faucet, starts filling the glass with water.\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\nINT. CHEAP BAR - COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT\n\nThe joint is deserted now except for the Santa Claus, who is\nleaning against the bar, quite loaded, and Bud and Margie\nMacDougall, who are dancing to a slow blues coming from the\njuke box. Bud is still in his overcoat and bowler, and\nMargie is wearing her fur coat. The bartender is sweeping up\nthe place.\n\n                         BARTENDER\n                   (to Santa Claus)\n            Drink up, Pop.

Go home.\n\nBud and Margie ignore him, continue dancing -- or rather\nswaying limply cheek-to-cheek. The bartender crosses to the\njuke box, pulls the plug out. The music stops, but not Bud\nand Margie -- they continue dancing.\n\n                         BARTENDER\n            O-U-T -- out!\n\nHe goes to the front of the bar, starts to extinguish the\nlights.

BROWNSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nBud and Margie come walking down the street.

APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nIt is exactly the way we left it. There is no sign of Fran,\nexcept for the gloves she dropped on the coffee table\nearlier. Bud switches on the light, shuts the door.\n\n                         MARGIE\n                   (looking around)\n            Say, this is Snugsville.\n\n                         BUD\n                   (helping her out of\n                   her coat)\n            Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only\n            fair to warn you that you are now\n            alone with a notorious sexpot.\n\n                         MARGIE\n                   (a gleam)\n            No kidding.\n\n                         BUD\n            Ask anybody around here. As a\n            matter of fact, when it's time for\n            me to go -- and I may go just like\n            that --\n                   (snaps his fingers)\n            -- I have promised my body to the\n            Columbia Medical Center.\n\n                         MARGIE\n                   (shuddering deliciously)\n            Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps\n            just to think about it.\n\n                         BUD\n            Well, they haven't got me yet, baby.\n            Dig up some ice from the kitchen\n            and let's not waste any time --\n            preliminary-wise.\n\n                         MARGIE\n            I'm with you, lover.\n\nShe takes the bowl of melted ice Bud has handed her,\ndisappears into the kitchen. As Bud starts to remove his\ncoat, he becomes aware of a scratching noise from the\nphonograph. He crosses to it, sees that the needle is stuck\nin the last groove of a long-playing record.\n\nBud lifts the record off, examines it curiously, then puts\nit aside and substitutes the cha cha record. As the music\nstarts, he dances over to the coat-rack beside the door,\nhangs up his chesterfield and bowler. He turns back into the\nroom, still dancing, suddenly spots Fran's gloves on the\ncoffee table. He picks up the gloves, looks around for some\nconvenient place to get rid of them. Moving over to the\nbedroom door, he opens it, tosses the gloves toward the bed\ninside. He shuts the door, starts to turn away, freezes in a\ndelayed reaction to something he saw inside. He quickly\nopens the door again, looks.\n\nSprawled across the bed, on top of the bedspread, is Fran.\nThe light from the bathroom falls across her. She is fully\ndressed, still in her coat, and apparently asleep.\n\nBud steps into the bedroom, closing the door behind him,\nwalks over to Fran.\n\n                         BUD\n            All right, Miss Kubelik -- get up.\n            It's past checking-out time, and\n            the hotel management would\n            appreciate it if you would get the\n            hell out of here.\n                   (Fran doesn't stir)\n            Look, Miss Kubelik, I used to like\n            you -- I used to like you a lot --\n            but it's all over between us -- so\n            beat it -- O-U-T -- out!\n                   (no reaction; he puts\n                   a hand on her\n                   shoulder, shakes her)\n            Come on -- wake up!\n\nShe doesn't respond. But something falls out of her hand,\nrolls across the bed. Bud picks it up, looks at it -- it is\nhis sleeping-pill vial, now uncapped and empty.\n                         BUD\n                   (a hoarse whisper)\n            Oh, my God.\n\nFor a second he is paralyzed. Then he drops the vial, grabs\nFran, lifts her into a sitting position on the bed, shakes\nher violently.\n\n                         BUD\n            Miss Kubelik! Miss Kubelik!\n\nFran's head droops to one side, like a rag doll's. Bud lets\ngo of her, rushes out.\n\nIn the living room, the phonograph is still cha cha-ing away.\nBud dashes to the phone, picks it up. Then it occurs to him\nthat he doesn't know whom to call and he hangs up. Out of\nthe kitchen comes Margie, with a bowlful of ice cubes.\n\n                         MARGIE\n            I broke a nail trying to get the\n            ice-tray out. You ought to buy\n            yourself a new refrigerator.\n\nBud, not listening, runs past her to the hall door and out.\n\n                         MARGIE\n                   (calling after him)\n            I didn't mean right now.\n\nINT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT\n\nBud arrives at the door of the Dreyfuss apartment, starts\nringing the doorbell and pounding with his fist.\n\n                         BUD\n            Dr. Dreyfuss! Hey, Doc!\n\nThe door opens, and Dr. Dreyfuss stands there sleepily,\npulling on his beaten bathrobe.\n\n                         BUD\n                   (words tumbling over\n                   each other)\n            There's a girl in my place -- she\n            took some sleeping pills -- you\n            better come quick -- I can't wake\n            her up.\n\n                         DR.

APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nMargie has settled herself comfortably on the couch, and is\nfixing the drinks. The cha cha music is still going. Bud\ncomes flying in, heads for the bedroom.\n\n                         MARGIE\n            Hey -- over here, lover.\n\nBud stops in his tracks, suddenly aware of her.\n\n                         MARGIE\n            What's all this running around?\n            You're going to wear yourself out.\n\nBud strides over to her purposefully, yanks her up to her\nfeet.\n\n                         MARGIE\n            Not so rough, honey.\n\n                         BUD\n                   (taking the glass out\n                   of her hand)\n            Good night.\n\n                         MARGIE\n            Good night?\n\n                         BUD\n                   (thrusting the fur\n                   coat at her)\n            The party's over.\n\n                         MARGIE\n            What's the matter? Did I do\n            something wrong?\n\n                         BUD\n                   (easing her toward door)\n            It's an emergency -- see you some\n            other time.\n\nDr. Dreyfuss comes hurrying in, carrying his medical bag. He\nstops, bewildered by the sound of music and the sight of a\nwide-awake girl in the apartment.\n\n                         BUD\n            Not this one --\n                   (pointing to the bedroom)\n            -- in there, Doc.\n\nDr. Dreyfuss proceeds into the bedroom.\n\n                         MARGIE\n            Say, what's going on here, anyway?\n\n                         BUD\n            Nothing.\n                   (propelling her\n                   toward the door)\n            Just clear out, will you?\n\n                         MARGIE\n                   (pointing back)\n            My shoes.\n\nBud reaches under the coffee table, where she left her\nshoes, retrieves them.\n\n                         MARGIE\n                   (bitterly)\n            Some lover you are. Some sexpot!\n\nBud shoves the shoes at her, takes a bill out of his wallet,\nhands it to her.\n\n                         BUD\n            Here -- find yourself a phone booth\n            and call your husband in Havana.\n\n                         MARGIE\n            You bet I will. And when I tell him\n            how you treated me, he'll push your\n            face in.\n                   (he shoves her\n                   through the open door)\n            You fink!\n\nBud slams the door shut, starts toward the bedroom. Halfway\nthere, he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on.\nHe detours to the phonograph, switches it off, continues\ninto the bedroom.\n\nIn the bedroom, the overhead light is on, and Dr. Dreyfuss\nis working on the unconscious Fran. He has removed her coat,\nand is shining a flashlight into her eyes, examining her\npupils. Bud approaches the bed worriedly.\n\n                         BUD\n            She going to be all right, Doc?\n\n                         DR. DREYFUSS\n            How many pills were in that bottle?\n\n                         BUD\n            It was half-full -- about a dozen\n            or so. You going to have to take\n            her to the hospital?\n\nDr. Dreyfuss ignores him. Out of his medical bag, he takes a\nstomach tube with a rubber funnel at the end. Then he starts\nto lift Fran off the bed.\n\n                         DR. DREYFUSS\n            Help me, will you?\n\nBetween them, they get Fran into an upright position.\n\n                         DR. DREYFUSS\n            Into the bathroom.\n\nThey half-carry, half-drag Fran's limp form toward the\nbathroom.\n\n                         BUD\n            What are you going to do, Doc?\n\n                         DR. DREYFUSS\n            Get that stuff out of her stomach --\n            if it isn't too late. You better\n            put some coffee on -- and pray.\n\nBud starts away as Dr. Dreyfuss takes Fran into the bathroom.\n\nBud loses no time getting into the kitchen. He fills an\naluminum kettle with water, strikes a match, lights the gas\nburner, puts the kettle on. Then he takes a jar of instant\ncoffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard, shakes\nan excessive portion of coffee into the mug, sticks a spoon\nin it. He watches the kettle for a moment, mops his brow\nwith a handkerchief, then starts back toward the bedroom.\n\nBud crosses the bedroom to the half-open door of the\nbathroom, looks in anxiously. From inside come the sounds of\na coughing spasm and running water. Bud turns away, undoes\nhis tie and collar, paces the bedroom floor. Something on\nthe night table attracts his attention -- resting against\nthe base of the lamp is a sealed envelope. Bud picks it\nup -- on it, in Fran's handwriting, is one word, JEFF. He\nturns the letter over in his hand, trying to decide what to\ndo with it.\n\nDr. Dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom, carrying a pale,\nstill unconscious Fran. Bud quickly conceals the suicide\nnote behind his back.\n\n                         DR. DREYFUSS\n            Bring my bag.\n\nHe lugs Fran into the living room. Bud stashes the letter in\nhis back pocket, picks up the medical bag, follows them.\n\nIn the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss lowers Fran into a chair.\nHer chin falls to her chest. Dreyfuss takes the bag from\nBud, fishes out a hypodermic syringe, draws 2 c.c.'s from a\nbottle of picrotoxin.\n\n                         DR. DREYFUSS\n            Roll up her right sleeve.\n\nBud does so. Dr. Dreyfuss hands the hypodermic to Bud,\nsearches for a spot for the injection.\n\n                         DR.

Dr. Dreyfuss grabs\nher by the hair, lifts her head up.\n\n                         DR.

Bud winces. Dreyfuss, still holding Fran by the\nhair, takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag. He\ncrushes one of the ampules in his hand, passes it under her\nnose. Fran tries to turn her head away. Dreyfuss slaps her\nagain, hard, crushes another ampule, repeats the process.\n\nBud is watching tensely. From the kitchen comes the whistle\nof the boiling kettle, but Bud pays no attention.\n\n                         DR. DREYFUSS\n            Get the coffee.\n\nBud hurries into the kitchen. He turns off the gas, pours\nthe boiling water into the mug with the instant coffee,\nstirs it. From off, come the sounds of more slapping and\nsome moaning. Bud carries the coffee out.\n\nIn the living room, Dr. Dreyfuss is working another ammonia\nampule under Fran's nose. Her eyes start fluttering. Dreyfuss\ntakes the coffee mug from Bud, forces it between Fran's\nlips, pours coffee into her mouth. Fran resists\ninstinctively, half the coffee dribbling over her chin and\ndress, but Dr. Dreyfuss keeps at it.\n\n                         DR. DREYFUSS\n            Let's get some air in here.

A\nman now comes out of a phone booth, joins the waiting\nbrunette, and they go off together. Bud picks out a couple\nof paperbacks, pays the clerk behind the counter.

But we're all set.\n\n                         FRAN\n            All set for what?\n\n                         SHELDRAKE\n            I rented a car -- it's going to be\n            here at one o'clock -- we're\n            driving to Atlantic City.\n\n                         FRAN\n            Atlantic City?\n\n                         SHELDRAKE\n            I know it's a drag -- but you can't\n            find a hotel room in town -- not on\n            New Year's Eve.\n\n                         FRAN\n                   (a long look at Sheldrake)\n            Ring out the old year, ring in the\n            new. Ring-a-ding-ding.\n\n                         SHELDRAKE\n            I didn't plan it this way, Fran --\n            actually, it's all Baxter's fault.\n\n                         FRAN\n            Baxter?\n\n                         SHELDRAKE\n            He wouldn't give me the key to the\n            apartment.\n\n                         FRAN\n            He wouldn't.\n\n                         SHELDRAKE\n            Just walked out on me -- quit --\n            threw that big fat job right in my\n            face.\n\n                         FRAN\n                   (a faint smile)\n            The nerve.\n\n                         SHELDRAKE\n            That little punk -- after all I did\n            for him! He said I couldn't bring\n            anybody to his apartment --\n            especially not Miss Kubelik. What's\n            he got against you, anyway?\n\n                         FRAN\n                   (a faraway look in\n                   her eye)\n            I don't know. I guess that's the\n            way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.\n\n                         SHELDRAKE\n            What are you talking about?\n\n                         FRAN\n            I'd spell it out for you -- only I\n            can't spell.\n\nThe piano player is consulting the watch on his upraised\nleft arm. He drops the arm in a signal, and the lights go\nout. At the same time, he strikes up AULD LANG SYNE.\n\nAll over the dimly lit room, couples get to their feet,\nembracing and joining in the song.\n\nIn the last booth, Sheldrake leans across the table, kisses\nFran.\n\n                         SHELDRAKE\n            Happy New Year, Fran.\n\nFran's expression is preoccupied. Sheldrake faces in the\ndirection of the pianist, and holding his glass aloft, sings\nalong with the others.\n\nAs AULD LANG SYNE comes to an end, the place explodes\nnoisily -- there is a din of horns, ratchets, and shouted\ngreetings. The lights come up again.\n\nIn the last booth, Sheldrake turns back toward Fran -- but\nshe is no longer there. Her paper hat lies abandoned on her\nvacated chair.\n\n                         SHELDRAKE\n            Fran --\n                   (looking around)\n            -- where are you, Fran?\n\nHe rises, cranes his neck, trying to spot her in the crowd.\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. BROWNSTONE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nFran, a coat thrown over the dress she was wearing at the\nRickshaw, comes down the street almost at a run. There is a\nhappy, expectant look on her face. She hurries up the steps\nof the house and through the front door.\n\nINT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT\n\nFran mounts the stairs eagerly. As she reaches the landing\nand heads for Bud's apartment, there is a loud, sharp report\nfrom inside.\n\nFran freezes momentarily, then rushes to the door.\n\n                         FRAN\n            Mr. Baxter!\n                   (pounding on door)\n            Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!\n\nThe door opens and there stands Bud, the bottle of champagne\nhe has just uncorked still foaming over in his hand. He\nstares at Fran unbelievingly.\n\n                         FRAN\n                   (sagging with relief)\n            Are you all right?\n\n                         BUD\n            I'm fine.\n\n                         FRAN\n            Are you sure? How's your knee?\n\n                         BUD\n            I'm fine all over.\n\n                         FRAN\n            Mind if I come in?\n\n                         BUD\n                   (still stunned)\n            Of course not.\n\nINT. THE APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nFran comes in and Bud shuts the door. The room is the same\nas we left it, except for an empty champagne glass standing\non the coffee table.\n\n                         BUD\n            Let me get another glass.\n\nHe goes to one of the cartons, takes out a champagne glass\nwrapped in newspaper, starts to unwrap it.\n\n                         FRAN\n                   (looking around)\n            Where are you going?\n                         BUD\n            Who knows? Another neighborhood --\n            another town -- another job -- I'm\n            on my own.\n\n                         FRAN\n            That's funny -- so am I.\n                   (Bud, pouring\n                   champagne, looks up\n                   at her)\n            What did you do with the cards?\n\n                         BUD\n                   (indicating carton)\n            In there.\n\nFran takes the deck of cards and the gin rummy score pad out\nof the carton, settles herself on the couch, starts to\nshuffle the cards expertly.\n\n                         BUD\n            What about Mr. Sheldrake?\n\n                         FRAN\n            I'm going to send him a fruit cake\n            every Christmas.\n\nBud sinks down happily on the couch, and Fran holds out the\ndeck to him.\n\n                         FRAN\n            Cut.\n\nBud cuts a card, but doesn't look at it.\n\n                         BUD\n            I love you, Miss Kubelik.\n\n                         FRAN\n                   (cutting a card)\n            Seven --\n                   (looking at Bud's card)\n            -- queen.\n\nShe hands the deck to Bud.\n\n                         BUD\n            Did you hear what I said, Miss\n            Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.\n\n                         FRAN\n                   (smiling)\n            Shut up and deal!\n\nBud begins to deal, never taking his eyes off her. Fran\nremoves her coat, starts picking up her cards and arranging\nthem. Bud, a look of pure joy on his face, deals -- and\ndeals -- and keeps dealing.\n\nAnd that's about it. Story-wise.\n\n                                            FADE OUT.\n\n                           \n\n\n\n                              THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApartment, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Billy Wilder\u00a0\u00a0I.A.L Diamond\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:33.796543"}
