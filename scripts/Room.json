A light\r\n    clicks on, briefly, then snaps off again.\r\n\r\n    Then on again, for a little longer.\r\n\r\n    We wake groggily with JACK (five), blinking up at MA (26).\r\n    She's standing in a worn t-shirt and underwear beside a lamp,\r\n    switching it on and off at apparently random intervals. She\r\n    cranes up at the recessed skylight, Room's only window.\r\n\r\n    The irregular flashes of lamp-light reveal glimpses of this\r\n    little world lined with cork: ten foot a side, seven foot\r\n    high, gabled ceiling rising to ten foot.\r\n\r\n    Clusters of Jack's and Ma's vivid drawings are pinned all\r\n    over the walls, quivering in the draft from the vents. Done\r\n    with five crayons (red, yellow, blue, orange, green) and\r\n    pencil on toilet tissue, lined pages or cardboard, they show\r\n    dogs, trees, aliens, rocket ships, figures labelled 'Jack' or\r\n    'Ma'. Delicate mobiles (uncooked spaghetti, threads,\r\n    plastics, foil, down from pillows, cloth scraps) dangle.\r\n\r\n    A wardrobe with slatted louver doors. On top, toys crafted\r\n    from garbage, a Labyrinth from toilet-roll insides.\r\n\r\n    A dresser with a TV. A homemade pack of cards, papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9\r\n    checkers and chess. A Fort constructed from vitamin and other\r\n    bottles and cans. A single meagre African violet in a pot on\r\n    the TV.\r\n\r\n    A round dining table, two fold-up chairs side by side.\r\n\r\n    A bath with a single small towel over the side.\r\n    A toilet, with a flotilla of homemade toy boats floating in\r\n    the tank which is oddly missing a lid.\r\n\r\n    A sink, with a single worn toothbrush, toothpaste, dish soap,\r\n    a broken comb, folded rags for washcloths. A small square of\r\n    mirror tile hung up over it.\r\n\r\n    A small kitchen cabinet. A dish rack: two each of big and\r\n    small white plates, bowls, tumblers, knives, forks, spoons\r\n    (one with a melted handle), a scissors, can opener, serrated\r\n    knife, wooden spoon, spatula.\r\n\r\n    A basic stove (with more folded rags on its handle, for pot\r\n    holders), one frying pan and one saucepan.\r\n\r\n    A small refrigerator (more toys on top), a tiny trash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                                                      (CONTINUED)\r\n</b><b>1   CONTINUED:                                                  1\r\n</b>\r\n    A rocker.    Above, a shelf. Ten books stacked. Homemade toys.\r\n\r\n    A reddish Persian-style rug on the floor.\r\n\r\n    A grey steel door, no handle. On the wall, a ten-digit\r\n    keypad with a red light like a watching eye.\r\n\r\n    Ma looks over at Jack and sees that he's awake. She mouths\r\n    'Sh' at him, soothing him back to sleep. Keeps signalling.\r\n\r\n    Darkness again, as Jack's eyelids fall.\r\n\r\n<b>    TITLE: ROOM\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>2   INT.

Elbow and\r\n     lip bloody, face covered in hair, snot and tears.\r\n\r\n     The world hits Jack: street lamps, wind in his face, shocking\r\n     colors of the sunset. Trees and houses looming and then\r\n     receding, like a rollercoaster.\r\n\r\n     His glance falls on the shovel meant for his grave.\r\n\r\n     Jack's eyes focus on the cab of the truck and what he\r\n     realizes must be the back of Old Nick's head, driving.\r\n\r\n     Old Nick slows at the third stop, and swings right. Jack is\r\n     flung headlong, banging his leg on the left of the flatbed.\r\n     The truck screeches to a stop, because Old Nick heard the\r\n     noise and glimpsed Jack in his rearview mirror.\r\n\r\n     He flings the driver's door open.\r\n\r\n     Jack scrabbles over to the opposite side.\r\n\r\n     Old Nick jumps down and strides around the truck.\r\n\r\n     Jack leaps down to the tarmac, bloodying his left knee. His\r\n     jaw smashes into his right knee. He picks a direction at\r\n     random and tears away from the truck, stumbles, keeps going.\r\n\r\n     A large dog on a long leash, emerges from a yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                                                         (CONTINUED)\r\n</b><b>36   CONTINUED: (2)                                            36\r\n</b>\r\n     DOUG(a big man in his forties) and his 2-year-old daughter\r\n     CARRIE, both in winter outdoor clothes, follow.\r\n\r\n     Jack runs into the man, finds himself on the ground with the\r\n     dog snarling at him.\r\n\r\n<b>                         DOUG\r\n</b>               Boomer!\r\n\r\n     He pulls the dog away by the collar.\r\n\r\n     Old Nick catches up, and scoops Jack up with one arm.\r\n\r\n     Pinned in the air, Jack lashes out in soundless terror. Old\r\n     Nick strides back towards the truck with him.\r\n\r\n<b>                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n</b>               Excuse me?

Confused and dizzy, he crawls towards\r\n     the sidewalk. The truck roars past: a getaway, not attempted\r\n     murder.\r\n\r\n     Jack watches the truck zoom through the next stop.\r\n\r\n     He collapses and blinks up at the vast evening sky. After a\r\n     beat, Doug, leaning in, interrupts the view.

A plain\r\n     clothes OFFICER is knocking on the front door of the house.\r\n     Jack watches through the car window as Officer Parker\r\n     consults with an OLDER WHITE MALE OFFICER, also plain\r\n     clothes. Parker and the older officer start to poke around\r\n     the side of the house, disappearing for a moment before\r\n     running back. Officer Parker takes what looks like a crowbar\r\n     from the trunk of the car. She draws her weapon. Grabowski\r\n     moves to leave the car.\r\n\r\n<b>                         OFFICER PARKER\r\n</b>               Stay with the boy.\r\n\r\n     She disappears around the back of the house.

Then,\r\n     at last the door is open and Jack is in her arms.\r\n\r\n<b>40   INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT                                    40\r\n</b>\r\n     A little later. Jack and Ma, in blankets, hold each other as\r\n     the police cruiser moves through the night.\r\n\r\n     Jack does a huge yawn, utterly exhausted now the adrenalin is\r\n     gone.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JACK\r\n</b>               Can we go to Bed now?\r\n\r\n<b>                         MA\r\n</b>               We can do anything.

They are being bustled\r\n      along by Officers Parker and Grabowski, A FEMALE PLAIN\r\n      CLOTHES DETECTIVE, a DOCTOR, a NURSE and a HOSPITAL SECURITY\r\n      GUARD. A woman in her 50s, is beside them, her arm around MA.\r\n      This is NANCY, Ma's mother. It's like a strange dream to\r\n      Jack. Through the group around him he can make out other\r\n      figures waiting in chairs. He can hear a drunk shouting,\r\n      phones ringing.\r\n\r\n<b>                          JACK\r\n</b>                Ma.\r\n\r\n      Ma shushes him, stroking his hair.

A cot bed, unused, has been set up to one\r\n      side. Jack is awake but content to lie close to Ma for a\r\n      while - studying the dials and switches on the wall above his\r\n      head. He looks at Ma, asleep, bruises fading to yellow-green.\r\n      He sits up and pulls back the sheet. He's wearing only a pair\r\n      of underpants from Room which look particularly wretched in\r\n      this new antiseptic environment. He touches the part of the\r\n      mattress he's being lying on. It's damp. He examines a\r\n      bandage on his knee. He gets up. On a side table, he sees a\r\n      plate with the remains of some toast on it and a half drunk\r\n      cup of tea. He sniffs at the food. There are two surgical\r\n      masks there, also. He walks slowly to the opposite wall, his\r\n      little figure silhouetted against the translucent blinds. He\r\n      stops in front of the one window which has its blind drawn.\r\n      The hospital suite is high up and the view is spectacular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                                                        (CONTINUED)\r\n</b><b>45   CONTINUED:                                               45\r\n</b>\r\n     From the back we study Jack's small figure and beyond it the\r\n     vast world below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                                                       (CONTINUED)\r\n</b><b>45   CONTINUED: (2)                                           45\r\n</b>\r\n     Coming around on Jack's face we see that he is trying to make\r\n     sense of what he's seeing.
