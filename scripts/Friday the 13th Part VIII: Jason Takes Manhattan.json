CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT\n\n\tA dark, rumbling sky. Haze clings to the lake as we float \n\tacross it, clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into \n\tview. A few scattered streetlights. Dilapidated cabins. \n\tAn abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. \n\n\tWe continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound \n\tof seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small \n\tHOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light \n\tflickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.\n\n\tINT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT\n\n\tA teenage boy and girl, JIM and SUZY, are slow-dancing. \n\tJim's lips softly touch her lissome shoulders.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tWell...how do you feel?\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tAsk me in about five minutes.\n\n\tShe bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully..\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tI'm talking about graduation. Being \n\t\ttotally free to do whatever we want \n\t\tnow.\n\n\tHer hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tIt feels excellent.\n\n\tHer mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently \n\tpulls away from her with a teasing smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tGotta throw the anchor over.\n\n\tHe leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets.\n\n\tEXT. HOUSEBOAT DECK - NIGHT\n\n\tas Jim tosses a small anchor overboard.\n\n\tTIGHT ON WATER SURFACE\n\n\tas the weighty object splashes, sinking into black \n\toblivion, pulling its cable down with it. \n\n\tJIM \n\n\tglances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He \n\tfeels a chill, heading back inside.\n\n\tEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)\n\n\tas the anchor drifts to the lake bottom, dropping a few \n\tfeet from a THICK POWER CABLE which rests in the lake \n\tsilt.\n\n\tINT.

He crawls on \n\ttop of the bed, kissing her again, but not with the same \n\tenthusiasm as before.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tWhat's wrong?\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tNothing.\n\n\tHe starts to pull off his shirt and join her.

Something's bothering \n\t\tyou.\n\n\tJim pauses, turning off the mood music.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tIt's just that we're right around that \n\t\told summer camp where all those \n\t\tmurders took place.\n\n\tThe boat creaks.

They're just \n\t\tstories.\n\n\tHe brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently, \n\tfinding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes, \n\ttrying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't. \n\tSuzy begins to rationalize.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tWe're the last graduating class, \n\t\tright? \n\n\tJim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tRight.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tI mean, Lakeview High just closed its \n\t\tdoors for good, right?\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tRight.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tSo there's no reason for him to come \n\t\tback because there won't be any of us \n\t\taround...right?\n\n\tJim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tRight. Except that Jason isn't real \n\t\tso none of it matters anyway.\n\n\tShe starts to relax, returning his kisses.\n\n\tEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)\n\n\tas the anchor drifts along the lake floor, tugging hard \n\ton the power cable. Camera TRACKS along the cable, \n\tcoming to a RUSTY SET OF CHAINS TANGLED AROUND IT.\n\n\tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tas Jim slides on top of Suzy. Thoughts of Jason are \n\tstarting to slip away along with their clothes.\n\n\tEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)\n\n\tas the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the \n\ttugging anchor. Camera continues to TRACK again...and we \n\tfind to our horror that the waterlogged, fish-eaten body \n\tof JASON IS SECURED BY THESE SAME CHAINS. (NOTE: Jason's \n\tface is obscured.)\n\n\tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tTeenagers in love, lost in not-so-innocent passion. At \n\tthe same moment:\n\n\tEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)\n\n\tThe anchor tugs one last time and RIPS THROUGH THE CABLE. \n\tSPARKS INSTANTLY FLY, chasing along the cable, finding \n\tthe chain which secures Jason and ENGULFING HIM IN \n\tELECTRICITY.\n\n\tEXT. HOUSEBOAT - ON LAKE SURFACE (EFX)\n\n\tas BRIGHT FLASHES OF BLUE LIGHT strobe-under the surface. \n\tARCING CURRENT chases up the anchor cable, sparking \n\tacross the hoist.\n\n\tEXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - WIDE SHOT FROM WATER\n\n\tas the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly \n\textinguished, plunging the campsite into darkness.\n\n\tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tas Suzy's eyes flash open.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tDid you hear that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tHear what?\n\n\tHe pulls her back down.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tC'mon, I'm serious.\n\n\tHe knows the mood is broken.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tAll right, I'll check it out.\n\n\tHe slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the \n\tsheet up around her fearfully.\n\n\tEXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT (TANK)\n\n\tas the cable smolders, void of electricity now. TRACK to \n\tfind the chains again...but they're dangling loosely. \n\tJASON IS GONE.\n\n\tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tSuzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now. The black void \n\tof night is all she sees out the cabin door, which Jim \n\thas left open. An uncomfortable amount of time passes.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tJimmy...?\n\n\tNo answer. Her heart starts to pound.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tJim...?\n\n\tAgain, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving \n\ttowards the open door. The ship creaks again.\n\n\tSUZY'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tas she grows closer to the doorway, nothing but pitch-\n\tblack beyond it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tStop screwing around, Jim. I mean \n\t\tit...\n\n\t...And just as she reaches the door:\n\n\tA HOCKEY MASKED MONSTER\n\n\tleaps out, clutching a HUGE KNIFE. Suzy barely has time \n\tto scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST.\n\n\tSUZY\n\n\tstands there in speechless shock, looking down at her \n\tmortal wound. But there's no blood.\n\n\tTHE MONSTER\n\n\tpulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out \n\twith his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM \n\tpulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it \n\taside.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tGotcha good, baby cakes.\n\n\tShe doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick \n\thim in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, \n\tlaughing.\n\n\tEXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK\n\n\tsitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A \n\tSHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT...followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING \n\tHAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling \n\tit away.\n\n\tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tas Jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed, trying \n\tunsuccessfully to kiss her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tAll right, all right -- I'm a major \n\t\tass.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tAnd you'll never do it again.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tAnd I'll never do it again. Forgive \n\t\tme?\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tNo.\n\n\tShe's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around \n\thim, finally giving in.\n\n\tEXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT\n\n\tA deadly-sharp SPEAR GUN rests in its rack outside the \n\tcabin. JASON'S HAND REMOVES IT.\n\n\tINT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tThe sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each \n\tother. Thoughts of Jason are nonexistent now.\n\n\tANGLE - CABIN DOOR\n\n\tNothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss-covered \n\tBARE FEET SLOSH INTO FRAME.\n\n\tSUZY\n\n\tcloses her eyes with pleasure...\n\n\tANGLE - CABIN DOOR\n\n\t...and camera RISES from the mossy feet, up the bloodless \n\tlegs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey-masked \n\tface of our anti-hero: JASON VOORHEES.\n\n\tSUZY \n\n\tlets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay \n\topen long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway. \n\tShe tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just \n\tcollapsed himself.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUZY\n\t\tJJJJJJJJason...\n\n\tHe doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tUh-huh. You must really think I'm an \n\t\tass.\n\n\tBut she continues to stare in horror as:\n\n\tJASON\n\n\traises the spear, taking aim.\n\n\tANGLE - SUZY AND JIM  \n\n\tHs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood-\n\tcurdling SCREAM. A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR, \n\tPIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD.\n\n\tJim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able \n\tto assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see \n\tthe monster himself.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIM\n\t\tOhmygod...\n\n\tJim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to \n\tdefend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He \n\tSMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim \n\tscrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE \n\tAIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.\n\n\tEXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT\n\n\tas the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward. The lone \n\tsilhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm. \n\tHe's back.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  FADE OUT/MAIN CREDITS.\n\n\tFADE IN:\n\n\tEXT.

DOCKSIDE - DAY\n\n\tStanding at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH, \n\tclipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair \n\tof new-agey SENIOR GIRLS. McCulloch is approaching fifty, \n\twearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the \n\tdisposition of a stern puritan.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tRemember girls, the shuffleboard \n\t\ttournament will start at six p.m. \n\t\tsharp. A non-attendance will restrict \n\t\tyour time in port, understood?\n\n\tThey nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers \n\tas they head up the ramp.

The captain of the ship. And \n\tSean's father. Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is \n\timmediately replaced with anxiety.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tBe right up, Dad.\n\n\tHe and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving \n\tMcCulloch one last glare.\n\n\tINT. '76 BMW 2002 - DAY\n\n\tBehind the wheel is MISS COLLEEN VAN DEUSEN, thirties, \n\tattractive, a progressive attitude. RENNIE WICKHAM sits \n\tnext to her -- she's seventeen, pretty, slightly \n\twithdrawn.

But Rennie's smiles are few and far \n\tbetween, this one disappearing as she glances out the \n\twindow.\n\n\tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (SECOND UNIT)\n\n\tas the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread \n\tout before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes \n\tacross it occupied by two indistinguishable people.\n\n\tRETURN TO SHOT\n\n\tRennie's eyes show a hidden terror. She quickly turns \n\taway, shivering briefly. Miss Van Deusen notices. She \n\tturns a corner, heading into the parking lot.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tEverything okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tJust felt a little chill.\n\n\tRennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tDid you know that I'm giving up \n\t\tteaching?\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tReally?\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tSince the school is closing anyway, \n\t\tI'm going to write that novel I've \n\t\tbeen threatening on everybody.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tThat's wonderful, Miss Van \n\t\tDeusen...what's it about?\n\n\tShe parks the car, turning off the ignition.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tA senior class cruise to Manhattan, \n\t\tlaced with romance, adventure and \n\t\tmurder.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tOr a Gothic cook book. I haven't \n\t\tdecided which.\n\n\tShe's coaxed the smile out of Rennie again.

You're in stateroom two-\n\t\tfifty-five.\n\n\tEva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling \n\tto see what happens with Tamara.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAMARA\n\t\tLook, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car \n\t\taccident yesterday and missed our \n\t\tappointment. It's okay, no big deal, \n\t\tjust a bruised arm...\n\t\t\t(squeezes her arm)\n\t\t...so I brought my project along \n\t\ttoday. It's in my suitcase. Really.\n\n\tHe looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this.\n\n\t\t\t\tEVA\n\t\tShe's telling the truth, Mr. \n\t\tMcCulloch. I saw her pack it.\n\n\tHe's surprised to hear this...and so is Tamara.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tAll right. But if it mysteriously \n\t\tdisappears en route, I'll have you \n\t\tsent back home the minute we dock. \n\t\tUnderstood?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAMARA\n\t\tPerfectly.\n\n\tShe grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on \n\tbefore he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAMARA  \n\t\tA major prick.\n\n\t\t\t\tEVA\n\t\tWhat are you going to do?\n\n\t\t\t\tTAMARA\n\t\tImprovise, of course.\n\n\tEXT. DOCK PILINGS - SAME TIME  \n\n\tas the HOUSEBOAT haphazardly bumps into barnacle-covered \n\tdock pilings, still around fifty yards from the cruise \n\tship.\n\n\tPOINT OF VIEW OUT HOUSEBOAT WINDOW\n\n\tThe window is splattered with blood, but still clear \n\tenough to make out Tamara and Eva walking up the gangway, \n\talong with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on \n\tboard.\n\n\tTIGHT ON HOUSEBOAT'S ANCHOR CABLE\n\n\t--or rather the remnants of it. It's a piece of frayed \n\twoven metal charred by extreme electricity, severed just \n\tabove water level. Suddenly there's blurry movement \n\tbehind it; camera RACK FOCUSES just in time to catch a \n\tglimpse of JASON SLIPPING OFF THE SIDE, FLOATING TOWARDS \n\tTHE PILINGS.\n\n\tEXT. DOCKSIDE - SAME TIME\n\n\tas McCulloch impatiently checks his watch and list again. \n\tMiss Van Deusen walks up to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tHello, Charles. Has everyone checked \n\t\tin?\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tJim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never \n\t\tshowed up. I'm a little concerned.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tDon't be. They probably decided to \n\t\texplore each other rather than New \n\t\tYork.\n\n\tHe gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp. \n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tLet's go -- we're running two minutes \n\t\tlate.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tCharles, there's someone else coming \n\t\talong too.\n\n\tHe stops, following her glance. His face tightens.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tRennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her \n\tdog Toby striding next to her. She walks up to him, \n\tstarts to say something, then decides against it. Rennie \n\theads up the gangway. HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van \n\tDeusen. He's livid.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tYou have no right...\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tAnd neither do you. It's up to Rennie\n\t\tto decide what she wants to do.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tShe doesn't know what she wants. She's \n\t\tnever had a stable life.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tAnd she sure doesn't have one now, \n\t\teither. She needs to live.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tI'm her legal guardian, not you or \n\t\tanybody else, and I alone know what's \n\t\tbest for her. End of discussion.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tNo, I think it's just the beginning.\n\n\tShe walks past him.\n\n\tEXT. RAMP/SHIP - ON RENNIE\n\n\tas she reaches the top of the gangway, her heart \n\tpounding. Rennie pauses, working up the courage to look \n\tout at the lake again.\n\n\tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tThe ROWBOAT she saw earlier is still there, even closer \n\tnow.\n\n\tRENNIE'S PUPILS\n\n\tcontract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a \n\tFAINT VOICE BELOW HER...\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.)\n\t\tHhhhelp me...\n\n\tRennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and \n\tsees:\n\n\tAN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY \n\n\tfloundering in the water. It takes us only a moment to \n\trecognize him -- IT'S YOUNG JASON. He's gasping, sucking \n\tin huge amounts of liquid, exactly like he did in the \n\tprologue.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG JASON\n\t\tHhhhelp me....I'm drowning...\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tleans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tWhat's wrong, Rennie??\n\n\tRennie frantically points over the ramp edge, unable to \n\tspeak. Miss Van Deusen quickly looks and sees:\n\n\tMISS VAN DEUSEN'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tThe water is calm. No Young Jason.\n\n\tRETURN TO SHOT\n\n\tas Rennie gets a hold of herself.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tI just got a little dizzy. I'm fine.\n\n\tShe continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, \n\twatching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to \n\tMcCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tcontinues along the starboard side, not risking another \n\tglance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK \n\tHAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes \n\tfollowing her like a crazed raven.\n\n\tINT. BRIDGE - CLOSE ON HARPOON - DAY\n\n\tSharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged \n\tscaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. WIDEN to \n\treveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the \n\tcruise ship's bridge. Admiral Robertson and his CHIEF \n\tENGINEER are preparing for departure, checking the OMEGA \n\tsatellite computer as well as the LORAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tADMIRAL ROBERTSON\n\t\t\t(checking watch)\n\t\tLet's take in the brow.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF ENGINEER\n\t\tYes Sir.\n\t\t\t(into intercom phone.)\n\t\tTake in the gangway and single up all \n\t\tlines.\n\n\tSEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from \n\this Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tHello, Dad.\n\n\t\t\t\tMILES\n\t\tHey, Admiral Robertson. Love your \n\t\tship.\n\n\t\t\t\tADMIRAL ROBERTSON\n\t\tShe's a beauty, isn't she? I should've \n\t\tretired from the Navy ten years ago.\n\n\t\t\t\tMILES\n\t\tYou've really been generous to give us \n\t\tthis cruise. I know I speak for \n\t\teverybody on board.\n\n\tEverybody...with the possible exception of Sean. He \n\tavoids eye contact with his father.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tADMIRAL ROBERTSON\n\t\tHell, there's just twenty or so of you \n\t\t-- we only need a skeleton crew and \n\t\tit's a pleasure to sail her anyway.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBy the way, congratulations on winning \n\t\tthe intramural diving championships, \n\t\tMiles. I'm sure you made your old man \n\t\tproud.\n\n\tAdmiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean \n\tshould think about doing the same.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF ENGINEER\n\t\tHave you decided on your departure \n\t\tprotocol, Admiral?\n\n\t\t\t\tADMIRAL ROBERTSON\n\t\tActually, I thought I'd leave the \n\t\thonors to my son.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tDad, I don't think...\n\n\t\t\t\tADMIRAL ROBERTSON\n\t\t\t(to Chief Engineer, ignoring \n\t\t\tSean)\n\t\tRelinquishing command of the Princess \n\t\tRuby to Captain Sean Robertson.\n\n\tSean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his \n\tfriend's nervousness as well.\n\n\t\t\t\tADMIRAL ROBERTSON\n\t\tBut before you take the helm, take \n\t\tthis.\n\n\tHe tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a \n\tnavigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting \n\tnext to a rusty old sextant.\n\n\t\t\t\tADMIRAL ROBERTSON\n\t\tSomething old and something new. I \n\t\tused the sextant when I was your age, \n\t\tbut now they have these goddamn \n\t\tcomputers to do all the work for you.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF ENGINEER\n\t\t\t(to Sean)\n\t\tHave you decided on a plan of \n\t\tdeparture, Captain?\n\n\tSean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at \n\tthe LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tHow about if we start up the forward \n\t\tengines and come around. 180 \n\t\tdegrees...\n\n\t\t\t\tADMIRAL ROBERTSON\n\t\tAren't you forgetting something?\n\n\tSean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a \n\tlarge button, pressing it three times, piercing the air \n\twith three long blasts of the ship's horn. It \n\tunderscores his frustration.\n\n\t\t\t\tADMIRAL ROBERTSON\n\t\tWe're in foggy weather! Send out the \n\t\tinternational maritime signal that a \n\t\tvessel is backing down, followed by a \n\t\tsecurity broadcast warning other \n\t\tships!\n\n\tHe shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, \n\tleaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment \n\tfor Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits \n\tas well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, \n\tsaddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this \n\tway.\n\n\tEXT. DECK - ON SEAN\n\n\tas he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK \n\tHAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at \n\tSean.\n\n\t\t\t\tDECK HAND\n\t\tThis voyage is doomed.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tYeah, tell me about it.\n\n\tSean sidesteps him, moving on.\n\n\tEXT. HARBOR - DAY (CRANE SHOT)\n\n\tParents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as \n\tCAMERA RISES AND ROTATES to find eighteen or so teenagers \n\t1ining the upper deck, happily waving back. The ship \n\tbegins to slice through serene water. The voyage has \n\tbegun.\n\n\tCLOSER ON HULL\n\n\tThe water begins to ripple as the ship's speed increases. \n\tAll seems normal...until JASON'S HANDS APPEAR, CLINGING \n\tTO A LOOSE MOORING LINE DRAGGING IN THE WATER. He \n\tslithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog \n\tbreezes past him.\n\n\tEXT. DECK - DAY\n\n\tas Sean continues along, hands in pockets. He turns a \n\tcorner and collides with RENNIE, walking her dog. His \n\teyes instantly brighten, as do hers.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tRennie...\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tHi, Sean.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tI heard you weren't coming.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\t\t(glances at Toby)\n\t\tWe changed our minds.\n\n\tSean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause...they are \n\tobviously in the early stages-of a relationship. \n\tSean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small \n\tnecklace-sized box.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tI got you a present.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tBut I didn't get you one...\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tForget it. It's a dumb little thing \n\t\tanyway.\n\n\tRennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace \n\twith a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tSean...it's beautiful.\n\n\tSean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tI thought maybe we could hike to the \n\t\ttop of the Statue when we got there, \n\t\tif you felt like it. It's supposed to \n\t\tbe 22 stories tall.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tI'd love to.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH (O.S.)\n\t\tYour father was looking for you, Mr. \n\t\tRobertson.\n\n\tMcCulloch appears behind them. The mood has been broken.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tI guess I'll see you later.\n\n\tSean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out \n\tto the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she \n\tpsyches herself up to look.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tThere's a storm predicted tonight. \n\n\tRennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn \n\taway.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tYou're making a big mistake, Rennie. \n\t\tIt's not too late to put you back on \n\t\tland.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tI'm staying.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tIf Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you \n\t\twere of...\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tShe didn't push me into coming.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tWhy are you doing this to yourself?\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tI don't even know why I'm afraid, \n\t\tUncle Charles. I can't even remember \n\t\twhen it started. Don't you think it's \n\t\ttime I found out and got over it?\n\n\tHe takes a measured pause.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tFacing your fear doesn't always \n\t\tconquer it.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tI'm staying.\n\n\tHe's not going to change her mind.\n\n\tP.O.V. - RENNIE AND MCCULLOCH (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)\n\n\tthrough a porthole window...and through the viewfinder \n\tof a video camcorder. McCulloch shakes his head, turning \n\taway from Rennie and walking away. A sinister electric \n\tguitar solo screeches out. PAN with McCulloch as he \n\tpasses the window, coming around 180 degrees into a CLOSE \n\tUP of J.J. JARRETT, fingering a sleek Gibson \"Flying V.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.J.\n\t\t\t(into camera)\n\t\tIs this axe awesome or what?\n\n\tINT. J.J.'S STATEROOM - DAY\n\n\tas J.J., a female rocker in the vein of band \"Vixen,\" \n\tcontinues to wail on her guitar. She's wearing a black \n\tleather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. Holding \n\tthe camcorder is WAYNE WEBBER, MTV-acclimated, wearing \n\tthe latest hip prescription glasses.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAYNE\n\t\tToo cool, J.J. Your parents came \n\t\tthrough.\n\n\tShe pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.J.\n\t\tNo lie. I hear there's a big power \n\t\troom down below where I can get \n\t\tsupreme concert hall echo. Come down \n\t\tand shoot a basement tape on me, okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tWAYNE\n\t\tSure...but I gotta shoot some \n\t\tshockumentary footage first.\n\n\tHe avoids eye contact when he says it. She gives him a \n\tlook.\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.J.\n\t\tMan, don't tell me you're still trying \n\t\tto scam on Tamara...\n\n\tHis non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him, \n\tgrabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.J.\n\t\tHow long have we known each other? \n\t\tDon't be a dweeb, Wayne. She's not \n\t\tinterested in you, only what you can \n\t\tdo for her. She's a user.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAYNE\n\t\tShe's sexy.\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.J.\n\t\tSo's this guitar. So what?\n\n\t\t\t\tWAYNE\n\t\tI'll catch you later.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\tHe exits. She mumbles something under her breath, coiling \n\tup her amp cord.\n\n\tINT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING WITH WAYNE\n\n\tas he walks onward. DROP DOWN to find his FEET as he \n\tpasses a DARK ALCOVE...which happens to have SLIMY \n\tFOOTPRINTS AND SEAWEED leading into it. Camera FOLLOWS \n\tthe footprints, RISING again and with dim recognition, \n\tour eyes fall on JASON. Lurking in the shadows. But not \n\tfor long.\n\n\tINT. POWER ROOM - DAY\n\n\tMassive, very dark, backlit steam seeping from a maze of \n\tpipes overhead. No windows. A wall of circuit breakers \n\tand voltage meters decorate one wall, quietly humming \n\tgenerators on the opposite side. J.J. appears with her \n\tguitar, amp and ghetto blaster, appreciative of the \n\tsurroundings.\n\n\t\t\t\tJ.J.\n\t\tThis place is aching for a video. \n\t\tWayne, you're an asshole.\n\n\tShe finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment.\n\n\tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tWe're peering at J.J. predatorially through the steam, \n\tmoving through it, behind the generators.\n\n\tJ.J.\n\n\tpops a cassette into her blaster, jamming the \"play\" \n\tbutton. A loud rock 'n roll rhythm track blasts out.\n\n\tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tmoving around the generators, eyeing her sleek leather \n\tpants as she bends over to plug in her axe.\n\n\tTIGHT ON ELECTRIC GUITAR\n\n\tas J.J. snaps the male end of the plug into the female. \n\treceptacle.\n\n\tJASON'S FACE\n\n\tappears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes.\n\t\t\t\t\n\tJ.J.\n\n\tscreams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with \n\ther playback. The generators are causing a breeze which \n\tmakes her hair dance, steam flowing between her legs. \n\tShe's lost in her music, building to a crescendo, bending \n\tthe high \"E\" string above the upper octave fret. She \n\topens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees:\n\n\tJASON\n\n\temerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.\n\n\tEXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME\n\n\tas J.J.'s SCREAM echoes from an exhaust duct. WHIP PAN to \n\tfind the crazed DECK HAND standing just below it, \n\treacting with dread. He's the only one who has heard it.\n\n\tINT. POWER ROOM - SAME TIME\n\n\tas Jason tears the guitar off her body, raising it in the \n\tair like a hatchet. The horrified girl flees down a \n\tnarrow maze of steel steps, forced back against a \n\tgenerator with nowhere to go. PUSH IN on her face for one \n\tlast look at her before:\n\n\tJASON\n\n\tswings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.\n\n\tEXT. UPPER DECK - SAME TIME\n\n\tas the Deck Hand flinches upon the thick, dull sound of \n\ther demise, followed by discordant feedback from her \n\tguitar...and eventual silence. He reaches into his breast \n\tpocket, his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of \n\tEarly Times.\n\n\tEXT. OCEAN - NIGHT (EFX)\n\n\tas LIGHTNING FLASHES over a gray, choppy sea. A storm is \n\timminent. The Princess Ruby finally appears, cutting \n\tthrough whitecaps, no land in sight.\n\n\tCLOSE UP - INK DIP PEN\n\n\tas Rennie's hand carefully dips it in India ink, moving \n\tto a blank page in her journal. She hesitates for several \n\tbeats.\n\n\tINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tNo inspiration. She puts down the pen, looking at her \n\tdog, who's curled up on the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tWhat do you think...time for some \n\t\tpersonal experiences to fuel our \n\t\tminds?\n\n\tThe dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tI agree.\n\n\tRennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and \n\tsome black satin pants.\n\n\tEXT. OUTSIDE DECK - SAME TIME\n\n\tWind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of \n\tdecorative flags. One of them flaps back...AND EXPOSES \n\tJASON.\n\n\tTHROUGH JASON'S EYES (FLYING WALL EFX)\n\n\tas the flag whips our faces. We MOVE through it, down the \n\tempty passageway, coming to a porthole window. Rennie's \n\twindow. We peer through it with unnerving intensity at \n\tthe backside of Rennie as she pulls off her T-shirt, \n\tslipping on the blouse. Camera continues through the \n\ttiny round window, floating across the room, over Toby \n\tand the bed...until we're INCHES FROM THE BACK OF \n\tRENNIE'S HEAD. She suddenly spins around in fright, \n\tfacing us point-blank, and:\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE\n\n\tNobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's \n\tsomething surreal about the window...\n\n\tTIGHT ON PORTHOLE WINDOW (EFX)\n\n\tEmpty grayness...then EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON FLOATS UP FROM \n\tBELOW, BUBBLES ESCAPING FROM HIS LIPS. The porthole has \n\tbecome a window into the depths of Crystal Lake.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tfeels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:\n\n\tDOG TOBY\n\n\tbegins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door, \n\tscratching to get out.\n\n\tRENNIE'S EYES\n\n\tare distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back \n\tat the porthole, she sees:\n\n\tAN EMPTY WINDOW\n\n\tNo water, no drowning boy.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tsnaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is \n\tfrantically clawing with his fur up.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tOkay Toby, calm down...\n\n\tShe's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie \n\tcloses the curtains on her window, then steps to her \n\tdoor. She swings the door open for Toby...and exposes \n\tan empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room, \n\tdashing off down the hall, snarling.\n\n\tINT. SHIP CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\n\tas Toby runs straight toward us. PAN with him as he \n\trushes around a corner, leading us into a view of TAMARA \n\tand EVA, disappearing down a staircase.\n\n\tINT. MENS GYM - DAY\n\n\tA strong seventeen year-old black kid, JULIUS GAW, is \n\tgoing a few rounds with another senior boy who's clearly \n\tlosing the boxing match. Julius dances around him on the \n\tmat like he's Mike Tyson, several other boys cheering \n\tthem on.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE - LOCKER ROOM WINDOW\n\n\tas Tamara and Eva step into view. Eva glances around, \n\tfeeling out of place in the men's locker room.\n\n\t\t\t\tEVA\n\t\tI'm not sure we're supposed to be \n\t\there, Tamara.\n\n\tA couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But \n\tTamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against \n\tthe glass, watching Julius.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAMARA\n\t\tIs that a muscular bod or what?\n\n\tTamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her \n\tinstead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a \n\tleft-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud. \n\tJulius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked \n\tsmile.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAMARA\n\t\tHe's undefeated, you know that?\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tJulius is the only senior I'd even \n\t\tconsider doing it with. If he wasn't \n\t\tblack, that is.\n\n\t\t\t\tEVA\n\t\t\t(awkward)\n\t\tMy parents are open minded about that \n\t\tsort of thing.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAMARA\n\t\tMy stepmom couldn't care less, but \n\t\tDaddy would have a shit fit.\n\t\t\t(lets it slip out)\n\t\tHe might even pay some attention to \n\t\tme.\n\n\tTamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting \n\tsomething.\n\n\t\t\t\tTAMARA\n\t\tGorgeous guy at ten o'clock.

Is it Jason now wearing the uniform?? When he's \n\tabout two feet away from him...\n\n\tSEAN\n\n\treaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his \n\tfather BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT.

EXERCISE ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\twhere Julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes, \n\tincluding Miles and Wayne.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS\n\t\tI managed to scrounge this shit from \n\t\tthe game room and hallways.

STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tas McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging \n\ther door open.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tCan't we at least talk about it?\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tI refuse to discuss this ridiculous \n\t\tnotion that a ghoul is terrorizing \n\t\tthis ship.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tBut what about the drowning boy I've \n\t\tbeen seeing?\n\n\tHe avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering \n\ther across the threshold. She's standing inside her room \n\tnow; he's in the hallway.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tWhatever you've been...imagining... \n\t\thas nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI want you to be safe, Rennie.

She pounds on it from the other \n\tside.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE (O.S.)\n\t\tUncle Charles!\n\n\tHe ignores her, briskly walking away.\n\n\tINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME\n\n\tas she throws her fists against the door a final time, \n\trealizing it's futile.\n\n\tINT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tSteam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing \n\tpipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks. He's holding \n\tthe skeet rifle under one arm, using the sun gun off his \n\tvideo camera to guide him.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAYNE\n\t\tJ.J. -- you down here?\n\n\tCLOSER ANGLE\n\n\tas Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the \n\tprecarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares \n\tthe crap out of him, causing him to stumble.\n\n\tINSERT - WAYNE'S GLASSES (SECOND UNIT)\n\n\t--They slip off the bridge of his nose, skittering down \n\tthrough the catwalk and pipes to God knows where.\n\n\tWAYNE\n\n\tlies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his \n\tbleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself \n\tto a standing position again.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAYNE\n\t\tWe got a major problem, Wayne.\n\n\tWAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tHis vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than \n\tcrisp images. He raises the gun and continues unsteadily \n\tforward.\n\n\tPOINT OF VIEW THROUGH GRID WORK\n\n\tas Wayne inches forward. Camera slowly PANS INTO A \n\tPROFILE OF JASON, watching him from a catbird seat.\n\n\tWAYNE\n\n\ttakes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs \n\tleading down to the next level. And when he arrives \n\tthere...\n\n\tWAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW\n\n\t...A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A \n\tKNIFE.\n\n\tWAYNE\n\n\tinstantly raises the rifle and FIRES...\n\n\tWAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW\n\n\t...and the body goes down. He's hit him!\n\n\tWAYNE\n\n\tstands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, \n\tlooking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to \n\tadjust the eyepiece diaptor.\n\n\tWAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)\n\n\tas the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus, \n\tfinally becoming crisp. WAYNE HAS SHOT A CREW MEMBER -- \n\tthe same good looking one Tamara and Eva ogled earlier. \n\tHe's holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set, \n\tnot a knife.\n\n\tWAYNE\n\n\tslowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his \n\tthroat.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAYNE\n\t\tNo...\n\n\tHe raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will \n\treveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.\n\n\tWAYNE'S POINT OF VIEW (B & W/VIEWFINDER MATTE)\n\n\tHe gets half his wish: a HOCKEY MASK NOW FILLS HIS \n\tFRAME...but Jason is far from dead. Wayne catches a split-\n\tsecond glimpse of Jason's fist coming towards him, then \n\tthe camera is KNOCKED FROM HIS EYE AND THE WORLD BECOMES \n\tDARK AND BLURRY.\n\n\tWAYNE\n\n\tscreams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips, \n\tpicking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs. \n\tWayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over \n\tsomething, bringing with it a harsh strum from an \n\tELECTRIC GUITAR.\n\n\tANGLE - WAYNE'S FEET\n\n\tSure enough, his left shoe is resting on the pickups of a \n\tblood-streaked Gibson Flying V.\n\n\tTIGHT ON WAYNE\n\n\t--sprawled out on the metal floor. He gropes around, his \n\thands feeling something. It sends chills from his groin \n\tup through his scalp.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAYNE\n\t\tNo no no...\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE\n\n\tWayne's hands are touching J.J.'S BLOODY FACE, A LARGE \n\tCRACK IN HER SKULL. He doesn't have time to scream or cry \n\tbecause\n\n\tJASON\n\n\thoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:\n\n\tTHE SHIP CIRCUIT PANEL (EFX)\n\n\twhich shorts out with a fanfare of ELECTRICAL SPARKS \n\tAND FIRE, INSTANTLY FRYING WAYNE.\n\n\tINT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME\n\n\tas the overhead lights briefly flicker, then resume \n\tnormal operation. Sean stands opposite the navigational \n\tchart, ping-ponging between it and the ship's \n\tcomputers as Miss Van Deusen paces nervously.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tWhat was that??\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\t\t(very worried)\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\t\t(trying not to panic)\n\t\tWhat happens if we don't get control \n\t\tof the ship, Sean?

You'd think he'd be able \n\t\tto operate this thing!\n\n\tSean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind \n\tand temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of \n\tSean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He \n\tchecks the Omega and LORAN.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tWell?\n\n\tSean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm. \n\tHis father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the \n\twheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of \n\tbuttons on the console.\n\n\tCLOSE UP - WALL OF BUTTONS\n\n\tWe PAN across them, stopping on one labeled \"FIRE ALARM - \n\tDO NOT BREAK EXCEPT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.\" Camera \n\tcontinues around to find we are in the POWER ROOM, NOT on \n\tthe bridge. Our vision suddenly lands on JASON, staring \n\tat the alarm button, considering. He glances back over \n\this shoulder.\n\n\tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)\n\n\tWayne's body is NOW ON FIRE...AND THE BLAZE IS SPREADING \n\tTHROUGH THE ROOM.\n\n\tINT. BRIDGE - SAME TIME\n\n\tas Sean makes up his mind, flipping several toggle \n\tswitches.\n\n\tINSERT - AUTO PILOT COMPUTER\n\n\tas Sean flips the last toggle and a green light \n\tilluminates, indicating the AUTO PILOT is in effect.\n\n\tRETURN TO SHOT\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tIt worked...we're back on course!\n\n\tSean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated. Miss Van \n\tDeuten immediately embraces him. But a fraction of time \n\tlater:\n\n\tTIGHT ON FIRE ALARM BUTTON\n\n\tJason's fist SMASHES the alarm button...\n\n\tINT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS\n\n\t...and a LOUD SIREN cries out across the entire vessel. \n\tThe blood drains from Sean's face.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tWhat's that?\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tThe fire alarm...\n\n\tVARIOUS ANGLES ON BOARD SHIP - NIGHT\n\n\tas the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck, hallways \n\tand corridors, giving Julius, Miles and Wayne deep \n\tpause for thought.\n\n\tINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - SAME TIME\n\n\tas the alarm bombards Rennie's ears like everybody \n\telse's. She hurries to her curtained porthole window, \n\tworking up the energy to look outside. Rennie gets a grip \n\ton them, FLINGING THEM OPEN. The DECK HAND'S CRAZED FACE \n\tIS GAZING BACK AT HER. Rennie screams; a second later he \n\thurries off.\n\n\tINT. BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\n\tas McCulloch tears open a cabinet door labeled EMERGENCY \n\tFLARE GUN. The siren continues to blast.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tCan you shut that damn thing off??\n\n\tSean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around \n\tfor the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees \n\tMcCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tWe already thought of that -- nobody \n\t\tcould possibly see it in this storm...\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULIACH\n\t\tThere's only one person who needs to \n\t\tsee it. And I'm going to find him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tWhat about the fire??\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tI doubt very much that one even \n\t\texists.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS VAN DEUSEN\n\t\tWhat are you talking about?\n\n\t\t\t\tMCCULLOCH\n\t\tUse some common sense! Setting off a \n\t\tfire alarm causes panic...the same \n\t\tkind of panic caused by suggesting \n\t\tJason Voorhees is on board.\n\t\t\t(resolved)\n\t\tEnough is enough. \n\n\tHe marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill \n\tswitch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He \n\tgrabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van \n\tDeusen.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tWe have to get everybody together just \n\t\tin case the fire's for real.\n\n\tSean heads for the door, shoving it forward.\n\n\tEXT.

TRACK with him as he treads along \n\tthe side of the ship, skeet rifle raised.\n\n\tJULIUS' POINT OF VIEW\n\n\twalking past the lifeboat stations, the wind and \n\tprecipitation battering the small boats. With no warning, \n\tAN OBSCURE FIGURE LEAPS OUT, GRIPPING AN AXE.\n\n\tJULIUS\n\n\tshoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes \n\tinstantaneous aim...but he doesn't shoot. He slowly \n\tlowers the rifle.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tas MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out \n\tof each other.\n\n\t\t\t\tMILES\n\t\tI'll take the upper deck.\n\n\tJulius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the \n\tsmoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent...\n\n\tINT. POWER ROOM - NIGHT (EFX)\n\n\tFilled with black smoke. The fire is spreading \n\tdangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel \n\tpump, leading to tanks below. A sign over them reads: \n\tDANGER - FUEL TANKS.\n\n\tEXT. DECK POOL - NIGHT\n\n\t--steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it. \n\tMiles appears, climbing a ladder to the upper deck level.\n\n\tPOINT OF VIEW THROUGH LADDER\n\n\tSomeone is spying on Miles from below, watching his every \n\tstep.\n\n\tEXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tas Miles arrives, axe raised. He pauses to regard his \n\tsurroundings, then moves on. RACK FOCUS TO FIND JASON \n\tRIGHT BEHIND HIM, having followed Miles up the stairs.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tOnly darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles \n\tmaterializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. \n\tHe passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back \n\tof his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS \n\tINTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS \n\tAROUND, RAISING THE AXE, BRINGING IT DOWN ON JASON'S \n\tHEAD...\n\n\t...but Jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes \n\tcontact, flinging it away.\n\n\tEXT. LOWER DECK - ON JULIUS\n\n\tHe's pacing along when a clattering noise from above \n\tmakes him stop. Suddenly MILES' AXE THUDS INTO THE \n\tMAHOGANY DECK NEXT TO HIS FOOT. Julius gazes at it, \n\tjerking his head upward.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS\n\t\tMiles??\n\n\tHis answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same \n\ttime:\n\n\tRUNNING WITH MILES\n\n\tHe's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery \n\tdeck as the monster relentlessly pursues him.\n\n\tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tHe's having no problem catching up to the defenseless \n\tteenager.\n\n\tEXT. DECK STAIRS - SAME TIME\n\n\tas Julius zooms up them to aid his comrade.\n\n\tEXT. RADAR MAST - NIGHT\n\n\tas Miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it. He \n\tglances downward and sees:\n\n\tMILES' POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tJason is right at his heels.\n\n\tMILES\n\n\tslips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward. \n\tHe makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost \n\tpoint when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM \n\tOFF THE MAST.\n\n\tSTUNT FREEFALL\n\n\tMiles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting \n\tand twisting like he's doing one of his better dives...\n\n\tCLOSE UP - MILES' FACE  \n\n\t...Empty space for a half-second, then MILES' FACE JOLTS \n\tINTO FRAME with a look of ultimate agony. Something has \n\tabruptly stopped his fall. Something quite fatal.\n\n\tEXT. DECK - ON JULIUS\n\n\tcoming around a corner, stopping dead in his tracks, his \n\tstomach wrenching as his eyes fall on:\n\n\tMILES (EFX)\n\n\t...who is staring right back at him with dead pupils. \n\tMILES HAS BEEN HORRIBLY IMPALED OM A SHIP FLAGPOLE.\n\n\tJULIUS\n\n\tdoesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because \n\tJASON'S HAND GRIPS HIS SHOULDER, SPINS HIM AROUND AND \n\tSLUGS HIM SQUARELY IN THE FACE. The force of it sends the \n\tboxer REELING BACKWARDS OFF THE RAILING...\n\n\tEXT. STORMY OCEAN (TANK)\n\n\t...and Julius SPLASHES INTO THE ROUGH SEA. He's quickly \n\tswallowed by the torrential waters.\n\n\tINT. RENNIE'S STATEROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tas Rennie's HAND jiggles her doorknob again, confirming \n\tthat it's locked tight. RISE to find her desperate face; \n\tshe begins furiously pacing and we DOLLY BEHIND HER \n\t...but Rennie stops cold upon hearing:\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG JASON (O.S.)\n\t\tHhhhelp....me....\n\n\tRennie whirls into a CLOSE UP, staring with disbelief at:\n\n\tYOUNG JASON (EFX)\n\n\t...who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom, his \n\thands reaching out to her. But then comes the \n\tinexplicable: THE OVAL RUG TURNS INTO LAKE WATER AND \n\tJASON SINKS INTO IT. He's drowning in the middle of her \n\troom, choking on murky water.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG JASON\n\t\tHhhhelp me....I'm drowning...\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tstands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a \n\tmagnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a \n\tdeep lake, and extends her arms to him.\n\n\tYOUNG JASON\n\n\tgrabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tfeels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her \n\teyes expanding because she's now looking at:\n\n\tHERSELF!\n\n\tRennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger \n\tin a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG RENNIE\n\t\tHhhhelp....me....\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tscreams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, \n\twatching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.\n\n\tYOUNG RENNIE\n\n\tdisappears under the surface of the water...which seconds \n\tlater CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.\n\n\tNEW ANGLE\n\n\tas Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face, \n\tutterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her \n\tporthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH \n\tTHE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles, \n\tgasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.\n\n\tCLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND\n\n\tgroping for a weapon to stop him, her fingers skittering \n\tacross her table like a spider.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - RENNIE AND JASON\n\n\tHer head is pulled taut against the wall just below the \n\tporthole, with Jason's hideous mask framed in the \n\tcircular shattered window. She's slowly dying.\n\n\tCLOSE ON RENNIE'S HAND\n\n\tHer movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system. But \n\tRennie's fingers miraculously find a recognizable object: \n\tthe ink-dip pen given to her by Miss Van Deusen.

Jason \n\tinstantly releases her, reeling backwards.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tsinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far \n\taway from the porthole as possible. She makes it across \n\tthe room to her stateroom door just as:\n\n\tTHE DOOR\n\n\tis SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

Julius grips Jason's scaly \n\tarm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey \n\tmask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all \n\this strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running \n\tout the door. The phone is left dangling.\n\n\tRUNNING WITH JULIUS (HAND HELD)\n\n\twith no apparent direction. Literally running for his \n\tlife.\n\n\tTRACKING WITH JASON\n\n\tHe's just as quick, but smoother and more methodical.\n\n\tJULIUS' POINT OF VIEW (HAND HELD)\n\n\theading up the alley, spotting a fire escape, diverting \n\this course straight for it.\n\n\tANGLE - FIRE ESCAPE\n\n\tas Julius LEAPS ONTO IT, dragging himself up, climbing as \n\tfast as is humanly possible.\n\n\tANGLE - JASON\n\n\t...but Jason is-far from human, easily negotiating the \n\twrought-iron stairs and rapidly catching up.\n\n\tEXT.

No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns \n\tback to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for \n\tthe fight of his life. He whispers to himself:\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS\n\t\tUse the combos and keep the feet \n\t\tlight...\n\n\tTHE FIGHT BEGINS, man against monster, each sizing the \n\tother up. \n\tJason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him \n\tand countering with left-right-left combination. They \n\thave absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round \n\tof kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself \n\tbeing forced back against the rings, which in this case \n\tis the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and \n\tsees:\n\n\tJULIUS' POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tIt's a long, rough way down. It's do or die time.\n\n\tRETURN TO SCENE\n\n\tas Julius SLAMS PUNCH AFTER PUNCH INTO JASON, forcing him \n\tback to the center of the rooftop, spending every last \n\tounce of his energy in doing so. He throws one more \n\tfeeble punch, knowing it's his last.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIUS\n\t\tTake your best shot, motherfucker...\n\n\tJason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a \n\tpunch none of us expected...\n\n\tJULIUS' HEAD (EFX)\n\n\tgets literally knocked off his shoulders, cascading off \n\tthe edge of the rooftop, and:\n\n\tANGLE - SLANTED LOWER ROOF\n\n\t--the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below, \n\trolling down towards street level and falling into a \n\tgarbage-filled dumpster.\n\n\tEXT.

Sean boosts Rennie up, starting to climb up himself \n\twhen:\n\n\tJASON\n\n\tfires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. \n\tRennie screams as Sean is dragged down...but he manages \n\tto latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. \n\tJason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as \n\tRennie watches helplessly.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tNO!!!\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\truns straight towards the track pit like a football \n\tpunter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON \n\tSQUARELY IN THE FACE.\n\n\tJASON (EFX)\n\n\ttrips backwards and LANDS ON THE THIRD, ELECTRIFIED RAIL, \n\tRECEIVING TEN THOUSAND VOLTS. His body smokes and \n\tconvulses, finally sizzling out. He appears to be \n\tterminated!!!\n\n\tANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE\n\n\tas they get to their feet, holding each other tight, \n\tlooking down on the now-dead undead creature.\n\n\tEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.) (CRANE SHOT)\n\n\tas our heroes arise into the neon-filled big city \n\twonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the \n\tawesome spectacle known as Times Square. A huge DIGITAL \n\tCLOCK tells us it's a quarter to midnight. Sean wraps his \n\tarm around her.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tIt's over, Rennie. It's finally over.\n\n\tCamera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. \n\tGuess who has just made an encore...with more energy \n\tthan ever!!!\n\n\tSEAN AND RENNIE\n\n\tlook all around them, having never been to a city as big \n\tas this. They finally turn far enough around to spot \n\tJASON in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer \n\tthan the last.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tGod...please no...\n\n\tBut Jason keeps on coming.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tSomebody help us!! He's going to kill \n\t\tus!!!\n\n\tBut the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, \n\tbustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to \n\tflee again.\n\n\tJASON\n\n\tshoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; \n\tthey've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. \n\tHe moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some \n\trap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates \n\ttheir stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull \n\tout switchblades and chains.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTREET URCHIN\n\t\tYou're dead meat, slime bag.\n\n\tJason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He \n\thas blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred \n\tfrom the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask, \n\tfacing them squarely.\n\n\tTIGHT ON STREET URCHINS\n\n\tas Jason's mask comes off out-of-frame. Their tough faces \n\tturn to putty, scared completely shitless.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTREET URCHIN\n\t\tHey man, it's cool, it's cool...\n\n\tThey turn tail and race like the wind. Jason steps \n\tforward so that we're looking at the back of his head, \n\tnever seeing his naked face. He slips his hockey mask on \n\tagain, turns into a CLOSE UP, then exits.\n\n\tINT. TIMES SQUARE DINER - NIGHT\n\n\tfilled with noise, smoke and derelicts. A tough, \n\tredheaded WAITRESS with a thick Brooklyn accent stands \n\tbehind the countertop, a wall of mirrors behind her. The \n\tfront door bangs open with the entrance of Sean and \n\tRennie, rushing up to the waitress.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\t\t(out of breath)\n\t\tYou have to call the police...\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tPlease, hurry...\n\n\tA telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAITRESS\n\t\tThere's a pay phone in back.\n\n\tThey start to run.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAITRESS\n\t\t...but it's broken.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tYou don't understand -- there's a \n\t\tmaniac trying to kill us!!!\n\n\t\t\t\tWAITRESS\n\t\t\t(blase)\n\t\tWelcome to New York.\n\n\tThere's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES \n\tTHROUGH THE DINER DOOR, MOWING A PATH STRAIGHT TOWARDS \n\tTHEM. Sean and Rennie run out the back as the Waitress \n\teyes Jason with complete disbelief.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tas the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS \n\tHIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE JUKEBOX.\n\n\tTHE WAITRESS\n\n\tpicks up the telephone, really pissed off.\n\n\tA BIKER\n\n\tclimbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE \n\tKNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS \n\tJASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it \n\tout, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing \n\taway.\n\n\tTHE WAITRESS\n\n\tstops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.\n\n\tJASON\n\n\tlifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO \n\tTHE MIRROR OVER THE COUNTER.\n\n\tTHE WAITRESS\n\n\tfeels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her \n\tmouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as \n\tshe can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out \n\tthe back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons \n\tshrink from him.\n\n\tINT. REAR OF DINER - SAME TIME\n\n\tas Sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains, \n\tfinally getting the back door open and springing into:\n\n\tEXT. DEAD END ALLEY - NIGHT\n\n\tThey run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a \n\tdead end. Sean and Rennie start to head back the other \n\tway when JASON MOWS OUT FROM THE DINER DOOR. Their vision \n\tscatters everywhere in search of a retreat...\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tLook!\n\n\tShe's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They \n\thaven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the \n\tcover back as Jason comes forth.\n\n\tINT. SEWER - ENTRANCE CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n\tas they descend into hell...a massive chamber consisting \n\tof tall columns, slimy catacombs and three feet of \n\tstagnant water. Their alternatives are nil; Sean and \n\tRennie join hands, wading through the swill, splashing \n\tdeeper into the labyrinth.\n\n\tANGLE UP STAIRS\n\n\tas the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is \n\teclipsed by JASON, making his way down after them.\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL #1 - NIGHT\n\n\tAn oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness. \n\tDim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery \n\trust formations. Rennie and Sean appear at the far end, \n\twading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us.\n\n\tTRACKING SHOT\n\n\tas they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, \n\tstrangers in a very strange land.\n\n\tANGLE - THEIR FEET\n\n\tsloshing through the slime. All is silent until Sean's \n\tfoot TRIPS OVER A BARREL labeled HUGHES CHEMICAL PLANT. \n\tA vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of \n\tthe container, sizzling on the around.\n\n\tSEAN AND RENNIE\n\n\tcarefully sidestep it, continuing on. They make it \n\tanother ten yards when A FIGURE LEAPS OUT FROM AN ALCOVE, \n\tGRIPPING A HUGE WRENCH. Rennie's scream echoes through \n\tthe tunnel.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE\n\n\t...but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers \n\tthe wrench, as frightened as they are.\n\n\t\t\t\tSANITATION ENGINEER\n\t\tWhat the hell are you kids doing down \n\t\there?\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tCan you help us get out??\n\n\t\t\t\tSANITATION ENGINEER\n\t\tI sure can and we don't have a minute \n\t\tto waste.\n\n\tHe begins quickly packing up his tools.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tSANITATION ENGINEER\n\t\tToxic waste, son. This sewer floods \n\t\tout with the stuff on the 13th of \n\t\tevery month, right at midnight.\n\t\t\t(checks watch)\n\t\tAnd that's less than ten minutes from \n\t\tnow.\n\n\tRennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, \n\tswallowing hard.\n\n\t\t\t\tSANITATION ENGINEER\n\t\tFollow me.\n\n\tHe clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly \n\tleads them down:\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL #2\n\n\t...no less threatening than the one they just left. When \n\tthey pass a lightless intersecting corridor, JASON EJECTS \n\tHIMSELF FROM IT, TACKLING THE SANITATION ENGINEER AND \n\tSEAN.\n\n\tTHE FLASHLIGHT\n\n\trolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically \n\tacross the polluted walls.\n\n\tTHE SANITATION ENGINEER\n\n\tbegins BASHING JASON'S HEAD IN WITH HIS WRENCH but the \n\tmonster drags the kicking and screaming man into TUNNEL \n\t#3.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\ttries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the \n\topposite wall, barely conscious.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tRun, Rennie...\n\n\tShe's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel \n\t#3, seeing:\n\n\tA GRUESOME SHADOW ON THE WALL\n\n\tJason arches his back with wrench in hand, hammering it \n\tover and over into the Sanitation Engineer's skull.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tbacks away but does not run. The time has come to face \n\ther fears.\n\n\tANGLE - SHADOW ON TUNNEL #3 WALL\n\n\tas Jason takes one more vengeful stroke, finishing him \n\toff. He steps from Tunnel #3 with the scarlet-coated \n\ttool, his shadow becoming flesh. He moves straight for \n\tSean, who has no hope for escape. Jason cocks the wrench \n\tover Sean's skull...and suddenly his hockey mask is \n\tSPLASHED WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT. Jason stops, turning \n\tdirectly into it.\n\n\tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tRennie is blinding us with the sanitation Engineer's \n\tflashlight, giving us only brief glimpses of herself in \n\tthe reflective wet surroundings.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tYou never got me in the lake, Jason. \n\t\tAnd you're not going to get me now \n\t\teither.\n\n\tHer voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the \n\tirritating light never leaving us.\n\n\tJASON\n\n\thas been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.\n\n\tJASON'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tas the bright beam leaves our eyes, Rennie dashing down \n\tthe intersecting tunnel (#1).\n\n\tTIGHT ON JASON'S FEET\n\n\tstomping through the sludge, picking up speed. He's \n\twanted to kill Rennie most of all.\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL #L\n\n\tas Rennie dashes up to the HUGHES CHEMICAL DRUM Sean \n\ttripped over, using the back end of the flashlight to \n\tcrush in the can's rusted lid. The metal is flimsy but \n\tstill resists her blows. She frantically hammers harder.\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL #2 - TRACKING WITH JASON\n\n\tHe's moving like a freight train now, an addict rolling \n\tafter his fix.\n\n\tINSERT - CHEMICAL DRUM\n\n\tas the butt of the flashlight dents the metal, ultimately \n\tcausing it to cave in.\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION - JASON'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\t--Looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into \n\tTunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of Rennie \n\tflinging the contents of the oil drum. A half second \n\tlater a WAVE OF GRAY/GREEN LIQUID FLIES AT US...\n\n\tTIGHT ON JASON (SLOW MOTION)\n\n\tand his hockey mask is SPLASHED WITH TOXIC WASTE, \n\tSEEPING INTO HIS MASK'S EYE SLITS. He careens back as if \n\ther were a rabid dog receiving a load of point-blank \n\tbuckshot.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tdrops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.\n\n\tCLOSE UP - JASON (EFX)\n\n\tas the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the \n\tplastic beginning to bubble and melt. RUSH INTO A TIGHT \n\tCLOSE UP AS JASON TEARS OFF HIS MASK, EXPOSING HIS \n\tHIDEOUS FACE: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the \n\tchemical. Worms slithering out his nostrils. And his \n\teyes...or lack thereof. They're like two raw quail eggs \n\tfrying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just \n\tbroke, running down his face.\n\n\tCLOSE ON FLASHLIGHT\n\n\tas the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp. RISE \n\tTO FIND RENNIE'S FACE, reacting to the stomach-turning \n\tsight of Jason's visage. She grabs hold of her senses and \n\tRUNS.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tas Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH \n\tHER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward \n\tSean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come \n\taround 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way \n\tready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL #2\n\n\tas Rennie skids up to Sean, still dazed. She grabs him, \n\tshaking hard.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tGet up, Sean!!!\n\n\tHis eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable \n\tterror registers in her ears...A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING \n\tSOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the \n\tdirection of her planned retreat:\n\n\tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n\tAn ominously empty tunnel, soon to be filled with the \n\tunthinkable. The sound of RUSHING LIQUID is growing at \n\tleaps and bounds.\n\n\tTIGHT ON RENNIE\n\n\tas her trembling chin rises, looking at:\n\n\tANGLE - TUNNEL #3 CEILING (EFX)\n\n\tThe dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from \n\tthe approaching flood.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\trotates her head and sees:\n\n\tJASON\n\n\tvision or no vision, he is lurching towards her \n\trelentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell \n\tand high water.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tdrags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed \n\twoman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to \n\tthe intersecting alcove wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tClimb!!!\n\n\tShe shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning \n\teverything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare \n\tback down the tunnel...\n\n\tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)\n\n\tThe overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake \n\thas just hit; the liquid will be arriving any second. Her \n\tvision WHIP PANS 180 DEGREES TO FIND JASON APPROACHING \n\tFROM THE OPPOSITE END, groping around with his scaly arms \n\tlike the claws of a roto-tiller.\n\n\tANGLE - LADDER\n\n\tas Rennie starts up after Sean, looking down and seeing:\n\n\tJASON\n\n\twithin ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder \n\tlike he's working on some kind of radar.\n\n\tRENNIE\n\n\tslips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and \n\trushing higher. She takes her final glance into the \n\ttunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as \n\tshe sees:\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)\n\n\tA million gallons of green-brown toxic waste splash into \n\tthe far intersection, FILLING THE TUNNEL, FLOODING \n\tSTRAIGHT FOR CAMERA.\n\n\tJASON\n\n\thas just started to climb the ladder when the wind and \n\tsmell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His \n\tdecomposed head swivels to face:\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)\n\n\tTons of lethal sewage, stopping for no one. Arriving in \n\tseconds.\n\n\tJASON'S FINAL CLOSE UP (EFX/FIBER OPTIC LENS)\n\n\tHe doesn't need vision to confirm what his other senses \n\talready know. Jason's mouth begins to quaver...AND THE \n\tFIRST WORDS HE HAS EVER SPOKEN COME OUT, IN THE VOICE OF \n\tAN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY:\n\n\t\t\t\tJASON\n\t\tMmmmmmmmmommy...DON'T LET ME DROWN, \n\t\tMOMMY...\n\n\tCamera speeds toward his gaping mouth and DOWN HIS THROAT \n\tas lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides. We \n\tsink deeper into his guts, fire and smoke flaring into \n\tour eves, eventually coming to a WELL IN THE PIT OF HIS \n\tSTOMACH, FILLED WITH BLOOD...and EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON IS \n\tDROWNING IN IT.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG JASON\n\t\tHhhhelp me....\n\n\tA split second later:\n\n\tEXT. TUNNEL #3 (EFX) (SLOW MOTION)\n\n\tThe wall of deadly toxic liquid ENGULFS JASON.\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL #3 - ON RENNIE AND SEAN (EFX)\n\n\tThe powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches \n\tbelow Rennie's feet, the force of it fiercely shaking \n\ttheir rusty support. They are clinging to the ladder with \n\ttheir eyes squeezed shut. Praying for survival.\n\n\tINT. TUNNEL #3 (MODEL EFX)\n\n\tWe are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage, rushing over \n\tand under us.\n\n\tEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (EFX)\n\n\tThe digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES \n\tMIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER \n\tMANHATTAN.\n\n\tANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX)\n\n\tas the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her \n\teyes, glancing straight down and seeing.\n\n\tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)\n\n\tThe ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a \n\tPAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops \n\tfurther, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR \n\tOLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy, \n\tprobably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he \n\tdrowned in Crystal Lake.\n\n\tJason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.\n\n\tEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.)\n\n\tRennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding \n\teach other up...relief etched in their matured faces.\n\n\t\t\t\tSEAN\n\t\tI hear there's a statue here that's 22 \n\t\tstories tall.\n\n\tRennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek. \n\tThey amble on.\n\n\tSTALKING POINT OF VIEW\n\n\t...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them \n\tthrough a crowd of pedestrians. About the height of a \n\tsmall child.\n\n\tRENNIE AND SEAN\n\n\twalk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their \n\tpursuer. But something, some innate perception causes \n\tRennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid \n\tfear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...\n\n\tTOBY!\n\n\tLimping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The \n\twhimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down, \n\thugging her animal like she'll never let go.\n\n\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n\t\tOh Toby...\n\n\tHIGH ANGLE CRANE SHOT (N.Y.)\n\n\tas Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing \n\tagain with Rennie.
