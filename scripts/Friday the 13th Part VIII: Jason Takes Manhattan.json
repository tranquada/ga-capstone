Dilapidated cabins. \n\tAn abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. \n\n\tWe continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound \n\tof seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small \n\tHOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light \n\tflickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.\n\n<b>\tINT.

Her heart starts to pound.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSUZY\n</b>\t\tJim...?\n\n\tAgain, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving \n\ttowards the open door.

Suzy barely has time \n\tto scream before JASON PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO HER CHEST.\n\n<b>\tSUZY\n</b>\n\tstands there in speechless shock, looking down at her \n\tmortal wound. But there's no blood.\n\n<b>\tTHE MONSTER\n</b>\n\tpulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out \n\twith his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM \n\tpulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it \n\taside.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJIM\n</b>\t\tGotcha good, baby cakes.\n\n\tShe doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick \n\thim in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, \n\tlaughing.\n\n<b>\tEXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK\n</b>\n\tsitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it.

A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR, \n<b>\tPIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD.\n</b>\n\tJim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able \n\tto assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see \n\tthe monster himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJIM\n</b>\t\tOhmygod...\n\n\tJim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to \n\tdefend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He \n\tSMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim \n\tscrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE \n<b>\tAIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT.

DOCKSIDE - DAY\n</b>\n\tStanding at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH, \n\tclipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair \n\tof new-agey SENIOR GIRLS.

He tramples onward.\n\n<b>\tINT. CORRIDOR/DISCO (STEADICAM)\n</b>\n\tThe thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune \n\tprecedes Eva as she tears open a door, entering the \n\tcorridor. MOVE BACKWARDS WITH HER as she rushes forward, \n\tcurving through the shallow passageway and emptying out \n\tonto a high tech DISCO FLOOR. A flashing Star Wars \n\tlighting system assaults her all directions along with \n\tthe music. She's all alone in here.\n\n<b>\tTIGHT ON EVA\n</b>\n\tThe lights strobing across her face only accentuate her \n\tterror. She spots another door on a small stage, rushing \n\tto it. It's locked.\n\n<b>\tCROOKED ANGLE - ENTRANCE DOOR\n</b>\n\tas Jason enters the corridor, SLAMMING THE DOOR SHUT \n<b>\tBEHIND HIM.\n</b>\n<b>\tEVA\n</b>\n\tdecides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the \n\tcorridor again and:\n\n<b>\tJASON\n</b>\n\tappears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The \n\tspotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's \n\tgone.\n\n<b>\tEVA\n</b>\n\tbacks away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor \n\tlike she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror \n\tballs fondle her body as she moves as far away from the \n\tpoint where she last saw him. But:\n\n<b>\tJASON\n</b>\n\tilluminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe \n\tassaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course \n\twith him.\n\n<b>\tEVA  \n</b>\n\twhirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the \n\tsight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs, \n\tPUSHING IN on her face.\n\n<b>\tEVA'S POINT OF VIEW\n</b>\n\tspiraling counter-clockwise on the dance floor, flashes \n\tof Jason materializing where she least expects to see \n\thim. And getting closer. Finally at the point of \n\texhaustion:\n\n<b>\tEVA\n</b>\n\tstops, looking everywhere.\n\n<b>\tEVA'S POINT OF VIEW\n</b>\n\tHe seems to be gone. She catches her breath...then \n\tsensing his presence, she revolves a half-turn to face:\n\n<b>\tTHE HOCKEY MASK\n</b>\n\texploding under a pin spotlight, standing directly \n\tbefore her. His forearms recoil with lightning speed as \n\the grips her throat...\n\n<b>\tWIDE SHOT - DISCO\n</b>\n\tThundering music. Frantic lights. And Jason and Eva at \n\tthe center of it all. HER FEET ARE TWENTY-FOUR INCHES OFF \n<b>\tTHE GROUND, KICKING MADLY AS THE LIFE IS BEING CHOKED OUT \n</b>\tOF HER. Finally Eva's legs go rag doll limp. Jason flings \n\ther to the ground like a sack of flour. This dance is \n\tover.\n\n<b>\tEXT.

POWER ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tSteam continues to seep from the maze of criss-crossing \n\tpipes. Wayne appears on one of the catwalks.

TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (EFX)\n</b>\n\tThe digital clock we saw earlier abruptly CHIMES \n<b>\tMIDNIGHT, HUGE BOLTS OF LIGHTNING CRACKING OVER \n</b><b>\tMANHATTAN.\n</b>\n<b>\tANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX)\n</b>\n\tas the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her \n\teyes, glancing straight down and seeing.\n\n<b>\tRENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX)\n</b>\n\tThe ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a \n\tPAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops \n\tfurther, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR \n\tOLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy, \n\tprobably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he \n\tdrowned in Crystal Lake.\n\n\tJason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.\n\n<b>\tEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT (N.Y.)\n</b>\n\tRennie and Sean stagger out from a side street, holding \n\teach other up...relief etched in their matured faces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSEAN\n</b>\t\tI hear there's a statue here that's 22 \n\t\tstories tall.\n\n\tRennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek. \n\tThey amble on.\n\n<b>\tSTALKING POINT OF VIEW\n</b>\n\t...coming out from another alley, creeping up behind them \n\tthrough a crowd of pedestrians. About the height of a \n\tsmall child.\n\n<b>\tRENNIE AND SEAN\n</b>\n\twalk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their \n\tpursuer. But something, some innate perception causes \n\tRennie to slow...and stop. Her eyes register a horrid \n\tfear and she WHIPS AROUND TO FACE...\n\n<b>\tTOBY!\n</b>\n\tLimping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The \n\twhimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down, \n\thugging her animal like she'll never let go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tRENNIE\n</b>\t\tOh Toby...\n\n<b>\tHIGH ANGLE CRANE SHOT (N.Y.)\n</b>\n\tas Sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing \n\tagain with Rennie. The three survivors enter the collage \n\tof pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers. \n\n\tIt is finally over.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTHE END\n</b>\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Rob Hedden\" title=\"Scripts by Rob Hedden\">Rob Hedden</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan Script.html#comments\" title=\"Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:05:46.721077"}
