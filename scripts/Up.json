He managed to bring the house to the falls, but\n          Ellie never made it.\n          He closes the book.   But as he does, Carl sees something he\n          hadn't before.\n\n          \n          The blank pages at the end are no longer blank.\n          A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them.\n          On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another...\n          photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs.\n          Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw\n          adventure in everyday life.\n\n          \n          A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in\n          their chairs.

On the arm is\n          Russell's sash. Carl picks it up.\n          He looks to Ellie's chair.\n\n          \n          He crosses his heart.\n\n          \n\n          EXT.

The balloons\n          have lost too much helium.\n\n          \n          Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch.
