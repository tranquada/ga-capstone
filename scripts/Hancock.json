KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT\n</b>\n          Horns stands there in the rain - a feeble frame of a man. He\n          wants a fight.\n          And he gets it... as Hancock, once again, emerges from the\n          building - fire in his eyes.\n\n<b>          HANCOCK\n</b>          You ready to rock it up?\n          Horus runs - he runs for an overturned S.W.A.T.

Hancock\n          follows, toying with the man.\n          Horus disappears inside.\n\n<b>          HANCOCK (CONT' D)\n</b>          Come out, you little shit.\n          A pause in action - no reply from Horus.\n\n<b>          HANCOCK (CONT'D)\n</b>          Are you a man?!\n          Horus answers...\n          He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER.\n          He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS\n          Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him inside the\n          brick structure.\n\n<b>          HORUS\n</b>          Fuck you.\n          Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He\n          GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus.\n          Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden\n          EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall\n          loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock.\n          CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does\n          not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the\n          street.\n          Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus\n          - grabbing him by the collar.\n          With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying.\n          THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the\n          asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          123.\n</b>          He gets up. Tries to walk.

He peddles back\n          against the curb, nowhere left to go.\n          Hancock arrives, looking afully steamed. He stands over Horus -\n          not unlike Scarpo much\n          The situation presents itself - he reacts.\n          A kick into Hancock's groin muscle - CHINK, sliikeyt a soundWofshrugs.\n          bone off metal. Absolutely harmless. Horus\n          else can he do?\n          Hancock tears a YIELD street SIGN it backs Ready to strike\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd es\n          this piece of jagged metal.\n\n\n<b>          (CONT' D)\n</b>\n<b>          (DEFIANT)\n</b>          No regrets.\n\n<b>          HANCOCK\n</b>\n<b>          (COOL)\n</b>          No mercy.\n          He takes aim...\n\n<b>          AARON (O.S.)\n</b>\n<b>          NO!\n</b>          Mary SCREAMS in the background...\n          Horns.

It\n          slips... she SCREAMS... and collapses, taking the rest of the\n          building with it.\n          A CRASH, followed by a cloud of billowing smoke.\n          Mary is no more.\n\n<b>          HORUS\n</b>\n<b>          MARY!\n</b>          Aaron.

He stands in comatose silence, looking\n          pale.\n          Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to\n          excavate his wife - one brick at a time.\n          Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console.\n\n<b>          ROHEIM (O.S.)\n</b>          (you're wasting your time)\n          Come on, Horus.\n          Horus - lost in the pain. He won't listen.\n          Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation. He\n          r olls up his sleeve and gets to work.\n          Hancock drops the yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his\n          midst... surveys the carnage...\n          A loaded beat.\n          Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with defeat.\n          Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his\n          knees... by a fallen police GUN.\n\n          He picks it up...\n          points it at his head...\n\n           FIRES the remaining rounds against his temple. Bullets carom\n          off skull.\n          Hancock discards the gun. Breaks into TEARS. Long SOBBING wet\n          tears. He CRIES. He WEEPS. Into his cupped hands. Indeed, a\n          surreal sight.\n          Horus. Roheim. Engaged to the task, brick by brick. Horus works\n          his way down... to a lifeless ARM, protruding from its tomb.\n          He stops.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          126.\n</b>\n<b>          INT.
