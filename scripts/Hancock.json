We SEE\n          the approaching entity as it hovers before us.\n          It's a man.\n          It's a man, plus.\n          It's a SUPERHERO,\n          garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b\n          ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain.\n          This Superhero (30). Unshaven.\n          Disheveled. Worn. A face\n          chiselled with mileage.\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n          In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed\n          nerve, snagged in a fish hook.\n          He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.\n          He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated\n          visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.\n          And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a\n          thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.\n          He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,\n          engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.\n          The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.\n          Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.\n          An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating\n          the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the\n          ruptured orifice as he disappears inside.\n          There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches\n          nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG\n          down the street like loose change.\n          The rain continues its onslaught.\n\n          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n          Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not\n          far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits,\n          dinner before them.\n          HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a\n          man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as\n          low fat milk.\n          He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A\n          gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an\n          attitude.\n          A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK\n          EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn\n          plate, finding no humor in eggplant.\n\n          MARY\n          The principal did'nothing. Like\n          schoolyard terrorism is no worse than\n          being tardy. What's the matter with\n          education? Back when, you could go to\n          school and learn about Betsy Ross and...\n          mollusks and... not get stabbed on the\n          way home.\n          \n\n          4.\n\n          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\n          A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its\n          side and plumes into a wall of white mist.\n          And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He\n          surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his\n          gait.\n          It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the\n          collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,\n          PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.\n          He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He\n          strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-\n          raped subway wall.\n          On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...\n\n          \"YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS.\"\n          He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat\n          pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips\n          into the metal vendor like it was Jello.\n          His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the\n          loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.\n          Deposits it under his coat.\n          And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets\n          above.\n          At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.\n          Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE\n          mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...\n\n          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n          see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.\n          It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits\n          another set of pots. She's clearing the table.\n          Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open\n          door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes\n          out of his clothes.\n\n          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before\n          the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in-\n          the-face body.\n\n\n          5.\n           Horns strikes\n           a He-man pose, his\n           biceps in the\n           wind.\n\n           He removes the Police apparel,\n           plastic. Proceeds to put it on.\n\n   \n          INT.

Grabs a random KEY from a nail.\n\n          FISH\n          Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.\n          (re: the check-in sheet)\n          And your John Hancock makes it sweet.\n          The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles\n\n          HANCOCK\n          on the dotted line.\n          Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's\n          grab.\n\n          FISH (CONT'D)\n          I don't take messages, I don't do favors,\n          and I don't know you from Jack. You want\n          sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra.\n          Plunger's extra.\n\n          HANCOCK\n          I need quiet. Is it quiet?\n\n          FISH\n          Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public\n          library to you? The girls work. Some of\n          them scream, some of them moan...\n\n          (SMILES)\n          and some of them just kinda lay there\n          cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls\n          you can stick in your ear. They're extra.\n\n          Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare\n          hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it\n          under the window.\n\n          And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a\n          deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.\n\n          Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the\n          strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and\n          CLINKS off the counter.\n          Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue.\n\n          INT.

And we\n          SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT.\n          A shoulder patch reads...\n\n          U-RENT SECURITY CO.\n          Their motto: \"TO OBSERVE AND RECORD\"\n          Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.\n\n          INT. AARON'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge. Outside, the story\n          is rain.\n          On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty\n          ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face.\n          Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.\n          Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's\n          interpretation of a man's weapon.\n          A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.\n\n          HORUS\n          How's the eye?\n\n          AARON\n          Black.\n          Horus enters.\n          Stands awkwardly before his son.\n\n          HORUS\n          It'll be gone in a week.

And I don't want any girly\n          make-up on my face.\n          Horus deposits himself on the bed.

I love you.\n          I ask you to do that for me... your old\n          man.\n          And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark\n          hallway - moved b y his affection.\n          She oversees a father-son embrace.\n\n          HORUS (CONT'D)\n          I'm late for work.
