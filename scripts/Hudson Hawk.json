VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY\n</b>\n     Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small\n     Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS\n     and roaring puppets is unfolding.\n\n     RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment\n     at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.\n\n     Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY\n     ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch\n     on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION\n     is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls\n     and collapse in a heap.\n\n     Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.\n\n<b>                             UNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER\n</b>               Leonardo, che pazzo.\n\n     The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings\n     up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...\n\n<b>     INT. ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE\n</b>\n     where the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at\n     him.  Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun-\n     glasses with his trademark beard.\n\n     He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary\n     reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da\n     Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible\n     machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio-\n     syncrasies.\n\n     TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke\n     from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular\n     Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams\n     of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance\n     laser show.\n\n<b>                             DA VINCI\n</b>                       (silencing authority)\n               Basta vapore.\n\n     The apprentice throws a lever.  A shunt near the furnace\n     turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately\n     slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for-\n     ward with tongs.\n\n<b>     A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS\n</b>\n     comes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this\n     trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately\n     modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more\n     dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow\n     glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into\n     a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat.\n\n     The tongs enter the frame.\n\n     Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur\n     goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master\n     peers at the smoking yellow bar.\n\n<b>                             APPRENTICE TWO\n</b>               Maestro, che meraviglia!\n\n<b>                             APPRENTICE THREE\n</b>               Lei e' proprio fantastico!\n\n     Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit.\n\n<b>                             DA VINCI\n</b>               Lasciatemi, solo.  Solo!\n\n     The apprentices scurry out.  Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns\n     his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes.\n\n<b>                             DA VINCI\n</b>               L'ho fatto.\n\n     Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da\n     Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop.\n\n<b>     INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP\n</b>\n     With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts\n     through some double doors into his workshop, sadly\n     reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged\n     bar in the other.\n\n     His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of\n     laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is\n     a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of\n     sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like\n     a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table\n     among these goodies.\n\n     Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work-\n     shop casually tinkering with various experiments.  He\n     snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing\n     a diving helmet prototype.  The Apprentice jumps into a\n     pool of water.\n\n     Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished-\n     except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens\n     to be seated in a stool before the easel.  She broadly\n     smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch.\n     Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a\n\n<b>     EXT. CASTLE TERRACE\n</b>\n     A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged\n     glider, enthusiastically shouting.  Da Vinci grins back\n     until he touches his pocket.  He pulls out the crystal\n     and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two\n     separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate\n     mirror.  He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable\n     geometric pieces.\n\n     Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of\n     the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the\n     table in his workshop.  He ponders then looks back out to\n     the Vinci vista.\n\n     The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:\n\n<b>     A HAWK\n</b>\n     who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison.\n\n<b>     INT. A SING SING PRISON CELL\n</b>\n     The shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window, over\n     the face of EDDIE HUDSON HAWKINS causing him to break out\n     of an eye-closed trance.\n\n     Before the viewer can get a good look at him, Hudson\n     Hawk turns to an oddball version of the \"Mona Lisa\" that\n     has his face and tears it off the cell back-wall.\n\n<b>     INT. PRISON BLOCK WALKWAY\n</b>\n     TWO PRISON GUARDS, One WISE and BLACK, the other YOUNG\n     and GREEN march down a cell block.  The Former is smoking\n     a pipe which the Young Guard lights with a lighter.\n\n<b>                             WISE GUARD\n</b>               We're losing our biggest celebrity\n               today.\n\n<b>                             YOUNG GUARD\n</b>               You're kidding, Petey the Paint\n               Thinner Killer is getting paroled?\n\n<b>                             WISE GUARD\n</b>               Not that slime, you Fizzhead.\n               Hudson Hawk.  The last of the\n               great cat burglars.\n\n<b>     INT. PRISON CELL WALL\n</b>\n     A hand tears down a picture of a happy Hudson Hawk and\n     a LITTLE MONKEY, identically dressed in black cat\n     burglar gear.\n\n<b>     THE BLOCK\n</b>\n     The Wise Guard and the Young Guard rumble forward.\n\n<b>                             WISE GUARD\n</b>               As a thief, Hawk was a poem.\n               Iambic fucking pentameter.  You\n               know, Crime used to have a little\n               class.  A hundred reporters were\n               here when he came in, now they're\n               probably out covering some tired\n               crack gang war...\n\n     The Guards approach Hawk's cell.  Hawk, with his back\n     turned, hefts on a nifty blazer.\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               Remind me to fire my publicist.\n\n     The Wise Guard chuckles as the Young Guard fumbles with\n     his key-ring.\n\n<b>                             YOUNG GUARD\n</b>               Darn, these are for L-block...\n\n     Hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe\n     cleaner from the Wise Guard's pocket.  Then the lighter\n     from the Young Guard's pocket--BURNS OFF the fabric fuzz\n     with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened\n     wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to\n     UNLOCK the door.\n\n<b>                             YOUNG GUARD\n</b>               - go back down to security and-\n\n     He stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open.  The\n     Guards double-take as Hawk, finally in full view, struts\n     past them, down the hall.  The Guards hustle to catch\n     up.  The wise guard puts his finger in the air and\n     sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating\n     from Hawk.\n\n<b>                             WISE GUARD\n</b>               Guess this means, Hawk, you'll\n               be able to let yourself back in...\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               Never happen.  Bet.  Ten bucks.\n\n     Hawk and the Wise Guard hit fists, half-smiling.  Hawk\n     unfolds the painting.\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               Oh, give this back to Petey in A\n               block.  Tell him it was a sweet\n               gift, but I think he got some\n               wrong ideas about our friendship.\n\n<b>                             YOUNG GUARD\n</b>               The Paint Thinner Killer did\n               this?  I think you picked a good\n               day to get out...\n\n     The trio comes to the final checkpoint.  Hawk takes a\n     deep breath.\n\n<b>                             WISE GUARD\n</b>               Hope I lose the bet.  Have that\n               cappuccino on me.\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>                       (flipping him the\n                        pipe cleaner)\n               You got it.  A double.\n\n<b>     EXT. OUTSIDE THE PRISON--DAY\n</b>\n     Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall\n     between him and freedom.  As music crescendos and\n     Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two\n     Mafioso brothers, CESAR and ANTONY MARIO, the latter\n     sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln\n     Continental.  Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back\n     attitude, his scumbag brother is not.\n\n<b>                             ANTONY\n</b>               Welcome back, buddy ol' pal.\n               We've got a proposition...\n\n<b>                              HAWK\n</b>               Answer's no, not even if you\n               bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario,\n               how's the \"Family?\"  Kill any\n               monkeys lately?\n\n<b>                              CESAR\n</b>               How many times do I have to say\n               it?  I didn't put the hit on\n               Little Eddie... Never had anything\n               against that kooky chimp.  I\n               actually found him, \"endearing.\"\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing\n               shots to the back of the head.\n               That's your mark, man.  What did\n               Little Eddie ever do to...\n\n     Smouldering, Hawk struts off.  Cesar takes a black\n     canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to\n     Hawk.  The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding\n     on the hood.\n\n<b>                             CESAR\n</b>               You're hitting Rutherford's\n               Auction House.  Easy as my\n               brother's wife.  Directions are\n               in the bag.

Antony bounds off.  Cesar\n     shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling\n     hands.\n\n<b>                             CESAR\n</b>               Hawk, you're a great thief.

Don't give me a\n               sonata about you always just\n               really wanted to settle down,\n               open a hardware Store and sell\n               spatulas...\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               If the Mario brothers weren't\n               Jersey's third largest family,\n               I'd say kiss my ass.  But\n               considering your status, I'll\n               say slurp my butt.\n\n     Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into\n     Cesar's hands.\n\n<b>                             CESAR\n</b>               What's your favorite sport, Hawk?\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               Baseball, why?\n\n     Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says\n     \"Baseball.\"  He is handed a baseball bat.  Hawk backs\n     up as Antony moves threateningly toward him.\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               I meant, ping pong.

Hawk boots\n     up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots\n     it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat\n     of the car.\n\n<b>                             CESAR\n</b>                       (unfazed)\n               You need some time to think.\n               That's cool, but next time, I'm\n               not going to say \"Please.\"\n\n     Cesar floats into the backseat.

Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him\n     a card that reads:  BEWARE THE ODD STEPS.\n\n     Hawk looks up from the card.  Kit Kat is gone, but\n     Butterfinger scampers in his place.\n\n<b>                             BUTTERFINGER\n</b>               Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72\n               stamps!\n\n     Sighing, Hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.\n\n<b>     EXT. INDOOR TRAIN TRACK\n</b>\n     One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an\n     indoor track.  The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch\n     up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the\n     Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it.\n     The train zips into a tunnel.\n\n<b>     INT. THE VATICAN UNDERGROUND SUBWAY\n</b>\n     The train rumbles into the Vatican mini-station.  TWO\n     HARRIED WORKERS heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting\n     table.\n\n     A bell rings as a clock hits 10.  The workers do a sigh\n     of relief.  Shucking off their uniforms, they head out.\n\n     A hand rips out of the huge package.\n\n<b>     INT. OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM--NIGHT\n</b>\n     Hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to\n     the mouth of the doorless Codex room.  He pauses to\n     hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at\n     the sides.\n\n<b>     THE CODEX ROOM\n</b>\n     Carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, Hawk\n     hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               \"Beware the Odd Steps.\"\n\n     Hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a\n     clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized\n     alarm button.\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               Why Kit Kat, aren't you a\n               gentleman...\n\n     Hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to\n     where the Codex is bathed in a holy light.\n\n     He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them\n     each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running\n     across the top.  The parallel mirrors now face out from\n     each other.  Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the\n     light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he\n     thrusts the mirrors into the beams.\n\n     The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk\n     exhales.  He balances the connected mirrors then crawls\n     through his tent-like passageway.\n\n     Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of\n     the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex.  The\n     acid sizzles.\n\n<b>     INT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT\n</b>\n     A BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers\n     propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling\n     on.\n\n<b>     THE CODEX ROOM\n</b>\n     Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass\n     cracks of the rectangular case loosen.  Hawk pulls out a\n     pocket fisherman....\n\n     The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through\n     the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down\n     the hall.\n\n<b>     OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM\n</b>\n     Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room.\n     He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now\n     empty mirror-frame then REALIZES.\n\n     Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard\n     rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor\n     deflecting mirrors.\n\n     He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to\n     be standing.\n\n     Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping\n     acid.  He also notices a fishing hook attached to the\n     binding of the Codex.  The fishing wire leads out of\n     the glass case.  The Guard reaches to touch it when\n     suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a\n     moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk.\n\n     The Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and\n     sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND\n     the hapless Burly Guard.  The green gas commences its\n     noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's\n     hands.  He then hurls a softball, smashing a window\n     on the other side of the room.\n\n     The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel\n     down into the mouth of the codex room.  Only one\n     Gas Mask drops from the doorway.  The Vatican Guard\n     pulls it on and gives a \"That's Life\" shrug of\n     shoulders to the fainting Guard three.\n\n     Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple\n     around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting\n     Fixture.  Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to\n     another.  He then ungrapples and heads toward the\n     shattered window.\n\n     The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving\n     chase.\n\n<b>     EXT. THE ROOF\n</b>\n     Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical\n     skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.  Suddenly a brick\n     on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS.\n     His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof,\n     landing against the antennae.\n\n<b>     INT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n     A T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian\n     goes fuzzy.  THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre\n     Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it.\n\n<b>     EXT. THE ROOF\n</b>\n     Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof\n     and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.\n\n     The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a\n     warning shot.\n\n     Hawk stretches to the bag.  His fingers touch as the\n     Guard continues to bound forward.\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               Please God, Please God.......let\n               the guard shoot me.\n\n     Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican\n     Guard hovering over him on the roof.\n\n<b>                             VATICAN GUARD\n</b>               The worm's on the other foot,\n               yankee noodle candy.\n\n     Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the\n     grapple.  Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard\n     off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.\n\n<b>     EXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL\n</b>\n     Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple\n     across a road around a tree branch.  Hawk ties the end of\n     grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath\n     and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.  The viewer follows him on his\n     breathtaking ride.\n\n     The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.  He\n     gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down.\n\n<b>     HAWK\n</b>\n     is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits\n     the friction belt.  Hawk drops with a wild scream...\n     and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost.\n     His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without\n     children.  He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails\n     down upon...\n\n<b>     EXT. A BUS\n</b>\n     and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.  Hawk\n     tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling\n     baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes\n     flying off...\n\n<b>     EXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT\n</b>\n     Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table\n     to the female hands holding open a menu.  The menu comes\n     down.  It is Anna.  Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas\n     bag.\n\n<b>                             ANNA\n</b>               Oh Hudson, I was worried you\n               weren't going to drop by....\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               I never break a date.

Hawk tries to throw a punch,\n     but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face.\n\n     The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs\n     in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate\n     mirror of the opening scene.\n\n<b>     INT.

The arms click higher.\n\n     The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video\n     monitor, taking notes.\n\n     The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to\n     spill and drop through brass tubes.\n\n<b>     ANNA\n</b>\n     murmurs to Hawk.\n\n<b>                              ANNA\n</b>               Da Vinci made the real directions\n               in a secret script that I decoded.\n               The way the machine is running\n               now, the gold will produce too\n               quickly, clog, and the machine\n               will shut itself down.  Isn't it\n               wonderful?\n\n<b>                              HAWK\n</b>               Yeah, but what would happen if that\n               little mirror came out of the\n               crystal.\n\n<b>                              ANNA\n</b>               Wha -- you don't want to know...\n\n     Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.\n\n<b>                              HAWK\n</b>               I wanna know...\n\n<b>                              ANNA\n</b>               Holy sh-h--things are going to\n               get very interesting, very fast.\n               Da Vinci would be proud of you.\n\n<b>     IN THE MACHINE\n</b>\n     The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the\n     Lead Bar spinning its trough.  There's a FLASH and a\n     controlled but jarring explosion.\n\n<b>     EVERYONE\n</b>\n     doubletakes.  Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel\n     pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three\n     deep in concentration Technicians to the ground.\n\n     Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling\n     on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a\n     religious purr.\n\n<b>     THE MACHINE\n</b>\n     triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around\n     the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.\n\n<b>     OUTSIDE THE MACHINE\n</b>\n     Hawk and Anna squint, blinded.  Flinging off her goggles,\n     A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward.\n\n<b>     THE MACHINE\n</b>\n     Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into\n     the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!\n\n<b>     MINERVA\n</b>\n     sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and\n     molten.  She moves closer, shouting into her head-set.\n\n<b>                              MINERVA\n</b>               Eureka, motherfuckers!\n\n     The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive\n     pace.\n\n     Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set.\n\n                              HAWK'S VOICE (head-set)\n               Minnie, hate to interrupt your\n               orgasm, but....\n\n<b>     HAWK AND ANNA\n</b>\n     stand above the unconscious Technicians.

The pool of molten gold\n     rockets at the viewer.\n\n     Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.\n\n     Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to\n     say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her\n     face.  It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a\n     bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.\n\n<b>     HAWK AND ANNA\n</b>\n     turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the\n     open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war\n     paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted\n     on his chest, ALFRED!\n\n<b>                              ALFRED\n</b>               How.\n\n<b>                              HAWK\n</b>               You're unemployed, Alfie.

I'll\n               forgive you for denying me the\n               pleasure of slaughtering my\n               boorish employers, but I'm afraid\n               the birth of the new British\n               Empire can have no witnesses!\n\n<b>                              HAWK\n</b>               Ooh-kay...\n\n     Alfred rushes forward with a howl.  Hawk meets him\n     halfway.  They trade savage punches and then lock onto\n     each other's throats.\n\n     Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays\n     for forgiveness.  She aims steadily, and fires...\n\n     right into Hawk's arm.  This allows Alfred to knock him\n     back with a strong punch.\n\n<b>                              ANNA\n</b>               Sorry!\n\n     She fires again.  The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle.\n\n<b>                              HAWK\n</b>               Stop helping me!  Thou shalt not\n               kill!\n\n     Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick\n     Hawk back against a wall.  Alfred lunges out with his\n     blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  Hawk yanks the shaft.\n     Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's\n     throat.\n\n     Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees\n     a hinge and lever on the shaft.  With an all or nothing\n     jerk, Hawk flicks the lever.  The shaft clicks on the\n     hinge.\n\n     Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold\n     away from Hawk and suddenly it is <u>Alfred's</u> throat which\n     is caught in the V-shaped trap!  The momentum of the\n     sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until\n     the point of the \"V\" hits it--\n\n<b>                              HAWK\n</b>               Don't lose your head over this.\n\n     Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth\n     swing right onto the V.  The blades slam together and\n<b>     POP ALFRED'S HEAD OFF, SENDING IT SCREAMING DISEMBODIED,\n</b><b>     HIGH IN THE AIR.\n</b>\n<b>     ALFRED'S SCREAMING HEAD P.O.V.\n</b>\n     Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's\n     head).\n\n<b>                              HAWK\n</b>               Excuse my crass American humor.\n\n     The machine thunders with another explosion.\n\n<b>     THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP\n</b>\n     Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop.  She\n     guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm.  He\n     delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he\n     sees...\n\n     BUNNY THE DOG!! standing in the open mouth of the\n     workshop.  Anna turns to Hawk...\n\n<b>                              ANNA\n</b>               Allow me.\n\n     Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps\n     up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending\n     her crashing to the ground.\n\n     Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.\n\n     Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing\n     Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.\n\n     Hawk can't get off a shot.  He throws down the gun in\n     exasperation.  It lands next to The Gadget that is\n     connected to the Tennis Ball Machine.  Hawk rushes\n     forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and\n     then smiles sweetly toward the dog.\n\n<b>                              HAWK\n</b>               Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.\n\n     Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up\n     blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.\n\n     Hawk slams down on the gadget.\n\n     A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.\n\n     Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force\n     of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.\n\n     Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.\n\n     A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.\n\n     Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles.  Anna shakes\n     her head vigorously.  He pulls her out of the frame.\n\n<b>     EXT. A VINCI COUNTRYSIDE TREE\n</b>\n     A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat.  It is THE\n<b>     TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.\n</b>\n     He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule.\n     He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him\n     to the ground.\n\n<b>     EXT. OUTSIDE THE GRAND CASTLE--DAY\n</b>\n     An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows!\n     Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....\n\n     Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from\n     the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.\n\n     The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle -\n     through the glorious vista.\n\n<b>     EXT. THE ROAD TO THE CASTLE\n</b>\n     The glider floats to a perfect landing before the\n     Unforgettable Juggler.\n\n<b>                             JUGGLER\n</b>                         Che pazzo....\n\n     Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke\n     billowing castle.  They smile and gush in relief.  They\n     wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and\n     laugh again.\n\n<b>     A SMALL PIAZZA\n</b>\n     The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush\n     of dawn.  Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride\n     atop it.\n\n     A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe\n     table with a luminous smile.  She unfolds a table cloth\n     atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.\n\n     Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into\n     the table.\n\n<b>                             HAWK\n</b>               Have I ever told you the world is\n               beautiful...\n                       (semi-seductively)\n               I'd really like to play\n               Nintendo with you, or something...\n\n<b>                             ANNA\n</b>               Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking\n               with God.\n                       (smiling)\n               But you're a close second, tough\n               guy.
