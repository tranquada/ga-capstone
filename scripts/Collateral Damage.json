Selena squirms hard, kicks\n      backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing\n      whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's\n      not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have\n      to kill him before he'd let go.\n\n      Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around\n      Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller\n      woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till\n      she's sitting back on her legs.
