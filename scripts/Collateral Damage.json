It's achieved without conversation.\n\n    The channel surfer slides down the fire pole.     He's\n    followed by the man who was upstairs snoring.\n\n    Junior rips a sheet from the teleprinter. He hands the\n    printout to the snorer, the company's \"chauffeur.\"\n\n    Feet jam into boots.

Headsets\n    go on. As the fire company's lieutenant, Gordy rides\n    shotgun. The chauffeur hands him the printout. As the\n    engine moves out under lights and SIREN, Gordy speaks to\n    the men over the headsets --\n\n                               GORDY\n                 Second alarm.

An engine and ladder company are on-scene\n    attacking the fire with hoses. Neighbors gawk. Gordy's\n    engine company arrives. Gordy hits the ground, moves to\n    a battalion chief. The chief's terse orders are drowned\n    out by the NOISE of the EQUIPMENT, fire and men. Gordy\n    moves back to his company, who have already hooked the\n    engine up to water.\n\n                            GORDY\n              Top story's fully involved.

Rats head past in the opposite direction,\n    deserting the burning building.\n\n\n7   THIRD FLOOR                                                     7\n\n    They meet fire on the third floor. On goes the water.\n    Gordy quickly checks rooms on the floor for occupants,\n    using the axe to open locked doors, then taps Junior and\n    Mike, indicates \"up.\" Begins leading the hose team up\n    the stairwell. Sees something and yells a warning --\n\n                            GORDY\n              Stairs're screwed.

He has\n     fallen through a gaping hole in the floor of the hallway\n     above. He's pinned under a large section of heavy\n     debris, coughing and screaming for help as fire rages\n     around him. To Junior and Mike --\n\n                                   GORDY\n                  Knock it back!\n\n     They turn the hose on the flames as Gordy moves to the\n     trapped firefighter. Gordy tries lifting the debris,\n     can't budge it. He starts chopping at it with the axe.\n\n     Chunks of plaster fly as the axe bites again and again.\n\n     Gordy hacks off a large piece of debris. He levers his\n     axe under the portion still trapping the firefighter.\n     Mike moves to help. Gordy heaves up on the axe. The\n     debris lifts. He heaves harder. It lifts more,\n     until...\n\n     Mike slides the firefighter out. Gordy yanks his axe\n     free. The debris collapses. Gordy moves to the\n     firefighter.\n\n                                FIREFIGHTER #1\n                  Two floors up. I heard\n                  screaming... Couldn't get there.\n\n                                   GORDY\n                  Where?\n\n                                FIREFIGHTER #1\n                  End of the hall.\n\n\n9    GORDY                                                         9\n\n     takes off. Charges the next flight of stairs. Reaches\n     the fifth floor. Tries to reach six, but there's too\n     much fire. He's beaten back... but not before he hears\n     the FAINT sound of SCREAMING.\n\n\n10   NEW ANGLE                                                     10\n\n     Gordy looks down the fifth floor hallway to an apartment\n     door at the end. Between him and the door is the gaping\n     hole in the floor. It's too big to jump. He starts\n     running. He's gonna jump it.\n\n     Gordy reaches the edge of the hole. Leaps with all he's\n     got. At the same time, he swings the axe, point-first.\n     Slams it into a spot high on the wall, and...\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               5.\n\n10   CONTINUED:                                                     10\n\n     Gordy swings over the hole on the axe handle.\n\n     He hits the other side running. Drives a shoulder into\n     the door at the end of the hall.\n\n\n11   INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT                                        11\n\n     Gordy bursts in. It's an inferno. He looks up. Knocks\n     his axe on the ceiling. Hears desperate POUNDING back.\n\n     Gordy climbs a table. Starts whacking upward with the\n     axe, attacking the peeling, crumbled plaster overhead.\n\n     Gordy is trying to hack a hole into the room above, but\n     he's not doing it fast enough. He won't beat the fire.\n\n\n12   INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY                                        12\n\n     Gordy calls down to his men.\n\n                                GORDY\n                  Give me the hose!\n\n                                MIKE\n                  This place is gone!

Turns it on full jet.\n\n     Gordy's barely able to hold the hose as the high-pressure\n     stream bites into old, decayed plaster.\n\n     Bit by bit the ceiling falls away.       Gordy's almost\n     through to the room above, when...\n\n     Falling debris severs the hose. Gordy's lost pressure.\n     He hasn't broken through. The building's coming down.\n     He's gotta get outta there.\n\n     Gordy's not going anywhere. Picks up the axe.       Attacks\n     the hole again furiously, until finally...\n\n                                                             6.\n\n14   GORDY                                                         14\n\n     breaks through! A small hole, which he quickly widens,\n     to reveal... a terrified Latino family gaping down at\n     him, their room ablaze around them. Gordy reaches up.\n     Speaks to them in Spanglish --\n\n                             GORDY\n               It's okay... Esta bien, esta\n               bien... Come with me...

She's on the phone.\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               8.\n\n19   CONTINUED:                                                      19\n\n                                ANNE\n                  Dr. Bob can squeeze him in at\n                  twelve. I have a patient\n                  relations meeting at twelve-\n                  fifteen. Can you take him?\n\n                                GORDY\n                  I have a game. But yeah, if we do\n                  the handoff at the doctor's.\n\n                                 ANNE\n                         (into phone)\n                  Yes, he'll be there...

Your\n                  father just can't keep you dry.\n\n     She leads Matt out. Closes the shower door. Gordy\n     sticks his face into the water. Looks back, finds...\n\n     Two bare butts, Anne's and Matt's, are pressed against\n     the shower door's foggy glass. OFF Gordy, laughing --\n\n\n20   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BASKETBALL COURT - DAY                    20\n\n     It appears the entire neighborhood's crammed against the\n     chain-link fence around the court, yelling and cheering\n     as a team of local kids from the NYFD Athletic League\n     plays a team of local kids from the NYPD Athletic League.\n\n     Gordy's an NYFD coach, exhorts his team at the top of his\n     lungs.\n\n     The rivalry's intense. The game close.       The noise\n     deafening. Bets are going down.\n\n     NYFD goes up by one in the final minute.\n\n     Gordy disses a cop coaching the opposing team.\n\n     LUIS is one of Gordy's kids. A small but talented\n     fifteen-year-old. Luis steals the ball. Drives for an\n     unguarded lay-up to put the team up by three... And\n     misses. An opponent recovers the ball. The flow shifts\n     toward the other end, but Luis is slow adjusting,\n     devastated at missing the easy \"two.\" Gordy yells at him\n     to defend.\n\n                                GORDY\n                  Luis, get back! Pick up your man!\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           9.\n\n20   CONTINUED:                                                  20\n\n     Luis shakes it off. Hustles back on \"D\" as his man gets\n     the ball. The opponent's a step ahead. Goes up... And\n     Luis gets there to reject him. The crowd loves it. The\n     BUZZER SOUNDS. NYFD wins.\n\n\n21   SAME SCENE - GORDY AND LUIS - MOMENTS LATER                 21\n\n     In the game's immediate aftermath. NYFD celebrating\n     around them. Gordy's proud of Luis.\n\n                                GORDY\n                  We lose, win, whatever. But one\n                  thing we never do. We never, ever\n                  give up. Right?\n\n     OFF Gordy, smiling at Luis...\n\n\n22   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          22\n\n     The crowds are gone. Gordy checks his watch and starts\n     off, when a SOUND draws his attention.\n\n\n23   GORDY'S POV                                                 23\n\n     Luis walks along the inside of the chain-link fence\n     around the court. A neighborhood gangbanger and his crew\n     match Luis step for step outside the fence, rattling the\n     fence, clearly trying to intimidate him.\n\n\n24   BACK TO SCENE                                               24\n\n     Gordy stalks walking toward them.    Calls --\n\n                                GORDY\n                  Luis...\n\n     Seeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off.\n     Reaching Luis --\n\n                                GORDY\n                  What was that about?\n\n                                LUIS\n                  Told 'em I wouldn't play with 'em\n                  anymore.\n\n     But Gordy sees Luis is scared. And he sees the\n     gangbanger and crew hovering nearby waiting for Gordy to\n     go.\n\n                                                                 10.\n\n25   EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - BODEGA - DAY                                25\n\n     THROUGH the window, we see Gordy delivering Luis to a\n     Latin man, clearly Luis's father and the bodega's owner.\n     We don't hear the words, but we can tell Gordy's\n     complimenting the boy to his dad.\n\n     Gordy emerges.    Checks his watch.   Whistles up a taxi.\n\n\n26   INT. TAXI - DAY                                                   26\n\n     Traffic jam on Park Avenue South. Gordy's anxious.\n     Checks his watch. He's late. To the cabbie --\n\n                               GORDY\n               Try Fifth.\n\n\n27   EXT. 68TH AND MADISON - DAY                                       27\n\n     Anne waits on the corner with Matt, playing with his\n     spaceship. She checks her watch. It's five of twelve.\n\n\n28   INT. TAXI - DAY                                                   28\n\n     Fifth Avenue's also a parking lot.\n\n                               GORDY\n               Shit.\n\n     He jams money in the pay dish.\n\n                             GORDY\n               I'm getting outta here.\n\n\n29   EXT. FIFTH AVENUE                                                 29\n\n     Gordy exits the cab and takes off running.\n\n\n30   ANNE                                                              30\n\n     checks her watch again.   She's pissed now.\n\n     In b.g., a cop leaves his police cart to write a ticket.\n\n     A caravan of Lincoln Navigators passes Anne and turns\n     east on 68th.\n\n\n31   GORDY                                                             31\n\n     turns onto 68th. As he runs, he jumps, trying to see\n     Anne and Matt over other pedestrians.\n\n                                                              11.\n\n32   ANNE                                                           32\n\n     In b.g., the Navigators pull up at a building flying the\n     Colombian flag. Latin and American men in suits get out\n     of the Navigators.\n\n\n33   EXT. 68TH - BETWEEN FIFTH AND MADISON                          33\n\n     Gordy dodges pedestrians.     Still trying to get a glimpse\n     of Anne and Matt.\n\n     The cop we saw writing tickets earlier is walking the\n     other way. Gordy nearly collides with him. At the last\n     moment, the traffic cop shuffles Gordy aside.\n\n                                 GORDY\n                  Sorry.\n\n     Gordy reaches the corner. Sees Anne and Matt. Whistles.\n     In b.g., behind Gordy, we see the cop get into a brown\n     Ford.\n\n\n34   ANNE AND MATT                                                  34\n\n     hear the WHISTLE.

When the truck clears...\n\n     Anne and Matt are gone. The corner's empty.   Just Matt's\n     spaceship, slowly falling to the ground...\n\n\n44   BACK TO SCENE                                                 44\n\n     There's a horrible SCREECH. A TAXI SKIDS sideways to\n     avoid the FedEx truck and hits Gordy. He's in the air,\n     tumbling, then smacks to the ground.\n\n     Gordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris.\n     Then struggles to his hands and knees.\n\n                             GORDY\n               Anne!\n\n     He tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a\n     large shard of glass embedded in his leg.\n\n     People come to help him, but Gordy only cares about\n     finding Anne and Matt. He looks around desperately but\n     can't see them, when...\n\n     His eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              13.\n\n44   CONTINUED:                                                     44\n\n     Gordy screams out his agony --\n\n                                GORDY\n                  Noooooo!!!\n\n\n45   EXT.

He hands one to\n     Gordy and indicates how they'll ford the stream. Gordy\n     nods, then follows Ever's lead into the perilous, belly-\n     deep water. They struggle to maintain their balance,\n     even with the sticks. When they reach the opposite bank,\n     Ever signs okay to Gordy and smiles.\n\n\n91   HELICOPTER CARCASS                                            91\n\n     They pass the carcass of a crashed and burned-out\n     helicopter, when...\n\n     Two dangerous-looking men armed with assault rifles step\n     out of nowhere onto the path ahead of Gordy and Ever.\n     Gordy and Ever stop. Gordy glances at Ever. Ever's\n     focused on the men and clearly doesn't like what he sees.\n     Gordy looks back. The armed men advance toward them\n     carefully, rifles in the ready position. Gordy watches\n     them approach, wondering who they are and what they're\n     going to do. Ever, frightened, takes a half-step back,\n     then swings the length of bamboo fast and hard, and...\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 39.\n\n91    CONTINUED:                                                       91\n\n      He smashes it into the base of Gordy's head, knocking\n      Gordy out.\n\n      The men run up. One man covers Gordy, while Ever and the\n      other man rifle his pack and toss his pockets. They take\n      his passport, wallet, and an NYFD T-shirt. And then\n      they're gone.\n\n\n92    CLOSE ON HUMMINGBIRD                                             92\n\n      Hovering over Gordy as he comes to.

He searches his pockets and\n      backpack, realizes the passport and wallet are missing.\n\n      Gordy stands. Looks around. He's alone.      He's in the\n      jungle... He keeps heading south.\n\n\n93    EXT. DARIEN GAP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                            93\n\n      Gordy trudges on. The thick jungle's hot and humid,\n      full of STRANGE SOUNDS and shadowy animal movements.\n\n      Gordy's going uphill, when he rounds a bend in the trail,\n      and...\n\n      He meets a man coming the other way. Alarm gives way to\n      the realization that the man is followed by a number of\n      people, including women and children. As they pass\n      Gordy, it's apparent they're refugees from their haunted\n      expressions and crude backpacks heavy with possessions...\n\n      Gordy addresses the passing people.     Indicates where he's\n      standing.\n\n                                  GORDY\n                   Aqui?   Colombia?...\n\n      No one replies. Then a small COLOMBIAN GIRL comes up and\n      gets his attention. She runs back up the trail a short\n      distance and stops. She draws a line in the dirt.\n\n                                  COLOMBIAN GIRL\n                   Panama.\n\n      She jumps backward over the line.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              40.\n\n93   CONTINUED:                                                     93\n\n                                COLOMBIAN GIRL\n                  Colombia.\n\n     She does it again.\n\n                                COLOMBIAN GIRL\n                  Panama... Colombia.\n\n     She smiles. At the sound of a sharp WHISTLE, however,\n     she runs back quickly, passing Gordy and rejoining her\n     family. Her father hands her a machete and a Zippo\n     lighter, says something to her. Whereupon the little\n     girl returns to Gordy and holds the items out to him.\n     Beat. Gordy takes them.\n\n                                GORDY\n                  Gracias.\n\n     The little girl runs back again, and Gordy watches the\n     refugees disappear around the bend. Then turns back\n     uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in\n     the dirt. Looks down at it. Crossing over means he\n     walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people\n     to flee for their lives, and...\n\n     Just as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement\n     past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way, he\n     now steps over the line and advances into Colombia.\n\n\n94   EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS (COLOMBIA) - DAY/NIGHT         94\n\n     Where the rain forest of Darien continues in Colombia.\n\n     Darkness sets in as Gordy follows the trail downhill.    At\n     night, the JUNGLE'S EVEN NOISIER. When...\n\n     EVERYTHING GOES QUIET. Gordy slows. And suddenly,\n     AUTOMATIC WEAPONS begin to POP somewhere. Not close, but\n     not far, either. A FEW BURSTS, some SINGLE SHOTS -- the\n     call and response of an ambush -- and then SILENCE. And\n     then the nighttime JUNGLE NOISES return.\n\n     As Gordy walks on...\n\n\n95   EXT. PARQUE NACIONAL LOS KATIOS - MORNING                      95\n\n     The sun is already cooking the jungle as Gordy reaches a\n     break in the trees, sees a small town ahead.\n\n                                                               41.\n\n96    NEARBY - MOMENTS LATER                                         96\n\n      Gordy has left the trail. He lowers his pants just\n      enough to expose his injured thigh. A bandage covers the\n      wound made by the glass shard. Gordy unwraps the\n      bandage, revealing...\n\n      A wad of cash is hidden inside, along with a photo of\n      Anne and Matt. A long, livid scar marks the wound.\n\n      Gordy studies the photo of Anne and Matt a moment, then\n      removes some cash from the wad and re-wraps the money and\n      photo inside the bandage.\n\n\n97    BACK ON TRAIL                                                  97\n\n      Gordy heads into the town.\n\n\n98    EXT./INT.

Colombian soldiers\n      have the chiva blocked as they perform their inspection.\n      The chiva's DIESEL GROWLS loudly.

And then...\n\n      The forest erupts in a deafening fusillade of AUTOMATIC\n      WEAPONS FIRE being directed at the soldiers at the\n      checkpoint. In the same instant, an RPG takes out a\n      Colombian Army humvee in a bright, fiery EXPLOSION.\n\n                                MAN IN YANKEES CAP\n                Alsuelo!\n\n\n108   MAN                                                           108\n\n      The man pulls Gordy down as the group hits the dirt.

The CRASHING\n      GETS CLOSER. And now Gordy begins to hear the BREATHLESS\n      PANTING of the guerrillas in retreat. BOOTS THUD past\n      Gordy's head.

The guerrilla, wearing the motley uniform of\n      an irregular soldier, whips a look back, and...\n\n      Gordy finds himself staring into the battle-hardened eyes\n      of a fierce young woman. In a heartbeat...\n\n      The woman jumps back to her feet, and   joins her comrades\n      laying down a suppressing FIRE at the   soldiers. Spent\n      cartridges rain down around Gordy, as   the AK-47 ON FULL\n      AUTO chops loudly over his head. And    then...\n\n\n110   NEW ANGLE                                                     110\n\n      The guerrillas are gone.\n\n      The Man in the Yankees hat hauls Gordy up, yells --\n\n                                 MAN IN YANKEES CAP\n                   Vaya!\n\n      The group is in the greatest danger now -- caught between\n      the fleeing guerrillas and the soldiers, who are giving\n      chase and will shoot anyone or thing in front of them.\n      Everyone in the group scrambles to his or her feet and\n      begins to run.

He and others keep running. A man goes down when\n      a BULLET BITES into his leg. Gordy slows, but the Man in\n      Yankees Cap won't let him stop to help. Slams him hard\n      on his back. Keeps pushing Gordy forward. A few moments\n      later, we hear M-16's on FULL AUTO back where they left\n      the man.\n\n                                 MAN IN YANKEES CAP\n                   His trouble is over.\n\n\n112   EXT.

He plunges\n      into the fast water up to his waist. Gordy and the rest\n      splash in behind, struggling to cross against the swift\n      current. The Man in the Yankees Cap reaches the far\n      bank. Takes two steps, and...\n\n                                                             46.\n\n113   EXPLOSION                                                    113\n\n      BOOM!

Slowly, the terrified young woman responds to the\n      strong, calm tone of command in Gordy's voice and the\n      unpanicked, reassuring look on his face.\n\n      Gordy brings her back to the group, which fights to stand\n      in the rushing river. He indicates for them to hold\n      hands for stability.

The GUNFIRE\n      is now FAR-OFF AND SPORADIC. He crosses to the water's\n      edge on the far bank. Pulls the Zippo from his pack and\n      leans over. Uses the flame to illuminate the mud and\n      rock immediately in front of him. Scratches lightly at\n      the ground with the machete, searching for mines. Finds nothing\n      in that spot. And steps onto it.\n\n      Searching the ground and scratching at it with the\n      machete before each step, Gordy inches toward the Man in\n      the Yankees Cap.

He's bleeding from various other\n      wounds as well. Gordy uses the Zippo to inspect the area\n      for more mines. Then kneels in a footprint.\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   You'll be okay...

The young man just stands there, frozen\n      in position, his leg still bowing the line.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              48.\n\n117   CONTINUED:                                                    117\n\n      Using the Zippo again to light his way, Gordy advances to\n      the young man. He follows the trip wire to where a Coca-\n      Cola can hangs from a nearby tree. On closer inspection,\n      Gordy can see the can is sleeved around a grenade.\n      There's no pin in the grenade. The can keeps the\n      grenade's arming spoon in place. The trip wire's\n      designed to yank the can off, allowing the grenade to\n      explode at chest level... And the can's almost off.\n\n      Gordy burns through the monofilament trip wire.

The place is busy, with plenty of\n      local \"hostesses\" for the men. Even Armstrong, standing\n      half-crocked at the bar, is flanked by two scantily-clad\n      women. He's got a spoon hanging off his nose. So does one\n      of the girls. Armstrong's trying to hang a spoon on the\n      other.\n\n      Gordy slips into the bar. Spots Armstrong through the\n      crowd. Sees Armstrong's not wearing his cap, when...\n\n      The girl with the spoon on her nose turns slightly,\n      revealing she's wearing the cap. It's on backwards, but\n      now Gordy can see the \"Deerborn\" logo clearly.\n\n      Gordy wants the guerrilla travel pass inside the cap.\n      It's a desperate move, but he's got no choice. Starts\n      toward the girl, when...\n\n      Gordy sees the thin federale enter the front door. The\n      thin federale sees him at the same time. Begins moving\n      in on him.\n\n      Gordy moves faster toward the girl.   And...\n\n      The girl unwittingly does him a favor by taking off the\n      cap and setting it on the bar, where it's easier to grab,\n      and then turns her attention to Armstrong's antics.\n\n      The thin detective fights through the crowd after Gordy.\n\n      Gordy's almost to the hat.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              57.\n\n143   CONTINUED:                                                    143\n\n      Armstrong's still having trouble with the second girl's\n      spoon.\n\n                                 ARMSTRONG\n                   I never met a nose I couldn't hang\n                   a spoon on.\n\n      Gordy reaches the bar, snags the cap. Glances back, sees\n      the thin federale closing in, turns to run out the back,\n      when...\n\n      A strong hand stops him. The hand belongs to the Fat\n      Federale. And now the thin federale's there, too,\n      wielding a stun gun where Gordy can see it. People in\n      the bar fall silent. Everyone but Armstrong, who's\n      finally hung the spoon on the second girl's nose.\n\n                                 ARMSTRONG\n                   Yahtzee!\n\n      And now Armstong also realizes something's up. Turns and\n      sees Gordy. Sees the cap in Gordy's hand as the Fat\n      Federale addresses Gordy --\n\n                                 FAT FEDERALE\n                   Come along, Mr. Pitt.\n\n      Whereupon Armstrong shouts drunkenly at Gordy --\n\n                                 ARMSTRONG\n                   Police catch you trying to steal\n                   my hat, you asshole?!\n\n      He staggers toward Gordy.

Then hisses into\n      Gordy's ear, clearly not that drunk --\n\n                                 ARMSTRONG\n                   Get outta here --\n\n      But then Armstrong's legs won't work as the thin federale\n      jams the stun gun against his neck, and 10,000 volts\n      surprise the Armstrong neural network.\n\n      Gordy moves against the thin federale in anger, when...\n\n      The Fat Federale ZAPS him with another STUN GUN, just\n      behind the ear...

It's clear the rebels\n      weren't brought here without a struggle, either -- both\n      are cut and bruised. The tougher-looking of the two has\n      taken a real beating. This beaten man is jammed face-\n      first against the bars of Gordy's cell. He makes eye\n      contact with Gordy while the other rebel is unbound and\n      put into a cell. Then the beaten man is shoved into the\n      cell. A solid, brick wall separates them from Gordy and\n      Armstrong. Armstrong's seen the patches on their\n      uniforms.

The\n      accoutrements of agriculture are present -- tractors,\n      sheds, cats, etc. -- but clearly, this is no family farm.\n      There are lots of serious-looking men around. More ELC\n      guerrillas stand guard.\n\n\n181   FELIX                                                       181\n\n      stops the car. He and Gordy get out.

Above the\n      platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps.\n      Spread out and drying beneath them is a half-acre or two\n      of converted cocaine.\n\n\n184   IN ANOTHER SHED                                             184\n\n      workers pack and wrap one-kilo bricks of coke for\n      shipment.\n\n                                                               70.\n\n185   GORDY AND FELIX                                                185\n\n      approach the two giant diesel generators.\n\n                              FELIX\n                We can fix anything, but these\n                keep dying on us...

Then goes. Whereupon the guerrilla crosses to\n      Gordy and takes up a sentry position over him.\n\n\n186   SAME SCENE - LATER                                             186\n\n      Gordy has the diesels partially dismantled.

To do this right, we\n                gotta order parts from Europe.\n                In the meantime, I can make\n                something temporary.

LAND CRUISER (CAGUAN) - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY               187\n\n      Felix is driving. Again, Gordy uses the opportunity to\n      look for The Wolf. It's a long-shot, and he knows it.\n      But it's all he can do.\n\n\n188   EMPTY STOREFRONT                                                    188\n\n      They pass an empty storefront. A sign on the large,\n      front plate glass window says \"Cine\" and \"Sabado.\"\n\n\n189   BAR                                                                 189\n\n      They pass a bar. Felix watches it go by with something\n      like a look of desire. Gordy registers the look and the\n      connection to the bar.\n\n\n190   INT. MACHINE SHOP - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                             190\n\n      Gordy selects spare parts.\n\n      A clerk wraps the parts in an old newspaper, and...\n\n      Gordy realizes his picture is on the paper.       He smears\n      grease from his hands over it.\n\n\n191   EXT.

Felix\n      gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and...\n\n      Gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the\n      other way: a large propane tank next to the house.\n\n\n196   EXT. PLANTATION - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT                         196\n\n      The work in the sheds continues.

He has two sentries now. One\n      wears a combat vest, and as Gordy works, his eyes go to\n      the grenades hanging on the vest's front.\n\n\n199   EXT. PLANTATION - DIESEL GENERATORS - DAY                       199\n\n      The sun's over the yardarm now, blazing hot, and Gordy's\n      still working under the watchful eyes of the guards.\n\n      Nearby, a group of guerrillas is playing soccer, when...\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              76.\n\n199   CONTINUED:                                                    199\n\n      A man is injured, and his teammates call for one of\n      Gordy's guards to substitute. The man in the combat vest\n      responds. The game is shirts and skins, and he's joining\n      the skins. Puts down his AK, strips off his combat vest\n      and shirt, and runs in.\n\n      Gordy's eyes go to the vest and the attached grenades.\n      With the other guard still watching him closely, however,\n      there's nothing Gordy can do.\n\n\n200   SAME SCENE - LATER                                            200\n\n      The soccer game rages back and forth. Suddenly, an open\n      man gets the ball. Breaks toward the goal.\n\n      Gordy sees the player about to go one-on-one with the\n      goalie. He cheers the action loudly, whereupon...\n\n      Gordy's guard turns to see what's happening, and...\n\n      Gordy grabs a grenade.    Almost gets it into a tool box,\n      when...\n\n      The player kicks wide, the guard looks back, and...\n\n      Gordy covers the clattering of the grenade's dropping\n      into the tool box by picking up a large wrench... But the\n      grenade's still visible as now...\n\n      Felix comes around the corner. He's sleepy and hungover.\n      And pissed by Gordy's lack of progress.\n\n                                 FELIX\n                   It's afternoon. Yesterday, you\n                   said it would only take two more\n                   hours.\n\n      Gordy wipes his hands on a rag, throws it on the grenade.\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   I have this one ready to go.\n\n      Gordy reaches up and hits the start button on the\n      GENERATOR. It SPUTTERS, but won't catch. Felix just\n      looks at him. Gordy makes an adjustment, and...\n\n      This time,   the ENGINE TURNS OVER. PURRS like new. The\n      heat lamps   brighten in a row of sheds. Felix winces as\n      the DIESEL   ROAR makes the hangover hammers in his head\n      pound even   harder.\n\n                                 FELIX\n                   What about the other one?\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                      77.\n\n200   CONTINUED:                                                            200\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   I just need another part from\n                   town, and it's five more minutes.\n\n                                    FELIX\n                   ...

I need\n                   to match it, and it's all greasy.\n\n      Felix buys it and heads off.          As Gordy follows him...\n\n\n201   EXT./INT.

Gordy's down to\n      final straws.\n\n                              GORDY\n                We can't stop for one beer?\n\n                              FELIX\n                There's beer at the plantation.\n\n                              GORDY\n                       (thinking fast)\n                There's no Berta at the\n                plantation.

Last night you\n                were in love with her.\n\n      There's a beat. Felix glances at Gordy.

In Spanish --\n\n                                 FELIX\n                   You know I'm your man, baby.\n\n      Someone whistles for a drink. Berta starts to stand.\n      Gordy slips her twenty US dollars to stay. She does.\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   I have to piss.\n\n      Gordy crosses, exits into the bano.\n\n\n208   EXT.

LAND CRUISER - MOMENTS LATER                           209\n\n      Gordy gets the grenade from the tool box. He slides it\n      just inside the top of his pants, with the spoon hooked\n      over the waistband. He finds some wire. Then searches\n      for something else. Finds a piece of string and checks\n      its length. From Gordy's reaction, we understand it's\n      too short.\n\n      Gordy opens doors and checks seat pockets. Nothing. He\n      checks the glove box. No long string there, either. But\n      he does find two rubber bands. Gordy studies them a\n      moment, thinking. Tests their elasticity. Then pulls\n      out the Zippo and thumbs it. The lighter still works.\n\n      As Gordy pockets everything and walks off...\n\n\n210   EXT. CAGUAN - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT                              210\n\n      Gordy steals through town, hiding when he sees someone\n      coming. He's re-tracing the route he took the night\n      before, when he followed the Beaten Man's Suburban.\n\n                                                               80.\n\n211   \"CINE\"                                                         211\n\n      He passes the \"Cine\" in the storefront. A movie's\n      beginning to play on the supervisor's big-screen TV.   The\n      place is packed.

Gordy turns, starts heading\n      back, when...\n\n      One of the GUERRILLAS calls to him.\n\n                              GUERRILLA\n                Alto!\n\n      Gordy stops. The two standing men walk toward him. The\n      other two men get out of the truck to provide backup.\n\n      One guerrilla approaching Gordy stops short and stands\n      off, cocked-and-locked, as the other comes up. Gordy\n      carefully produces the travel pass. The guerrilla looks\n      it over. In butchered Spanish --\n\n                              GORDY\n                Yo trabajo con Felix.

The woman and boy hustle by,\n      glancing at the face of this big gringo in trouble as\n      they pass. They hurry on toward the nearby \"Cine.\"\n\n      OFF Gordy, as the guerrilla indicates for him to start\n      walking to the truck...\n\n\n213   INT.

There's a cot.\n\n                              GORDY\n                This where Armstrong stays?\n\n                              FELIX\n                This is where you stay... A boat\n                will take you down river at seven.\n\n      Felix closes the door. We hear a LOCK TURNING. Gordy\n      moves to the door and tries it. It's definitely locked.\n      Through a small window, he can see the lights in the\n      sheds and the ever-vigilant nighttime ELC sentries\n      patrolling the grounds. The DIESELS ROAR in the b.g.\n\n      Gordy turns back. Readjusts the grenade digging into his\n      belly, then hooks it back inside his pants. He turns off\n      the light. Moves to the adobe wall opposite the door.\n      THROUGH another small window, he can see it's dark in\n      this direction.\n\n      Gordy rummages through the refuse lying around the room.\n      We see some rubber tubing. We see some rope. Gordy\n      finally finds a piece of sharp metal. He moves to the\n      wall with the window. With the DIESELS covering the\n      noise, Gordy starts chiseling away at the adobe.\n\n\n217   EXT.

He moves to the window by the\n      door and looks out. Sees the Suburban. Four guerrillas\n      are getting out, including the Beaten Man. Felix meets\n      them. The Beaten Man exchanges words with Felix. Felix\n      indicates Gordy's room. As the Beaten Man continues to\n      question Felix...\n\n      Gordy realizes he's fucked. He can't get through the\n      wall fast enough. His eyes go to water dripping from a\n      pipe leading to the washtub sink. He moves to it. Finds\n      the water pipe underneath that feeds the tap. Cranks\n      shut the master valve on the pipe. Wraps his hands\n      around the pipe and pulls. Nothing. Jams his feet\n      against the wall for leverage and pulls harder... And\n      this time, he yanks the pipe free from the sink. He\n      finds the rubber hose. Fits an end over the pipe.\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                   83.\n\n218   CONTINUED:                                                         218\n\n      Quickly lashes it on with some wire. Then cranks on the\n      master valve. High-pressure water streams from the hose.\n\n      Gordy sneaks a peek out the window. The Beaten Man's\n      still questioning Felix. The sound of the hose water is\n      being covered by the DIESELS.\n\n      Gordy crosses the room, extending the hose to the hole\n      he's made in the wall. He aims the stream at the hole.\n      Thumbs the end of the hose to make the water jet even\n      harder... And watches the jet begin eating away at the\n      old adobe and brick, just as it ate through the crumbling\n      plaster in the Spanish Harlem tenement.\n\n\n219   EXT. PLANTATION                                                    219\n\n      The Beaten Man finishes with Felix. Felix begins leading\n      the guerrillas toward the storeroom.\n\n\n220   INT. STOREROOM                                                     220\n\n      Gordy's made progress, but hasn't broken through yet.\n      And he won't, not in enough time. Under his breath --\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   Come on, baby... come on, baby...\n\n      And just then...\n\n\n221   EXT. PLANTATION                                                    221\n\n      WHAM-WHAM-WHAM, one of the DIESELS Gordy repaired suffers\n      a spectacularly loud internal breakdown. The heat lights\n      dim in a row of sheds. Felix and the guerrillas stop to\n      see what's happening. At which point, the generator now\n      BURSTS into FLAMES.\n\n\n222   BACK TO GORDY                                                      222\n\n      He smiles.\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   Just in time...\n\n      And we realize that he'd planned on the diversion, as...\n\n      The water jet breaks through.      The hole's still small.\n      Gordy begins to widen it.\n\n                                                              84.\n\n223   EXT. PLANTATION                                               223\n\n      Felix, the Beaten Man and the other guerrillas resume\n      their march toward the storeroom.\n\n      They reach the storeroom. Water's pouring out under the\n      door. Felix unlocks the door and opens it to find...\n\n\n224   INT. STOREROOM                                                224\n\n      Gordy's gone. The Beaten Man signals two men to go out\n      the hole. To the other man --\n\n                              BEATEN MAN\n                       (in Spanish)\n                Organize the others. Find him.\n\n      The man goes. Outside, we hear him SHOUT orders to the\n      guerrillas guarding the plantation. The Beaten Man turns\n      to Felix. Felix is terrified. In a pleading tone --\n\n                              FELIX\n                       (in Spanish)\n                He can't be far. You'll catch --\n\n      BANG! The Beaten Man SHOOTS Felix in the head. Then\n      exits. OFF Felix, dead, his blood mixing with the water\n      still streaming across the floor...\n\n\n225   EXT. PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER                               225\n\n      The guerrillas report to the Beaten Man. They can't find\n      Gordy. To the men guarding the plantation --\n\n                              BEATEN MAN\n                       (in Spanish)\n                Keep looking.\n\n      He signals his men to come with him.   They get into the\n      Suburban. Whereupon we FIND...\n\n\n226   UNDER SUBURBAN                                                226\n\n      Gordy's hanging onto the chassis. With the large tires\n      and high ground-clearance, there's just enough room to\n      get his legs over the rear axle. He's just finishing\n      rigging up a rope he took from the store room -- the\n      rope's slung from one side of the chassis to the other,\n      to support Gordy's back. He hears the ENGINE START,\n      grabs the transfer case, and...\n\n                                                             85.\n\n227   SUBURBAN                                                     227\n\n      ROARS off with Gordy suspended below.\n\n      The rear DRIVE SHAFT WHIRS madly, inches from Gordy's\n      face. And, with each bump in the road, even with heavy-\n      duty off-road shocks and springs, the undercarriage of\n      the Suburban comes within inches of crushing Gordy's\n      legs. ROCKS are PINGING everywhere. The dirt and the\n      dust are choking. Even for a short distance, it's going\n      to be a long, dangerous ride.\n\n\n228   EXT. SUBURBAN (CAGUAN) - NIGHT                               228\n\n      As the TRUCK BLASTS down back roads and through the\n      darkened town...\n\n\n229   GORDY                                                        229\n\n      continues to suffer underneath. Even with the rope\n      supporting him, he has to hold on with two hands.\n\n      A vicious jolt suddenly loosens a grenade. It starts to\n      slip free. Gordy can't stop it without letting go. The\n      grenade falls, and...\n\n      Gordy shoots out a hand and grabs it. Barely. The spoon\n      just hanging on the end of his fingertips. Gordy can't\n      use his other hand to get it. He needs the hand to hold\n      onto the car. The grenade begins to slip. He's going to\n      lose it. And just as it falls...\n\n      Gordy does the only thing left. He slips a finger\n      through the loops of the grenade pin. Just barely snags\n      the grenade before it drops to the road. And then...\n\n      Carefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar\n      the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and\n      screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer\n      case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach,\n      where he gets a better grip. Jams the grenade back.\n      Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to\n      relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm.\n\n\n230   ABOVE GORDY'S WORLD                                          230\n\n      the Suburban passes the \"Cine.\"   The movie's over, just\n      letting out.\n\n231   EXT. GUERRILLA HOUSE - NIGHT                                 231\n\n      The Suburban pulls up to the well-guarded house Gordy saw\n      the night before. The men get out and go inside, leaving\n      the SUBURBAN RUNNING, clearly planning to leave again\n      right away.\n\n                                                               86.\n\n232   GORDY                                                          232\n\n      carefully lowers himself to the ground. Slides out on\n      the side away from the house. Hides behind a large\n      wheel. The brightly-lit house is surrounded by coconut\n      trees. Gordy watches the guards. When the guards aren't\n      looking, he runs to the nearest tree. The sounds of the\n      SUBURBAN'S ENGINE covers his footsteps.\n\n\n233   TREES                                                          233\n\n      Gordy moves from tree to tree when the guards aren't\n      looking, when he reaches one tree, and...\n\n\n234   NEW ANGLE                                                      234\n\n      THUNK!   A coconut hits the ground next to him, and...\n\n      One of the guards comes to investigate.\n\n      The guard gets closer. Gordy inches around the tree. He\n      can't get away without being seen. He nudges the coconut\n      with his toe. Nudges it harder, causing it slowly to\n      roll away, and...\n\n      The guard picks it up. Never sees Gordy in the shadow of\n      the tree, pressed against the trunk. The guard shows the\n      coconut to a guard near the house, then walks back.\n\n\n235   GORDY                                                          235\n\n      sneaks to another tree. Then reaches the house. He\n      moves to a window. Peers into a room. No one's there.\n      But we hear the sound of VOICES. Gordy creeps along the\n      wall. Looks into another room, and...\n\n\n236   INSIDE                                                         236\n\n      is a group of ELC guerrillas, including the Beaten Man,\n      packing suitcases, etc. Leaving in a hurry.\n\n\n237   GORDY                                                          237\n\n      scans the faces. Except for the Beaten Man, no face is\n      familiar. A man with his BACK TO us stands, and there's\n      nothing familiar about him, either. When...\n\n\n238   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  238\n\n      Directly in front of us, another man emerges from a room.\n      He's also in ELC guerrilla camo.\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             87.\n\n238   CONTINUED:                                                   238\n\n      OFF Gordy, looking intently at the man.\n\n\n239   FLASHBACK - SURVEILLANCE TAPE                                239\n\n      The face of the cop outside the consulate.\n\n\n240   MAN (PRESENT)                                                240\n\n      in the room.

Eases into the shadows. His dirty face\n      and clothes blend in just enough. The guard moves past.\n\n\n244   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                244\n\n      When the coast is clear, Gordy moves to the large propane\n      tank. He takes out the grenade. Puts the rubber bands\n      around it, spoon and all. Grips the grenade in his hand,\n      holding the spoon down, and yanks the pin. And then...\n\n      Slowly, slowly, Gordy begins releasing his grip, allowing\n      the rubber bands to take on the pressure of the spring-\n      loaded spoon. If they'll do it... if the spoon goes now,\n      Gordy's going up in the blast.\n\n      Gordy continues to relax his grip. The rubber bands\n      stretch. Stretch more. Keep stretching until they're\n      barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it.\n\n      Gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane\n      tank. Then takes out the Zippo, pulls it apart and\n      removes the lighter fluid-soaked cotton. Holds the\n      cotton just above the grenade and squeezes with his\n      fingers. And...\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               88.\n\n244   CONTINUED:                                                     244\n\n      Lighter fluid drops onto the rubber bands.    Gordy\n      squeezes out as much as he can onto them.\n\n      Then Gordy gets the hell out of there.   He finds cover.\n      Ducks down. And waits.\n\n\n245   CLOSEUP - GRENADE                                              245\n\n      The lighter fluid is dissolving the rubber bands.\n\n\n246   BACK TO SCENE                                                  246\n\n      Gordy suddenly hears a woman's gentle SINGING.    He looks\n      in the direction of the sound, and...\n\n      Gordy sees the attractive Woman and the boy approaching\n      on the road.

Sees the\n      Woman and Boy are safe, when...\n\n      A vicious kick in the ribs lifts Gordy off the ground,\n      rolling him away from the Woman and child.\n\n                               THE WOLF\n                You bastard!\n\n      The Wolf's alive and unhurt.

The woman picks it\n      up, and we see...\n\n      It's the photo of Anne and Matt.\n\n      The woman stares at the photo a moment, as...\n\n      Gordy absorbs another blow.    He tries to stand.\n\n                              GORDY\n                You killed my wife and son --\n\n      Whack! The Wolf slams the butt of an AK-47 against\n      Gordy's skull. Gordy drops hard. The Wolf reverses the\n      AK. Points it at Gordy's head, about to pull the\n      trigger, when...\n\n      The Woman lays a hand on The Wolf's arm.\n\n                               WOMAN\n                Claudio.\n\n      The Wolf doesn't take his eyes off Gordy.

Implores him --\n\n                               WOMAN\n                Claudio.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               91.\n\n261   CONTINUED:                                                     261\n\n      The Wolf glances over. Meets her eyes a moment. Sees\n      the photo in her hand. Glances up into her eyes again.\n      They hold the look. A whole conversation exchanged\n      without words. Then The Wolf turns back to Gordy, lying\n      in a pile on the ground. Beat. To Gordy --\n\n                                 THE WOLF\n                   You were just saved by your\n                   guardian angel.\n\n\n262   INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY                                  262\n\n      Dark and dank. Excavated clay walls and floor. Heavy\n      door. A bare overhead bulb provides some light.\n\n      Gordy lies on a metal bed frame. One of his legs is\n      chained to the bed. He's in pain from being kicked --\n      but the physical aches are nothing compared to the\n      anguish he feels for having failed.\n\n      The door's unlocked and opens. Daylight streams in from\n      above as The Wolf enters with two guerrilla bodyguards.\n      He moves to the middle of the room. Looks at Gordy.\n\n                                 THE WOLF\n                   One of the men in the jail with\n                   you in Mompos is dying. He was\n                   burned in your explosion.\n\n      Gordy just looks at him.\n\n      The Wolf signals a bodyguard, who crosses to Gordy and\n      frees his leg from the chain.\n\n                                 THE WOLF\n                   You want to kill me? Come and\n                   kill me.\n\n      The bodyguards are smiling. Gordy hesitates, then\n      springs for The Wolf, and...\n\n      The Wolf immediately fells him with a choppy-looking\n      karate combination. The Wolf's no Jet Li -- his style's\n      a throwback, even ugly, but it's well-practiced and\n      brutally effective. Even still, Gordy springs back right\n      away... and The Wolf drops him again.\n\n                                 THE WOLF\n                   You Americans think you have all\n                   the answers. And really, you're\n                   so naive...\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 92.\n\n262   CONTINUED:                                                       262\n\n      Gordy comes up swinging. Gordy's a barroom fighter. If\n      he can touch you, you're in trouble. He never gets\n      close. A vicious front kick folds him, and a fist drives\n      him to the floor. The Wolf stands over him.\n\n                                 THE WOLF\n                   ... You see one peasant with a\n                   gun, and you never ask why he has\n                   to have it. You just run to give\n                   your billions to the nearest\n                   soldiers, no matter how merciless\n                   or corrupt they are.\n\n      The last kick really hurt Gordy.    He's slow rising.\n\n                                 THE WOLF\n                   That's why I'm teaching America a\n                   lesson... that's why there'll be\n                   more bombs... and more families\n                   like yours will pay the price.\n\n      The Wolf wants to pique him, but this is pouring gasoline\n      onto fire. Gordy explodes off the ground. The\n      suddenness and fury of the rush catch The Wolf off guard.\n      Gordy drives him backward. Slams him against a wall.\n      Then hooks an arm around the back of The Wolf's neck and\n      drives the other fist like a piston into his abdomen.\n      All his weight behind the punches. Trying to break ribs\n      and crush them into The Wolf's heart, when...\n\n      A bodyguard slams the butt of an AK into Gordy's kidneys.\n      Gordy takes the blow standing. The guard delivers a\n      second, much harder shot, and Gordy drops to his knees in\n      agony. Beat. The Wolf recovers from the hammer-blows to\n      his midsection. And then...\n\n      He makes Gordy pay for the punches. Lands blow after\n      blow on Gordy's face. Beats the living shit out of\n      him... and leaves him unconscious on the dirt floor.\n\n\n263   BLACK                                                            263\n\n      we hear a gentle CLACKING sound.

She's sitting on the metal bed frame\n      nursing Gordy's wounds. The CLACKING sound CONTINUES --\n      it's made by SEA SHELLS that dangle from a bracelet on\n      Selena's wrist.

We met\n                   in Guatemala, in an Indian village\n                   called Guamaunco. We were married\n                   there. Sophia, our daughter was\n                   born there. Claudio was kind and\n                   loving, and we were happy... We\n                   were there four years when the\n                   civil war broke out... The\n                   guerrillas were all around us, but\n                   left us alone... Then they made an\n                   attack on the army nearby. The\n                   next night, soldiers came to our\n                   village. They were led by\n                   American 'advisors'...

Right now on the tube Daffy's getting his\n      beak blown off.\n\n\n278   SOLDIER                                                       278\n\n      pets his child and kisses his wife as he goes off to\n      guard duty.\n\n                                                               102.\n\n279   ELC OFFICER                                                     279\n\n      talks on satellite phone inside camp headquarters.\n\n\n280   MAURO                                                           280\n\n      sits next to Selena on the porch of a house.

An armed guerrilla\n      approaches, unaware of their presence. Gordy fumbles\n      with the AK-47, looking for the safety switch on the\n      strange weapon. Selena reaches over and expertly flicks\n      it off.

The first wave of BLACKHAWKS FLASHES OVER the\n      village. Selena and Gordy barely have time to duck as\n      ROCKETS EXPLODE into ground targets, and front and door\n      MINI-GUNS SPIT BULLET-STREAMS that RIP THROUGH people and\n      STRUCTURES.

Selena leads Gordy to\n      a bush and pulls back leaves, revealing Mauro, cowering\n      fearfully, clutching an old leather doll to his chest.\n      Selena takes Mauro's hand, grabs a small pack lying next\n      to him, then leads Gordy off through the jungle.\n\n\n306   SOLDIER'S POV (NIGHT-VISION)                                      306\n\n      He SEARCHES the jungle.

When...\n\n      A truck stops ahead of him and blocks the alley.\n\n      Gordy veers into a walkway between buildings.\n\n\n369   EXT. STREET                                                     369\n\n      A parked   car suddenly pulls out in front of the speeding\n      Ducati.    Claudio can't swerve around it. SLAMS ON the\n      BRAKES.    The car's driver, frightened and flustered by\n      the near   collision, is slow moving out of the way.\n\n\n370   EXT. TOWN HOUSE - BACK YARD                                     370\n\n      Gordy bursts through a gate. Sees back steps leading to\n      the open door of a second-story over a garage and charges\n      the steps.\n\n\n371   EXT. STREET                                                     371\n\n      The driver of the car finally backs up. Claudio aims the\n      DUCATI through a narrow gap and ZOOMS on.\n\n\n372   INT. TOWN HOUSE GARAGE                                          372\n\n      Gordy blows into the second story of the garage, a\n      converted old-time carriage barn. He's in the old\n      hayloft. On the opposite side of the loft, a double\n      door built for loading in hay is open above the street.\n      Gordy sprints for the opening, and...\n\n\n373   EXT. STREET                                                     373\n\n      The Ducati tears around traffic, when...\n\n      Gordy leaps out of the hayloft, launches himself off a\n      parked car as the DUCATI SCREAMS past, and...\n\n      He just manages to grab Selena and yank her off the bike.\n\n      Selena's arms are wrapped around Claudio -- when Gordy\n      rips her out of the saddle, Claudio goes, too. The three\n      of them tumble to the ground as the speeding Ducati\n      spins, flips and disintegrates.\n\n                                                              124.\n\n374   CLAUDIO                                                        374\n\n      in leathers and a helmet. He takes the fall better than\n      Selena. Gets to his feet. Looks for the guns they\n      dropped. Before Claudio can get to a gun, Gordy's on\n      him. They grapple. Gordy pounds Claudio hard. Once.\n      Twice. When...\n\n\n375   SELENA                                                         375\n\n      side-kicks Gordy. He sags. She front-kicks a heel into\n      his spine and between his shoulder blades. Gordy lets go\n      of Claudio and drops. Selena's relentless, kicks Gordy\n      repeatedly as...\n\n\n376   CLAUDIO                                                        376\n\n      gets the pistol. Turns.   Aims the gun two-handed at\n      Gordy's head, and BANG!\n\n\n377   DRAY                                                           377\n\n      SHOOTS Claudio dead from the mouth of the alleyway down\n      the block. The first SHOT CRACKS the back of Claudio's\n      helmet. The second SHOT punches through and exits his\n      visor in a bright red mist of blood.\n\n\n378   SELENA                                                         378\n\n      bolts.\n\n\n379   GORDY                                                          379\n\n      goes after her.\n\n\n380   DRAY                                                           380\n\n      EMPTIES a CLIP at Selena, but he doesn't have a clear\n      shot and misses.\n\n\n381   SELENA                                                         381\n\n      sees a walkway between houses and turns in.\n\n\n382   SAME SCENE - BEAT LATER                                        382\n\n      Gordy turns in behind her.\n\n                                                             125.\n\n383   EXT.

Jukes\n      through a gate into...\n\n\n384   EXT. ANOTHER TOWN HOUSE - BACK YARD                           384\n\n      A shovel lies in the grass. Selena scoops it up and in\n      one motion, spins back toward the gate, launches it\n      blade-first with all her strength, timing it perfectly,\n      as Gordy runs through the gate, and...\n\n\n385   GORDY                                                         385\n\n      just barely evades the sharp shovel edge headed for his\n      face. It doesn't hurt him, but it stops him, and Selena\n      breaks toward an open door of the house.\n\n\n386   INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                               386\n\n      Selena blasts into the bottom floor, runs through a\n      playroom. Gordy's right behind her.\n\n\n387   SELENA                                                        387\n\n      mounts a stairwell. A girl's descending. Selena grabs a\n      pigtail and flings her down the stairs, and...\n\n\n388   GORDY                                                         388\n\n      gets there just in time to keep the screaming girl from\n      falling all the way to the bottom. He sits the uninjured\n      girl down and continues on.\n\n\n389   SELENA                                                        389\n\n      runs toward the living room, which is undergoing a\n      renovation. Without stopping, she tears through the\n      plastic covering the doorway to seal in dust from the\n      rest of the house. She topples what she can into\n      Gordy's way. Throws nails down behind her. Grabs a\n      circular saw and hurls it back at Gordy, just missing him\n      and shattering a large wall mirror.\n\n      Selena's a soldier, taught to pick up and use whatever\n      weapons she finds as she moves through a battlefield --\n      this battlefield gives her a crowbar, which she keeps as\n      she runs out through plastic covering the other doorway.\n\n                                                              126.\n\n390    ARCHWAY                                                       390\n\n       leads into the dining room. Selena runs in. Gordy's\n       right on her heels. Selena pulls down dining room chairs\n       in front of Gordy. He vaults one but trips over the\n       second and falls.\n\n\n391    SELENA                                                        391\n\n       blows through a swinging door into the kitchen, slamming\n       into a Hispanic maid, who's coming to investigate all\n       the noise. Both women tumble. Selena gets right back\n       on her feet. She breaks out a window with the crowbar\n       and exits onto a fire escape as Gordy blasts in from the\n       dining room.\n\n\n392    OMITTED                                                       392\nthru                                                                 thru\n394                                                                  394\n\n\n395    EXT. TOWN HOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE                                 395\n\n       The window Selena slipped through easily is small for\n       Gordy. He gets hung up on the glass, losing precious\n       seconds. Selena's already halfway up when Gordy hits the\n       fire escape steps.\n\n       The fire escape ends at a top floor window. Selena\n       BREAKS out the GLASS with the crowbar and goes in.\n\n\n396    INT. TOWN HOUSE - VARIOUS SHOTS                               396\n\n       Selena's in a teenager's bedroom. The teenager's got\n       headphones on, oblivious to everything. Selena darts\n       through a bathroom into a second bedroom.\n\n\n396A   GORDY                                                         396A\n\n       enters the first bedroom behind her.\n\n\n397    WOMAN                                                         397\n\n       IN GARDENING CLOTHES and holding a digging tool stands on\n       a stairwell landing, alarmed and confused by the chaos\n       she hears in her house. She had started down the stairs\n       but now has turned back at the sound of the WINDOW\n       BREAKING on the top floor. Calls.\n\n                               WOMAN IN GARDENING CLOTHES\n                 What's going on?\n\n                                                              127.\n\n398   SELENA                                                         398\n\n      runs into the hallway at the top of the stairs, above the\n      woman.\n\n                               WOMAN IN GARDENING CLOTHES\n                Who are you?

Meets the Woman In\n      Gardening Clothes, who's now come up the stairs. She\n      screams. Swipes at him with the digging tool, making\n      three deep scratches in his face. Gordy doesn't stop.\n\n\n401   OMITTED                                                        401\n\n\n402   EXT. TOWN HOUSE - ROOF/ADJOINING ROOFTOPS                      402\n\n      This is where the woman was gardening, tending a rooftop\n      flower bed. Selena emerges, crushes plants as she runs\n      to the next town house roof.\n\n      Gordy hits the roof behind her.\n\n\n403   SELENA                                                         403\n\n      As Selena runs from rooftop to rooftop along the row of\n      town houses, we see her warrior determination and\n      discipline. She's thinking ahead and she never\n      hesitates. Her big problem is she's being pursued by an equally\n      well-trained and determined firefighter. And\n      he's not far back. One tumble, and he'll catch her.\n      Selena strains harder.\n\n\n404   SELENA                                                         404\n\n      vaults a gap.   Moments later, Gordy vaults it.\n\n405   SELENA                                                         405\n\n      finally runs out of roof. She looks down. A fire escape\n      ladder leads down to an interior, ground-level courtyard\n      of a small foreign embassy. Still holding the crowbar,\n      Selena takes the ladder down.\n\n                                                              128.\n\n405A   MOMENTS LATER                                                 405A\n\n       Gordy reaches the ladder. Selena's ahead of him by a\n       floor, hurrying down two rungs at a time. Gordy doesn't\n       fuck with the rungs. Just swings over the edge of the\n       roof, grabs the side-rails lightly with his hands,\n       squeezes the rails with the insides of his boots and lets\n       gravity take over.\n\n\n406    EXT. EMBASSY - COURTYARD                                      406\n\n       The fire escape leads down to a second-story balcony\n       running around the inside wall of the courtyard. Twin\n       staircases lead from the balcony to ground level, where,\n       across the slate-paved car court, a wrought-iron gate\n       opens onto the street.\n\n       Gordy hits the balcony a half-second after Selena. He\n       grabs her. Selena swings the crowbar to break his arm.\n       Gordy has to let go. Selena heads for the stairs leading\n       to the ground.\n\n\n407    GORDY'S                                                       407\n\n       got one chance to intercept Selena. The balcony's too\n       high for him to jump, but the courtyard's ringed with\n       trees -- they're not close, but they're not far, either.\n       Not for a man craving revenge for the deaths of his wife\n       and son, a man who also slides down fire poles for a\n       living.\n\n       Gordy runs down the balcony. Gains speed. Jumps.\n       Launches off the balcony railing. And hurtles himself at\n       the trunk of a medium-sized tree. He hits the trunk.\n       Hangs on. And slides to the ground. And now...\n\n\n408    ANOTHER ANGLE                                                 408\n\n       He's between Selena and the only way out.   And there's no\n       way she's getting past him.\n\n       But that's not what Selena's thinking. She attacks with\n       the crowbar, and Gordy can only retreat in the face of\n       the vicious onslaught. He finds a nearby garbage can.\n       It's full, heavy, but he manages to lift it, spilling\n       garbage as he uses the can to block the blows from the\n       crowbar. The CROWBAR THWOCKS into the can over and over,\n       the sound ECHOING LOUDLY in the small courtyard.\n\n       Selena swings again, and Gordy moves to block the hit.\n       It's a feint. She swings under the can and hits a leg.\n       It hurts like hell, he stumbles, but he stays on his\n       feet, still holding the can. Selena goes for his head.\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                129.\n\n408   CONTINUED:                                                       408\n\n      Gordy raises the can. Thwock! Thwock! The can's all\n      dents. There's garbage everywhere. She feints high and\n      then swings low again, a wicked blow to the knee. Gordy\n      stumbles badly this time. Selena breaks for the gate.\n      Gordy sees her and, with all his might slings the can\n      across the slate pavers, and...\n\n      The can takes Selena's legs out from under her. She\n      falls hard. Gets back to her feet quickly and starts to\n      run, when...\n\n      Gordy hits her like a linebacker. Slams Selena against a\n      brick wall. Gets behind her and slips a mighty arm\n      around her thin neck. Selena squirms hard, kicks\n      backward, going for the balls, kneecaps, insteps, doing\n      whatever she can to hurt Gordy and get free. But she's\n      not in a position to do a lot of damage -- and she'd have\n      to kill him before he'd let go.\n\n      Gordy's got his arm locked in a police chokehold around\n      Selena's neck. Uses his weight to force the smaller\n      woman down onto her knees. Presses her harder, till\n      she's sitting back on her legs. Selena can't drop out of\n      the hold, and her legs are immobilized. All she can do\n      is scratch. But Gordy's oblivious. They're alone in the\n      courtyard. Body to body. Head to head. He's pumped\n      with fury and hatred. He tightens the chokehold. Hisses\n      in her ear --\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   You killed them.\n\n                                 SELENA\n                          (beat; with\n                           contempt)\n                   One woman, one boy -- they mean\n                   nothing next to the thousands\n                   who've been slain.\n\n      Gordy hears it.    It only drives him to a deeper fury.\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   They were my family.\n\n      Gordy's blind with rage. Chokes her neck hard.\n      Summoning all the power in him, first to shut off her air\n      and blood, and then to continue squeezing, relishing her\n      every dying moment, until he's snuffed out the life of\n      the person who took Anne and Matt from him.

He's a firefighter.\n      He saves lives. If he kills Selena, Gordy crosses into\n      her world, into Brandt's world, into the brutal nightmare\n      destroying Colombia and all the places like it, and becomes\n      part of that sadness and death... And...\n\n      Gordy relaxes the chokehold enough so she can breathe.\n      Selena gasps for air. The impulse to murder has left\n      Gordy. There's a new resolve...\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   The killing ends here.\n\n      Beat.   Selena pants.\n\n                                 SELENA\n                   It will never end.\n\n\n409   NEW ANGLE                                                           409\n\n      Under which an EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD emerges from the\n      building. He sees Gordy and Selena -- a large man\n      holding a smaller woman in a chokehold. Draws his gun.\n\n                                   EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD\n                   Let her go!\n\n      Gordy looks up at the nervous guard pointing his gun.\n      Selena screams.\n\n                                 SELENA\n                   Please help me!\n\n                                   EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD\n                   Let her go!\n\n                                   GORDY\n                   No.    You don't understand.\n\n                                 SELENA\n                   He's trying to kill me!\n\n                                 EMBASSY SECURITY GUARD\n                   Let her go, or you're dead!\n\n      He's going to shoot. Gordy has no choice.       As he lets\n      Selena go and stands --\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   Hold us both till the police get\n                   here.\n\n                                                               131.\n\n410   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   410\n\n      It's too late. Selena stomps a heel into the Guard's\n      knee, crushing it, then twists the gun from his hands.\n      She points it at him and pulls the trigger, and...\n\n      In his agitation, the guard never took the safety off.\n      Selena glances quickly at the gun to find the safety.\n\n\n411   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   41\n\n      In the same moment, Gordy grabs the crowbar from the\n      ground.\n\n\n412   SELENA                                                          412\n\n      flicks off the safety and points the gun again.\n\n\n413   GORDY                                                           413\n\n      hurls the crowbar with all his might, and...\n\n\n414   NEW ANGLE                                                       414\n\n      The GUN FIRES, just as the crowbar hits Selena, spoiling\n      her aim. The bullet creases the guard's arm. Selena\n      recovers. And the next BULLET...\n\n\n415   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                   415\n\n      Isn't hers. It's from Phipps' GUN. It takes Selena in\n      the middle of the back and explodes her heart on its way\n      through her body. She's dead on her feet. Her body\n      crumples to the ground and empties its blood in a large\n      pool that quickly spreads over the slate.\n\n\n416   OTHER AGENTS                                                    416\n\n      move in to help the guard as Phipps holsters his pistol.\n      He walks to Gordy. The two men share a long, silent\n      look. It's over. Gordy looks again at Selena's body in\n      its pool of blood. Then turns and goes.\n\n\n417   BRANDT'S                                                        417\n\n      entering the courtyard as Gordy walks out.   Brandt's seen\n      Selena. He's smiling.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              132.\n\n417   CONTINUED:                                                     417\n\n                                 BRANDT\n                   We got the bitch.\n\n      Gordy hits him. One of the jackhammer blows he slammed\n      into Claudio in the bunker. A hard fist deep in the gut\n      that drives all the wind from Brandt and drops him to his\n      knees. Beat. Gordy's voice is cold and hard --\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   You're no better than she is.\n\n      And Gordy goes.\n\n\n418   INT. FIREHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                 418\n\n      Gordy cranks away on the repaired ice cream maker. He's\n      wearing civvies. He stops cranking, spoons out a huge\n      dollop into a bowl.\n\n\n419   INT. FIREHOUSE - TRUCK BAY                                     419\n\n      Gordy hands the bowl to Mauro, who's playing in the front\n      seat of the pumper. Mauro tastes it. Thumbs up. Gordy\n      smiles.\n\n      Mike and the other men on Gordy's old shift are watching.\n      To Gordy --\n\n                                 MIKE\n                   It'll be good to get you back.\n\n      Gordy turns to them. Looks into the faces of these men,\n      the people closest to him in the world. Beat. Then --\n\n                                 GORDY\n                   It's good to be home.\n\n      Gordy's still in pain, still missing the wife and son\n      he'll never see again. But Gordy's gonna be alright.\n\n      Mauro's gonna be with him. There'll be fires to put out\n      and lives to save and basketball games and the multitude\n      of miseries and joys the firefighters in Spanish Harlem\n      see each and every day.\n\n      As we PULL BACK, OUT and AWAY from the old brick edifice\n      from which the big red truck will come, bringing help...\n\n\n                                                    FADE OUT.\n\n\n                                 THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nCollateral Damage\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Ronald Roose\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:50.813698"}
