A\r\n          light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small\r\n          dog and a young girl emerge.\r\n\r\n                         GIRL\r\n          Go on now Paul, don't be long.\r\n\r\n          The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.\r\n          The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing\r\n          the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low\r\n          humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow\r\n          reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers\r\n          Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,\r\n          bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange\r\n          glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.\r\n\r\n                         GIRL\r\n          Paul... Paul?\r\n          The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.\r\n\r\n                         GIRL\r\n          Paul?!\r\n          The glow fades again.\r\n          MUSIC: \"The Boy In The Bubble\"\u009d by Paul Simon.\r\n\r\n                         TITLE: PAUL\r\n\r\n          EXT. SAN DIEGO STREET. PRESENT - DAY\r\n\r\n          GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the\r\n          blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM\r\n          is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy\r\n          hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears\r\n          a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His\r\n          hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.\r\n          Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM\r\n          and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps.\r\n          As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the\r\n          road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their\r\n          way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.\r\n\r\n          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. CONVENTION FLOOR - LATER\r\n\r\n          GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is\r\n          brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight,\r\n          the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of\r\n          the blade. He nods appreciatively.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Beautiful piece.\r\n\r\n                         VENDER\r\n          Damn straight.

CLIVE takes\r\n          the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with\r\n          MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background.

A banner hangs behind, displaying\r\n          the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini\r\n          rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser\r\n          whip.

The adjacent\r\n          toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter.

THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. TOILET - EVENING\r\n\r\n          CLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which\r\n          is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its\r\n          mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          That is absolutely amazing!\r\n\r\n          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN.

They have a\r\n          soap dispenser, shaped like an\r\n          alien's head. When you pump his\r\n          jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n\r\n                         (MUMBLING)\r\n          Clive...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          15.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          It's hilarious.\r\n          GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          What?\r\n          CLIVE looks over and sees the two men.

The two\r\n          men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of\r\n          drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd\r\n          looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.\r\n\r\n                         PAT\r\n          Okay then, beers for you gentleman.\r\n          A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt\r\n          with a sparkler for the boys from\r\n          outer space.\r\n          The man snigger derisively.

Long way to The Beehive.\r\n          PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look.

They leave. GRAHAM\r\n          comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker. PAT gives him\r\n          a wink. He leaves.\r\n\r\n          INT/EXT. RV - EVENING\r\n\r\n          GRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat.

THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a\r\n          moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door\r\n          opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches.\r\n          They wander over to a WHITE mailbox.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM/CLIVE\r\n\r\n                         (REVERENTIALLY)\r\n          The Black Mailbox.\r\n          GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it.

They look at it intently.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          Perhaps it's not them.

They are plunged into darkness,\r\n          still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Probably best not to do that. I\r\n          couldn't really see anything.\r\n          They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of\r\n          the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Oh God, oh God, oh God.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          I need the toilet.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Me too.\r\n          The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          They're trying to overtake.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          Don't let them get past.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Should I ram them?\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          What about the deposit?\r\n          CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A\r\n          BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to\r\n          avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes\r\n          widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times,\r\n          bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on\r\n          its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          It wasn't them.\r\n          The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and\r\n          CLIVE peer out of the window.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          We should see if they're okay.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          I still need a wee.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          I can hold mine.\r\n          GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE\r\n          remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled\r\n          Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          20.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          The bulb's gone in there.\r\n\r\n          EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          GRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car.\r\n          Inside are three unconscious men.

The glow of a\r\n          cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large,\r\n          black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          I rather think these men need help.\r\n          Graham, give me the phone.\r\n          GRAHAM passes the phone over.\r\n\r\n                         VOICE\r\n          Seriously, I wouldn't do that.\r\n          GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone\r\n          to his ear. We hear the operator.\r\n\r\n                         OPERATOR\r\n          911 Emergency. How may I direct\r\n          your call? Hello? Hello?\r\n          GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps\r\n          into the light. GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack. Standing in front\r\n          of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops... is an\r\n\r\n          ALIEN.\r\n\r\n                         ALIEN\r\n          Put - the phone - down.\r\n          Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks\r\n          backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump.\r\n          GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN.

It stands at roughly 3 feet tall.\r\n          His black almond shaped eye glint. His large head tilts to\r\n          one side, his small mouth opens slightly, his long fingers\r\n          clasp together, pleading.\r\n\r\n                         ALIEN\r\n          Please man, I need you.\r\n          GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          Okay then.\r\n\r\n                         ALIEN\r\n          Great.

Now let's get Cloverfield\r\n          onto the recreational vehicle and\r\n          get the fuck off MacArthur's Black\r\n          Mile.\r\n          They attempt to move CLIVE.

The door shuts, a few seconds\r\n          later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV.\r\n          He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV\r\n          starts up and drives off.\r\n\r\n          INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of\r\n          times.

THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          We hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a\r\n          dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited\r\n          man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first.\r\n          The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and\r\n          pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his\r\n          mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time.\r\n          Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A\r\n          SOLDIER approaches.\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          Sir?\r\n\r\n                         ZOIL\r\n          Talk to me.\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          Three survivors, company men, hurt\r\n          but alive.\r\n\r\n                         ZOIL\r\n          Anyone else?\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          No sir.\r\n          ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          What's this?\r\n          The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.\r\n          ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.\r\n\r\n                         CAPTAIN\r\n          What is it sir?

ZOIL stands, full of purpose.

From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear\r\n          the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He\r\n          notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to\r\n          see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the\r\n          bathroom door. The toilet flushes.\r\n          CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens.

They pull up to a gate.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          It's awfully quiet.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Just the way we like it.\r\n          PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on\r\n          the horn.\r\n\r\n          HOOOOOOONNNNK!\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Stop doing that!\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          Someone's coming.\r\n          PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.\r\n\r\n                         VOICE\r\n          Hello?\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          (quietly to Graham)\r\n          We're just a couple of regular guys\r\n          on a tour of the less touristy side\r\n          of the American midwest.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          I don't think she heard you.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          I was talking to you.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          Oh, sorry.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          48.\r\n\r\n                         VOICE\r\n          Hello?\r\n          GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid-\r\n          twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She\r\n          wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares\r\n          at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton\r\n          John's \"Hopelessly Devoted To You\"\u009d.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Hello Ruth.

GRAHAM\r\n          watches RUTH intently as they pass.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Doors to manual and cross check.\r\n          Graham?

RV PARK - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          RUTH is walking back to a static mobile home. From the RV we\r\n          hear GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp. RUTH furrows her brow, turns\r\n          back, and goes inside.\r\n\r\n          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          RUTH enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette.\r\n          From the ad-joining room we hear the sound of someone using a\r\n          police radio scanner. Garbled reports fade in and out. We\r\n          perhaps even hear ZOIL's voice briefly amid the static.\r\n\r\n          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)\r\n          What took you so long?\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          I was just talking.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          50.\r\n          RUTH stirs a pot on the stove.

It's in North\r\n          Western Europe.\r\n          The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands\r\n          the towering figure of MOSES BEHE. Almost as wide as he is\r\n          tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace.\r\n\r\n                         MOSES BEHE\r\n          Europe? I'll give you Europe,\r\n          missy. Now, get and make my supper.\r\n          MOSES lumbers off with the atlas.

RV - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          The door to the RV opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE jump in.

Fire's\r\n          my forte.\r\n          CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking\r\n          mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and\r\n          slams the door of the RV behind him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          CLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire. He flicks his\r\n          tongue out, summoning the flames higher. PAUL materializes\r\n          nearby, making CLIVE jump.

CLIVE opens\r\n          the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          Good morning.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Good morning.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          May I come in?\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          Yes.\r\n          CLIVE give GRAHAM a \"\u0098what the hell are you thinking?' Look as\r\n          RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          Was everything to your liking?\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Yes, thank you.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          Where's the other one?\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          The other one?\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          It's okay, we don't charge by the\r\n          person.

Um...\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          I'm in the can. I ate a closed\r\n          mollusc.\r\n          PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and\r\n          CLIVE look embarrassed.

He checks the passport and\r\n          finds CLIVE's absurd picture.

GO!\r\n          The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM\r\n          appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as\r\n          MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's\r\n          arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a\r\n          booming shot.

He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up\r\n          into her head. We see a lightening montage of images.

PARKING LOT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH explode out of the bar and run toward\r\n          the RV. The MEATHEADS crash out after them.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          What about Papa?!\r\n\r\n                         JAKE\r\n          Hey, we ain't finished with you.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          75.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Graham, take Ruth into the RV and\r\n          lock the door. I don't want either\r\n          of you to see this.\r\n          CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in\r\n          the face, he falls, nose bleeding.\r\n          They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The\r\n          MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL\r\n          stands silhouetted against the interior lights.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          Yo fucknuts!\r\n          The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few\r\n          feet from them, their eyes bulge.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          So, who wants to get probed first?\r\n          The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          Ha! Only one of us fainted!\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          Tell me you got the food?\r\n          CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food.\r\n          Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          It's them.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          Who?\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          It wasn't my fault. They answered\r\n          the phone. He knew all about us.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          Who?

MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as\r\n          the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks\r\n          eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he\r\n          doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night,\r\n          leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln\r\n          Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          76.\r\n\r\n          INT. RV - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The RV pulls off the road into a secluded lay-by.

It's been a long day what\r\n          with meeting you guys, being\r\n          abducted by and alien and having my\r\n          whole belief system called into\r\n          question.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          Sorry about that.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          It was amazing though, wasn't it?\r\n          Remember when Paul said \"\u0098Yo\r\n          fucknuts'?

Here\r\n          Clive.\r\n          RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief.

He goes to leave but turns back.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          I'd use a pen to push the tissues\r\n          off the bed. I've had a cold.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DESERTED TOWN - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          GRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag\r\n          of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing\r\n          store.

On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike\r\n          ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          You read this one?\r\n\r\n                         KEITH NASH\r\n          No.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          It's a good one. Take it.

The boys walk up the street, seconds later, HAGGARD\r\n          and O'REILLY step out of a store, eating bags of candy.\r\n\r\n          MRS.

The ZOIL style agent, shooting the\r\n          PAUL style alien. He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in\r\n          the entirely wrong direction.\r\n\r\n                         HAGGARD\r\n          South. Toward New Mexico, huh?\r\n          KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks\r\n          meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the\r\n          street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel.\r\n\r\n                         O'REILLY\r\n          We've got him man! We're going to\r\n          get a fucking promotion.\r\n\r\n                         HAGGARD\r\n          You did good kid.

WOODS - DAY\r\n\r\n          MOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire. He bends\r\n          down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now\r\n          stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking\r\n          hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up\r\n          the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up\r\n          is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber\r\n          towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Little\r\n          kid in the town said he saw an\r\n          alien. Said he was heading toward\r\n          New Mexico.\r\n\r\n                         ZOIL\r\n          And you were just gonna take off?\r\n\r\n                         HAGGARD\r\n          Thought it best to take the\r\n          initiative, sir. We were going to\r\n          radio you.\r\n\r\n                         ZOIL\r\n          Well now, that's mighty civil of\r\n          you. We have a chain of command. I\r\n          expect you to abide by it. Where\r\n          d'you say he was headed?\r\n\r\n                         HAGGARD\r\n          New Mexico sir.\r\n\r\n                         ZOIL\r\n          Well, then let's move it.\r\n          They scramble.\r\n\r\n                         ZOIL\r\n          Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting\r\n          ideas about your station again.\r\n          ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          91.\r\n\r\n          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAY\r\n\r\n          MOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his\r\n          hands and the wheel.

I want that little\r\n          fucker's brain in a jar by sundown.\r\n          MOSES smiles darkly.\r\n\r\n                         MOSES BEHE\r\n          Looks like you're going the wrong\r\n          way, Agent Zoil.

Creep in on the sign.\r\n\r\n          INT. RV - DAYBREAK\r\n\r\n          The RV is parked outside the firework warehouse. RUTH and\r\n          PAUL sit opposite each other at the dining table.

It's like existential\r\n          Prozac. Imagine being five year\r\n          sold and having no adults around to\r\n          tell you why it snows or what trees\r\n          are for. That's how it is for much\r\n          of humanity. Faith is a night-\r\n          light. It illuminates the scary\r\n          corners, fills the gaps, makes the\r\n          universe easier to comprehend.\r\n          Thing is, it's okay not to know\r\n          everything. I mean, who knows\r\n          what's really out there?

Well, then you get it, right?\r\n          If they have the theory, who's to\r\n          say at some point in the future\r\n          they won't put it into practice and\r\n          who's to say someone else didn't do\r\n          that 13.5 Billion years ago and\r\n          that's how the universe came to be?\r\n          Course, then we get the eternal\r\n          problem of who created the creator\r\n          but that's a whole other car park.\r\n          I think Shakespeare said it best.\r\n          \"There's more in Heaven and earth\r\n          than is dreamt of in your\r\n          philosophy Horatio\"\u009d.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          93.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          What did you call me?\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          Horatio.

Spent a very long time\r\n          trying to convince folk about what\r\n          happened that night. My parents, my\r\n          friends. Everyone thought I was\r\n          mad. They told me it was a meteor\r\n          that squashed little Paul. Took me\r\n          away and did tests they did, said\r\n          it was for cosmic radiation. They\r\n          said I was concussed,\r\n          hallucinating, but I knew you were\r\n          real. I pulled you from that\r\n          spaceship myself. Sat with you till\r\n          the men came and took you away. If\r\n          Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he\r\n          would have seen you too. They kept\r\n          telling me I'd imagined it but I\r\n          knew different.

He just used to\r\n          smile and say \"\u0098there, there Tara'.\r\n          He got sick when I was seventeen\r\n          and died a few years later. I\r\n          inherited this place. Word got out\r\n          about my story not long after it\r\n          happened, so I didn't really have\r\n          any friends. Kids used to throw\r\n          stones at the house and call me\r\n          names. I just kinda retreated into\r\n          myself. I'd spend whole nights up\r\n          on the roof, staring at the sky,\r\n          hoping to catch a glimpse of you\r\n          again. I always believed that one\r\n          day you\"\u0098d come back and here you\r\n          are.\r\n          The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out.\r\n\r\n                         TARA\r\n          Listen to me gabbing.

He was the first\r\n          man to climb the tower.\r\n\r\n                         TARA\r\n          I climbed up there in 1976. Thought\r\n          it would make a good site for some\r\n          UFO spotting.

SMALL ROAD - DUSK\r\n\r\n          ZOIL opens the trunk of his car. He pulls out a large piston,\r\n          spare ammo and a webbing pack which he slings around his\r\n          shoulder. He sets off up the hill.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          TEAM PAUL are walking round the tower. As they round the\r\n          corner the landscape changes, the trees give way to a piece\r\n          of open pasture flanked by pine forest, the tower opens\r\n          itself up slightly, a perfect natural amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          This is it.\r\n          PAUL takes out the firework, Zippo and cigarettes from his\r\n          back pack. He lights his last cigarette and takes a drag.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          I'll miss these.\r\n          PAUL takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the\r\n          ground. He crouches down and lights the touch paper with the\r\n          cigarette, then scampers back to the gang. Beat. The firework\r\n          rises into the sky. It explodes. The star-burst is massive\r\n          and bright red, it illuminates the tower.\r\n\r\n                         TARA\r\n          Pretty.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          What now?\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          We wait.\r\n          A light appears in the sky some way off.\r\n\r\n          PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (FROWNING)\r\n          That was quick.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          ZOIL runs through the bush, fast, like a wild animal. His\r\n          face fixed with serious intent, gun in one hand, torch in the\r\n          other.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          111.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          ZOIL leaps a fallen tree. Ahead, through the trees, he sees\r\n          an ethereal glow. He pulls the slide back on his pistol.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The lights are really close now. They are accompanied by a\r\n          deep rumble. A very earthly sound. Rotor blades.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          Wait a minute...\r\n          A HELICOPTER swoops in to land, kicking dust and debris into\r\n          the air. TEAM PAUL turn back to the woods but are stopped by\r\n          the sight of a torch getting nearer.\r\n\r\n          PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh shit.\r\n          Behind them, the HELICOPTER powers down. The door opens.\r\n\r\n                         VOICE\r\n          Well, whaddya know? Small world.\r\n          VOICE appears flanked by two faceless, heavily armed\r\n          SOLDIERS. They level their weapons, just as ZOIL bursts\r\n          through the trees behind them.\r\n\r\n                         ZOIL\r\n\r\n          PAUL!\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          Lorenzo?!\r\n          PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The\r\n          bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the\r\n          bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the\r\n          bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes\r\n          past him, slamming into one of the soldiers.\r\n          ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second\r\n          shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He\r\n          leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the\r\n          cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his\r\n          shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward,\r\n          holding a smoking gun.\r\n\r\n                         VOICE\r\n          It was you! You told him.

GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the\r\n          unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly,\r\n          blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke.\r\n          RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          Leave him alone!\r\n          VOICE hits out at RUTH.

Ruth,\r\n          shine the torch down here?\r\n          RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          114.\r\n          BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to\r\n          see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white,\r\n          his eyes wide.\r\n\r\n                         MOSES BEHE\r\n          Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          Noooooooooo!\r\n          GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of\r\n          blood around her mouth.\r\n\r\n                         MOSES BEHE\r\n          I...I never meant to shoot her. I\r\n          was aiming for the goblin.\r\n\r\n                         CLIVE\r\n          He's not a goblin he's from another\r\n          planet.\r\n\r\n                         MOSES BEHE\r\n          But he can't be. He... he...\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          He's an alien you stupid man! Oh\r\n          Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.\r\n          I should have never persuaded you\r\n          to come with us.\r\n          RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          What, and miss all this? Graham,\r\n          I've lived more in the last 48\r\n          hours that I ever did in that\r\n          trailer park. Isn't that what you\r\n          said living was all about? Right\r\n          now? This conversation? That tree?\r\n          My next cheeseburger? I'm not\r\n          afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold\r\n          though. Hey, where is everybody?\r\n          RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM\r\n          buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled\r\n          with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder.\r\n\r\n                         MOSES BEHE\r\n          What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so\r\n          sorry.\r\n          A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL,\r\n          silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          There is no way this thing isn't\r\n          gonna end happy.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          115.\r\n          PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest.\r\n          MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.\r\n\r\n                         MOSES BEHE\r\n          Get away from her! Don't you touch\r\n          my little girl.\r\n          CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums,\r\n          charged with static. PAUL's skin ripples with color. Everyone\r\n          watches transfixed. RUTH's eye flickers and opens. With some\r\n          difficulty, she sits up and takes off her glasses. She blinks\r\n          both shining, healthy eyes.\r\n\r\n                         GRAHAM\r\n          Ruth, are you okay?\r\n\r\n                         RUTH\r\n          I think so. Is anyone hungry? I\r\n          really feel like a cheese burger.\r\n          Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his\r\n          knees and sobs.
