ROY \"TIN CUP\" McAVOY\n    stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest\n    light, hitting golf balls. THWOCK...! Launching them,\n    really, into the deepening night. There's a beer between\n    his legs. Behind him:\n\n    A group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from Tin\n    Cup. These men are the range regulars: CURT, CLINT,\n    EARL, and DEWEY. Each man has money in one hand and his\n    preferred libation in the other. They're all looking\n    back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back\n    wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to:\n\n    ROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of\n    the group with a handful of cash. Romeo is a part-time\n    bookie and full-time driving range man.

ZAP! A BUG is ELECTROCUTED.

The regulars hold their breath, thinking this is\n     the end of Tin Cup's Open bid. But...\n\n     Tin Cup smiles and caresses the seven iron\n     affectionately.\n\n                             TIN CUP\n               But the seven iron, I never miss\n               the seven iron.
