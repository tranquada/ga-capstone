MARSHAL'S OFFICE - MCMURDO - DAY\n          \n          Carrie enters. Walks by a mirror. Takes a glance. Is\n          about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection --\n          what's the point? We notice a slight scar on her right\n          temple.\n          \n          She steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is\n          bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'.\n          \n          She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of\n          empty pages reading \"INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN:\n          None.\" On today's page she fills in the blanks with\n          \"Theft of botany sample.\" And \"None.\"\n          \n          A pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces.\n          Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up.\n          Just stares unhappily at the binder.\n          \n          Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the\n          cardboard tiles.\n          \n          She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a\n          row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform\n          graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other\n          girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday\n          cake in front of her.

FIRST TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Carrie peers in. It's too dark to see anything. She\n          goes to pull out her flashlight with her left hand --\n          stops herself. Reaches in with her right, extracts it\n          from her pocket.

There's a\n          pool of blood underneath. Her heart pounds. She uses\n          her flashlight, touches the sleeping bag. It doesn't\n          move. She pulls at it...\n          \n          ...and discovers A PAIR OF ECW PANTS -- the LEFT LEG is\n          soaked in blood.   No corpse.\n          \n          She steadies her breathing.

More stitches.\n          \n          She cuts through them. Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM\n          OF A CANNISTER that's been stuffed inside his chest. She\n          reaches in and pulls it out. Even has rust on the\n          bottom. Carrie's confused -- IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THE\n          CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF. It look more like\n          THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO.\n          \n          She contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her\n          hand on the top. Begins to twist. It loosens easily.\n          Pulls the lid off. Looks at it. Whatever it is, it's\n          frozen. Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a FOOT\n          LONG ICE CORE SAMPLE. Can't quite figure it out, until\n          she shines her light on it --\n          \n          The freezer DANCES WITH GLISTENING LIGHT. The core\n          sample is PACKED FULL OF DIAMONDS. She looks to the\n          other two bodies.\n          \n          She opens Mooney's bag. Sees his chest is uneven -- more\n          cylinders inside. Repeats the action with Rubin.
