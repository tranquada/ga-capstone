It does state that\r\n                  you have a right to chose your own\r\n                  medical care but that is interpreted as\r\n                  medical care that is approved by the Food\r\n                  and Drug Administration.\r\n\r\n      The Judge looks over to the FDA table.\r\n\r\n<b>                            JUDGE\r\n</b>                  Regarding the FDA, the court is highly\r\n                  disturbed by its bullying tactics and\r\n                  direct interference with a drug whose own\r\n                  agency has found to be non-toxic. The\r\n                  FDA was formed to protect people, not\r\n                  prevent them from getting help.\r\n\r\n      The Judge sighs.\r\n\r\n<b>                            JUDGE\r\n</b>                  The law does not seem to make much common\r\n                  sense. If a person has been found to be\r\n                  terminally ill they ought to be able to\r\n                  take just about any drug they feel will\r\n                  help... but that is not the law. Mr.\r\n                  Woodroof, there is not a person in this\r\n                  courtroom who is not moved to compassion\r\n                  by your plight, what is lacking here is\r\n                  the legal authority to intervene. I'm\r\n                  sorry. This case is hereby dismissed.\r\n\r\n      The Judge bangs the gavel.\r\n\r\n      David Wayne raises in frustration.

Ron nods, takes a deep breath, swings\r\n      his legs over the railing, straddles the stall, stays above\r\n      the animal.

Based    on this knowledge, great strides have\r\nbeen made in treating   this infection with anti-HIV medications\r\nbut a cure has yet to   be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe first studies with AZT as a single drug (monotherapy)\r\nwhile showing initial good results did not ultimately prove to\r\nbe a long term solution for HIV treatment.\r\n\r\nBy 1996, medical researchers learned that HIV is best treated\r\nwith a combination cocktail of at least three HIV medications.\r\nAZT was frequently used as a part of these early combination\r\ntherapies. Today, AZT has been largely replaced by safer, new\r\nHIV medications.                                                     *\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Dallas-Buyers-Club.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Dallas Buyers Club</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Craig Borten\" title=\"Scripts by Craig Borten\">Craig Borten</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Melisa Wallack\" title=\"Scripts by Melisa Wallack\">Melisa Wallack</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Dallas Buyers Club Script.html#comments\" title=\"Dallas Buyers Club comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:03:06.203787"}
