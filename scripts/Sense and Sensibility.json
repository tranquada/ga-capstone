The bulrushes catch his eye and he slows, then \n               stops. He stands for a moment deep in thought.

ELINOR is transfixed by this strangely erotic \n               moment. WILLOUGHBY senses her gaze and looks over. She snaps \n               her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she \n               has written 'Edward' at the top of the sheet.

She smiles kindly at BRANDON.\n\n<b>                                     MARIANNE\n</b>                         I should be delighted to join you, \n                         Colonel!\n\n               The COLONEL helps her into the curricle, exchanging nods \n               with WILLOUGHBY, who is regarding him with some suspicion.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                         Good morning, Miss Dashwood; good \n                         morning, Colonel.\n\n<b>                                     MARIANNE\n</b>                         The Colonel has invited us to \n                         Delaford, Willoughby!\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                         Excellent. I understand you have a \n                         particularly fine pianoforte, Colonel.\n\n               The undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense.\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL BRANDON\n</b>                         A Broadwood Grand.\n\n<b>                                     MARIANNE\n</b>                         A Broadwood Grand! Then I shall really \n                         be able to play for you!\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                         We shall look forward to it!\n\n               MARIANNE smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up \n               the horses. They drive off, waving their farewells.\n\n               BRANDON looks after them for a silent moment, and then \n               collects himself and turns to ELINOR, who is less than \n               satisfied with their behaviour.\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL BRANDON\n</b>                         Your sister seems very happy.\n\n<b>                                     ELINOR\n</b>                         Yes. Marianne does not approve of \n                         hiding her emotions. In fact, her \n                         romantic prejudices have the \n                         unfortunate tendency to set propriety \n                         at naught.\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL BRANDON\n</b>                         She is wholly unspoilt.\n\n<b>                                     ELINOR\n</b>                         Rather too unspoilt, in my view. The \n                         sooner she becomes acquainted with \n                         the ways of the world, the better.\n\n               COLONEL BRANDON looks at her sharply and then speaks very \n               deliberately, as though controlling some powerful emotion.\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL BRANDON\n</b>                         I knew a lady like your sister--the \n                         same impulsive sweetness of temper--\n                         who was forced into, as you put it, \n                         a better acquaintance with the world. \n                         The result was only ruination and \n                         despair.\n\n               He stops, and briskly remounts his horse.\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL BRANDON\n</b>                         Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.\n\n<b>               EXT. BARTON PARK - DRIVE - DAY\n</b>\n               People and carriages fill the drive, the sun shines and the \n               atmosphere is pleasantly expectant. SIR JOHN is organising \n               the provision of blankets and parasols and COLONEL BRANDON \n               is busy furnishing the DRIVERS with their routes. There are \n               three new faces a pretty, blowsy WOMAN (CHARLOTTE PALMER), a \n               stony-faced MAN (MR PALMER) and an exceedingly good-looking \n               GIRL (LUCY STEELE), who are standing with ELINOR, MARIANNE, \n               MARGARET, MRS JENNINGS and MRS DASHWOOD.\n\n               MARIANNE is standing slightly apart, looking out along the \n               road, impatient for WILLOUGHBY.\n\n<b>                                     MRS JENNINGS\n</b>                         Imagine my surprise, Mrs Dashwood, \n                         when Charlotte and her lord and master \n                         appeared with our cousin Lucy! The \n                         last person I expected to see! 'Where \n                         did you pop out from, Miss?' says I. \n                         I was never so surprised to see anyone \n                         in all my life!\n\n               LUCY STEELE smiles shyly and looks at the ground.

It was the Misses \n                         Dashwood she wanted to see, not \n                         Delaford, Mamma! I have heard nothing \n                         but 'Miss Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood \n                         that' for I don't know how long! And \n                         what do you think of them now you do \n                         see them, Lucy? My mother has talked \n                         of nothing else in her letters since \n                         you came to Barton, Mrs Dashwood.

Do you know you are \n                         quite rude today? He is to be an MP, \n                         you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is \n                         very fatiguing for him for he is \n                         forced to make everybody like him--\n                         he says it is quite shocking--\n\n<b>                                     MRS PALMER\n</b>                         I never said anything so irrational. \n                         Don't palm all your abuses of the \n                         language upon me.\n\n<b>                                     MRS JENNINGS\n</b>                              (to Mrs Dashwood)\n                         Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always \n                         out of humour.\n\n               MR PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under siege. \n               WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle. MARIANNE waves \n               to him with a radiant smile. MRS JENNINGS nudges CHARLOTTE \n               and points to MARIANNE.\n\n<b>                                     MRS JENNINGS\n</b>                         Here he is! Now you shall see, \n                         Charlotte.\n\n               WILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible, making \n               her laugh.\n\n<b>                                     MRS JENNINGS\n</b>                         How now, Mr Willoughby!

WILLOUGHBY inclines his head politely, \n               leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in. MRS JENNINGS \n               coos and chuckles at them. CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLOTTE\n</b>                         I know Mr Willoughby extremely well--\n                         not that I ever spoke to him but I \n                         have seen him forever in town. Your \n                         sister is monstrous lucky to get \n                         him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is \n                         in love with her as well, which is a \n                         very great compliment for he hardly \n                         ever falls in love with anyone.\n\n               ELINOR smiles politely. WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle out to \n               the front of the drive. CHARLOTTE points after them and laughs \n               with MRS JENNINGS. LUCY edges up beside ELINOR.\n\n<b>                                     LUCY\n</b>                         May I beg a seat beside you, Miss \n                         Dashwood? I have so longed to make \n                         your better acquaintance! I have \n                         heard nothing but the highest praise \n                         for you.\n\n               ELINOR is relieved to change the subject.\n\n<b>                                     ELINOR\n</b>                         I would be delighted. But Sir John \n                         and Mrs Jennings are too excessive \n                         in their compliments. I am sure to \n                         disappoint.\n\n<b>                                     LUCY\n</b>                         No, for it was from quite another \n                         source that I heard you praised and \n                         one not at all inclined to \n                         exaggeration.\n\n               LUCY speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though \n               not wanting anyone else to hear. At that moment a HORSEMAN \n               thunders up the drive towards them. Everyone turns to face \n               the new arrival.\n\n<b>                                     SIR JOHN\n</b>                         What can this be?\n\n               It is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long, hard ride. \n               He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter, which \n               BRANDON tears open. MRS JENNINGS is puce with suppressed \n               curiosity.\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL BRANDON\n</b>                         My horse!

Impossible!\n\n               Everyone gathers round BRANDON, who is, naturally, mortified. \n               A SERVANT brings up the COLONEL's horse.\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL BRANDON\n</b>                         Imperative.\n\n               There is a murmur of disappointment from the party. SIR JOHN \n               is embarrassed and protests again.\n\n<b>                                     SIR JOHN\n</b>                         But Brandon, we are all assembled. \n                         We cannot picnic at Delaford without \n                         our host!

His grave urgency \n               silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone \n               stunned and, of course, deeply curious. Then they all start \n               to talk at once. LUCY is still next to ELINOR.\n\n<b>                                     LUCY\n</b>                         Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it! \n                         Just when I was to have the \n                         opportunity of speaking with you.\n\n<b>               EXT.

I think he \n                         wrote the letter himself as a trick \n                         for getting out of it.\n\n<b>                                     MRS DASHWOOD\n</b>                              (indulgently)\n                         You are a very wicked pair, Colonel \n                         Brandon will be sadly missed.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                         Why? When he is the kind of man that \n                         everyone speaks well of and no one \n                         wants to talk to.\n\n<b>                                     MARIANNE\n</b>                         Exactly!\n\n<b>                                     ELINOR\n</b>                         Nonsense.\n\n<b>                                     MRS DASHWOOD\n</b>                         Colonel Brandon is very highly \n                         esteemed at the Park.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                         Which is enough censure in itself.\n\n<b>                                     ELINOR\n</b>                              (half laughing)\n                         Really, Willoughby!\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                              (imitating Mrs Jennings \n                              perfectly)\n                         Come, come, Mr Impudence--I know you \n                         and your wicked ways--oh!\n\n               He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing \n               her walk. He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on her \n               shoulder.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                         Come, Miss Dashwood, reveal your \n                         beau, reveal him, I say! Let's have \n                         no secrets between friends! Let me \n                         winkle them out of you!\n\n               ELINOR hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles \n               off to MARIANNE.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                              (as Mrs Jennings)\n                         I declare, Miss Marianne, if I do \n                         not have you married to the Colonel \n                         by teatime, I shall swallow my own \n                         bonnet.\n\n               MARIANNE laughs. WILLOUGHBY drops the parody suddenly.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                         As if you could marry such a \n                         character.\n\n<b>                                     ELINOR\n</b>                         Why should you dislike him?\n\n               There is indeed an edge to WILLOUGHBY's raillery. He flicks \n               ELINOR an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps MARIANNE to \n               her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                         Because he has threatened me with \n                         rain when I wanted it fine, he has \n                         found fault with the balance of my \n                         curricle and I cannot persuade him \n                         to buy my brown mare. If it will be \n                         of any satisfaction to you, however, \n                         to be told I believe his character \n                         to be in all other respects \n                         irreproachable, I am ready to confess \n                         it. And in return for an \n                         acknowledgement that must give me \n                         some pain.\n                              (he is slowing down)\n                         You cannot deny me the privilege...\n                              (slower still)\n                         of disliking him...\n                              (and stopping)\n                         as much as I adore...\n\n               He and MARIANNE are standing looking at each other. The \n               expression on WILLOUGHBY's face is heart-stopping. MARGARET \n               has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open.\n\n               ELINOR glances at MRS DASHWOOD but she is gazing up at them \n               with almost as many stars in her eyes as MARIANNE.\n\n               Suddenly WILLOUGHBY breaks the mood by swinging away from \n               MARIANNE and gesturing to the house.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                         --this cottage!\n\n               The tension is broken.

He is coming to propose.\n\n<b>               EXT. LONDON TENEMENTS - NIGHT\n</b>\n               A district of extreme poverty, populated by the LOWLIFE of \n               LONDON: FOOTPADS, dogs, rats and SCAVENGERS of all kinds. In \n               the distance a tavern belches forth drunken REVELLERS who \n               sway and reel into the night.\n\n               A hooded HORSEMAN pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance \n               to a slum. He dismounts and looks up at one of the windows. \n               The rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for \n               him. He strides inside.\n\n<b>               INT.

We follow him up the stairs to \n               a door which is opened by an OLDER WOMAN.\n\n<b>               INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               He enters a bare room partitioned with filthy rags hung from \n               the ceiling and lit with stinking tallow lamps. At the window \n               stands the slight figure of a VERY YOUNG WOMAN. She turns. \n               BRANDON reacts with a tender smile which stiffens into an \n               expression of deep shock. We see her silhouette. She is \n               heavily pregnant. She bursts into tears and runs into his \n               arms.\n\n<b>               INT.

Suddenly, MARIANNE \n               bursts out of the parlour sobbing, and disappears into the \n               room opposite.

She wheels round to face her new \n               partner. It is WILLOUGHBY! They both stop dancing and stare \n               at each other aghast. A traffic jam starts and they are forced \n               to take hands and resume the steps.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                              (stiff)\n                         How do you do, Miss Dashwood?\n\n               ELINOR does not know quite how to respond.\n\n<b>                                     ELINOR\n</b>                         I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby.\n\n               She looks about for MARIANNE, instinctively wanting to keep \n               her away from WILLOUGHBY.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                         How is your--family?\n\n<b>                                     ELINOR\n</b>                              (cold)\n                         We are all extremely well, Mr \n                         Willoughby--thank you for your kind \n                         inquiry.\n\n               WILLOUGHBY is shamed into silence. Then he sees MARIANNE. At \n               the same moment the music pauses. MARIANNE looks up. In the \n               brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across \n               the room.\n\n<b>                                     MARIANNE\n</b>                         Willoughby!\n\n               Everyone turns to look as MARIANNE rushes towards him with \n               both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. As the \n               noise of the room builds again and PEOPLE change their \n               partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching. \n               MARIANNE reaches him but WILLOUGHBY stands with his arms \n               frozen at his side. MARIANNE gives a little confused laugh.\n\n<b>                                     MARIANNE\n</b>                         Good God, Willoughby!

Behind her, MRS \n               JENNINGS is giving an animated commentary to FANNY and JOHN, \n               while LUCY whispers in ROBERT's ear as they go past to join \n               the set.\n\n<b>                                     WILLOUGHBY\n</b>                              (strangled)\n                         How do you do, Miss Marianne?\n\n<b>                                     MARIANNE\n</b>                         Willoughby, what is the matter?

She whispers with \n               urgent effort.\n\n<b>                                     MARIANNE\n</b>                         Where is Elinor?\n\n<b>                                     ELINOR\n</b>                         I am here, dearest, I am here.\n\n               MARIANNE looks at her with deep relief. Behind the DASHWOODS, \n               BRANDON stands at the door, unwilling to intrude on this \n               intimacy. He wipes his eyes and turns away.

A piece of \n               rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden. \n               It starts to wave about wildly and we see MARGARET emerging \n               and climbing down.

Then, in London, when you told \n                         me of the Colonel's offer, I became \n                         convinced that you wanted me to marry \n                         Lucy and that--well, that you and \n                         Colonel Brandon...\n\n<b>                                     ELINOR\n</b>                         Me and Colonel Brandon!\n\n<b>                                     EDWARD\n</b>                         I shall not forget attempting to \n                         thank him for making it possible for \n                         me to marry the woman I did not love \n                         while convinced he had designs upon \n                         the woman I did--do--love.\n\n               EDWARD stops walking. He looks at ELINOR and realises he can \n               stand it no longer.\n\n<b>                                     EDWARD\n</b>                         Would you--can you--excuse me--\n\n               He takes her face in his hands and kisses her.\n\n<b>               EXT. PATH TO BARTON CHURCH - DAY\n</b>\n               A group of VILLAGE CHILDREN run down the hillside towards \n               the church waving ribbons and dressed in their Sunday best.\n\n<b>               EXT. BARTON VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY\n</b>\n               A large wedding party is gathered outside the church. The \n               entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS, \n               SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS JENNINGS in \n               a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR PALMER, SIR JOHN, \n               MRS DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed \n               in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in \n               regimental uniform.\n\n               The path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and \n               everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start \n               to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and \n               BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft.\n\n               The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and \n               COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in \n               his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour.\n\n               CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE \n               and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their \n               flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage \n               decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON \n               lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he \n               radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely \n               happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her \n               seem much older.\n\n               According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large \n               handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN \n               jump and dive for them.\n\n               The coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One \n               hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards \n               into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession \n               makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into \n               the surrounding countryside.\n\n               Then we see, on the far edge of frame, very small, a MAN \n               sitting on a white horse, watching. It is WILLOUGHBY. As we \n               draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around \n               and moves off in the opposite direction.\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Sense and Sensibility</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Jane Austen\" title=\"Scripts by Jane Austen\">Jane Austen</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Emma Thompson\" title=\"Scripts by Emma Thompson\">Emma Thompson</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Sense and Sensibility Script.html#comments\" title=\"Sense and Sensibility comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:15:31.564096"}
