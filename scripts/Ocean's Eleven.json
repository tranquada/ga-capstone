CHANGING CUBICLE                                         4\n\n     Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare\n     thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The\n     old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver\n     wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on?\n\n\n5    EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON         5\n\n     A sign reads: \"NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY\n     CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.\" Someone has graffitied below it:\n     \"If you were in prison, you'd be home now.\"\n\n     The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its\n     frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you\n     notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)\n\n     He hovers   there for a moment, on the precipice of\n     freedom.    The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of\n     the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New\n     Jersey):    Life is hard out there.\n\n     But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step\n     into free America...\n\n\nA6   EXT.

And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red\n     carpeting.\n\n     As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we\n     hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of\n     CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK\n     from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS.\n\n     And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair\n     and a snifter of brandy. He's home.\n\n\n     ON DANNY'S WALLET\n\n     As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on\n     green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of\n     chips.\n\n                                                             4.\n\n7   AT BLACKJACK TABLE                                            7\n\n    Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for\n    someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but\n    without success. He turns his attention back to his\n    cards, and the cards of the dealer.\n\n    Nine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins.\n    King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts.\n    Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again.\n\n    A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes\n    him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was\n    scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar\n    face is welcome.\n\n                               DANNY\n              Hello, Frank.\n\n    The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and\n    his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's\n    dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He\n    quickly hides his astonishment.\n\n                            FRANK\n              I beg your pardon, sir. You must\n              have me confused with someone\n              else. My name is Ramon. See?\n\n    He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is\n    the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen. A pit\n    boss circles close by and glares at them both.\n\n                            DANNY\n              My mistake...\n                     (collecting his chips,\n                      doubled)\n              Table's cold anyway.\n\n                            FRANK\n              You might try the lounge at the\n              Grand, sir.

He nurses a bourbon,\n    folds back the New York Times and scans.\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n    OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00                               5.\n\n8   CONTINUED:                                                     8\n\n    His eyes move down the page and stop at a header --\n    \"Vegas' Paradiso to be Razed; Former Owner Denounces\n    Plans\" -- accompanied by two photographs...\n\n    The first: Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of\n    the Paradiso, Terry Benedict, with a beautiful (if barely\n    visible) woman on his arm.

And his face falls.\n\n     All he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a\n     calling card. On one side, in engraved printing:\n     \"DANIEL OCEAN.\" On the flip side, in handwriting: \"Nice\n     pull. Murphy's Bar, Rush & Division.\"\n\n\n53   INT.

That's when\n                   we make our move...\n\n      Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the\n      vault's center and march out again, closing the thick\n      metal door behind them. When the vault LOCKS CLICK...\n\n      ... We STOP DESCENDING, just above the cash cart. There\n      is silence for a spell, the lights flicker out, then...\n\n      ... the false top of the cart springs open, revealing Yen\n      within, folded neatly.\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n      OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                                 78.\n\n115   CONTINUED:                                                     115\n\n      He inhales deeply, then slowly unspools himself from the\n      cash cart until, at last, he crouches atop it. He takes\n      in the room: vacant and silent.\n\n      Except for Rusty, who walks right by him, incongruously.\n\n                                 RUSTY\n                   Okay: they've put you in the\n                   middle of the room, far from\n                   everything.

Ten of\n      the eleven (Turk and Virgil in guard costumes, Basher is\n      still missing) watch from offstage, like a film crew\n      watching a dress rehearsal.\n\n                                 FRANK\n                   Fin says he shorts it.\n\n                                 LIVINGSTON\n                   Make it a sawbuck.\n\n      From a dead squat, Yen leaps, hands first, from the cash\n      cart to a ledge five yards away, and grips it safely with\n      both hands without touching the floor. From this\n      position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the\n      door...\n\n      Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to\n      see Basher, at last. Sniffing the air, he double-takes\n      -- Basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage.\n\n                                 BASHER\n                          (and he's not happy)\n                   We're in deep shit.\n\n\n117   EXT.

LAB - DAY                                                  120\n\n       Scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a\n       glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator.\n\n                                  BASHER (V.O.)\n                    A pinch is the equivalent of a\n                    cardiac arrest for any broad-band\n                    electrical circuitry. Or better\n                    yet: A pinch is a bomb... but\n                    without the bomb. Every time a\n                    nuclear weapon detonates, it\n                    unleashes an electromagnetic pulse\n                    which shuts down any power source\n                    within its vicinity. That tends\n                    not to matter in most cases\n                    because the nuclear weapon\n                    destroys everything you might need\n                    power for anyway. Now a pinch\n                    creates a similar electromagnetic\n                    pulse, but without the headache of\n                    mass destruction and death. So\n                    instead of Hiroshima, you get the\n                    Seventeenth Century.\n\n\nA121   INT.
