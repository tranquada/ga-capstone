The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of\n     the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New\n     Jersey):    Life is hard out there.\n\n     But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step\n     into free America...\n\n\n<b>A6   EXT.

Dealer busts.\n    Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again.\n\n    A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes\n    him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was\n    scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar\n    face is welcome.\n\n<b>                               DANNY\n</b>              Hello, Frank.\n\n    The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and\n    his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's\n    dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself.

Or better\n                    yet: A pinch is a bomb... but\n                    without the bomb. Every time a\n                    nuclear weapon detonates, it\n                    unleashes an electromagnetic pulse\n                    which shuts down any power source\n                    within its vicinity. That tends\n                    not to matter in most cases\n                    because the nuclear weapon\n                    destroys everything you might need\n                    power for anyway. Now a pinch\n                    creates a similar electromagnetic\n                    pulse, but without the headache of\n                    mass destruction and death.
