THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR\n     THIS SOFT COPY.\n\n\n\n\n     INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n     We're in a large closet.  JACK KIEFER, an athletic American\n     in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a\n     corner, staring at a television screen.\n\n     The television shows a surveillance view of the living room\n     that lies outside the confines of the closet.  The TV image\n     is in black and white.  JACK shifts, trying like hell to get\n     comfortable but he's been there a while\n\n     ON THE SCREEN\n\n     A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel\n     room.  Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits\n     in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T-\n     shirt.  There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the\n     room behind him.  A legend:\n\n                          KIEV\n\n     KASIMOV is sobbing.  Uncontrollably.  A MAN enters the room,\n     ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian\n     godfather.  The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out.  ANATOLY\n     looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit\n     by him in a chair he picks up for him.  KASIMOV does as he is\n     bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY.  They speak in Russian\n     which is subtitled.\n\n                          ANATOLY\n                Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called\n                us.\n\n                          KASIMOV\n                     (sobbing)\n                I don't remember what happened!  We were\n                at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having\n                fun.\n\n     ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the\n     room.  A WOMAN lies half under the sheets.  She's lying in an\n     unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared\n     with blood.  She's dead.  ANATOLY lifts her eyelid.\n\n                          KASIMOV\n                I don't even know how I got here.\n                I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I\n                didn't lay a finger on her.\n\n     ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN.\n\n                          ANATOLY\n                Kasimov.  Don't flounder.\n\n     IN THE CLOSET\n\n     JACK, impatient, checks his watch. \n\n                          JACK \n                Jesus, she's been under too long.  Come \n                on, come on! \n\n     ON THE SCREEN \n\n                          KASIMOV \n                You're the only one who can help me. \n\n     Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket.  But ANATOLY hits \n     his hand away and smacks him around the head. \n\n     IN THE CLOSET \n\n     JACK reacts. \n\n     ON THE SCREEN\n\n     ANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV. \n\n                          ANATOLY \n                C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. \n\n                          KASIMOV \n                They'll kill me. \n\n     ANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV. \n\n                          ANATOLY \n                You asked for my help.  You asked for my\n                help...come on... \n\n                          KASIMOV\n                You're right, of course. \n\n     IN THE CLOSET \n\n     JACK leans forward. \n\n                          JACK \n                The name pal...give us the name. \n\n     ON THE SCREEN \n\n                          KASIMOV \n                The contact in Minsk..the contact in \n                Minsk..works in a travel agency. \n\n     IN THE CLOSET \n\n                          JACK \n                Come on! \n\n     ON THE SCREEN \n\n                          ANATOLY \n                Come on! \n\n                          KASIMOV \n                His name is.....Dimitri Miediev. \n\n                          ANATOLY \n                Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev... \n\n     IN THE CLOSET \n\n                          JACK \n                Got him. \n\n     ON THE SCREEN \n\n     Back on screen, ANATOLY places a hand on KASIMOV'S shoulder\n     as if he had just anointed him. \n\n     IN THE CLOSET \n\n     In the closet, JACK types the name into a computer and cross \n     checks -- \"MIEDIEV\" comes up, then \"posting/American \n     consulate/Kiev.\" \n\n     JACK turns and nods to a WHOREHOUSE WAITRESS in costume in \n     the closet next to him, dressed in traditional Russian tunic \n     and virtually no bottom.  She quickly leaves. \n\n     INT. SHABBY ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     We enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does. \n     She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot \n     glasses. \n\n                          ANATOLY \n                Now, we drink. \n\n     He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV. \n\n                          ANATOLY (CONT'D) \n                To friends. \n\n                          KASIMOV \n                Yes, Anatoly, yes. \n\n                          JACK \n                Cheers. \n\n     He drinks.  He blinks.  Something felt funny about that. \n     Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY \n     moves to the closet door and opens it. \n\n     IN THE CLOSET \n\n     ANATOLY reaches up to his face --\n\n     --and tears away a mask of flesh.  He's no middle aged \n     Russian mobster, he's ETHAN HUNT, an American in his early \n     thirties.  He gestures to KASIMOV contemptuously.  JACK hands \n     ETHAN a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the \n     room. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                     (in English now) \n                Get rid of this scum. \n\n     Immediately, there is activity, and PEOPLE everywhere.  TWO \n     OTHERS come into the room and carry KASIMOV out. \n\n     ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks \n     the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He \n     strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the \n     dead woman's thigh.  He checks her pulse again, checking a \n     stopwatch.  In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open. \n\n     CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half \n     rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her \n     mouth. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                Did we get it? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                We got it.  On your feet. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Walk, just walk.  Start walking. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                I'm walking. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Talking's good, walking's better. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                Sleeping's better. \n\n     Meanwhile, MEN in overalls take apart the room.  The ceiling \n     lifts right off the walls, and the walls themselves start to \n     come down, revealing the \"hotel room\" to be an elaborate set \n     in the middle of an empty warehouse. \n\n     JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE \n     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN \n     stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him \n     questioningly. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                Are you all right Ethan.  What's wrong\n                with you? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                If you're gonna do this again Claire, \n                It's not gonna be on my watch. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                Oh yeah? \n\n     JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE \n     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN \n     stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him, \n     questioningly. \n\n                          JACK \n                Claire. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Jack. \n\n     She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her \n     finger.  ETHAN notices.  He turns and SHOUTS to the room at \n     large. \n\n                          ETHAN\n                IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT \n                OUT OF HERE YET?! \n\n                          JACK \n                Just waiting for you, tubs. \n\n     He walks across the room and out the door.  CLAIRE, worried, \n     clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding \n     ring. \n\n     We move in on it --\n\n                                                            CUT TO: \n\n     INT. JET - DAY\n\n     -- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a MAN's \n     finger. One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the \n     plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner.  He shoves \n     some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a \n     fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE. \n\n     The pilot's voice makes an announcement. \n\n                          VOICE (O.S.)\n                Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off \n                at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight \n                thousand feet-and we should be arriving \n                in Prague right on schedule. \n\n     A FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats, passing \n     out menus. \n\n                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT \n                Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? \n\n     A passenger takes one.  The ATTENDANT continues on. \n\n                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT \n                          (CONT'D) \n                Would you like to watch a movie Mr \n                Phelps? \n\n     The MAN with the wedding ring looks up.  JIM PHELPS is in his \n     mid-forties, good-looking, intense.  He's a tired man, and \n     not just now, it's a profound fatigue.  He looks up at the \n     ATTENDANT and smiles warmly. \n\n                          PHELPS \n                No, I prefer the theatre.  \n\n     A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes \n     stilted. \n\n                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT \n                Would you consider the cinema of the\n                Ukraine? \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Perhaps you'd choose one for me. \n\n     The ATTENDANT turns and walks away.  PHELPS sits back, shakes \n     a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the \n     armrest. \n\n     AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN.\n\n     The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8 \n     cassettes of feature films.  She opens a panel in the top of \n     the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there. \n\n     BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT\n\n     The ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS. \n     He takes it without a word and she moves on. \n\n     PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between \n     his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small \n     movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the \n     other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the \n     armrest, and puts the tape in. \n\n     He presses play.\n\n     ON THE TAPE, \n\n     the image of a man comes on.  EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, \n     but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed \n     glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than \n     tieless.  But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever \n     look away.  He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                     (on the tape) \n                Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're \n                about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- \n\n     The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man \n     in his forties.  The image is herky-jerky videotape, \n     presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks \n     down a foreign street. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) \n                -- a former KGB Line X officer now \n                working the international black market \n                selling intelligence.  This morning, we \n                learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half \n                of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- \n                official cover agents working in Eastern \n                Europe. \n\n     The screen shows an image of what such a list might look \n     like, code names and other information scrolling by on a \n     computer screen at high speed. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) \n                For security reasons, the NOC list is \n                divided into two encoded halves. \n                Golitsyn already has the cryptonym \n                portion, which contains agent code names \n                and targeting areas.  This portion is \n                useless unless combined with the second \n                half -- the true name list that is kept \n                in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. \n\n     The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building \n     at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava \n     River. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) \n                We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the \n                true name list at an Embassy function \n                tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you \n                decide to accept it, is to obtain \n                photographic proof of the theft, apprehend \n                those involved, and return the stolen \n                list.  I don't have to stress the \n                importance of this matter, Jim.  We're \n                keeping it internally black. Because of  \n                its urgency, I've already sent to Prague \n                a team selected from your usual group. \n\n     Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already \n     seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) \n                Ethan Hunt will of course be your point \n                man, as usual.  He's in Kiev; we're \n                getting word to him now. \n\n     INT. JET - DAY\n\n     PHELPS sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his \n     tired brow.  KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) \n                As always, should you or any member of \n                your IM force be caught or killed, the \n                Secretary will disavow all knowledge of \n                your actions.  This tape will self- \n                destruct in five seconds.  Good luck, \n                Jim! \n\n     PHELPS inhales deeply -- \n\n     -- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder, sending up a \n     plume of wispy smoke -- \n\n     -- and PHELPS exhales, concealing the plume in a cloud of \n     cigarette smoke. \n\n                                                            CUT TO: \n\n     EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - DAY\n\n     SARAH and HANNA, a German woman in her mid-thirties enter. \n     Another legend: \n\n                         PRAGUE \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - PRAGUE - DAY \n\n     The IMF team's safe house is a sparsely furnished Prague \n     apartment with a panoramic view of the city. \n\n     The IMF team is scattered around the room. Sketches, pads, \n     overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere. \n     JACK and SARAH seated next to each other - JACK demonstrating \n     the VISCO glasses to her.  CLAIRE is seated opposite JACK at \n     the computer.  JIM and ETHAN are in the kitchen.  HANNAH \n     taking a roll of black-out curtain through the room. \n\n                          JACK \n                Look to your right, then back to me. \n                There's a camera built right into the \n                bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and \n                transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?\n\n                          SARAH \n                Of course I can hear you. \n\n                          JACK \n                No, in your...ear piece. You have a \n                lovely smile (eyes). Can you hear me \n                now? \n\n                          SARAH \n                Loud and clear. \n\n                          JACK \n                What's going on? \n\n                          SARAH \n                I don't know. \n\n                          JACK \n                Why don't you take a look? \n\n                          SARAH \n                Jack...that's spying. \n\n                          JACK \n                That's what we do isn't it? \n\n                          SARAH \n                Jack you're so wicked. \n\n                          JACK \n                Too wicked to have a drink later? \n\n                          SARAH \n                I think I might just take that look. \n\n     ETHAN and JIM PHELPS are in a heated conversation. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more \n                than ninety days leave coming. \n\n                          PHELPS \n                A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. \n                Take it all, if you want.  After this one. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                I thought I'd take some now. \n\n                          PHELPS\n                     (quietly, to Ethan) \n                What the hell's made you decide to take \n                your leave at the worst possible time? \n                Claire's in a weird mood too. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Oh?  What's the problem? \n\n                          PHELPS \n                I don't know, I had to go to Chicago \n                again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Tell you what? \n\n                          PHELPS \n                When you started noticing your short term \n                memory loss.  What the problem was you \n                and Claire had in Kiev? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                What problem? \n\n                          PHELPS\n                     (laughs)\n                Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking\n                burnout here?\n\n                          ETHAN \n                I guess. \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Ethan, you can't burn out. \n\n                          ETHAN\n                Why not? \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Because I can't afford it. And because \n                you'd burn up before you'd burn out. \n\n     CLAIRE, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to \n     be the reference point in the following exchange: \n\n                          ETHAN \n                How was Chicago? \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto \n                dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the \n                one about the astronaut who comes back \n                from the first manned flight to Mars \n                after two years?  His wife's got a year \n                old kid.  So he says \"All right.  Who was \n                it?  My friend Harry?\"  She says no. \"Oh,\n                it was my friend Sammy.\"  She says it \n                wasn't Sammy.  \"Oh, I suppose it was my \n                friend Lou.\"  \"No, what's the matter, \n                don't you think I have any friends of my \n                own?!\" \n\n     PHELPS laughs.  ETHAN doesn't.  The back of CLAIRE'S head is \n     in his line of sight. \n\n                          PHELPS (CONT'D) \n                Boy, you really are grim. Come here, \n                take a look. \n\n     He leads ETHAN to the window, which overlooks the city. \n\n     EXT. PRAGUE - DAY \n\n     ETHAN's POV of Embassy. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY\n\n     ETHAN nods. \n\n                          PHELPS (CONT'D) \n                Beyond Charles Bridge there is our \n                Embassy.  See it?  Tomorrow night, if \n                anything goes wrong, this guy will steal \n                the names of our agents in every country \n                all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to \n                the highest bidders -- third world \n                terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- \n                any and everybody who'd love to get rid \n                of long term coverts like us, and some \n                very dear friends among them.  If they're \n                exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over \n                here.  Take a lock at this. \n\n     CLAIRE, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a \n     quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  In it, an old \n     edition of the McLaughlin Report, the PBS news show, is \n     playing. \n\n     ETHAN is distracted by it. \n\n     INSERT - TELEVISION\n\n     SENATOR WALTZER, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, \n     is holding forth: \n\n                          SENATOR WALTZER \n                I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA \n                and all its shadow organizations have \n                become irrelevant at best and \n                unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we \n                throw a little light on the whole concept \n                of the Pentagon's \"black budget.\"  These \n                covert agency subgroups have confidential \n                funding, they report to no one -- who are\n                these people?!  We were living in a \n                democracy the last time I checked. \n\n     BACK TO SCENE \n\n     ETHAN looks back at JIM. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                You're going to use Walter? \n\n                          PHELPS \n                He's our guy. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Not this week. This week he's flyfishing \n                at the Oughterard Slough in County \n                Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides. \n\n                          ETHAN\n                He won't be back in a hurry? \n\n                          PHELPS \n                No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? \n                You think the plot'll work? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Sure.  If the main character does. \n\n                          PHELPS \n                If you were me, Ethan, who would you\n                trust to make him believable? \n\n     JACK comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum.\n\n                          JACK \n                Sorry, am I interrupting?  \n\n                          ETHAN\n                Always. \n\n     JACK shows the gum to ETHAN.\n\n                          JACK \n                Stick of gum. If you come up against a \n                lock you can't pick -- \n\n     Half the gum is red, the other half is green. \n\n                          JACK (CONT'D) \n                Red light.  Green light.  Mash them \n                together, asta lasagna.  Don't get any on \n                you -- you have five seconds. \n\n     He offers the gum to ETHAN.\n\n                          PHELPS \n                Are you gonna take it? \n\n     CLAIRE glances up from the computer and catches ETHAN's eye. \n     PHELPS may have caught the glance, but is focused on ETHAN. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                     (relenting) \n                Give me the God damn gum. \n\n                          JACK \n                Just don't chew it. \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Thank you. \n\n                                                            CUT TO: \n\n     EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT\n\n     The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River.  Party \n     at the Embassy tonight. \n\n     INT. AN ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT\n\n     JACK, wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking \n     eyeglasses (they're called Visco glasses), enters an elevator \n     shaft through a small door at the base of the wall.  He looks \n     up the shaft, shining a flashlight until he finds what he's \n     looking for -- \n\n     -- a gray metal box, protruding from the wall one floor up. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     PHELPS is at a table in the safe house apartment, watching \n     the bank of monitors HANNAH wired together earlier. The \n     monitors are alive now, showing various views of the inside \n     of the Embassy, where the party is going on, and one view of \n     the elevator shaft. \n\n     PHELPS wearing an IMF headset and speaks into the mouthpiece. \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Ethan.  Jack's inside.  Window's open by \n                twenty-three hundred. \n\n     INT. EMBASSY - NIGHT\n\n     Inside the Embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair \n     that's in full swing on the second floor. \n\n     SENATOR WALTZER, the man who was on TV, walks up a grand \n     staircase, headed in.  An AMERICAN DIPLOMAT in a tuxedo \n     hurries up to him. \n\n                          DIPLOMAT \n                How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, \n                the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just \n                steer you through the reception line here\n                --\n\n     The DIPLOMAT pilots the SENATOR by one arm, guiding him to a \n     reception line at the base of the stairs to the party. \n\n                          DIPLOMAT (CONT'D) \n                Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the \n                director of the National Gallery -- Petr \n                Brandl, the mayor of Prague -- \n\n     SARAH, a very attractive young American dressed in an elegant \n     gown, steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with \n     WALTZER. \n\n                          SARAH \n                I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator? \n\n                          SENATOR WALTZER \n                Of course I do.  How are you, Miss \n                Norman? \n\n     He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so \n     SARAH whispers something in his ear. \n\n                          SARAH \n                He's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me. \n\n     Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team. \n\n     The SENATOR pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket \n     (and if we didn't know the SENATOR was ETHAN before, this \n     confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder. \n\n     UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE, \n\n     ALEKSANDER GOLITSYN, the Ukrainian, has just come in from \n     outside. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     PHELPS sees the SENATOR's point of view of GOLITSYN, through \n     the glasses, broadcast back to PHELPS' monitor.  He speaks \n     into his microphone. \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Sarah, mark the package and go to two. \n\n     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT\n\n     SARAH still has the SENATOR's attention. \n\n                          SARAH \n                Your advance team mentioned you'd want a \n                tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead \n                and set that up for you -- \n\n                          SENATOR WALTZER \n                Terrific.  Let's get going. \n                     (to the Diplomat) \n                Will you excuse us?  \n\n     He slips an arm around SARAH and they walk off, not into the \n     party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads \n     further into the Embassy. \n\n                          DIPLOMAT \n                Uh, sir? \n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT                               \n\n     JACK climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal \n     box.  He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a \n     noise from above.  He looks up and sees the elevator above \n     him descending. \n\n     JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. The \n     elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him \n     to the wall. \n\n                          JACK \n                Great.  Come on. \n\n     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT \n\n     As the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, \n     SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse.  But as \n     she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing \n     herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head.  He never \n     notices.  They move on and down the flight of stairs. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT     \n\n     JIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party.  He looks \n     to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party, a jumpy \n     one, as someone hurrying up stairs. \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go. \n\n     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT\n\n     On a flight of stairs, HANNAH, dressed for the party and \n     slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs. \n\n                          HANNAH \n                En route. \n\n     She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the \n     party below.  She pushes a micro switch on the side of her \n     glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the \n     lenses. \n\n                          PHELPS (O/S) \n                Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to\n                night vision). \n\n     HANNAH\u00edS VISCO POV \n\n     the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands \n     out.  That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green \n     where SARAH sprayed it. \n\n     INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT\n\n     The SENATOR (let's just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down \n     the stairs and pass a sign that says \"Denied Area -- \n     Political Attaches Only.\"  ETHAN checks his watch.  23:00. \n\n     He nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an \n     elevator at the end of the corridor.  A sign in front of it \n     says \"Out of Order.\"  They head for it anyway. \n\n     A MARINE GUARD appears from behind a side door, catching them \n     by surprise.  \n\n                          JACK \n                Governor's in position.  We have the elevator. \n\n                          GUARD \n                Excuse me, can I help you? \n\n                          SARAH \n                -- which leads directly to the Denied \n                Area, the only limited access area in the \n                whole facility. \n\n     SARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking. \n\n                          SARAH (CONT'D) \n                As you can see. this area has both a \n                Marine guard and video surveillance, and \n                is strictly monitored at all times. \n\n     She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank \n     and slides her thumb inside.  The panel lights up and flashes \n     a message -- \"ACCESS DENIED.\"  SARAH and ETHAN trade a look. \n\n                          SARAH (CONT'D)\n                     (covering) \n                Senator, don't you have a young man on \n                your staff named JACK? \n\n     She tries the thumb again, Still no soap. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Jack?  I believe we did have a young man \n                named Jack.  Not a reliable man, as I \n                recall.  Constantly late or behind in his \n                work. \n\n     Now the GUARD, noticing that Sarah's not being allowed \n     access, comes closer to them. \n\n                          GUARD \n                Excuse me, let me see that ID again! \n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT\n\n     JACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening \n     to their conversation. \n\n                          PHELPS (O.S.) \n                Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a \n                second.  Keep dancing.  \n\n                          ETHAN (O.S.) \n                     (with the Senator's southern accent) \n                We were forced to tie him to my best \n                stallion and drag him around the barn a \n                few times.  \n\n     Finally, the elevator moves down a floor and JACK is freed. \n\n                          JACK \n                Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on\n                it. \n\n     He quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of \n     circuitry.  He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the \n     elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download.\n\n     THE LAPTOP\n\n     there's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID \n     picture.  JACK downloads her file into the security computer. \n\n     INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT\n\n     Ignoring the GUARD, SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the \n     thumbprint analyzer once more.  The panel glows, this time \n     the message flashes -- \n\n                          IDENTITY CONFIRMED \n\n     -- and the elevator doors slide open briskly.  \n\n     The GUARD, surprised, now catches sight of the SENATOR. \n\n                          GUARD \n                Oh. Sorry, sir. \n\n     He snaps a salute.  ETHAN and SARAH get into the elevator and \n     the doors close behind them. \n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT\n\n     JACK looks down at the elevator below.  Through a grating, he \n     can see them inside. \n\n                          JACK \n                The drink (date) with Sarah is definitely\n                off. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     PHELPS moves from JACK's view of the elevator car to HANNAH's \n     view of the party on his video monitors. \n\n                          PHELPS \n                     (a touch of impatience) \n                Hannah -- I'm blind again.  Hannah. \n\n     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT\n\n     HANNAH, stationed on the second floor of the Embassy, moves \n     to get a better view of the party. She reacquires GOLITSYN's \n     glowing head.  \n\n                          HANNAH \n                He's heading to the denied area. \n\n     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     This work room is filled with combination lock filing \n     cabinets and various computer terminals.  ETHAN hands SARAH \n     his Visco glasses and she crosses the room, placing them \n     upside down on top of a filing cabinet.  \n\n     ETHAN straps on a Visco wrist monitor and tunes it in, \n     switching several times. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                     (to Sarah) \n                Higher.  Higher.  \n\n                          SARAH \n                Higher. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Right, right.  Good. \n\n     SARAH adjusts the glasses. \n\n     THROUGH THE GLASSES, \n\n     the view of the main computer terminal is upside down, but \n     clear.  Anyone sitting there will be recorded. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     On PHELPS' monitor, we see ETHAN, via his Visco glasses on \n     the filing cabinet, standing next to the computer.  PHELPS \n     barks out a warning.  \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Get moving, Ethan.  He's rolling to you. \n\n     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN pushes the elevator button but the elevator is already \n     moving up. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Jack we're in position. \n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT/WORK ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     In a split view, we see both sides of the elevator wall \n     simultaneously -- on one side, JACK is lying on top of the \n     rising elevator, on the other side, ETHAN and SARAH are \n     waiting for it to arrive. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Jack.  Jack. \n\n                          JACK \n                I didn't touch it. \n\n     The elevator stops, the doors open -- \n\n     -- and GOLITSYN gets on.  GOLITSYN descends in the elevator \n     with JACK on top and ETHAN and SARAH waiting down below! \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     PHELPS sees JACK's point of view of the elevator, with \n     GOLITSYN inside.  \n\n                          PHELPS \n                     (tension rising) \n                He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box! \n\n     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN and SARAH are waiting in front of the elevator, the one \n     GOLITSYN is about to step off of!  ETHAN looks around, for a \n     place to hide. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open\n                the doors. \n\n                          SARAH \n                What about my coat?  I'll freeze. \n\n                          JACK (O.S.) \n                I don't have it. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \n\n     PHELPS whips over to a laptop and starts typing. \n\n                          PHELPS \n                Opening the doors.  Go under. \n\n     He jabs ENTER on his keyboard. \n\n     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     The elevator doors WHISK open, revealing the empty shaft \n     beyond.  ETHAN and SARAH jump into the shaft. \n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN and SARAH jump down into the five foot empty space \n     below the work room floor.  Above them, the elevator \n     continues its descent, with them hiding below.  The elevator \n     drops to just over their heads and stops. \n\n     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     GOLITSYN steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides \n     a 3.5 computer disk into the computer in the work room. \n     Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, \n     downloading the vital information. \n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT\n\n     Waiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, \n     starting to reverse it.  He checks his Visco wrist monitor as \n     GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft.  He smiles and speaks into a \n     microphone.  \n\n                          ETHAN \n                He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack. \n\n                          JACK (O.S.) \n                Give me a break, Pops. \n\n                          SARAH \n                Such a nice ass. \n\n                          JACK (O.S.) \n                And a lonely ass. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport \n                in five minutes. \n\n                          CLAIRE (O.S.) \n                Roger that. \n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT\n\n     Back inside, ETHAN strips off his mask and wearing his now \n     reversed jacket, he and SARAH exit the small door at the base \n     of the elevator shaft. \n\n     EXT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT\n\n     JACK rapidly disconnects his equipment.  But as he pulls the \n     final electrical clip from the elevator's wiring, it flashes \n     and SPARKS. \n\n     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN and SARAH exit an Embassy service area by the \n     waterfront and blend into the Embassy crowd, as an amorous \n     couple. \n\n                          ETHAN\n                In position.  Jack open the door, let the\n                package roll.\n\n                          JACK (O.S.)\n                Roger that.  Opening doors now.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Stairway, you\u00edre wrapped, go to\n                transport.\n\n     ETHAN\u00edS voice comes over HANNAH\u00edS earpiece.\n\n                          HANNAH\n                En route.\n\n     HANNAH breaks off and goes up the stairs.\n\n     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n\n     The button marked \"ROOF\" lights up, seemingly all by itself.\n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT\n\n     The car engages with a sharp jolt --\n\n                          JACK\n                Hey.\n\n     --and starts to rise.  JACK looks down, into the elevator\n     car, through the grate.  There\u00eds no one in it.\n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     On one of his monitors, PHELPS sees the elevator moving in\n     the shaft.\n\n                          PHELPS\n                Jack, what are you doing?!\n\n     INT.

SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     PHELPS is typing at his keyboard and jamming the enter button\n     but gets no response.\n\n                          PHELPS\n                I don\u00edt have it -- I don\u00edt have\n                control!\n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT\n\n     JACK\u00edS face pales.  He looks up, above him, at the\n     approaching ceiling.\n\n                          JACK\n                Uh -- then I have a problem.\n\n     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     GOLITSYN pulls out the now-programmed disk from the computer,\n     slips it in his jacket pocket and heads for the door.\n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT\n\n     JACK looks up through his Visco glasses at the approaching\n     roof, covered with spikes.\n\n     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT\n\n     Through the monitor, ETHAN sees JACK\u00edS P.O.V. of the roof of\n     the building approaching.  Fast.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Cut the power.  Cut the power Jack.  Do\n                you hear me.\n\n     INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (ABOVE ELEVATOR) - NIGHT\n\n     On top of the elevator, JACK has ripped open the control\n     panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get\n     the thing to stop.\n\n     He swears, his fingers fumble, he works faster and faster.\n     He looks up.  The roof of the building is nearly upon him.\n        \n                          ETHAN (O.S.)\n                Come on, Jack, come on.\n\n     JACK looks up again, he cringes, he covers his head with his\n     hands, he SCREAMS --\n\n     --and he\u00eds crushed to death against the roof.\n\n     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN is staring at the static on the monitor that once was\n     JACK\u00edS signal.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Jack.  Jack.\n\n     He closes his eyes, knowing what that means.\n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     PHELPS also sees the static.\n\n                          PHELPS\n                Man down.  Stay where you are.  I\u00edm on my\n                way.\n\n     He gets up and races out of the apartment.\n\n     INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     GOLITSYN, who now has the disk, jabs again and again at the\n     elevator button but it won\u00edt even light up.  He studies the\n     elevator doors and jumps into the shaft, just as ETHAN and\n     SARAH did moments before.\n\n     He hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small\n     door at the shaft\u00eds base.\n\n     EXT. PRAGUE SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     PHELPS hurries towards the bridge.\n\n                          PHELPS\n                En route.\n\n     EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\n     PHELPS dashes onto the Charles Bridge and heads across the\n     river, toward the Embassy.  He throws a look back, over his\n     shoulder.  Paranoia\u00eds setting in.\n\n     EXT. EMBASSY (AS SEEN FROM CHARLES BRIDGE) - NIGHT\n\n     Outside the Embassy, GOLITSYN escapes, pushing through the\n     service area door and racing past a DRUNKEN COUPLE who are in\n     the midst of a lover\u00eds quarrel, in Russian.\n\n     Pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where PHELPS is\n     still racing to meet ETHAN.  But he stops suddenly, as if\n     hearing something and looks behind him, at the deepening\n     gloom.\n\n     EXT. EMBASSY - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN and SARAH hear PHELP\u00edS voice over the monitor.\n\n                          SARAH\n                The package is in the open.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Jim.

RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN moves to the bridge stairs.\n\n                          PHELPS (O.S.)\n                Where are you?\n\n                          ETHAN\n                About two hundred yards from the bridge.\n\n                          PHELPS (O.S.)\n                They\u00edre covering this frequency, Ethan.\n                Cut all radio communications.  Repeat.\n                Cut all radio communications.  \n\n     ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge.  Past\n     CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car.  He looks on his monitor\n     and again sees PHELPS\u00ed POV.  Only ominous silence.  Phelps is\n     looking back over his shoulder.  The bridge is deserted.\n\n     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT\n\n     SARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where\n     a cobblestone promenade runs along the river.  He disappears\n     into the fog at the edge of the river.\n\n     EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN checks his monitor again.\n\n     THE MONITOR\n\n     PHELPS\u00ed point of view changes radically as his head swivels\n     on the darkened bridge.  He whirls again, looking over his\n     shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible,\n     pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a\n     GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor.\n\n     The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down\n     to a bloody hole in his own chest.\n\n     His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge\n     and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.\n        \n     EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN\u00eds face goes white with shock.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                JIM!\n\n     EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\n     He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but there\u00eds\n     no sign of PHELPS.\n\n     ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but\n     sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming\n     obscured in the gathering fog.\n\n     He turns and looks to the embankment.  He can faintly see\n     GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade.  ETHAN gives chase.\n\n     EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point\n     on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIRE\u00edS outline,\n     visible in the driver\u00eds seat.  But as he descends the stairs\n     --\n\n     --the car explodes and bursts into flames.\n\n     The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                CLAIRE!\n\n     He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a \n     stunned CROWD starts to gather.\n\n     Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the\n     embankment.\n\n     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT\n\n     SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees\n     GOLITSYN again, slowing down.  A MAN comes out of the fog an\n     seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light.\n\n     SARAH draws closer.  Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to\n     be hanging with her for some reason.\n\n     EXT. STAIRS FROM BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN continues towards the embankment.\n\n     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT\n\n     SARAH is almost to GOLITSYN.  Suddenly, the MAN in front of\n     GOLITSYN pulls him towards him.  Sensing something wrong,\n     SARAH quickens her pace.  The MAN is now hunched over\n     GOLITSYN, facing away from SARAH, going through GOLITSYN\u00eds\n     pockets.\n\n     The figure finds what it\u00eds looking for -- the disk -- and\n     takes it.  SARAH comes closer --\n\n     -- and the figure whirls.  It brings a knife up sharply,\n     plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.\n\n     ANGLE\n\n     ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment.  He bursts\n     out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees,\n     over GOLITSYN\u00eds body.  ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and\n     GASPS.\n\n     He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death.  He\n     looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated\n     edge.\n\n     BEHIND ETHAN\n\n     The DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more.  In fact, they\u00edre\n     watching ETHAN.  Through the fog and night, they see him\n     leaning over SARAH, holding the knife in his hands.\n\n     AT THE BODIES\n\n     SARAH goes still.  ETHAN lays her down, turns the other body\n     over and sees that it is GOLITSYN.  He quickly begins\n     rummaging through his pockets.\n\n     ETHAN hear police sirens and sees...\n\n     ANGLE\n\n     A Prague police boat, SIREN wailing, arrives at the dock in\n     front of the Embassy.  The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop\n     suddenly.\n\n     As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the\n     explosion, ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley\n     and out of sight.\n\n     EXT. STREET -- PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver.  He\u00eds\n     holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a \n     modernist cockroach.  He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts\n     of the phone\u00eds wiring, piercing it with its little prongs.\n\n     He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phone\u00eds tongue\n     down for a second, releases it and listens.  He has a dial\n     tone.  Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by\n     heart.\n\n     After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side.\n\n                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)\n                Satcom seven.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Central Europe.  Unsecured.\n\n                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)\n                Designator?\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Bravo Echo one one.\n\n                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)\n                Switching.\n\n     There is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the\n     line.\n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)\n                This is Kittridge.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Go secure.\n\n     Pause.  A funny series of CLICKS comes over the line.      \n        \n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)\n                Go ahead.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                They\u00edre dead.\n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)\n                Who\u00eds dead?\n\n                          ETHAN\n                My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim -\n                - Hannah, maybe, I -- don\u00edt know\n        \n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)\n                Are you damaged?\n\n                          ETHAN\n                They knew we were coming.  Golitsyn\u00eds\n                dead too.  The disk is gone.\n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)\n                Are you intact?\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Do you read me?  The list is in the open!\n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)\n                Let's just bring you in safely, and then\n                we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you\n                followed?\n\n     ETHAN closes his eyes.  KITTRIDGE\u00edS voice is strong and\n     reassuring and he needs that right now.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                I don\u00edt think so.\n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)\n                Don\u00edt think, be sure.  Are you clean?\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Yes.\n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)\n                Location green.  One hour.  I\u00edll be there\n                myself.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                You\u00edre in Prague?\n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)\n                Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Don\u00edt\n                disappoint me.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                No sir.\n\n                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.)\n                One hour.\n\n     He hangs up.  ETHAN does the same.  He stares at the phone\n     for a moment, thinking.  He checks his watch.\n\n     EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the\n     street.  Every face seems to be starring at him now, every\n     sound is menacing.  He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his\n     hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd.\n\n     EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering,\n     gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by \n     residential buildings.\n\n     ETHAN\u00edS POV\n\n     Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built\n     on the portico of an old palace.\n\n     Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively\n     shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza.\n\n     INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN'S POV \n\n     ETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an \n     enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. \n     He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are \n     scattered around. \n\n     EUGENE KITTRIDGE is seated at a table in the middle. He and \n     ETHAN make eye contact.  ETHAN walks to the table, a couple \n     of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he \n     goes.  KITTRIDGE has been working on a pretty good-sized \n     lobster.  He rises to greet ETHAN and they sit. \n                          \n                          KITTRIDGE \n                I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know \n                how much Jim in particular meant to you, \n                Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Yeah. \n\n     He spots a stack of documents on the table.\n\n     ETHAN picks them up.  There's a Canadian picture bearing \n     ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, \n     driver's license, etc. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE\n                Passport, visas - you know the drill. \n                We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, \n                debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague \n                police a bone, you know toss them a few \n                suspects.  Follow me? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Yeah.  I follow you. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                We've lost enough agents for one night. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                You mean I've lost enough agents for one \n                night. \n\n     KITTRIDGE seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, \n     carefully: \n        \n                          KITTRIDGE \n                You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, \n                Ethan. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Who else is left? \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                Yes.  I see your point. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Why was there another team? \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                What? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                I don't quite follow you. \n\n                          ETHAN\n                Let's see if you can follow me around \n                this room. \n                     (eyes moving around the room) \n                The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 \n                and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing \n                around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. \n                The waiter behind Hannah at the top of \n                the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The \n                other IMF team.  You're worried about me. \n                Why?\n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                     (a tight little smile) \n                You're right.  Maybe this'll save some \n                time. \n\n     The figures around the room have grown restless.  KITTRIDGE \n     tries to indicate that it's okay. He pulls some papers out \n     of his jacket. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) \n                For a little over two years now we've \n                been spotting serious blowback in IMF \n                operations.  We have a penetration.  The \n                other day we decoded a message on the \n                Internet from a Czech we know as \"Max.\"\n\n                          ETHAN \n                The arms dealer. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                That's right.  Max, it seems, has two \n                unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity\n                and for corrupting susceptible agents. \n                This time he's gotten to someone on the \n                inside - he's put himself in a position \n                to buy our NOC list. An operation he \n                referred to as \"Job 314\".  The job he \n                thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                Correct the actual list is safe at \n                Langley.  \"Golitsyn\" was a lightning rod, \n                one of ours. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                This whole operation was a molehunt. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like \n                you said.  You survived. \n\n     ETHAN stares at him levelly. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D)\n                I want to show you something, Ethan. \n\n     He now shoves the papers across the table.  They're xeroxed \n     copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and \n     MARGARET ETHAN HUNT.  It shows a balance of $127, 000. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) \n                Since your father's death, your family's \n                farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, \n                suddenly, they're flush with over a \n                hundred and twenty grand in the bank. \n                Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped \n                out the bank account -- dying slowly in \n                America after all, can be a very \n                expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why \n                don't we go quietly out of here onto the \n                plane... \n\n                          ETHAN \n                How about if we just go quietly into the \n                bathroom and I wash your mouth out with \n                soap - you pathetic button down \n                bureaucratic asshole. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) \n                Ethan, I can understand you're very \n                upset. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Kitteridge, you've never seen me very \n                upset. \n\n        ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket.  While \n        KITTRIDGE talks, ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                All right, enough is  enough Hunt. You've \n                bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on \n                intimate loyalties to get away with it. \n                You're determined to shake hands with the \n                devil and I'm going to make sure you do \n                it in hell. \n\n     We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- it's the piece of \n     bubble gum, half red, half green. He squeezes the gum, \n     mushing the two sides together. \n\n     ETHAN lashes out, swatting KITTRIDGE'S glass of wine off the\n     table in one quick motion.  As he does, he hurls the piece of \n     gum. \n\n     Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine \n     glass.  KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- \n\n     -- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. His eyes \n     widen.  KA BOOM! \n\n     The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish \n     tank.  A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and \n     WOMAN, knocking them to the ground. \n\n     At the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door. \n\n     EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the \n     deserted square. \n\n     EXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT\n\n     Silence.  ETHAN enters the darkened entry. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN glances up at the stairwell.  Naked light bulbs \n     illuminate the way up.  He slips off his jacket and shirt, \n     then puts his jacket back on. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN unscrews a bulb.  He crushes the bulb in his shirt and \n     scatters the glass fragments on the steps.  He climbs to the \n     next bulb. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT\n\n     At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft \n     sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments \n     dropping and ETHAN'S at the door. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \n\n     In the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with \n     flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a \n     Sig Sauer automatic. He moves through the rooms, checking \n     them as he goes. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, \n     pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can.  He \n     unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various \n     denominations from various countries and a couple of \n     passports. \n\n     As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the\n     mirror.  He's a mess.  He splashes water on his face. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water \n     and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     He comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he \n     notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the \n     static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching.  One by \n     one, he switches them off. \n\n     THE LAPTOP \n\n     JACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk.  ETHAN \n     wakes it up. \n        \n     The computer emits a DIAL TONE, then STATIC as it hits its \n     connection.  It prompts ETHAN along: \n\n                SELECT USENET GROUP\n\n     ETHAN TYPES IN \n\n                job 314\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Job.  Job 3:14.

He tries something else -- \"scroll \n     usenet groups.\"  \n\n     The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying \n     speed, by the hundreds.  That's not going anywhere. \n\n     ETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to \n     figure out what permutation of \"job 314\" he should add to the \n     others on his computer screen.  He MUMBLES. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Job three fourteen.

He turns to Job 3:14 and reads the \n     Bible passage \"Kings and Counsellors...\" \n\n     He thinks for another moment, then punches back into the \n     Internet and under the command \"Select Usenet Group\" he \n     types: \n\n                BIBLE\n\n     The computer replies: \n\n                126 ENTRIES FOUND, SPECIFY GROUP\n\n     ETHAN: \n\n                BOOK OF JOB\n\n     The computer presents a multi-colored screen of religious \n     icons and artwork with an accompanying message: \n\n                WELCOME TO THE BOOK OF JOB DISCUSSION \n                GROUP.

Fate will be \n                that of kings and counsellors who built \n                for themselves palaces now lying in \n                ruins.  Must meet to discuss a.s.a.p. \n\n     ANGLE\n\n     A rhythmic CRUNCHING sound and from the darkness on the other \n     side of the room, PHELPS staggers toward him, wet and muddy, \n     his middle a hopelessly bloody mess.  He looks like he's \n     dying on his feet.  ETHAN freezes, appalled. \n\n                          PHELPS\n                Ethan, what are you doing? \n\n     ETHAN tries to speak but nothing will come out. \n\n                          PHELPS (CONT'D) \n                I needed you, Ethan. 1 needed you on the \n                bridge, and -- you weren't there.  Ethan? \n                Ethan? \n\n     ETHAN reaches out to grab PHELPS but can't seem to touch him. \n     PHELPS suddenly vanishes into thin air, ETHAN awakens from \n     the dream and finds himself leaping to his feet, gun cocked \n     and pointed at -- \n\n     ANGLE\n\n     It's CLAIRE. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                What are you doing here?! \n\n     CLAIRE freezes, her hands half-raised. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                     (carefully) \n                Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. \n                Ethan what's wrong with you? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Don't move. \n\n     Her right hand has moved a fraction.  She freezes again. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                You were in the car! \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in \n                trouble on the radio.  He said someone \n                was... \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the \n                car. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                No, I got out of the car and I ran to the\n                bridge. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                What happened to Jim? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                There was nobody on the bridge. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                What happened to Jim? \n\n     Ethan grabs her wrists, shouting. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Dead.  Dead.  Dead!  Wake up, Claire! \n                Jim's dead, they're dead.  They're all \n                dead! \n\n     ETHAN releases her wrists. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                     (mumbling) \n                They're dead.  Jim's dead. \n\n                          ETHAN\n                Take off your coat. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                What? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Take off your God damn coat! \n\n     He grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- \n     spinning her around.  The coat hits the floor like a dead \n     body.  CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest. \n\n     CLAIRE begins to shiver.  ETHAN circles her, runs his hand \n     cursorily across her body.  It accentuates CLAIRE'S \n     shivering. \n\n                          ETHAN (CONT'D) \n                Where were you? \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                I walked away.  He said abort.  He was \n                gone so I walked away. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? \n                Did they send you here? \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                     (slowly) \n                Who is \"they?\" \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Did they send you...Did they send you? \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                Who is they, who is they? \n\n        ETHAN grabs her by the wrists. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Who sent you?!  Who sent you? \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                     (screaming) \n                No one sent me!  We're supposed to be \n                back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, \n                if we abort, we don't return here until \n                four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, \n                four o'clock --! \n\n     She sags.  A moment.  Then the clock begins to chime -- BONG, \n     BONG, BONG, BONG.  In the wake of the bells' reverb, ETHAN \n     releases his grip on her wrists. \n\n     INT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT\n\n     ETHAN sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, \n     still waiting for a response.  CLAIRE sitting on the end of \n     the bed.  Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                Why haven't they brought us in yet? \n\n                          ETHAN\n                I've been disavowed.  They think I killed \n                Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred \n                thousand dollars found its way into my \n                parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes \n                I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've \n                been in the employ of an arms dealer, \n                Max, for the last two years, to get him \n                our NOC list. \n\n     A long moment while she stares at ETHAN's back. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                What are you going to do? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the \n                mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, \n                at least part of the time. 1 can't find \n                him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, \n                he'll find me. \n                \n                          CLAIRE \n                Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me \n                go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going \n                to tell him you had nothing to do... \n\n                          ETHAN\n                Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not \n                dead, he's going to assume you're with \n                me. \n\n     The computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it. \n\n     THE COMPUTER SCREEN\n\n     Blinking -- \"MESSAGE WAITING.\"  ETHAN hurries over and clicks \n     on the message box.  The screen blinks and the message shows \n     up: \n\n     ?        JOB - CORNER OF NEKAZANKA AND PRlKOPY ONE P.M. \n\n     ?        BUY A PACKET OF DUNHILL \n\n     ?        AND ASK THE MAN SITTING ON THE BUS \n\n     ?        STOP BENCH FOR A MATCH\n\n     CLAIRE looks to ETHAN. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                The message is for Job. \n\n                          ETHAN\n                I'm going to answer it. \n\n     EXT. STREET BY BANK/FLORENC BUS STOP - DAY\n\n     ETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A \n     MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to \n     ETHAN. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Excuse me, could I trouble you for a \n                match? \n\n     Without turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As \n     ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm \n     and escort him into a car which has just pulled up. \n\n     INT. CAR - DAY\n\n     ETHAN slides into the back seat, between the TWO MEN. \n     MATTHIAS, the man on the left, holds up a black hood.  He \n     extends it to ETHAN, who doesn't take it. \n\n                          MATTHIAS\n                Would you remove your hat please? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Why? \n\n                          MATTHIAS \n                You wish to meet Max?  This is the price \n                of admission. \n\n     Reluctantly, Ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car \n     takes off. \n\n     INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n     The black hood still on his head, ETHAN has trouble sitting \n     upright.  He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in \n     the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are \n     drawn.  The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- \n     expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art. \n\n     Somewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few \n     seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone \n     is VACUUMING.  MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby. \n\n                          ETHAN\n                I thought I was going to see Max. \n\n                          MATTHIAS \n                You misunderstood.  No one sees Max. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Then what am I doing here? \n\n                          MATTHIAS \n                Allowing Max to see you and hear what \n                you've got to say. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                I don't communicate very well through a \n                shroud. \n\n                          MATTHIAS \n                If Max doesn't like what you have to say, \n                you'll be wearing that shroud \n                indefinitely. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                I'm willing to take the chance. \n\n                          MATTHIAS \n                Very well. \n\n     MAX'S figure into frame.  MATTHIAS removes ETHAN's hood. \n     When it comes off ETHAN finds himself looking up at a tall \n     woman of indeterminate age.  She's handsome to the point of \n     severity. \n\n                          MAX \n                Who are you and what are you doing here? \n                          \n                          ETHAN \n                I need one hundred thousand dollars. \n\n                          MAX\n                Really?  And you thought if you simply \n                showed up I might give it to you? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and \n                twenty five thousand. \n\n                          MAX \n                The penny drops.  You are not Job.  Yes, \n                Job is not given to quoting Scripture in \n                his communications. And there was its \n                tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is \n                not playful.  So you're something of a \n                paradox. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                That depends. \n\n                          MAX\n                On what? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Whether you like a paradox.  I want a \n                hundred and fifty thousand dollars. \n\n                          MAX\n                It's quite out of the question. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's \n                bait, part of an internal molehunt. \n\n                          MAX\n                And how might you know that?  Are you \n                another Company man? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Like Job? \n\n                          MAX \n                Ah, but, we're asking about you. \n\n                          ETHAN\n                I'm NOC.  Was.  Now disavowed. \n\n                          MAX \n                Why, may I ask? \n\n                          ETHAN\n                That's the question I want to ask Job. \n\n                          MAX \n                I don't know Job any more than he knows \n                me. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an \n                introduction. \n\n                          MAX \n                Why should I? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Because I can deliver the actual NOC \n                list.  The one you have is not only \n                worthless, it's certain to be equipped \n                with a homing device to pinpoint your \n                exact location. \n\n                          MAX \n                It's easy to say the disk is worthless \n                when you say I can't look at the \n                information and see if it's worthless. \n                Not a tenable position, sir. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from \n                thirty seconds to ten minutes you're \n                gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping \n                around you like jackrabbits. \n\n                          MAX \n                     (Pause.) \n                Mm - Hmmm... \n\n                          ETHAN\n                Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner \n                you used in the car? \n\n                          MAX \n                Very good. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up \n                first. \n\n     ANGLE\n\n     MATTHIAS boots up.  There's a little musical noise and the \n     screen brightens.  The computer WHIRS and CLICKS and a \n     complex list of names, addresses, phone numbers and other \n     personal information scrolls by.  But Matthias is watching \n     the digital read-out on the RF scanner. \n\n                          MATTHIAS \n                Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so \n                good. \n\n                          MAX \n                That's not so good for you, my friend. \n\n     On the scanner, the digital read-out is now in the thirties. \n\n                          MATTHIAS \n                Thirty-two and change. \n\n                          MAX \n                     (to Ethan) \n                Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just \n                be the hard drive heating up. \n\n     She looks from the scanner to ETHAN as if she's trying to \n     make up her mind about something. \n\n                          MATTHIAS \n                Forty-four.  Forty-five. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                I'd say you've got about two minutes. \n\n     MAX still doubts it. The OTHER MAN goes to the windows -- \n\n     --nothing happens.

Nothing out here but \n     a beautiful day.  He walks to the railing and looks down at \n     the street. \n\n     Down below, the dog that's still barking is tied to a street \n     sign.  WOOF.  WOOF.  WOOF.  Abruptly, it stops. \n\n     INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY \n\n     Back inside: \n\n                          MATTHIAS\n                Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine. \n\n     EXT.

MAX'S BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY\n\n     Led by KITTRIDGE, the FIVE IMF AGENTS wearing Kevlar-lined \n     trenchcoats creep through the lobby of the building and hit \n     the stairs. They climb them silently. \n\n     INT. MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY\n\n     A CLEANING WOMAN is vacuuming the hall carpeting when the \n     AGENTS come up the stairs, guns drawn. Her jaw drops and she \n     turns off the vacuum cleaner. \n\n                          FEMALE IMF \n                     (in czech) \n                Switch it on.  Keep cleaning. \n\n     KITTRIDGE looks at her sharply and gestures.  She turns the \n     vacuum back on. They reach the door of a certain apartment \n     and -- \n\n     INT. APARTMENT - DAY\n\n     -- KICK through it.  The AGENTS swarm into MAX'S apartment, \n     guns waving in all directions.  KITTRIDGE sweeps in between \n     them and takes command of the place -- \n\n     --but there's nobody here.  TWO AGENTS race into the bedroom, \n     and just as quickly out again. \n\n     EXT. POWDER TOWER - TOP SHOT - DAY\n\n     MAX, ETHAN, MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN move quickly across \n     the bridge that connects Max's apartment to the tower. \n\n     EXT.

CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY\n\n     While ETHAN talks, we see what he's referring to: \n\n     A CIA ANALYST carrying a glass of iced tea and several file \n     folders walks down a long corridor in the headquarters \n     building.  He comes to an impressive guard station and rests \n     his chin on a strange-looking optometric device. \n\n                          ETHAN (V.O.) \n                They missed nothing in that room.  Even \n                the vents have laser nets over them.  \n\n     Apparently the device approves and the ANALYST is buzzed into \n     a \"RESTRICTED\" area of the building. \n\n     INT. CIA COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY\n\n     The ANALYST reaches a curtained area. He shoves the curtain \n     aside and comes to a large, vaulted door.  He slides a card- \n     key into a slot, leaves it there and slides a second card-key \n     into the slot beneath it. \n\n                          ETHAN (V.O.)\n                Inside, there are three countermeasure \n                systems that can only be deactivated by \n                authorized entry.  Which we won't have. \n\n     A panel next to the ANALYST says \"INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES \n     OFF.\"  The ANALYST next spins a three digit combination code, \n     CHUNKS the door open and steps into -- \n\n     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY\n\n     -- the secured terminal room.  It's not large but it's \n     impressive.  A single terminal is bolted into the middle of \n     the floor and the glass and tile walls of the room overlook \n     computer storage towers. \n\n                          ETHAN (V.O.) \n                The first system is sound-sensitive, \n                anything above a whisper sets it off. \n                The second system is on the floor and \n                pressure-sensitive --\n\n     The ANALYST closes the vault door behind him and walks across \n     the room.  As he walks, the floor tiles light up under his \n     feet, turning off again when he lifts the weight from them. \n\n                          ETHAN (V.O.) \n                --and the third detects any increase in \n                temperature.  Even the body heat of an \n                unauthorized person in the room will \n                trigger it. \n\n     A thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is 72 \n     degrees.  The ANALYST sets his glass down, boots up the \n     computer, and starts entering data from the file folders. \n\n                          ETHAN (V.O.) \n                All three systems are state of the art. \n                \n     The ANALYST turns and takes a sip of his iced tea.  A drop of \n     condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor. When it \n     makes contact, the floor panel lights up. \n\n     INT. TRAIN STATEROOM - NIGHT\n\n     The other team members gathered around the table look at \n     ETHAN skeptically. \n\n                          LUTHER \n                And you really think we can do this. \n\n     INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT \n\n     The middle of the night and the train is dark. The team \n     members come out of the stateroom to go to bed -- KRIEGER \n     heads in one direction, ETHAN and CLAIRE in the other.\n\n     ETHAN stops.  His attention is drawn to the car ahead. There \n     is a window in the door to the car and he looks through it. \n\n     ETHAN'S P.O.V. THRU WINDOW (INT. BUSINESS CAR - NIGHT)\n\n     Ethan sees the business car, a plush space for busy \n     executives to get some work done on the train. There are \n     laptops, cellular phones, desks that fold out in front of \n     spacious seats. \n\n     A FEMALE EXECUTIVE, forty or so, is seated at one of the \n     desks, typing away into her laptop. \n\n     INT.

Just walk away. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                You don't think we're going to make it. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                I didn't say that. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                You didn't have to......... \n\n                          ETHAN\n                I just need you to be safe. \n\n                          CLAIRE\n                What about you? \n\n                          ETHAN\n                What about me - Jim called an abort - I \n                didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just \n                need you to be safe. \n\n     CLAIRE's coolness causes ETHAN to hesitate just enough to \n     take it in. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.. \n\n     And they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing \n     and half-falling onto the converted bed.  She suddenly \n     resists.  He senses it and pulls away.  \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Sorry. \n\n     He rises and goes to the door.  He's got his hand on the knob \n     when CLAIRE wraps her arms around him from behind, turns him \n     to her and kisses him, deeply.  This time they sink slowly to \n     the bed. \n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.

It's the \n     man whose picture she looked at in the storage room.  She \n     sits next to him. \n\n     He looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile, then \n     goes back to his paper. \n\n     He turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing \n     the other way, CLAIRE pulls out a small vial resembling a \n     perfume sampler.  She dumps the clear liquid contents into \n     his coffee.  He turns back and hands her part of the paper. \n     CLAIRE smiles. \n\n     COFFEE MAN drinks up.  CLAIRE stares at his shoulder \n     strangely.  He notices. \n\n     She reaches out and flicks something off his shoulder blade. \n\n     He smiles.  But she hasn't flicked something off his shoulder \n     blade, she's flicked something onto it -- a little piece of \n     shiny gray metallic tape.  CLAIRE leaves the table. COFFEE \n     MAN drinks up and leaves the table. \n\n     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY\n\n     LUTHER stares at another one of his laptops, this one with a \n     blueprint of the inside of the building.

He twitches and slumps to the ground, unconscious. \n     KRIEGER quickly grabs him around the neck. \n\n     ETHAN turns.  Holding the GUARD'S head with one hand, KRIEGER \n     pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with \n     the other.  He jabs it toward the base of the GUARD'S skull - \n\n     -- but ETHAN is on him in a flash.  He grabs KRIEGER's knife \n     arm shoving it up against the wall.  Staring into KRIEGER'S \n     face in warning. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Zero body count. \n\n                          KRIEGER \n                     (a threat) \n                We'll see.  \n\n                          ETHAN\n                Time up. \n\n     ETHAN releases him and walks away. \n\n     INT. VERTICAL DUCT - DAY \n\n     The Guard is tied up, lying on the floor of the Service Area \n     Room.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are below the open vent into the \n     duct system. \n\n     The first climb is straight up.  KRIEGER cups his hands under \n     ETHAN'S foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to \n     climb. \n\n     INT.

A \n     laser net protects the ventilator, red shafts of light cris- \n     crossing every which way.  ETHAN looks down, through the net. \n\n     He can see the computer room below and the top of the \n     TECHNICIAN'S head. \n\n     INT. DUCT - DAY                                              \n\n     In the duct, ETHAN signals to KRIEGER, making a triangle of \n     his hands.  KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi- \n     sided, pyramid shaped glass object.  \n\n     ETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of \n     the laser net's beams. The pyramid glows and we realise what \n     it is -- a prism. \n\n     The laser beam now captive in the prism, ETHAN carefully \n     moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and \n     directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the \n     shaft. \n\n     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                             \n\n     Up in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move \n     in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing.  When it appears ready \n     to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between \n     the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw. \n\n     The screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the \n     floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip \n     with a gentle CLICK, as to a magnet. \n\n     The screw is pulled up, through the shaft.  Now the whole \n     shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand. \n\n     It turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct. \n\n     A rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop \n     near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees.  A \n     gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the \n     tube, cooling the room. \n\n     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY\n\n     The TECHNICIAN defaults the security systems outside the \n     terminal room. \n\n     INT.

No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the \n     gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use. \n\n     Now ETHAN's head descends slowly into the room, his hair \n     falling in front of him. \n\n     At first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, \n     but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then \n     shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his \n     ankles and understand.  \n\n     He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and \n     temperature read out on the computer.  Suddenly ETHAN is \n     lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the \n     computer as the ANALYST enters the room. \n\n     INT.

CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                   \n\n     ETHAN descends again, slowly but steadily, until he is at the \n     same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in \n     front of the computer. \n\n     A heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together, secured by a \n     rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the \n     set of pulleys. \n\n     INT. DUCT - DAY \n\n     KRIEGER holds the rope, his jaw clenched, sweat breaking out \n     on his forehead. \n\n     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               \n\n     Unfortunately, he's three feet away from it.  He stretches \n     his arms but can't reach. \n\n     He blinks, unable to believe this.  He curls himself into a \n     situp and looks up, into the shaft. \n\n     INT. DUCT - DAY                                      \n\n     KRIEGER sees the predicament. \n\n     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               \n\n     ETHAN gestures to him, pointing to the floor.  Slowly, \n     KRIEGER drops him another few feet.  Now ETHAN's lower than \n     the terminal and still three feet away from it. \n        \n     He closes his eyes, summoning his strength and does another \n     situp, bringing himself up right in front of the terminal. \n\n     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                 \n\n     In the fire truck, LUTHER, who is watching on the Visco \n     monitor, turns his head upside down to get a look at what \n     ETHAN sees. \n\n     He cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and \n     begins to whisper.  We hear only the moist, airy sound of his \n     breath, not the words. \n\n                          LUTHER \n                Type this password: AW96B6.  Return.

He reaches \n     out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it\n     and starts typing, softly. \n\n     The computer HUMS, activated.  ETHAN unbuttons his pocket, \n     withdraws a 3.5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy \n     drive. \n\n     The computer accepts it with a soft WHIR.  ETHAN winces, even \n     that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances.  \n\n     But no alarms go off. \n\n     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                          \n\n     LUTHER cranes his head again to see the computer terminal \n     through ETHAN's trembling viewpoint.

His eyes \n     suddenly widen as he sees something next to him. \n\n     It's a rat.  KRIEGER stares. The rat stares back.  Neither \n     moves.  Puzzled by KRIEGER'S lack of response, the rat crawls \n     forward, inquisitive. \n\n     KRIEGER's eyes water, his nose twitches.  He's about to \n     sneeze. \n\n     INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY                                          \n\n     LUTHER pulls himself together and WHISPERS another command \n     into the microphone. \n\n                          LUTHER \n                You've done it.  Eject it. \n\n     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                             \n\n     The 3.5 disk is ejected from the floppy drive.  ETHAN pockets \n     it and signals to be raised. \n\n     Slowly, his body starts to move up.  As it does, a bead of \n     sweat rolls down his nose, balling at the tip. \n\n     ETHAN ignores it.  But below him, he sees the floor tiles, \n     four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the \n     computer terminal.  \n\n     His eyes widen as he realizes something -- \n\n     --the drop of sweat falls -- \n\n     --and he catches it with his right hand. \n\n     INT.

He goes to the sink and throws \n     some water on his face. He's still unaware of the piece of \n     shiny metallic tape stuck to his shoulder blade. \n\n     He walks out of the bathroom, crosses corridor to door. \n\n     INT.

LUTHER speaks into his microphone. \n\n                          LUTHER \n                He's rolling.  Get moving! \n\n     INT.

ETHAN looks up at him, wide-eyed and gestures to pull \n     him up.  KRIEGER shakes his head no. \n\n     ETHAN gestures -- \"WHAT?!\" \n\n     INT.

CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY \n\n     The TECHNICIAN deactivates the alarm systems, swings the \n     door open and comes back into the room.  \n\n     He turns to close the door behind him and in so doing just \n     misses seeing ETHAN'S head as it is pulled back up into the \n     ceiling. \n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     INT.

He sees \n     the knife, picks it up, looks at it and then puts it down. \n     He resumes his work at the computer but when he punches up \n     his program, something prints out on his screen.  Its header: \n\n                KEYSTROKE LOG -- FILE DOWNLOAD \n                    11/18/95 9.58 AM\n\n     And it goes on.  The TECHNICIAN'S eyes widen in disbelief. \n     He spins back in his chair and reaches for the nearest \n     telephone. \n\n     INT. CIA - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY                           \n\n     In the communications room, tempers are running a little \n     high.

Behind KITTRIDGE, on \n     the other side of the room, the phone starts to ring. \n\n     An AGENT gets up to answer it as a creeping fear pervades the \n     room. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) \n                     (joking) \n                Other than here. \n\n     Nervous laughter goes around the table.

He holds the phone out \n     to KITTRIDGE, shaking slightly. \n\n                          AGENT \n                It's for you. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                Kittridge, yup? \n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.

They exchange looks of massive relief. \n     But no one speaks.  LUTHER, in particular, looks heavily \n     troubled by what they've just done. \n\n     ETHAN looks at CLAIRE, who is jammed into the seat next to \n     him.  She drops her head on his shoulder, exhausted. \n\n     KRIEGER, in the driver's seat literally and figuratively. \n\n     ETHAN just looks straight ahead and to CLAIRE. \n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     INT.

KITTRIDGE sits in a chair beside, \n     staring gravely at him. \n\n     He gets up and walks to the door, where HARRY BARNES hovers. \n     KITTRIDGE lowers his voice, it's barely audible. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) \n                     (to Barnes) \n                You and I know about this -- and that's \n                where it stops.

ETHAN hurriedly digs through an overnight \n     bag until he finds what he's looking for -- the now-battered \n     bible he's used to contact Max.  He flips through the pages \n     and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and \n     waiting on the tiny desk. \n\n     LUTHER, alone in a chair across the room. is seriously \n     preoccupied.  KRIEGER is sprawled-on a ratty sofa, hoisting a \n     lager and watching CNN. \n\n     CLAIRE is at the window staring out, anxious. \n\n     KRIEGER glances over the back of the sofa at ETHAN. \n\n                          KRIEGER \n                You contacting your buyer? \n                     (no answer) \n                Ethan? \n\n     From the desk, ETHAN glances up.

Oh, 'scuse me Mr. Hunt? \n\n     ETHAN ignores him, working.  His computer jams with static as \n     it connects to a BBS.  The screen blinks and displays the \n     familiar Bible group service through which he's contacted \n     Max.  When it asks him which chapter and verse for the \n     posting, ETHAN flicks through the Bible, looking for the next \n     code.  He  begins to type. \n\n                MAX -- Now might be an excellent time \n                to interpret Scripture face to face. \n                Meet on TGV, noon tomorrow.

Bring our mutual friend \n                Job.\n\n     KRIEGER suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible \n     out of Ethan's hands to the floor. \n\n                          KRIEGER \n                You're not going to any meeting without me. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                My contact is extremely shy. \n\n     He goes back to the computer, his finger hovering over the \n     \"ENTER\" button. \n\n     LUTHER and CLAIRE watch this growing conflict closely. ETHAN \n     sighs and stands up.  KRIEGER pulls out the blue disk he took \n     from ETHAN in the computer room and waves it in front of him. \n\n                          KRIEGER \n                I don't think you're in any position to \n                give orders, do you?  Not while I'm \n                holding this. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                Krieger. \n\n                          KRIEGER \n                Stay out of this. \n                OR \n                Lachez - moi \n                OR  \n                T'agueue \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Don't you mean this? \n\n     He reaches into his briefcase and pulls out an identical \n     disk.  He puts it back in his jacket pocket. \n\n     KRIEGER stares for a second. \n\n                          KRIEGER\n                That's not it.

KRIEGER does.  The pocket is empty. \n\n                          ETHAN (CONT'D) \n                     (mock surprise) \n                Where did it go?!

He was carrying two discs. \n\n     While he talks, he rotates his hand, palm away from KRIEGER. \n     When he rotates it back, the disk is gone again.  He holds up \n     his left hand.  It's there now. \n\n                          ETHAN (CONT'D) \n                So hard to keep track of these things. \n\n     ETHAN shows his hands -- now both are empty. \n\n                          KRIEGER \n                     (fuming) \n                Where is it? \n\n     ETHAN pats his pockets, pretending to be frantic. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                I thought you had it!  Do you actually \n                think I'd let you have the NOC list? \n\n     KRIEGER just stares at him, shaken.  CLAIRE laughs.  KRIEGER \n     looks at her.  He turns completely red.  When he looks back \n     at ETHAN, ETHAN holds two disks -- one in each hand. \n\n                          KRIEGER \n                Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and \n                I\u00edll cut your throat. \n\n     He tosses his worthless disk into the trash can and storms \n     out, SLAMMING the door behind him.  ETHAN picks up the Bible \n     and sees Drake Hotel. \n\n                          CLAIRE \n                I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've \n                never worked with him.

Then one morning you wake\n                up and find out the President of the\n                United States is running the country -\n                without your permission.  The son-of-a-\n                bitch!  How dare he?  You realize it\u00eds\n                over, you\u00edre an obsolete piece of\n                hardware not worth upgrading, you\u00edve got\n                a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a \n                year.  Kittridge, we\u00edll go after that no\n                good son-of-a-bitch, big time!\n\n                          ETHAN\n                We don\u00edt have to, Jim.

No guns.  Real plus.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to\n                Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me.\n                I\u00edll have Claire and Luther Stickell with\n                me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will\n                have helicopter transport waiting in\n                Paris.\n\n     PHELPS looks away.  Seems badly shaken.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Jim...?\n\n                          PHELPS\n                I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you\n                and suddenly there she was, standing in\n                the rain just outside the safe\n                house..alive and beautiful..and thinking\n                I\u00edm dead and gone.  God knows what she\u00eds\n                had to do forget about me to keep going\n                and get the job done, I..\n\n     PHELPS breaks off abruptly.  Apparently some inner struggle\n     over this threatens to overwhelm him.  Then, controlling it:\n\n                          PHELPS\n                - no.  She can\u00edt know about me.  No one\n                can.  Not til this is over.  There\u00eds too\n                much at stake, Ethan.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                You\u00edre probably right.\n\n                          PHELPS\n                I usually am.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                Once we leave the safehouse, get in there\n                and crash.  I\u00edll call you from Paris.\n\n                          PHELPS\n                You got it.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                And get a doctor.\n\n                          PHELPS\n                Good luck.\n\n     INT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - CLAIRE\u00edS ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     The door to CLAIRE'S room in the safe house opens, throwing a\n     shaft of light over her form.  ETHAN creeps in and closes the\n     door behind him.\n\n     It is approximately one a.m. .  CLAIRE is huddled in the\n     corner.  ETHAN enters and stands looking at her.\n\n                          CLAIRE\n                What happened?\n\n                          ETHAN\n                  (walks towards her)\n                I sent the message to Max.

She wraps an arm around him\n     and he holds onto the kiss.  The room appears to revolve\n     around them.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     EXT. PRIVATE HELIPAD - DAY\n\n     Suddenly it\u00eds bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our\n     eyes.\n\n     KITTRIDGE and BARNES step off a military helicopter, blinking\n     at the sunlight and hurry down the steps.\n\n     TWO AGENTS immediately flank KITTRIDGE at the bottom and fall\n     into step alongside, ready to brief him.  One of them holds\n     out a small package with \"for Job\" written on it.\n\n     KITTRIDGE looks at him.  He rips it open.  A note inside\n     simply says:\n\n                      TGV.  LONDON TERMINUS\n                              Noon.\n\n     KITTRIDGE looks at his watch.  It\u00eds ten to twelve.\n\n     As he reads the note, something else falls out of the\n     envelope and CLUNKS to the ground.\n\n     He bends over, picks it up, and looks at it.  Cradled in his\n     hand, we can\u00edt see what it is.  But to him, it\u00eds very\n     interesting.\n\n     He steps up his pace, headed for the car.\n\n                          KITTRIDGE\n                     (to the Agent) \n                How long to the London Terminus?\n\n                          AGENT\n                Twenty, twenty-five minutes.\n\n                          KITTRIDGE\n                You\u00edve got ten.  Move!\n\n     INT. WATERLOO STATION PLATFORM - DAY\n\n     The sleek front power car, looking like the nose of an SST,\n     gets its 25,000 volt charge from the overhead catenary.\n\n     The rear power car gets its jolt.\n\n     The TGV starts to move, pulling out of the station.\n\n     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY\n\n     The business car is similar to the one ETHAN saw on the first\n     train they look across Europe.  It\u00eds crowded, maybe THIRTY\n     MEN and WOMEN in suits, most of them already immersed in work\n     on their laptops or talking on their cellular phones.\n\n     One such woman is MAX in her seat, number 27.  MATTHIAS and\n     the OTHER MAN, last seen dropping off ETHAN in Prague, sit\n     across from her, her laptop is on the table next to her, in\n     her briefcase.\n\n                          MAX\n                How long until we reach the Chunnel?\n\n                          MATTHIAS\n                Twenty minutes.\n\n     INT. REAR CAR - MOVING - DAY\n\n     A MAN puts a cellular phone and a radio/cassette machine on\n     the bunk-bed.  We only see his hands as he proceeds to take\n     the parts of a pistol out of the cassette machine and\n     assemble a wicked-looking pistol from the seemingly innocuous\n     electrical parts inside.\n\n     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY\n\n     MAX is reading the Financial Times.  MATTHIAS is looking out\n     of the window.  A cellular phone rings inside MAX\u00eds briefcase\n     in front of MATTHIAS.  MATTHIAS takes the phone out.\n\n                          MATTHIAS\n                Yes...\n                     (holds phone out for Max)\n                It\u00eds him.\n\n                          MAX\n                     (into phone) \n                This wasn\u00edt what we discussed.\n\n                          ETHAN (O.S.)\n                     (on phone) \n                My apologies Max.  Couldn\u00edt be helped.\n                There\u00eds a piece of black cloth under your\n                seat.  Tear it away and you\u00edll find the\n                disk.\n\n     MAX reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer\n     disk as promised.  She hands it to Matthias who strips off\n     the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the\n     computer in the briefcase.  He boots it up quickly and turns\n     the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to\n     see.\n\n     One half of the screen, with the heading \"CRYPTONYM AND\n     OPERATIONAL SPECS\" is already jammed with information.  The\n     blank second half of the screen acquires the title \"TRUE\n     NAME,\" and information starts filling itself in rapidly --\n     names, addresses, identities.\n\n     As the two sides match up, a legend flashes:\n\n                IDENTITY MATCH\n\n                          MAX\n                     (back into phone) \n                Ha, dear boy!

Once you\u00edve\n                got the money -- he\u00edll find you.\n\n     INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE)\n\n     LUTHER, three rows behind in another seat, is at work on a\n     laptop of his own.  A mobile Nokia phone is beside it - red\n     light flashing.\n\n     INT. SECOND CLASS CAR - MOVING (ANOTHER ANGLE) - DAY\n\n     KITTRIDGE and BARNES move through the second class car.  They\n     turn around and start working their way back again.\n\n     At the front, CLAIRE is getting desperate.  A LARGE MAN\n     passes through the door behind her.\n\n     The LARGE MAN continues back, nearing KITTRIDGE and BARNES,\n     who are forced to step into empty seats on the side in order\n     to make room for him to pass.  As they move by him, their\n     vision is momentarily blocked --\n\n     -- and CLAIRE gets up to follow.\n\n     She follows to the rear of the car and she passes through the\n     door and out of the car, after KITTRIDGE and BARNES talk in\n     doorway.\n\n                          BARNES\n                Only four more cars.\n\n                          KITTRIDGE\n                And if we don\u00edt find him - we\u00edll search\n                the whole train again.\n\n                          BARNES\n                What\u00eds Hunt doing on the TGV?\n\n                          KITTRIDGE\n                High speed train.

He gets up, taking his computer with him, headed\n     for the rear of the car.

Oh, Ethan\n                is in love with you, Claire, make no\n                mistake about it.

ETHAN looks to ladder hatch and climbs ladder. \n\n     INT. REAR CAR - ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY\n\n     PHELPS climbs up a ladder past an inert engineer slumped over \n     the control panel -- an obvious earlier victim of PHELPS. \n     PHELPS puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door \n     and climbs through it -- \n\n     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY\n\n     -- halfway out onto the roof of the train.  He reaches into \n     his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle \n     on the end of it.  He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof \n     and pulls himself the rest of the way out. \n\n     He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the \n     smooth surface of the train. \n\n     Now for the tough part.  Using the suction cups, PHELPS \n     slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and \n     replanting the cups as he goes.  \n\n     He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the \n     back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, \n     a window for the ENGINEER. \n\n     Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his \n     belt.\n\n     He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train.  From out \n     of the fog, a helicopter approaches. \n\n     PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is \n     going.  In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching \n     the tunnel under the English Channel.  His eyes widen. \n\n     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY\n\n     KRIEGER is at the controls.  He sees the approaching tunnel \n     as well. \n\n     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY\n\n     PHELPS crawls like hell to get into position.  Looking up, he \n     sees KRIEGER pointing frantically behind him. PHELPS turns. \n\n     ETHAN is climbing out the trap door. \n\n     A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost \n     touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it. \n\n     ETHAN, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. \n     Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to \n     grab small holes on the roof.  \n\n     He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other \n     way.  Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof. \n\n     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY\n\n     KRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching.  He gestures \n     to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing \n     over PHELPS and then back to him. \n\n     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY\n\n     PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto \n     his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the \n     roof. \n\n     ETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto \n     the roof. \n\n     PHELPS and ETHAN struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously \n     closer to the chunnel entrance. \n\n     They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance. \n\n     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY\n\n     KRIEGER sees the tunnel, only seconds away now.  He paws at \n     the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever. \n\n     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY\n\n     PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the \n     train.  PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the \n     strap manages to pull himself back on. \n\n     -- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel -- \n\n     -- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT! \n\n     INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY\n\n     As the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes \n     nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes \n     one last time.  This time it says: \n\n                CONNECTION TERMINATED. \n                    TRANSFER LOST.\n\n     MAX'S face falls. \n\n                          MAX\n                Damn!\n\n     INT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY\n\n     Another CONDUCTOR races into the power car, past his inert \n     companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the \n     train.  He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it. \n\n                          CONDUCTOR \n                No, no, it's IN the tunnel! \n\n                          VOICE (O.S.) \n                Stop the train! \n\n                          CONDUCTOR \n                It'll crash into us!  Accelerate, \n                accelerate. \n\n     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY\n\n     For a moment, we see no one.  No ETHAN.  No PHELPS.  Moving \n     around to the other end of the car, we see where they've \n     gone. \n\n     They're dangling from either side of it. \n\n     PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself \n     back onto the roof of the train.  ETHAN reaches for the other \n     cup. \n\n     The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track \n     and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER \n     pushing it up to full speed again. \n\n     But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the \n     train. \n\n     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY\n\n     PHELPS, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the \n     windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of \n     KRIEGER'S copter. \n\n     He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the \n     other direction. \n\n     Another train. \n\n     At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the \n     oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the \n     roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as \n     it blows by. \n\n     The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS \n     misses the skid.  \n\n     KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate \n     ETHAN with the rotor.  PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the \n     copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the \n     tunnel.  SPARKS and chunks of cement fly.  \n\n     KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly.  ETHAN uses the moment to \n     leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid. \n\n     PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another. \n     Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls \n     out -- \n\n     -- a red and green piece of bubble gum. \n\n     PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles \n     frantically for his gun. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Red light, green light.  Asta Lasagna \n                mother fucker. \n\n     ETHAN mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the \n     copter's underbelly and turns away from it. \n\n     PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum, SCREAMING -- \n\n     -- but the gum EXPLODES.  The force of the blast rockets \n     ETHAN forward, he lands on the train's windshield. \n\n     The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers \n     wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under \n     the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball. \n\n     ETHAN, stuck on the windshield, can only watch as the \n     wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him. \n     It stops just short of him, with its bent and broken rotor \n     blade barely missing his throat.  \n\n     ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly \n     drained. \n\n     INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY\n\n     KITTRIDGE comes back into the business car and is joined by \n     BARNES.  LUTHER, only slightly bruised, stands up next to \n     them and gestures to MAX and her laptop. \n\n                          LUTHER\n                I think this is what you're looking for. \n\n     MAX looks up, stunned.  KITTRIDGE leans over and peers at her \n     screen. He just smiles and sits down next to her, content to \n     wait for her to speak. \n\n     When she finally does, she's almost charming. \n\n                          MAX \n                My lawyers will have a field day with \n                this.  Entrapment, jurisdictional \n                conflicts -- \n\n     KITTRIDGE leans closer to her and lowers his voice, just as \n     friendly. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of \n                this one. \n\n                          MAX \n                I'm sure we can find something I have \n                that you need. \n\n                          KITTRIDGE \n                You know, I would love to try. \n\n     EXT. LONDON PUB - DAY\n\n     LUTHER sits on a high stool, his PowerBook next to him, while \n     he sips a beer.  A television screen is featuring follow-up \n     coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in \n     the chunnel.  Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of \n     a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in \n     the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was \n     there were no other fatalaties.  There are intermittent \n     sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of \n     arrivals and departures.  ETHAN into shot.  He sits beside \n     LUTHER. \n\n                          LUTHER \n                Reach your folks? \n                     (ETHAN nods) \n                How they feeling? \n\n                          ETHAN\n                About what? \n\n                          LUTHER \n                The official apology from the Justice \n                Department, the VIP treatment, you know, \n                the whole nine yards. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Well my Mother was a little confused \n                about how the DEA could mistake her and \n                Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers \n                in the Florida keys. \n\n     LUTHER picks up his beer. \n\n                          LUTHER\n                     (Laughs and with a British accent) \n                Cheers. \n\n     They drink. \n\n                          ETHAN\n                Here's to  you, Luther. (clink glasses)  To \n                being off the disavowed list. \n\n                          LUTHER \n                Hey, I'm the flavour of the month! \n\n                          ETHAN\n                You're more than that, Luther.  They were \n                mistaken about you and they're trying to \n                show you they know it.  They want you \n                back in. \n\n                          LUTHER\n                Sure.  They want me back in so I won't \n                break in!  They still can't figure out \n                how we did it. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing? \n\n                          LUTHER \n                I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back \n                pay, give me a promotion, check out my \n                office at Langley and then, maybe, talk \n                about it. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                     (laughing) \n                It's all one big negotiation, isn't it? \n\n                          LUTHER \n                Why don't you come back with me? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Just don't know why I'd be doing it. \n\n                          LUTHER \n                You really liked Phelps, didn't you? \n\n                          ETHAN \n                He was a good guy for a long, long time. \n                Just - not long enough. (looks up) Gotta \n                catch my flight..(rising) \n                So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen \n                again? \n\n                          LUTHER \n                Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss \n                being disreputable. \n\n                          ETHAN \n                Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any \n                better I'll always think of you that way. \n\n     The two men understand one another and LUTHER will say no \n     more.  The two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a \n     moment ETHAN disappears from the bar, leaving a contemplative \n     LUTHER looking after him. \n\n     INT. PLANE - NIGHT \n\n     ETHAN HUNT slumps down in his scat, dosing. A FLIGHT \n     ATTENDANT makes her way down the aisle, holding a case filled \n     with movie cassettes. She stops before a lady passenger. \n\n                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT \n                Would you like to watch a movie, Miss \n                Clarke? \n\n     She then stops before ETHAN. \n\n                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT \n                Excuse me, Mr. Hunt.  Would you like to\n                watch a movie.\n\n                          ETHAN\n                No, thank you.\n\n                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT \n                Would you consider the cinema of the \n                Caribbean? \n\n     ETHAN just stares at her.  This couldn't be what it's \n     sounding like. \n\n                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT \n                Aruba, perhaps? \n\n     The camera moves into ETHAN's face.  They found him.  They \n     want him back.  He looks up at her and..... \n\n                                                      CUT TO BLACK \n\n\n                           THE END \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMission Impossible\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Robert Towne\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:31:23.163075"}
