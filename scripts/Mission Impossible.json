THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR\n</b><b>     THIS SOFT COPY.\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>     INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\n     We're in a large closet.  JACK KIEFER, an athletic American\n     in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a\n     corner, staring at a television screen.\n\n     The television shows a surveillance view of the living room\n     that lies outside the confines of the closet.  The TV image\n     is in black and white.  JACK shifts, trying like hell to get\n     comfortable but he's been there a while\n\n<b>     ON THE SCREEN\n</b>\n     A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel\n     room.  Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits\n     in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T-\n     shirt.  There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the\n     room behind him.  A legend:\n\n<b>                          KIEV\n</b>\n     KASIMOV is sobbing.  Uncontrollably.  A MAN enters the room,\n     ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian\n     godfather.  The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out.  ANATOLY\n     looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit\n     by him in a chair he picks up for him.  KASIMOV does as he is\n     bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY.  They speak in Russian\n     which is subtitled.\n\n<b>                          ANATOLY\n</b>                Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called\n                us.\n\n<b>                          KASIMOV\n</b>                     (sobbing)\n                I don't remember what happened!  We were\n                at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having\n                fun.\n\n     ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the\n     room.  A WOMAN lies half under the sheets.  She's lying in an\n     unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared\n     with blood.  She's dead.  ANATOLY lifts her eyelid.\n\n<b>                          KASIMOV\n</b>                I don't even know how I got here.\n                I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I\n                didn't lay a finger on her.\n\n     ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN.\n\n<b>                          ANATOLY\n</b>                Kasimov.  Don't flounder.\n\n<b>     IN THE CLOSET\n</b>\n     JACK, impatient, checks his watch. \n\n<b>                          JACK \n</b>                Jesus, she's been under too long.  Come \n                on, come on! \n\n<b>     ON THE SCREEN \n</b>\n<b>                          KASIMOV \n</b>                You're the only one who can help me. \n\n     Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket.  But ANATOLY hits \n     his hand away and smacks him around the head. \n\n<b>     IN THE CLOSET \n</b>\n     JACK reacts. \n\n<b>     ON THE SCREEN\n</b>\n     ANATOLY bends close to KASIMOV. \n\n<b>                          ANATOLY \n</b>                C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon. \n\n<b>                          KASIMOV \n</b>                They'll kill me. \n\n     ANATOLY paces up the room, away from KASIMOV. \n\n<b>                          ANATOLY \n</b>                You asked for my help.

She quickly leaves. \n\n<b>     INT. SHABBY ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     We enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does. \n     She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot \n     glasses. \n\n<b>                          ANATOLY \n</b>                Now, we drink. \n\n     He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV. \n\n<b>                          ANATOLY (CONT'D) \n</b>                To friends. \n\n<b>                          KASIMOV \n</b>                Yes, Anatoly, yes. \n\n<b>                          JACK \n</b>                Cheers. \n\n     He drinks.  He blinks.  Something felt funny about that. \n     Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY \n     moves to the closet door and opens it. \n\n<b>     IN THE CLOSET \n</b>\n     ANATOLY reaches up to his face --\n\n     --<u>and tears away a mask of flesh</u>.  He's no middle aged \n     Russian mobster, he's ETHAN HUNT, an American in his early \n     thirties.  He gestures to KASIMOV contemptuously.  JACK hands \n     ETHAN a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the \n     room. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                     (in English now) \n                Get rid of this scum. \n\n     Immediately, there is activity, and PEOPLE everywhere.  TWO \n     OTHERS come into the room and carry KASIMOV out. \n\n     ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks \n     the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He \n     strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the \n     dead woman's thigh.  He checks her pulse again, checking a \n     stopwatch.  In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open. \n\n     CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half \n     rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her \n     mouth. \n\n<b>                          CLAIRE \n</b>                Did we get it? \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                We got it.  On your feet. \n\n<b>                          CLAIRE \n</b>                I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                Walk, just walk.  Start walking. \n\n<b>                          CLAIRE \n</b>                I'm walking. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                Talking's good, walking's better. \n\n<b>                          CLAIRE \n</b>                Sleeping's better. \n\n     Meanwhile, MEN in overalls take apart the room.  The ceiling \n     lifts right off the walls, and the walls themselves start to \n     come down, revealing the \"hotel room\" to be an elaborate set \n     in the middle of an empty warehouse. \n\n     JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE \n     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN \n     stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him \n     questioningly. \n\n<b>                          CLAIRE \n</b>                Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong\n                with you? \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                If you're gonna do this again Claire, \n                It's not gonna be on my watch. \n\n<b>                          CLAIRE \n</b>                Oh yeah? \n\n     JACK comes into the room from the closet.  He hands CLAIRE \n     her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring.  ETHAN \n     stops what he's doing, noticing.  She looks up at him, \n     questioningly. \n\n<b>                          JACK \n</b>                Claire. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                Jack. \n\n     She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her \n     finger.  ETHAN notices.  He turns and SHOUTS to the room at \n     large. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN\n</b><b>                IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT \n</b><b>                OUT OF HERE YET?! \n</b>\n<b>                          JACK \n</b>                Just waiting for you, tubs. \n\n     He walks across the room and out the door.  CLAIRE, worried, \n     clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding \n     ring. \n\n     We move in on it --\n\n<b>                                                            CUT TO: \n</b>\n<b>     INT. JET - DAY\n</b>\n     -- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a MAN's \n     finger. One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the \n     plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner.  He shoves \n     some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a \n     fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE. \n\n     The pilot's voice makes an announcement. \n\n<b>                          VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>                Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off \n                at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight \n                thousand feet-and we should be arriving \n                in Prague right on schedule. \n\n     A FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats, passing \n     out menus. \n\n<b>                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT \n</b>                Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen? \n\n     A passenger takes one.  The ATTENDANT continues on. \n\n<b>                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT \n</b><b>                          (CONT'D) \n</b>                Would you like to watch a movie Mr \n                Phelps? \n\n     The MAN with the wedding ring looks up.  JIM PHELPS is in his \n     mid-forties, good-looking, intense.  He's a tired man, and \n     not just now, it's a profound fatigue.  He looks up at the \n     ATTENDANT and smiles warmly. \n\n<b>                          PHELPS \n</b>                No, I prefer the theatre.  \n\n     A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes \n     stilted. \n\n<b>                          FLIGHT ATTENDANT \n</b>                Would you consider the cinema of the\n                Ukraine? \n\n<b>                          PHELPS \n</b>                Perhaps you'd choose one for me. \n\n     The ATTENDANT turns and walks away.  PHELPS sits back, shakes \n     a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the \n     armrest. \n\n<b>     AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN.\n</b>\n     The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8 \n     cassettes of feature films.  She opens a panel in the top of \n     the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there. \n\n<b>     BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT\n</b>\n     The ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS. \n     He takes it without a word and she moves on. \n\n     PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between \n     his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small \n     movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the \n     other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the \n     armrest, and puts the tape in. \n\n     He presses play.\n\n<b>     ON THE TAPE, \n</b>\n     the image of a man comes on.  EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, \n     but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed \n     glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than \n     tieless.  But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever \n     look away.  He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE \n</b>                     (on the tape) \n                Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're \n                about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn -- \n\n     The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man \n     in his forties.  The image is herky-jerky videotape, \n     presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks \n     down a foreign street. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) \n</b>                -- a former KGB Line X officer now \n                working the international black market \n                selling intelligence.  This morning, we \n                learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half \n                of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- \n                official cover agents working in Eastern \n                Europe. \n\n     The screen shows an image of what such a list might look \n     like, code names and other information scrolling by on a \n     computer screen at high speed. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) \n</b>                For security reasons, the NOC list is \n                divided into two encoded halves. \n                Golitsyn already has the cryptonym \n                portion, which contains agent code names \n                and targeting areas.  This portion is \n                useless unless combined with the second \n                half -- the true name list that is kept \n                in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague. \n\n     The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building \n     at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava \n     River. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) \n</b>                We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the \n                true name list at an Embassy function \n                tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you \n                decide to accept it, is to obtain \n                photographic proof of the theft, apprehend \n                those involved, and return the stolen \n                list.  I don't have to stress the \n                importance of this matter, Jim.  We're \n                keeping it internally black. Because of  \n                its urgency, I've already sent to Prague \n                a team selected from your usual group. \n\n     Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already \n     seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) \n</b>                Ethan Hunt will of course be your point \n                man, as usual.  He's in Kiev; we're \n                getting word to him now. \n\n<b>     INT. JET - DAY\n</b>\n     PHELPS sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his \n     tired brow.  KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE (O.S.) \n</b>                As always, should you or any member of \n                your IM force be caught or killed, the \n                Secretary will disavow all knowledge of \n                your actions.  This tape will self- \n                destruct in five seconds.  Good luck, \n                Jim! \n\n     PHELPS inhales deeply -- \n\n     -- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder, sending up a \n     plume of wispy smoke -- \n\n     -- and PHELPS exhales, concealing the plume in a cloud of \n     cigarette smoke. \n\n<b>                                                            CUT TO: \n</b>\n<b>     EXT.

CLAIRE is seated opposite JACK at \n     the computer.  JIM and ETHAN are in the kitchen.  HANNAH \n     taking a roll of black-out curtain through the room. \n\n<b>                          JACK \n</b>                Look to your right, then back to me. \n                There's a camera built right into the \n                bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and \n                transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?\n\n<b>                          SARAH \n</b>                Of course I can hear you. \n\n<b>                          JACK \n</b>                No, in your...ear piece.

And because \n                you'd burn up before you'd burn out. \n\n     CLAIRE, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to \n     be the reference point in the following exchange: \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                How was Chicago? \n\n<b>                          PHELPS \n</b>                Wonderful.

His wife's got a year \n                old kid.  So he says \"All right.  Who was \n                it?  My friend Harry?\"  She says no. \"Oh,\n                it was my friend Sammy.\"  She says it \n                wasn't Sammy.  \"Oh, I suppose it was my \n                friend Lou.\"  \"No, what's the matter, \n                don't you think I have any friends of my \n                own?!\" \n\n     PHELPS laughs.  ETHAN doesn't.  The back of CLAIRE'S head is \n     in his line of sight. \n\n<b>                          PHELPS (CONT'D) \n</b>                Boy, you really are grim.

Tomorrow night, if \n                anything goes wrong, this guy will steal \n                the names of our agents in every country \n                all over Eastern Europe.  Up for grabs to \n                the highest bidders -- third world \n                terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords -- \n                any and everybody who'd love to get rid \n                of long term coverts like us, and some \n                very dear friends among them.  If they're \n                exposed, they'll be executed.  Come over \n                here.  Take a lock at this. \n\n     CLAIRE, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a \n     quicktime video image in a box on her screen.  In it, an old \n     edition of the McLaughlin Report, the PBS news show, is \n     playing. \n\n     ETHAN is distracted by it. \n\n<b>     INSERT - TELEVISION\n</b>\n     SENATOR WALTZER, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, \n     is holding forth: \n\n<b>                          SENATOR WALTZER \n</b>                I'll go you one further.  I say the CIA \n                and all its shadow organizations have \n                become irrelevant at best and \n                unconstitutional at worst.  It's time we \n                throw a little light on the whole concept \n                of the Pentagon's \"black budget.\"  These \n                covert agency subgroups have confidential \n                funding, they report to no one -- <u>who are</u>\n                <u>these people</u>?!  We <u>were</u> living in a \n                democracy the last time I checked. \n\n<b>     BACK TO SCENE \n</b>\n     ETHAN looks back at JIM. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                You're going to use Walter? \n\n<b>                          PHELPS \n</b>                He's our guy. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing? \n\n<b>                          PHELPS \n</b>                Not this week.

AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River.  Party \n     at the Embassy tonight. \n\n<b>     INT. AN ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT\n</b>\n     JACK, wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking \n     eyeglasses (they're called Visco glasses), enters an elevator \n     shaft through a small door at the base of the wall.  He looks \n     up the shaft, shining a flashlight until he finds what he's \n     looking for -- \n\n     -- <u>a gray metal box</u>, protruding from the wall one floor up. \n\n<b>     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     PHELPS is at a table in the safe house apartment, watching \n     the bank of monitors HANNAH wired together earlier. The \n     monitors are alive now, showing various views of the inside \n     of the Embassy, where the party is going on, and one view of \n     the elevator shaft. \n\n     PHELPS wearing an IMF headset and speaks into the mouthpiece. \n\n<b>                          PHELPS \n</b>                Ethan.  Jack's inside.  Window's open by \n                twenty-three hundred. \n\n<b>     INT. EMBASSY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Inside the Embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair \n     that's in full swing on the second floor. \n\n     SENATOR WALTZER, the man who was on TV, walks up a grand \n     staircase, headed in.  An AMERICAN DIPLOMAT in a tuxedo \n     hurries up to him. \n\n<b>                          DIPLOMAT \n</b>                How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, \n                the Ambassador's aide.  If I could just \n                steer you through the reception line here\n<b>                --\n</b>\n     The DIPLOMAT pilots the SENATOR by one arm, guiding him to a \n     reception line at the base of the stairs to the party. \n\n<b>                          DIPLOMAT (CONT'D) \n</b>                Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the \n                director of the National Gallery -- Petr \n                Brandl, the mayor of Prague -- \n\n     SARAH, a very attractive young American dressed in an elegant \n     gown, steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with \n<b>     WALTZER. \n</b>\n<b>                          SARAH \n</b>                I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator? \n\n<b>                          SENATOR WALTZER \n</b>                Of course I do.  How are you, Miss \n                Norman? \n\n     He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so \n     SARAH whispers something in his ear. \n\n<b>                          SARAH \n</b>                He's in pocket.  Under the archway behind me. \n\n     Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team. \n\n     The SENATOR pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket \n     (and if we didn't know the SENATOR was ETHAN before, this \n     confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder. \n\n<b>     UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE, \n</b>\n     ALEKSANDER GOLITSYN, the Ukrainian, has just come in from \n     outside. \n\n<b>     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     PHELPS sees the SENATOR's point of view of GOLITSYN, through \n     the glasses, broadcast back to PHELPS' monitor.  He speaks \n     into his microphone. \n\n<b>                          PHELPS \n</b>                Sarah, mark the package and go to two. \n\n<b>     INT.

ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT                               \n</b>\n     JACK climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal \n     box.  He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a \n     noise from above.  He looks up and sees the elevator above \n     him descending. \n\n     JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. The \n     elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him \n     to the wall. \n\n<b>                          JACK \n</b>                Great.  Come on. \n\n<b>     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT \n</b>\n     As the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, \n     SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse.  But as \n     she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing \n     herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head.  He never \n     notices.  They move on and down the flight of stairs. \n\n<b>     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT     \n</b>\n     JIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party.  He looks \n     to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party, a jumpy \n     one, as someone hurrying up stairs. \n\n<b>                          PHELPS \n</b>                Hannah.  He's marked.  Lets go. \n\n<b>     INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     On a flight of stairs, HANNAH, dressed for the party and \n     slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs. \n\n<b>                          HANNAH \n</b>                En route. \n\n     She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the \n     party below.  She pushes a micro switch on the side of her \n     glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the \n     lenses. \n\n<b>                          PHELPS (O/S) \n</b>                Hannah, pull the shade (or - Hannah go to\n                night vision). \n\n<b>     HANNAH\u00edS VISCO POV \n</b>\n     the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands \n     out.  That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green \n     where SARAH sprayed it. \n\n<b>     INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT\n</b>\n     The SENATOR (let's just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down \n     the stairs and pass a sign that says \"Denied Area -- \n     Political Attaches Only.\"  ETHAN checks his watch.  23:00. \n\n     He nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an \n     elevator at the end of the corridor.

He disappears\n     into the fog at the edge of the river.\n\n<b>     EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     ETHAN checks his monitor again.\n\n<b>     THE MONITOR\n</b>\n     PHELPS\u00ed point of view changes radically as his head swivels\n     on the darkened bridge.  He whirls again, looking over his\n     shoulder and this time <u>the barrel of a gun</u> is visible,\n     pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a\n     GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor.\n\n     The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down\n     to a bloody hole in his own chest.\n\n     His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge\n     and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.\n<b>        \n</b><b>     EXT.

CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but there\u00eds\n     no sign of PHELPS.\n\n     ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but\n     sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming\n     obscured in the gathering fog.\n\n     He turns and looks to the embankment.  He can faintly see\n     GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade.  ETHAN gives chase.\n\n<b>     EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT\n</b>\n     ETHAN runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point\n     on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIRE\u00edS outline,\n     visible in the driver\u00eds seat.  But as he descends the stairs\n<b>     --\n</b>\n     --<u>the car explodes and bursts into flames</u>.\n\n     The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back.\n\n<b>                          ETHAN\n</b><b>                CLAIRE!\n</b>\n     He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a \n     stunned CROWD starts to gather.\n\n     Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the\n     embankment.\n\n<b>     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\n     SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees\n     GOLITSYN again, slowing down.  A MAN comes out of the fog an\n     seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light.\n\n     SARAH draws closer.  Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to\n     be hanging with her for some reason.\n\n<b>     EXT. STAIRS FROM BRIDGE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     ETHAN continues towards the embankment.\n\n<b>     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\n     SARAH is almost to GOLITSYN.  Suddenly, the MAN in front of\n     GOLITSYN <u>pulls him towards him</u>.  Sensing something wrong,\n     SARAH quickens her pace.  The MAN is now hunched over\n     GOLITSYN, facing away from SARAH, going through GOLITSYN\u00eds\n     pockets.\n\n     The figure finds what it\u00eds looking for -- the disk -- and\n     takes it.  SARAH comes closer --\n\n     -- and the figure whirls.  It brings a knife up sharply,\n     plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.\n\n<b>     ANGLE\n</b>\n     ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment.  He bursts\n     out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees,\n     over GOLITSYN\u00eds body.  ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and\n<b>     GASPS.\n</b>\n     He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death.  He\n     looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated\n     edge.\n\n<b>     BEHIND ETHAN\n</b>\n     The DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more.  In fact, they\u00edre\n     watching ETHAN.  Through the fog and night, they see him\n     leaning over SARAH, holding the knife in his hands.\n\n<b>     AT THE BODIES\n</b>\n     SARAH goes still.  ETHAN lays her down, turns the other body\n     over and sees that it is GOLITSYN.  He quickly begins\n     rummaging through his pockets.\n\n     ETHAN hear police sirens and sees...\n\n<b>     ANGLE\n</b>\n     A Prague police boat, SIREN wailing, arrives at the dock in\n     front of the Embassy.  The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop\n     suddenly.\n\n     As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the\n     explosion, ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley\n     and out of sight.\n\n<b>     EXT. STREET -- PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT\n</b>\n     ETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver.  He\u00eds\n     holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a \n     modernist cockroach.  He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts\n     of the phone\u00eds wiring, piercing it with its little prongs.\n\n     He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phone\u00eds tongue\n     down for a second, releases it and listens.  He has a dial\n     tone.  Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by\n     heart.\n\n     After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side.\n\n<b>                          FLAT VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>                Satcom seven.\n\n<b>                          ETHAN\n</b>                Central Europe.

ETHAN does the same.  He stares at the phone\n     for a moment, thinking.  He checks his watch.\n\n<b>     EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\n     ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the\n     street.  Every face seems to be starring at him now, every\n     sound is menacing.  He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his\n     hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd.\n\n<b>     EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering,\n     gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by \n     residential buildings.\n\n<b>     ETHAN\u00edS POV\n</b>\n     Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built\n     on the portico of an old palace.\n\n     Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively\n     shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza.\n\n<b>     INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>     ETHAN'S POV \n</b>\n     ETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an \n     enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. \n     He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are \n     scattered around. \n\n     EUGENE KITTRIDGE is seated at a table in the middle. He and \n     ETHAN make eye contact.  ETHAN walks to the table, a couple \n     of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he \n     goes.  KITTRIDGE has been working on a pretty good-sized \n     lobster.  He rises to greet ETHAN and they sit. \n<b>                          \n</b><b>                          KITTRIDGE \n</b>                I can't tell you how sorry I am.

There's a Canadian picture bearing \n     ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, \n     driver's license, etc. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE\n</b>                Passport, visas - you know the drill. \n                We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, \n                debrief you at Langley.

Maybe this'll save some \n                time. \n\n     The figures around the room have grown restless.  KITTRIDGE \n     tries to indicate that it's okay. He pulls some papers out \n     of his jacket. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) \n</b>                For a little over two years now we've \n                been spotting serious blowback in IMF \n                operations.  We have a penetration.  The \n                other day we decoded a message on the \n                Internet from a Czech we know as \"Max.\"\n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                The arms dealer. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE \n</b>                That's right.  Max, it seems, has two \n                unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity\n                and for corrupting susceptible agents. \n                This time he's gotten to someone on the \n                inside - he's put himself in a position \n                to buy our NOC list. An operation he \n                referred to as \"Job 314\".  The job he \n                thought Golitsyn was doing tonight. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE \n</b>                Correct the actual list is safe at \n                Langley.  \"Golitsyn\" was a lightning rod, \n                one of ours. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                This whole operation was a molehunt. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE \n</b>                Yes, the mole's deep inside.

They're xeroxed \n     copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and \n     MARGARET ETHAN HUNT.  It shows a balance of $127, 000. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) \n</b>                Since your father's death, your family's \n                farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, \n                suddenly, they're flush with over a \n                hundred and twenty grand in the bank. \n                Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped \n                out the bank account -- dying slowly in \n                America after all, can be a very \n                expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why \n                don't we go quietly out of here onto the \n                plane... \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                How about if we just go quietly into the \n                bathroom and I wash your mouth out with \n                soap - you pathetic button down \n                bureaucratic asshole. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE (CONT'D) \n</b>                Ethan, I can understand you're very \n                upset. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                Kitteridge, you've never seen me very \n                upset. \n\n        ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket.  While \n        KITTRIDGE talks, ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand. \n\n<b>                          KITTRIDGE \n</b>                All right, enough is  enough Hunt. You've \n                bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on \n                intimate loyalties to get away with it. \n                You're determined to shake hands with the \n                devil and I'm going to make sure you do \n                it in hell. \n\n     We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- it's the piece of \n     bubble gum, half red, half green. He squeezes the gum, \n     mushing the two sides together. \n\n     ETHAN lashes out, swatting KITTRIDGE'S glass of wine off the\n     table in one quick motion.  As he does, he hurls the piece of \n     gum. \n\n     Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine \n     glass.  KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass -- \n\n     -- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. His eyes \n     widen.  KA BOOM! \n\n     The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish \n     tank.  A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and \n     WOMAN, knocking them to the ground. \n\n     At the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door. \n\n<b>     EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the \n     deserted square. \n\n<b>     EXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Silence.  ETHAN enters the darkened entry. \n\n<b>     INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n</b>\n     ETHAN glances up at the stairwell.  Naked light bulbs \n     illuminate the way up.  He slips off his jacket and shirt, \n     then puts his jacket back on. \n\n<b>     INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT\n</b>\n     ETHAN unscrews a bulb.  He crushes the bulb in his shirt and \n     scatters the glass fragments on the steps.  He climbs to the \n     next bulb. \n\n<b>     INT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft \n     sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments \n     dropping and ETHAN'S at the door. \n\n<b>     INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT \n</b>\n     In the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with \n     flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a \n     Sig Sauer automatic.

CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY\n</b>\n     While ETHAN talks, we see what he's referring to: \n\n     A CIA ANALYST carrying a glass of iced tea and several file \n     folders walks down a long corridor in the headquarters \n     building.  He comes to an impressive guard station and rests \n     his chin on a strange-looking optometric device. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN (V.O.) \n</b>                They missed nothing in that room.  Even \n                the vents have laser nets over them.  \n\n     Apparently the device approves and the ANALYST is buzzed into \n     a \"RESTRICTED\" area of the building. \n\n<b>     INT. CIA COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY\n</b>\n     The ANALYST reaches a curtained area. He shoves the curtain \n     aside and comes to a large, vaulted door.  He slides a card- \n     key into a slot, leaves it there and slides a second card-key \n     into the slot beneath it. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN (V.O.)\n</b>                Inside, there are three countermeasure \n                systems that can only be deactivated by \n                authorized entry.  Which we won't have. \n\n     A panel next to the ANALYST says \"INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES \n     OFF.\"  The ANALYST next spins a three digit combination code, \n     CHUNKS the door open and steps into -- \n\n<b>     INT.

A single terminal is bolted into the middle of \n     the floor and the glass and tile walls of the room overlook \n     computer storage towers. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN (V.O.) \n</b>                The first system is sound-sensitive, \n                anything above a whisper sets it off. \n                The second system is on the floor and \n                pressure-sensitive --\n\n     The ANALYST closes the vault door behind him and walks across \n     the room.  As he walks, the floor tiles light up under his \n     feet, turning off again when he lifts the weight from them. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN (V.O.) \n</b>                --and the third detects any increase in \n                temperature.  Even the body heat of an \n                unauthorized person in the room will \n                trigger it. \n\n     A thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is 72 \n     degrees.  The ANALYST sets his glass down, boots up the \n     computer, and starts entering data from the file folders. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN (V.O.) \n</b>                All three systems are state of the art. \n<b>                \n</b>     The ANALYST turns and takes a sip of his iced tea.  A drop of \n     condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor. When it \n     makes contact, the floor panel lights up. \n\n<b>     INT.

I lost the team. I just \n                need you to be safe. \n\n     CLAIRE's coolness causes ETHAN to hesitate just enough to \n     take it in. \n\n<b>                          CLAIRE \n</b>                I wish I'd never laid eyes on you.. \n\n     And they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing \n     and half-falling onto the converted bed.  She suddenly \n     resists.  He senses it and pulls away.  \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                Sorry. \n\n     He rises and goes to the door.

He's the TECHNICIAN who works at the \n     secured computer terminal. \n\n<b>     INT. CIA - SERVICE AREA - DAY \n</b>\n     ETHAN and KRIEGER in the service area - preparing.  ETHAN \n     putting the mask in a bag. \n\n     The GUARD returns. \n\n<b>                          GUARD \n</b>                Where's the other guy? \n\n     The GUARD moves towards ETHAN, who kicks back at him, pushing \n     him back to KRIEGER, who zaps the GUARD on the back of the \n     neck.  He twitches and slumps to the ground, unconscious. \n     KRIEGER quickly grabs him around the neck. \n\n     ETHAN turns.  Holding the GUARD'S head with one hand, KRIEGER \n     pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with \n     the other.  He jabs it toward the base of the GUARD'S skull - \n\n     -- but ETHAN is on him in a flash.  He grabs KRIEGER's knife \n     arm shoving it up against the wall.  Staring into KRIEGER'S \n     face in warning. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                Zero body count. \n\n<b>                          KRIEGER \n</b>                     (a threat) \n                We'll see.  \n\n<b>                          ETHAN\n</b>                Time up. \n\n     ETHAN releases him and walks away. \n\n<b>     INT. VERTICAL DUCT - DAY \n</b>\n     The Guard is tied up, lying on the floor of the Service Area \n     Room.  ETHAN and KRIEGER are below the open vent into the \n     duct system. \n\n     The first climb is straight up.  KRIEGER cups his hands under \n     ETHAN'S foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to \n     climb. \n\n<b>     INT. DUCT - DAY \n</b>\n     ETHAN and KRIEGER crawl quickly through the ducts, moving \n     horizontally now.  They reach a juncture and turn right. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast.  Luther, I'm \n                going in.

A \n     laser net protects the ventilator, red shafts of light cris- \n     crossing every which way.  ETHAN looks down, through the net. \n\n     He can see the computer room below and the top of the \n     TECHNICIAN'S head. \n\n<b>     INT. DUCT - DAY                                              \n</b>\n     In the duct, ETHAN signals to KRIEGER, making a triangle of \n     his hands.  KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi- \n     sided, pyramid shaped glass object.  \n\n     ETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of \n     the laser net's beams. The pyramid glows and we realise what \n     it is -- a prism. \n\n     The laser beam now captive in the prism, ETHAN carefully \n     moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and \n     directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the \n     shaft. \n\n<b>     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                             \n</b>\n     Up in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move \n     in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing.  When it appears ready \n     to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between \n     the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw. \n\n     The screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the \n     floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip \n     with a gentle CLICK, as to a magnet. \n\n     The screw is pulled up, through the shaft.  Now the whole \n     shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand. \n\n     It turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct. \n\n     A rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop \n     near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees.  A \n     gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the \n     tube, cooling the room. \n\n<b>     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n     The TECHNICIAN defaults the security systems outside the \n     terminal room. \n\n<b>     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n     It is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw \n     earlier.  No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the \n     gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use. \n\n     Now <u>ETHAN's head</u> descends slowly into the room, his hair \n     falling in front of him. \n\n     At first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, \n     but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then \n     shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his \n     ankles and understand.  \n\n     He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and \n     temperature read out on the computer.  Suddenly ETHAN is \n     lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the \n     computer as the ANALYST enters the room. \n\n<b>     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                  \n</b>\n     The TECHNICIAN crosses to the computer and sits down, a stack \n     of work to his right. \n\n<b>     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                    \n</b>\n     The TECHNICIAN is working away at the computer.  He pauses \n     and wipes some sweat from his forehead. \n\n<b>     INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                                      \n</b>\n     With a strange look on his face, the TECHNICIAN looks up. \n     It's almost as if he senses ETHAN above him but instead -- \n\n<b>                          TECHNICIAN \n</b>                Oh, God. \n\n     -- he vomits.  \n\n     He reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again.  Puzzled, \n     sick and feeling another wave coming on, he drags himself to \n     his feet, hauls himself across the room and leaves. \n\n<b>     INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY                             \n</b>\n     Even sick, the TECHNICIAN still thinks to re-activate the \n     alarm systems with a card-key.  They HUM back to life \n     efficiently, a light flashing: \n\n                <b>INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES ON</b>\n\n<b>     INT.

He stretches \n     his arms but can't reach. \n\n     He blinks, unable to believe this.  He curls himself into a \n     situp and looks up, into the shaft. \n\n<b>     INT.

CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY                               \n</b>\n     ETHAN gestures to him, pointing to the floor.  Slowly, \n     KRIEGER drops him another few feet.  Now ETHAN's lower than \n     the terminal and still three feet away from it. \n<b>        \n</b>     He closes his eyes, summoning his strength and does another \n     situp, bringing himself up right in front of the terminal. \n\n<b>     INT.

We hear only the moist, airy sound of his \n     breath, not the words. \n\n<b>                          LUTHER \n</b>                Type this password: AW96B6.  Return.

He reaches \n     out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it\n     and starts typing, softly. \n\n     The computer HUMS, activated.  ETHAN unbuttons his pocket, \n     withdraws a 3.5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy \n     drive. \n\n     The computer accepts it with a soft WHIR.  ETHAN winces, even \n     that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances.  \n\n     But no alarms go off. \n\n<b>     INT.

MATTHIAS takes the phone out.\n\n<b>                          MATTHIAS\n</b>                Yes...\n                     (holds phone out for Max)\n                It\u00eds him.\n\n<b>                          MAX\n</b>                     (into phone) \n                This wasn\u00edt what we discussed.\n\n<b>                          ETHAN (O.S.)\n</b>                     (on phone) \n                My apologies Max.

Tear it away and you\u00edll find the\n                disk.\n\n     MAX reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer\n     disk as promised.  She hands it to Matthias who strips off\n     the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the\n     computer in the briefcase.  He boots it up quickly and turns\n     the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to\n     see.\n\n     One half of the screen, with the heading \"CRYPTONYM AND\n     OPERATIONAL SPECS\" is already jammed with information.  The\n     blank second half of the screen acquires the title \"TRUE\n     NAME,\" and information starts filling itself in rapidly --\n     names, addresses, identities.\n\n     As the two sides match up, a legend flashes:\n\n                <b>IDENTITY MATCH</b>\n\n<b>                          MAX\n</b>                     (back into phone) \n                Ha, dear boy!

ETHAN looks to ladder hatch and climbs ladder. \n\n<b>     INT. REAR CAR - ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY\n</b>\n     PHELPS climbs up a ladder past an inert engineer slumped over \n     the control panel -- an obvious earlier victim of PHELPS. \n     PHELPS puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door \n     and climbs through it -- \n\n<b>     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY\n</b>\n     -- halfway out onto the roof of the train.  He reaches into \n     his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle \n     on the end of it.  He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof \n     and pulls himself the rest of the way out. \n\n     He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the \n     smooth surface of the train. \n\n     Now for the tough part.  Using the suction cups, PHELPS \n     slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and \n     replanting the cups as he goes.  \n\n     He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the \n     back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, \n     a window for the ENGINEER. \n\n     Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his \n     belt.\n\n     He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train.  From out \n     of the fog, a <u>helicopter</u> approaches. \n\n     PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is \n     going.  In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching \n     the tunnel under the English Channel.  His eyes widen. \n\n<b>     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY\n</b>\n     KRIEGER is at the controls.  He sees the approaching tunnel \n     as well. \n\n<b>     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY\n</b>\n     PHELPS crawls like hell to get into position.  Looking up, he \n     sees KRIEGER pointing frantically behind him. PHELPS turns. \n\n     ETHAN is climbing out the trap door. \n\n     A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost \n     touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it. \n\n     ETHAN, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. \n     Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to \n     grab small holes on the roof.  \n\n     He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other \n     way.  Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof. \n\n<b>     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY\n</b>\n     KRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching.  He gestures \n     to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing \n     over PHELPS and then back to him. \n\n<b>     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY\n</b>\n     PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto \n     his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the \n     roof. \n\n     ETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto \n     the roof. \n\n     PHELPS and ETHAN struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously \n     closer to the chunnel entrance. \n\n     They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance. \n\n<b>     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY\n</b>\n     KRIEGER sees the tunnel, only seconds away now.  He paws at \n     the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever. \n\n<b>     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY\n</b>\n     PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the \n     train.  PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the \n     strap manages to pull himself back on. \n\n     -- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel -- \n\n<b>     -- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT! \n</b>\n<b>     INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY\n</b>\n     As the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes \n     nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes \n     one last time.  This time it says: \n\n                <b>CONNECTION TERMINATED. \n                    TRANSFER LOST.</b>\n\n     MAX'S face falls. \n\n<b>                          MAX\n</b>                Damn!\n\n<b>     INT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY\n</b>\n     Another CONDUCTOR races into the power car, past his inert \n     companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the \n     train.  He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it. \n\n<b>                          CONDUCTOR \n</b>                No, no, it's <u>IN</u> the tunnel! \n\n<b>                          VOICE (O.S.) \n</b>                Stop the train! \n\n<b>                          CONDUCTOR \n</b>                It'll crash into us!  Accelerate, \n                accelerate. \n\n<b>     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY\n</b>\n     For a moment, we see no one.  No ETHAN.  No PHELPS.  Moving \n     around to the other end of the car, we see where they've \n     gone. \n\n     <u>They're dangling from either side of it</u>. \n\n     PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself \n     back onto the roof of the train.  ETHAN reaches for the other \n     cup. \n\n     The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track \n     and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER \n     pushing it up to full speed again. \n\n     But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the \n     train. \n\n<b>     EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY\n</b>\n     PHELPS, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the \n     windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of \n     KRIEGER'S copter. \n\n     He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the \n     other direction. \n\n     Another train. \n\n     At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the \n     oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the \n     roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as \n     it blows by. \n\n     The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS \n     misses the skid.  \n\n     KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate \n     ETHAN with the rotor.  PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the \n     copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the \n     tunnel.  SPARKS and chunks of cement fly.  \n\n     KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly.  ETHAN uses the moment to \n     leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid. \n\n     PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another. \n     Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls \n     out -- \n\n     -- <u>a red and green piece of bubble gum</u>. \n\n     PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles \n     frantically for his gun. \n\n<b>                          ETHAN \n</b>                Red light, green light.  Asta Lasagna \n                mother fucker. \n\n     ETHAN mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the \n     copter's underbelly and turns away from it. \n\n     PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum, SCREAMING -- \n\n     -- but the gum EXPLODES.  The force of the blast rockets \n     ETHAN forward, he lands on the train's windshield. \n\n     The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers \n     wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under \n     the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball. \n\n     ETHAN, stuck on the windshield, can only watch as the \n     wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him. \n     It stops just short of him, with its bent and broken rotor \n     blade barely missing his throat.  \n\n     ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly \n     drained. \n\n<b>     INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY\n</b>\n     KITTRIDGE comes back into the business car and is joined by \n     BARNES.  LUTHER, only slightly bruised, stands up next to \n     them and gestures to MAX and her laptop. \n\n<b>                          LUTHER\n</b>                I think this is what you're looking for. \n\n     MAX looks up, stunned.  KITTRIDGE leans over and peers at her \n     screen. He just smiles and sits down next to her, content to \n     wait for her to speak. \n\n     When she finally does, she's almost charming. \n\n<b>                          MAX \n</b>                My lawyers will have a field day with \n                this.

LONDON PUB - DAY\n</b>\n     LUTHER sits on a high stool, his PowerBook next to him, while \n     he sips a beer.  A television screen is featuring follow-up \n     coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in \n     the chunnel.  Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of \n     a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in \n     the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was \n     there were no other fatalaties.  There are intermittent \n     sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of \n     arrivals and departures.  ETHAN into shot.
