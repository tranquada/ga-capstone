Never meant to be a drug \n               dealer, it just came along. He's been other things: messenger \n               boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub \n               shill -- never meant to be them either. Now he's a D.D. Drug \n               dealer.\n\n               JOHN LETOUR, well-groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, \n               tippet-like scarf, belt pouch, \"Beatle\" boots, a shadow \n               drifting in and out of other shadows, New York, day, night: \n               watching, listening, rarely speaking -- nonexistent, seen \n               only by those he sees. His face an affable blank. Make of it \n               what you will. The eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly. \n               A map of calculation.\n\n               Once he had a drug problem. Life turned a page. Today he \n               follows instructions: he sleeps light -- one eye open, \n               anticipating. JOHN LETOUR, D.D., loner, voyeur, has been \n               drifting toward an unknown destination. At mid-life the \n               destination draws near. The circle tightens. The dealer is \n               anxious. The destination is love.\n\n<b>               NIGHT IN THE LIFE\n</b>\n               CREDIT SEQUENCE: New York by night. JOHN LETOUR nestles in \n               back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the \n               window. Neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, \n               young dates: each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose.\n\n               His beeper goes off. He clicks it, checks the digital message. \n               The DRIVER stops at an uptown corner. LETOUR opens the \n               curbside door, motions to the DRIVER he'll be back in \"ten\" \n               minutes. He enters the video laundromat, a twenty-four-hour \n               video rental/laundromat/tanning salon.\n\n               Inside, he meets a RETRO-YUPPIE (J. Crew Division) in the \n               \"Classics\" section. They exit.\n\n               On the sidewalk, money is exchanged for a packet. LETOUR \n               pockets the uncounted cash. The YUPPIE mouths goodbye, eager \n               to put distance between him and LETOUR. JOHN checks his \n               beeper, stops at a pay phone, dials.\n\n               JOHN LETOUR re-enters the sedan; the DRIVER heads downtown. \n               High-rises give way to Tudor City. Uncollected trash lines \n               the curbs. LETOUR eyes a PEDESTRIAN; PEDESTRIAN looks back. \n               Later. Three a.m. The streets are dark. LeTour's car passes \n               a glowing Korean market.\n\n               LETOUR narrates from diary:\n\n<b>                                     LETOUR\n</b>                              (voice over)\n                         Labor Day weekend. Some time for a \n                         sanitation strike. Everybody crazy \n                         to stock up. They decide to score at \n                         the last minute and want it now. \n                         Never fails. The faces look alike. \n                         You gotta use memory tricks: each \n                         has some peculiarity -- it keeps you \n                         sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug \n                         dealer starts writing a diary it's \n                         time to quit. I started writing after \n                         that. Not every night -- now and \n                         then. Just to burn off the night. \n                         Fill up one book, throw it out, start \n                         another.\n\n               The sedan drives on. End credits.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               HOMEBASE\n</b>\n               Four a.m.: streets empty. LeTour's sedan drops him off near \n               a ten-story West 80s apartment building. JOHN gives the DRIVER \n               a forty-dollar tip (standard procedure), turns the corner. \n               He presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door. He enters \n               the lobby, walks past English reproduction furniture toward \n               the elevators. Presses the button.\n\n               Penthouse C door opens. ANN lets JOHN in with a smile.\n\n               ANN, forty-four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him \n               with a wet kiss. Her hair is coiffured, her face made up. \n               She is John's employer, mentor, confidante, Mother Hen: she \n               keeps the books. Her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: \n               she's been in the drug business fifteen years.\n\n               Ann's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green \n               walls, zebra-skin sofa, Haitian wall friezes, framed magazine \n               photos of Paramahansa Yogananda, Liz Taylor, the Duke of \n               Windsor -- paintings stacked behind an oversized urn. A bird \n               flits in its cage. One corner of the living area is devoted \n               to a fledgling cosmetics business: Macintosh computer, \n               billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, \n               reference books, color charts.\n\n               ROBERT, fifty, slight, waves hello as JOHN locks the door. \n               Gay, hip, worn, he's John's \"co-runner.\"\n\n               They work -- and eat -- out of Ann's apartment. Take-out \n               tins of Indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, \n               glasses, and vitamin bottles. No sign of drugs, drug \n               paraphernalia, or money.\n\n<b>                                     ANN\n</b>                         Darling.\n\n<b>                                     LETOUR\n</b>                         Ann.\n\n<b>                                     ANN\n</b>                         Have we made New York safe for another \n                         weekend?\n\n<b>                                     LETOUR\n</b>                              (waves)\n                         Robert.\n\n<b>                                     ROBERT\n</b>                         Get a job.\n\n<b>                                     LETOUR\n</b>                              (about ROBERT)\n                         Sad what ten years without sex can \n                         do.\n\n               Repartee: the plumbing of family feeling.\n\n               JOHN unzips his belt pouch, walks toward the bedroom to \n               deposit the night's earnings.\n\n<b>                                     ANN\n</b>                         Any hundreds?\n\n<b>                                     LETOUR\n</b>                         Twenties -- and tens.\n\n<b>                                     ROBERT\n</b>                         Tens!\n\n<b>                                     ANN\n</b>                         Goddamn cash machines.\n\n<b>                                     ROBERT\n</b>                         Did what's-his-name give you a hard \n                         time?\n\n<b>                                     LETOUR\n</b>                              (out of shot)\n                         You mean --?\n\n<b>                                     ROBERT\n</b>                         Yeah.\n\n<b>                                     LETOUR\n</b>                         Cash Before Delivery.\n                              (re-emerges)\n<b>                         CBD.\n</b>\n<b>                                     ROBERT\n</b>                         Fucking investment bankers.\n\n<b>                                     ANN\n</b>                         These Wall Street kids deal with \n                         fake money all day, they think cash \n                         is a theoretical concept -- like it \n                         doesn't apply.

A \n               delivery truck passes uncollected garbage. He enters a \n               nondescript doorway. Inside his studio apartment, JOHN sits \n               at a second-hand table writing in a composition book. He \n               drinks from an eight-ounce glass of white wine, continues.\n\n               The room has little personality; Ann's apartment has enough \n               for two. Nails indicate where pictures once hung; a boombox \n               sits on the linoleum floor amid cassettes, books \n               (Autobiography of a Yogi, The Secret Doctrine), fashion \n               magazines, a stack of unopened CDs. A futon is unrolled \n               beneath the room's sole decoration, a poster of a human foot \n               advertising a forgotten photo exhibit. Wine bottles -- Chenin \n               Blanc. Precious little to show for forty years.\n\n               LeTour's narration resumes as he writes:\n\n<b>                                     LETOUR\n</b>                              (voice over)\n                         \"Labor Day.\" \"Union Movement\" -- \n                         there's a contradiction in terms.

It's lucky in a \n                         way I got mixed up in it -- now I \n                         have to see this thing through.
