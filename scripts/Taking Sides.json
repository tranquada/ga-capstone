For my part, the only divide \n                         in art is between good and bad. \n                         Eventually, Goebbels summoned me \n                         and told me I could leave the \n                         country if I wanted to but under \n                         no condition would I ever be allowed \n                         to return. I always believe that \n                         you have to fight from the inside \n                         not from without. I asked myself, \n                         what's the duty of an artist, to \n                         stay or to leave? And then Goebbels \n                         demanded that I acknowledge Hitler \n                         as solely responsible for cultural \n                         policy. Well, that was a fact and \n                         it seemed pointless to deny it.

I have \n                         always had the view that art and \n                         politics should... should have \n                         nothing to do with each other.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         Then why did you conduct at one of \n                         their Nuremberg rallies?\n\n<b>                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n</b>                              (flaring)\n                         I did not conduct at at the rally, \n                         I conducted on the evening before \n                         the rally.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         That sounds like the small print \n                         in one of our insurance policies, \n                         Wilhelm.

I was in Vienna, \n                         rehearsing the Ninth Symphony of \n                         Beethoven, when Goebbels called \n                         and said I had to conduct at \n                         Hitler's birthday. I'd always \n                         managed to wriggle out of such \n                         invitations, pleading previous \n                         engagements, illness, having my \n                         doctors state I was not well and \n                         so on and so on. I was also \n                         fortunate that Baldur von Shirach, \n                         who controlled Vienna, hated Dr. \n                         Goebbels and would do anything to \n                         thwart his wishes. But this time \n                         Goebbels got to my doctors before \n                         me; they were frightened off, and \n                         von Schirach was threatened, bullied \n                         and gave in. So, I had no \n                         alternative but to conduct for \n                         Hitler. Believe me, I knew I had \n                         compromised, and I deeply regret \n                         it.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                              (playing with him)\n                         Doesn't sound much of a trick to \n                         me.

I did not know what to \n                         expect. In these past weeks, I \n                         have been thinking more carefully \n                         and making some notes.\n                              (glances at the \n                              notes.)\n                         You have to understand who I am \n                         and what I am. I am a musician and \n                         I believe in music. I am an artist \n                         and I believe in art. Art in \n                         general, and music, in particular, \n                         has for me mystical powers which \n                         nurture man's spiritual needs. I \n                         must confess, however, to being \n                         extremely naive.  I insisted for \n                         many years on the absolute \n                         separation of art and politics. My \n                         entire life was devoted to music \n                         because, and this is very important, \n                         because I thought that I could, \n                         through music, do something \n                         practical.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         And what was that?\n\n<b>                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n</b>                         Maintain liberty, humanity and \n                         justice.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         Gee, that's a thing of beauty, \n                         honest to God, a real thing of \n                         beauty.

Are you now saying you \n                         think you were wrong?

And \n                         Goebbels and Goering keep saying \n                         to you, 'If you don't do it, little \n                         K will.'

David, at an open window, keeps \n               his back to Steve, still on the telephone.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE\n</b>                         Turn it off!\n\n<b>               EXT.  STEVE S BUILDING - DAY\n</b>\n               Furtw\u00e4ngler, on the stairs, stops, hearing the music echoing \n               through the building.\n\n               Furtw\u00e4ngler left hand begins to tremble, but it is only \n               his way of sensing the tempo.  \n\n               Furtw\u00e4ngler slowly continues down the stairs.\n\n<b>                                     STEVE'S VOICE\n</b>                         We handed Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler over \n                         to the civil authorities and he \n                         was charged with serving the Nazi \n                         regime, with uttering anti-Semitic \n                         slurs, performing at an official \n                         Nazi Party function and with being \n                         a Prussian Privy Councillor.  Dr. \n                         Furtw\u00e4ngler was acquitted. I didn't \n                         nail him. But I sure winged him. \n                         And I know I did the right thing. \n                         Furtw\u00e4ngler resumed his career but \n                         he was never allowed to conduct in \n                         the United States. He died in 1954. \n                         Little K succeeded him as head of \n                         the Berlin Philharmonic.\n\n<b>               INT.

When the music finishes, Furtw\u00e4ngler \n               turns and bows. Goebbels rises and shakes hands with him.  \n               Furtw\u00e4ngler takes his handkerchief and wipes his hands. \n               The film replays this gesture several times - Furtw\u00e4ngler \n               wiping his hands.\n\n<b>                                                               FADE OUT:\n</b>\n<b>               THE END \n</b>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Taking-Sides.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Taking Sides</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Ronald Harwood\" title=\"Scripts by Ronald Harwood\">Ronald Harwood</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Music\" title=\"Music Scripts\">Music</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Taking Sides Script.html#comments\" title=\"Taking Sides comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:17:53.243284"}
