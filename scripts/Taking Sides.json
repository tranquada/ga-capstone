BERLIN CONCERT HALL (1944) - NIGHT\n\n               A man conducting Beethoven.  Air raid in progress.  Bombs \n               falling nearby.  The orchestra continues to play.  Suddenly \n               the lights go out.  The music stops. \n\n               INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR, CONCERT HALL - NIGHT\n\n               A beam from a torch, bouncing, making shadows.  An \n               ATTENDANT, carrying the torch, hurries down the corridor.  \n               The air raid continues.\n\n               He comes to a door, knocks, opens it and looks in.\n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                              (agitated)\n                         Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler, the Reichsminister.\n\n               The sound of heavy footsteps approaching.

RUINED CINEMA - DAY\n\n               Dark.  ON A SCREEN: scenes from Leni Riefenstahl's triumph \n               of the will. Over this:\n\n                                     A MAN'S VOICE\n                         Look at them. Men, women, kids. \n                         Boy, did they love him. You see, \n                         Steve, Adolf Hitler touched \n                         something deep, real deep and savage \n                         and barbaric, and it won't just go \n                         away overnight. It's got to be \n                         rooted out. You know what I think? \n                         I think they were all Nazis. And \n                         let's face it, their leaders, those \n                         bastards now on trial in Nuremberg, \n                         couldn't have done it alone. It's \n                         these people, they gave all the \n                         help that was needed. Willingly.\n\n               The film changes with a scratchy music soundtrack - Wagner. \n               SHOTS of high-ranking Nazis in an audience including Josef \n               Goebbels, listening. And they're listening to and watching \n               Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler conducting. At the appropriate moment:\n\t\t \n                                     THE MAN'S VOICE\n                         That's him.  Furtw\u00e4ngler. Wilhelm \n                         Furtw\u00e4ngler.\n\n               The Nazis applaud. Goebbels shakes hands with Furtw\u00e4ngler. \n               The film ends. \n\n               Sitting in the ruined cinema are two men: GENERAL WALLACE, \n               with files on the table, and, beside him, MAJOR STEVE \n               ARNOLD.

In this neck of the \n                         woods, he's probably Bob Hope and \n                         Betty Grable rolled into one.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Jeez, and I never heard of him.\n\n               Wallace glances at the file.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         You were in insurance before the \n                         war.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Right. Claims assessor.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Conscientious, determined, dogged.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                              (amused)\n                         They said I was dogged?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Well, they say here that when you \n                         went on a case, you stayed on it.\n                              (looks up at Steve.)\n                         Now we can't take every Nazi in \n                         this country to trial, although I \n                         would like to; it's an \n                         impossibility. So we're going for \n                         the big boys in industry, education, \n                         law, culture.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Like this bandleader.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                              (a smile)\n                         Well, he's more than just a \n                         bandleader, Steve. He's a great \n                         conductor, a gifted artist. But we \n                         believe that he sold himself to \n                         the devil. Your number one priority \n                         from this moment on is to connect \n                         him to the Nazi Party. Don't be \n                         impressed by him. I want the folks \n                         back home to understand why we \n                         fought this war. Find Wilhelm \n                         Furtw\u00e4ngler guilty. He represents \n                         everything that was rotten in \n                         Germany.\n\n               Steve wants to rise, but Wallace puts a hand on his shoulder \n               to make him sit again.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Stay put, Steve. There is some \n                         other stuff that I'd like for you \n                         to see here. Background.\n\n               He nods to the projectionist, then starts to go, but stops.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Oh, one thing that may be a problem. \n                         Our Occupation Authorities in \n                         Wiesbaden have a duty to help these \n                         poor unfortunates with their \n                         defence. They keep repeating: 'We \n                         must be just, we must be seen to \n                         be just.' Well, I've only one thing \n                         to say to the liberals in Wiesbaden: \n                         fuck 'em.\n                              (as he goes)\n                         You answer to no one but me. Is \n                         that understood?\n                              (to the projectionist \n                              in the door)\n                         Show him the film.\n\n                                     PROJECTIONIST\n                         Yes, sir. Roll it.\n\n               Wallace goes. The projectionist starts the next reel.\n\n               ON THE SCREEN: a Berlin sequence. Bombs falling. Ruins, a \n               city devastated, empty. Flags of the four allied nations. \n               Posters of Truman, Stalin, Churchill.\n\n                                     ARCHIVE FILM VOICE\n                         That is the hand that dropped the \n                         bombs on defenceless Rotterdam, \n                         Brussels, Belgrade. That is the \n                         hand that destroyed the cities, \n                         villages and homes of Russia. That \n                         is the hand that held the whip \n                         over the Polish, Yugoslav, French \n                         and Norwegian slaves. That is the \n                         hand that took their food.\n\n               Steve watches expressionless.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Next reel, please.  \n\n               ON THE SCREEN: SHOTS of camp survivors. Then SHOTS of \n               emaciated corpses being bulldozed into mass graves.\n\n                                     ARCHIVE FILM\n                         Sanitary conditions were so \n                         appalling that heavy equipment had \n                         to be brought in to speed the work \n                         of cleaning up. This was Bergen \n                         Belsen.\n\n               The moment this appears, Steve rises and goes quickly. \n\n               ON THE SCREEN: piles of cadavers.\n\n               INT. MAJOR STEVE ARNOLD'S BEDROOM (I945) - NIGHT\n\n               Steve having a nightmare, twisting, turning, moaning. He \n               wakes with a cry. He is sweating. He turns on the light, \n               looks at a clock, reaches for a cigarette, lights it. He \n               smokes. He stares at the ceiling.\n\n               Later:\n\n               Early morning. Cold. Steve is at the basin in his small \n               room, shaving.

You bow to his reign of blood.  \n                         You caress the ideology that meant \n                         death and destruction. You never \n                         know who was a member of the Nazi \n                         Party. Don't be fooled. Don't \n                         fraternise.\n\n               EXT. STEVE'S OFFICE BUILDING, BERLIN - DAY\n\n               Steve's car swerves round the corner and comes to a halt. \n               A small crowd watch workmen on ladders hammering away at a \n               stone swastika above the portico. American soldiers \n               supervise. Steve gets out of the car, carrying an attache \n               case, and he, too, watches as the stone swastika falls and \n               crashes into pieces on the road. One or two people clap, \n               most just stare.  \n\n               The American soldiers immediately hoist the Stars and \n               Stripes. Steve goes into the building. The sentry salutes.\n\n               The driver of the car goes to the trunk and takes out a \n               labelled duffel bag, cans of film, a case which holds a 16-\n               mm projector. A small BOY sidles up to him:\n\n                                     BOY\n                         Cigarettes, chewing gum?\n\n               INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Steve and Sergeant Adams ascending a grand, winding but \n               damaged staircase to the rear of a spacious entrance hall. \n               A once impressive building. Signs of bomb damage everywhere. \n               German workmen doing repairs. American military personnel \n               coming and going, saluting Steve, who barely acknowledges \n               them.\n\n               They reach the landing.

I can \n                         only tell you from my own \n                         experience. Soon after I joined \n                         the orchestra, we were rehearsing \n                         the Third Symphony of Beethoven, \n                         the Eroica.

During \n                         the break, I asked how he wanted \n                         it played. He was studying his \n                         score. He didn't look up. He said, \n                         'Just watch me.'  So, of course, I \n                         did. I never stopped watching him. \n                         The moment came. And suddenly, he \n                         turned to me and our eyes were \n                         locked. There was something in his \n                         look that...  that simply demanded \n                         the crescendo. I shall never forget \n                         his look. It was a moment of... of \n                         magic.\n\n               Steve nods, thinks for a moment.

The terrace is \n               deserted.\n\n               A waiter carries a tray with various refreshments to a \n               quiet corner where Dymshitz, Green, Vernay, his aide \n               LIEUTENANT SIMON, Steve and David sit in comfortable \n               armchairs. The waiter serves them. During this:\n\n                                     DYMSHITZ\n                         Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. \n                         I'm glad to see you.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Colonel.

Maybe the \n                         greatest conductor in the world. \n                         His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - \n                         unequalled.\n\n               Steve makes a non-committal gesture.\n\n                                     DYMSHITZ\n                         I'll come straight to point. I've \n                         offered him a very attractive \n                         position. Conductor of the \n                         Staatsoper Unten den Linden. He \n                         refused. But I want him. I want \n                         him badly.

But I \n                         like Furtw\u00e4ngler. He's my favourite \n                         conductor.\n                              (chuckles.)\n                         Mine and Hitler's.

The sound of \n               laughter, David's laughter from the office. It makes him \n               even more uncomfortable.\n\n               INT. STEVE'S OFFICE SUITE - DAY\n\n               Emmi and David laughing.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         I clicked my heels, saluted and \n                         bowed at the same time.\n\n               He demonstrates. She laughs again.\n\n                                     EMMI\n                         That's because you had a proper \n                         upbringing.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         That's right. I was raised very \n                         strictly. So don't speak before \n                         you are spoken to!\n\n                                     EMMI\n                         Oh!

So, this is going to be \n                         very formal, too, now. Lieutenant \n                         David Wills requests die pleasure \n                         of die company of Fraulein Emmi \n                         Straube at dinner any night she \n                         cares.\n\n               She smiles just as Steve bursts in. He's in a bright, \n               cheerful, energetic mood.\n\n               David draws back guiltily. Emmi, embarrassed, hesitates \n               then turns to the typewriter and types furiously. Seeing \n               this, Steve stops, but just for a brief moment. Then, as \n               he goes to his desk:\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         David, need to ask you something. \n                         You heard this rumour the British \n                         found something called the Hinkel \n                         Archive?\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         Yes. \n\n                                     STEVE\n                         So what is it? \n\n                                     DAVID\n                         The British occupy the building \n                         where this guy, Hinkel, ran the \n                         Nazi Ministry of Culture and it \n                         seems they've... they've discovered \n                         his secret archive.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         What's that mean?\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         I don't know, but the British are \n                         excited about it, I know that. The \n                         rumour is Hinkel kept a file on \n                         every artist working in the Third \n                         Reich.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Jeez.

Dim light. \n               There is more furniture now: two chairs, one comfortable, \n               the other upright.  A sitting area by the window with the \n               telephone extension. The 16-mm projector set up in another \n               corner.\n\n               Steve, at his desk, wrapped up against the cold, going \n               through files, making notes. He stops, seems to listen, \n               then goes to the window, looks out.\n\n               The music ends. The record hisses. Steve just stares out \n               at the night and the snow. The record continues to hiss.\n\n               INT./EXT TRAM, BERLIN (TRAVELLING) - DAY\n\n               The tram packed to overflowing.

Whispering. \n               He stares ahead or keeps his eyes downcast. An elderly man \n               tugs at his coat, half-rises, offering his seat.  \n               Furtw\u00e4ngler manages a smile and shakes his head.

Furtw\u00e4ngler closes his eyes, breathes \n               deeply.\n\n               He stands, goes to the window, looks out.\n\n               INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Silence.

How \n                         did that happen to a non-Party \n                         member?\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         I received a telegram from Hermann \n                         Goering informing me that he had \n                         made me a Privy Councillor. I was \n                         not given the opportunity either \n                         to accept or refuse. After the \n                         dreadful events of November 1938, \n                         the violent attacks on the Jews, I \n                         stopped using the title.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         What about Vice-President of the \n                         Chamber of Music, you used that \n                         title didn't you? But then I suppose \n                         you had no choice there either, \n                         because I suppose Dr. Goebbels \n                         just sent you a telegram saying, \n                         Dear Mr. Vice-President.\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me \n                         a telegram. I was simply told. In \n                         a letter, I believe. I don't \n                         remember exactly.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Goebbels and Goering were sure \n                         heaping honours on you. One makes \n                         you a Privy Councillor, the other \n                         makes you Vice-President of the \n                         Chamber of Music, and you weren't \n                         even a member of the Party, how do \n                         you explain that?\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         Well, there was a constant battle \n                         between Goering and Goebbels as to \n                         which of them would control German \n                         culture. I was simply a pawn.  \n                         Anyway, I resigned from the \n                         Musikkammer at the same time I \n                         resigned as Musical Director of \n                         the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. \n                         In 1934.\n\n               David puts up a hand. Steve nods.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         Why was that? Why did you resign, \n                         Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler?\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         I wrote an open letter to the \n                         newspapers condemning what they \n                         were doing to music, making these \n                         distinctions between Jews and non-\n                         Jews. For my part, the only divide \n                         in art is between good and bad. \n                         Eventually, Goebbels summoned me \n                         and told me I could leave the \n                         country if I wanted to but under \n                         no condition would I ever be allowed \n                         to return. I always believe that \n                         you have to fight from the inside \n                         not from without. I asked myself, \n                         what's the duty of an artist, to \n                         stay or to leave? And then Goebbels \n                         demanded that I acknowledge Hitler \n                         as solely responsible for cultural \n                         policy. Well, that was a fact and \n                         it seemed pointless to deny it. I \n                         simply acknowledged that Hitler \n                         and the Minister of Culture \n                         appointed by him were solely \n                         responsible for the cultural policy \n                         of the Reich. What I wanted to \n                         express was that I, personally, \n                         had no responsibility whatsoever \n                         for their cultural policy. I have \n                         always had the view that art and \n                         politics should... should have \n                         nothing to do with each other.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Then why did you conduct at one of \n                         their Nuremberg rallies?\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                              (flaring)\n                         I did not conduct at at the rally, \n                         I conducted on the evening before \n                         the rally.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         That sounds like the small print \n                         in one of our insurance policies, \n                         Wilhelm.

I was in Vienna, \n                         rehearsing the Ninth Symphony of \n                         Beethoven, when Goebbels called \n                         and said I had to conduct at \n                         Hitler's birthday. I'd always \n                         managed to wriggle out of such \n                         invitations, pleading previous \n                         engagements, illness, having my \n                         doctors state I was not well and \n                         so on and so on. I was also \n                         fortunate that Baldur von Shirach, \n                         who controlled Vienna, hated Dr. \n                         Goebbels and would do anything to \n                         thwart his wishes. But this time \n                         Goebbels got to my doctors before \n                         me; they were frightened off, and \n                         von Schirach was threatened, bullied \n                         and gave in. So, I had no \n                         alternative but to conduct for \n                         Hitler. Believe me, I knew I had \n                         compromised, and I deeply regret \n                         it.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                              (playing with him)\n                         Doesn't sound much of a trick to \n                         me.

Furtw\u00e4ngler \n               hesitates. \n\n               Emmi comes to the waiting-room door, watches, as if on \n               guard.\n\n               David comes round to face Furtw\u00e4ngler.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                              (he gathers courage)\n                         When I was a child, my father, he \n                         took me to... he took me to one of \n                         your concerts.

After the \n               music gathers momentum:\n\n               Rain. Thunder and lightning. The musicians continue to \n               play, unperturbed.  They are coming to the end of the \n               Quintet.\n\n               David and Emmi huddled together. Some umbrellas up and \n               then movement which catches David's attention.

He is suddenly startled by a \n               loud roll of thunder and then a fierce crack of lightning.  \n\n               He goes to the window, watching the rain. He stands \n               motionless for a second, then makes a decision. He grabs \n               his cap, a raincoat from the back of the door. Another \n               loud thunderclap.\n\n               INT. US OFFICERS' CLUB - NIGHT\n\n               Dancers jitterbugging and jiving. Among them, David and \n               Emmi also dancing, imitating the others and having a good \n               time. The music ends. Scattered applause. The band leaves \n               the platform. The dancers return to tables or the bar.  \n\n               Later:\n\n               David and Emmi at their table, eating. She eats voraciously, \n               eyes glazed, all her concentration on the food in front of \n               her. David is fascinated, can't stop watching her.\n\n               Steve enters the club, makes his way to the bar, orders a \n               drink.\n\n               Steve turns to survey the room, almost at once spots David \n               and Emmi, their backs to him. He observes them.\n\n               David and Emmi at their table: They have finished their \n               meal. Emmi is silent now, staring at her empty plate. \n\n               Steve is suddenly at their table.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Well, what is this, the office \n                         party?  \n\n               David and Emmi are frozen with embarrassment.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         May I join you?\n                              (sits down, beams.)\n                         So, what have you two been up to \n                         tonight?

I invited Emmi here but she \n                         turned me down. You must've hidden \n                         depths, David...\n\n               he band starts to play; he stands, holds out a hand.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         C'mon, Emmi, let's dance. I'll \n                         teach you how to jive.\n\n               She is horribly embarrassed, doesn't move. David suddenly \n               stands and takes Emmi by the arm.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         I'm very sorry, Major, but I \n                         promised her mother, we have to \n                         go.\n\n               They leave quickly.\n\n               Steve watches them.

HALL, STAIRWAY, STRAUBE APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT\n\n               David and Emmi enter the hall, each locked in their own \n               thoughts.  They reach the foot of the stairs and pause.  \n               They want to kiss but both are too awkward. She starts up \n               the stairs.\n\n                                     EMMI\n                         Don't see me to my door, there's \n                         no need.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         But I promised your mother.\n\n               She stops, turns.\n\n                                     EMMI\n                         Well, sleep well.\n\n               She continues on her way.\n\n               INT.

He has a cold.\n\n               Emmi, who also has a cold, opens a file and is immediately \n               alert. She reads. She blows her nose. She is uncertain. \n               She looks up at Steve. She makes a decision. She rises, \n               takes the file to Steve.\n\n                                     EMMI\n                         Excuse me, Major. I found this on \n                         Helmuth Rode.

But it's this \n                         that's more important, I think...\n\n               She points to something.

LAKESIDE, BERLIN - DAY\n\n               Steve lies, shirt off, taking the sun. Children playing. \n               Noise behind him of someone in the bushes. Steve doesn't \n               move.\n\n               Rode, carrying a slender leather case, pushes through to \n               Steve, who remains with his eyes closed.\n\n                                     RODE\n                         Major.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                              (eyes still closed)\n                         Helmuth.\n\n                                     RODE\n                         Guess what I am holding in my hand. \n                         You like guessing games?\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What \n                         are you holding in your hand?\n\n               Rode takes from the case a conductor's baton.

Remember that \n                         only yesterday every business, \n                         every profession was part of \n                         Hitler's system.

The door opens \n               and Furtw\u00e4ngler bursts in.\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         It is now nine o'clock precisely. \n                         I do not intend to be kept waiting \n                         again.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                              (dangerously calm)\n                         Don't talk to me like I was a second \n                         violinist. Go back into the waiting \n                         room.

WAITING ROOM - DAY\n\n               The door to the landing is open and Rode is there pretending \n               to sweep. He looks in to see Furtw\u00e4ngler sitting, holding \n               his handkerchief over his nose and mouth.\n\n                                     RODE\n                         Would you perhaps like to have a \n                         glass of water, Herr Professor?\n\n               Furtw\u00e4ngler doesn't seem to hear. Rode hesitates, then \n               continues to sweep.\n\n               INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               David and Emmi look at him, puzzled.\n\n               She goes to the door, opens it, nods. Rode quickly \n               disappears.  Furtw\u00e4ngler looks at Emmi.\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         What is this man doing here?\n\n               Emmi doesn't answer. All eyes on the door.  Furtw\u00e4ngler \n               enters.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler!

He blows his nose. The room is warming up. It will \n               become like an airless court room, a pressure cooker.\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         When I last saw you, I was \n                         unprepared. I did not know what to \n                         expect. In these past weeks, I \n                         have been thinking more carefully \n                         and making some notes.\n                              (glances at the \n                              notes.)\n                         You have to understand who I am \n                         and what I am. I am a musician and \n                         I believe in music. I am an artist \n                         and I believe in art. Art in \n                         general, and music, in particular, \n                         has for me mystical powers which \n                         nurture man's spiritual needs. I \n                         must confess, however, to being \n                         extremely naive.  I insisted for \n                         many years on the absolute \n                         separation of art and politics. My \n                         entire life was devoted to music \n                         because, and this is very important, \n                         because I thought that I could, \n                         through music, do something \n                         practical.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         And what was that?\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         Maintain liberty, humanity and \n                         justice.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Gee, that's a thing of beauty, \n                         honest to God, a real thing of \n                         beauty. I'm going to try to remember \n                         that. Liberty, humanity and justice. \n                         Beautiful. But you used the word \n                         'naive'. Are you now saying you \n                         think you were wrong? That art and \n                         politics can't be separated?\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         I believe art and politics should \n                         be separate, but that they weren't \n                         kept separate I learned to my cost.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         And when did you first learn that - \n                         when you sent the telegram? Was \n                         that the surrender signal, the \n                         waving of the white flag?\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         What telegram?\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love \n                         Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. \n                         That sounds to me like you were \n                         dropping on your knees and saying, \n                         'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the \n                         number one man.

David raises \n               his hand.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Yes, David?\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         Why not show Dr. Furtw\u00e4ngler the \n                         evidence.

I thought I might just trap \n                         you there, Wilhelm, but David here \n                         was too quick for me. Smart move, \n                         David, smart move. No, I don't \n                         have the telegram, but I know it \n                         exists.

Let's look at that. You \n                         and the Berlin Philharmonic toured \n                         the Third Reich, played in countries \n                         the Nazis had conquered. Are you \n                         saying that conducting in occupied \n                         territories from 1939 on wasn't a \n                         commercial for Adolf and all he \n                         stood for?\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         We never, never officially \n                         represented the regime when we \n                         played abroad. We always performed \n                         as a private ensemble. As I think \n                         I already told you, I was a \n                         freelance conductor.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         You know something? You should've \n                         written our insurance policies for \n                         us because you got more exclusion \n                         clauses than Double Indemnity. \n                         What do you imagine people thought? \n                         The Berlin Philharmonic's taken \n                         over by Doctor Goebbels and his \n                         Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is \n                         a freelance, so art and politics \n                         are now entirely separate? Is that \n                         what you believed ordinary people \n                         thought?\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         have no idea what ordinary people \n                         thought.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         No!\n\n                                     FURTW\u00c4NGLER\n                         No, because I had only one \n                         intention.

K worried you, \n                         didn't he? He always worried you. \n                         In 1942, he's thirty-four years \n                         old, you're already fifty-six. And \n                         Goebbels and Goering keep saying \n                         to you, 'If you don't do it, little \n                         K will.' Never mind art and politics \n                         and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit \n                         about liberty, humanity and justice \n                         because I don't care how great you \n                         are.

He grabs the baton from his desk, \n               stands trembling before Furtw\u00e4ngler, and snaps it in half.  \n\n               He pushes his face close to Furtw\u00e4ngler, who recoils, \n               terrified.
