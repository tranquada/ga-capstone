In the window    is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads\n\"Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu\".    What remains visible behind the poster and\nthe security grate is an    IMPRESSION of people moving and milling\naround.\n<b>INT. WORKOUT AREA \u00ad SAME NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL.\n</b>\nThe students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old\nand young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would\nbe in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered\nsweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is\ntypified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the\nstudents as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is\na day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth\nshoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT\n</b>\nStruggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is\ntrying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He\ndrops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside\nhim.\n\n<b>                     YOUNG ADULT\n</b>\n           Sifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes...\n\nSifu Kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he\nwalks past the student.\n<b>                     KWAN\n</b>           At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks\n           trained in iron palm until our hands bled...\n                   (beat)\n\n           ... then we trained some more.\nHe walks on, leaving a puzzled student behind.\n<b>                     YOUNG ADULT\n</b>                   (getting back into horse stance)\n           I guess not...\n<b>\n</b><b>ANGLE ON KWAN\n</b>As he walks around the different people training. As one woman is\nmoving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and\nrearranges her hands.\n<b>                       KWAN\n</b>              Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!\nHe    moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward\nthe    door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door.\nIt    is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As\nhe    is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan.\n<b>                       STUDENT\n</b>              Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce\n              Lee...\n\n<b>                       KWAN\n</b>\n              Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in\n              flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is\n              effective. Show me.\n\nThe boy shrugs    and then    starts throwing side kicks. Kwan   is half\nlooking at the    boy and    half looking towards the door and   the clock.\nThe boy throws    three or    four kicks and then stops. He is   watching\nKwan watching    the door.    Kwan sees him, and turns back to   him.\n\n<b>                       KWAN (CONT'D)\n</b>\n                    (shaking his head)\n\n              A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never\n              mind.\n\nHe continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door.\nFinally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the\nmaster, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't\nknow he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is\ndoing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS.\nRODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles\nwidely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously\nhand made, and on the back is embroidered: \"Kwan's Shaolin\" and\nunderneath that is \"Drew Carson\". Kwan takes in the entire outfit,\nwhile the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They\nare all very impressed.\n\n<b>                       KWAN (CONT'D)\n</b>              Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen\n              uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez.\n              I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de!\nThis last he says looking at the empty door.\n<b>                       MOTHER\n</b>\n              I only hope it brings him luck in the tournament.\n<b>\n</b><b>                    KWAN\n</b>           Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors\n           depend on heart and soul \u00ad that's how they saved the\n           T'ang emporer.\nHe looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering\nhis students around him.\n<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)\n</b>           Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez.\n                  (to class)\nDuring my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the\nmartial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er...\nfortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But,\nthere was also time for individual training \u00ad where skills were honed\nlike the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.\n\nHe turns to go.\n\nOne of the students, before he can leave, clears his throat.\n\n<b>                    STUDENT 2\n</b>\n           What do you want us to do?\n\n<b>                    KWAN\n</b>\n           When the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the\n           cliff.

DREW GARAGE \u00ad SAME NIGHT\n</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE.\n</b>\nIt is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is\ncandlelight inside, and it is moving around \u00ad an effect not unlike a\nghost carrying a candelabra.\n\n<b>INT. DREW GARAGE \u00ad SAME NIGHT\n</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR.\n</b>The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu\nand Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the\nspooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see DREW\n<b>\n</b>CARSON, a    muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare\nshoulders,    moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu\nmaneuvers.    He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot\nwax on his    skin (INSERT).\nIn the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie.\n<b>ANGLE ON KWAN\n</b>Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching\nDrew.\n<b>ANGLE ON DREW\n</b>As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body\nmoving as he tries to match the movements on the TV.\nSuddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts\ninstantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls\nbut not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and\nDrew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost\nmove for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping\nKwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is\nlit by the TV screen.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON DREW\n</b>\nWho, for the first time, sees that it is Kwan.\n\n<b>                       DREW\n</b>\n<b>              MASTER KWAN!\n</b>\nHe hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face.\n\nHe leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax.\nIt pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's\nchest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to\nwipe the hot wax off.\n\n<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)\n</b>\n              Master Kwan!

What are you doing anyway?\n<b>DREW\n</b>Is taking the glued-on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling\nthe already hard wax off his chest.\n\n<b>                       DREW\n</b>              Practicing. I saw it in this movie...\nKwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of\nhim.\n<b>                       KWAN\n</b><b>\n</b>           Why didn't you come to class?

Besides, the Shaolin monks never had\n           tapes to study... they did it this way... right?\n<b>                      KWAN\n</b>           Not quite \u00ad our drills at the temple had meaning. If we\n           had tapes, we would have watched them.\nDrew starts to protest, but Kwan doesn't even let him start.\n<b>                      KWAN (CONT'D)\n</b>           \"The    warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win\n           100    times in 100 battles.\" Study the tapes I gave you.\n           All    these years of one on one training \u00ad you're the best\n           I've    ever taught.\n\n<b>                      DREW\n</b>\n           The best?\n\n<b>                      KWAN\n</b>\n           Best white boy, maybe.

Drew smiles a defeated smile and turns toward the VCR, when\nDrew's stepfather, BOB, walks in. He is a big, overweight man, and he\nis very angry.\n\n<b>                      BOB\n</b>\n                   (shouting)\n           Are you screwing around with this stuff again?\n\n<b>                      DREW\n</b>           Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I?\n<b>                      BOB\n</b>\n           It's your attitude that bothers me, son.\n<b>                      DREW\n</b>           I'm not your son, Bob. Lay off.\nIt is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension\nin the room, and starts to say something.\n<b>                      BOB\n</b><b>\n</b>                 (cutting him off)\n           Don't say a word, yellow man.\n<b>REACTION SHOT OF KWAN\n</b>Closing his already opened mouth.\n<b>                    BOB (CONT'D)\n</b>           You're here because I told your Mom I'd see you were\n           taken care of... after.

I NEVER asked for anything\n           from you.\n\nHe spins and kicks one of the hanging bags, then walks out of the\nworkout room, leaving Bob and Kwan standing alone.\n\nKwan looks at Bob, who towers over him, and smiles sheepishly.\n\n<b>                    KWAN\n</b>\n           Pressure. Big tournament this weekend.\n\nHe starts to walk out, but Bob follows him.\n\n<b>                    BOB\n</b>\n           How would you have liked having to take care of a kid you\n           never really wanted... ?\n<b>                    KWAN\n</b>           I wish I had the chance...\n\nKwan exits, and we...\n<b>EXT.

The fight begins.\nIt isn't even close. Trevor is better than he ever was. He is\nincredible, and he destroys the Shaolin fighter.\nOblivious to the boos and whistles from the crowd, he plays with the\nShaolin fighter, making him look like a real fool.\n<b>INTERCUT REACTION SHOTS OF DREW\n</b>Who is watching the destruction.

I will not fight for personal glory, or for\n           my ego.\n<b>                    SAN DE\n</b>           You have learned much.\n<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR\n</b><b>                    TREVOR\n</b>\n           The Shaolin monks are PUSSIES!

Or you?\n\nHe is pointing at Li and Gao and the others, who are itching to climb\ninto the ring. Gao goes over to San De, and shoots a questioning look\nat Drew.\n\n<b>                    GAO\n</b>\n           Master, the American is insulting the Temple, and the\n           fighting monks.\n<b>                    SAN DE\n</b>                  (looking at drew)\n\n           What should be done?\n<b>                    GAO (CONT'D)\n</b>           Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of\n           the temple.\nSan De looks at Drew long and hard.\n<b>                    SAN DE\n</b>           There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some\n           people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.\n<b>\n</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW\n</b>Who understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to\nsmile slowly.\n<b>                      SAN DE (CONT'D)\n</b>           It's your call.\nDrew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still\nstanding, trying to get someone to fight him.\nDrew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and\nLi and together they high-five.\n<b>                      DREW\n</b>           For the temple...\nDrew climbs into the ring.\n\nThe crowd is going crazy. Trevor has a predator's grin on his face as\nhe sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match.\nImmediately, his contingent of people start to work on him \u00ad massage,\ndrinks, etc.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON DREW\n</b>\nWho sits alone in the other corner.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO\n</b>\nWho see the difference. Immediately, they mobilize the other monks.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON GAO\n</b>\nWho pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to\ngive it to Drew.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER\n</b>\nAs it is flooded with monks. Some of them are massaging Drew\n(painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels\nto bring air to him, etc.\n\nThe referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. They do,\nand he motions for them to bow to each other.\n\n<b>                      TREVOR\n</b>           Remember last time, punk?\n<b>                      DREW\n</b>           Nothing exists but the moment, and...\n                 (beat)\n\n           ... I'm going to enjoy it.\nThey back up, and the fight begins.\nTrevor attacks hard, but Drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu.\n<b>\n</b>He continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy\ntechnique, but he can't touch Drew.\n<b>                      TREVOR\n</b>           Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight!\nAnd he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry.\nSoon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this    quickly. He\ngoes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that    Trevor is\ncompletely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will,    and soon has\nTrevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of    high kicks,\ntakedowns, flips and punches.\nTrevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even\nbothering to defend himself.\nDrew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his\nright hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old-\nfashioned roundhouse punch.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO\n</b>\nYelling for the knock out blow.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DE\n</b>\nWorried about this latest development.\n\nInstead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his\nhand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.\n\nTrevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a\nthing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.\n\nTo teach him a lesson.\n\nTrevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.\n\nThe crowd goes crazy.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO\n</b>\nWho also get the message.\n<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.\n</b>Who knew the message all along.\n\n<b>WIDE ANGLE OF ENTIRE RING\n</b>Drew and Trevor standing together in the center.

Drew can't stand it anymore,\nand rushes up to San De. He gives him a hug.\n<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE\n</b>Who is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then\nhis face softens and he returns Drew's embrace.\nThey break and bow again, and San De moves off.
