What remains visible behind the poster and\nthe security grate is an    IMPRESSION of people moving and milling\naround.\nINT. WORKOUT AREA \u00ad SAME NIGHT\n\nESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL.\n\nThe students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old\nand young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would\nbe in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered\nsweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is\ntypified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the\nstudents as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is\na day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth\nshoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.\n\nANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT\n\nStruggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is\ntrying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He\ndrops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside\nhim.\n\n                     YOUNG ADULT\n\n           Sifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes...\n\nSifu Kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he\nwalks past the student.\n                     KWAN\n           At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks\n           trained in iron palm until our hands bled...\n                   (beat)\n\n           ... then we trained some more.\nHe walks on, leaving a puzzled student behind.\n                     YOUNG ADULT\n                   (getting back into horse stance)\n           I guess not...\n\nANGLE ON KWAN\nAs he walks around the different people training. As one woman is\nmoving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and\nrearranges her hands.\n                       KWAN\n              Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!\nHe    moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward\nthe    door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door.\nIt    is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As\nhe    is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan.\n                       STUDENT\n              Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce\n              Lee...\n\n                       KWAN\n\n              Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in\n              flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is\n              effective. Show me.\n\nThe boy shrugs    and then    starts throwing side kicks. Kwan   is half\nlooking at the    boy and    half looking towards the door and   the clock.\nThe boy throws    three or    four kicks and then stops. He is   watching\nKwan watching    the door.    Kwan sees him, and turns back to   him.\n\n                       KWAN (CONT'D)\n\n                    (shaking his head)\n\n              A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never\n              mind.\n\nHe continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door.\nFinally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the\nmaster, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't\nknow he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is\ndoing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS.\nRODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles\nwidely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously\nhand made, and on the back is embroidered: \"Kwan's Shaolin\" and\nunderneath that is \"Drew Carson\". Kwan takes in the entire outfit,\nwhile the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They\nare all very impressed.\n\n                       KWAN (CONT'D)\n              Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen\n              uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez.\n              I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de!\nThis last he says looking at the empty door.\n                       MOTHER\n\n              I only hope it brings him luck in the tournament.\n\n                    KWAN\n           Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors\n           depend on heart and soul \u00ad that's how they saved the\n           T'ang emporer.\nHe looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering\nhis students around him.\n                    KWAN (CONT'D)\n           Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez.\n                  (to class)\nDuring my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the\nmartial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er...\nfortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But,\nthere was also time for individual training \u00ad where skills were honed\nlike the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.\n\nHe turns to go.\n\nOne of the students, before he can leave, clears his throat.\n\n                    STUDENT 2\n\n           What do you want us to do?\n\n                    KWAN\n\n           When the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the\n           cliff. Understand?\n\n                    STUDENT 2\n\n           No.\n\nThe others mutter \"No\" and shake their heads, confused.\n\n                    KWAN\n\n           No matter.\nHe exits, leaving his students staring vacantly after him.\n\nThey look at each other, honestly not knowing what to do.\nEXT. DREW GARAGE \u00ad SAME NIGHT\nESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE.\n\nIt is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is\ncandlelight inside, and it is moving around \u00ad an effect not unlike a\nghost carrying a candelabra.\n\nINT. DREW GARAGE \u00ad SAME NIGHT\nESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR.\nThe area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu\nand Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the\nspooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see DREW\n\nCARSON, a    muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare\nshoulders,    moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu\nmaneuvers.    He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot\nwax on his    skin (INSERT).\nIn the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie.\nANGLE ON KWAN\nWho is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching\nDrew.\nANGLE ON DREW\nAs he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body\nmoving as he tries to match the movements on the TV.\nSuddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts\ninstantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls\nbut not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and\nDrew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost\nmove for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping\nKwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is\nlit by the TV screen.\n\nANGLE ON DREW\n\nWho, for the first time, sees that it is Kwan.\n\n                       DREW\n\n              MASTER KWAN!\n\nHe hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face.\n\nHe leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax.\nIt pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's\nchest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to\nwipe the hot wax off.\n\n                       DREW (CONT'D)\n\n              Master Kwan! I'm sorry, very sorry!\n\n                       KWAN\n                    (blustering)\n\n              I'm OK, never mind! What are you doing anyway?\nDREW\nIs taking the glued-on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling\nthe already hard wax off his chest.\n\n                       DREW\n              Practicing. I saw it in this movie...\nKwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of\nhim.\n                       KWAN\n\n           Why didn't you come to class? Why waste time with this...\n           Should study tapes of opponent.\n                      DREW\n           I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had\n           tapes to study... they did it this way... right?\n                      KWAN\n           Not quite \u00ad our drills at the temple had meaning. If we\n           had tapes, we would have watched them.\nDrew starts to protest, but Kwan doesn't even let him start.\n                      KWAN (CONT'D)\n           \"The    warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win\n           100    times in 100 battles.\" Study the tapes I gave you.\n           All    these years of one on one training \u00ad you're the best\n           I've    ever taught.\n\n                      DREW\n\n           The best?\n\n                      KWAN\n\n           Best white boy, maybe.

Drew smiles a defeated smile and turns toward the VCR, when\nDrew's stepfather, BOB, walks in. He is a big, overweight man, and he\nis very angry.\n\n                      BOB\n\n                   (shouting)\n           Are you screwing around with this stuff again?\n\n                      DREW\n           Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I?\n                      BOB\n\n           It's your attitude that bothers me, son.\n                      DREW\n           I'm not your son, Bob. Lay off.\nIt is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension\nin the room, and starts to say something.\n                      BOB\n\n                 (cutting him off)\n           Don't say a word, yellow man.\nREACTION SHOT OF KWAN\nClosing his already opened mouth.\n                    BOB (CONT'D)\n           You're here because I told your Mom I'd see you were\n           taken care of... after.

I NEVER asked for anything\n           from you.\n\nHe spins and kicks one of the hanging bags, then walks out of the\nworkout room, leaving Bob and Kwan standing alone.\n\nKwan looks at Bob, who towers over him, and smiles sheepishly.\n\n                    KWAN\n\n           Pressure. Big tournament this weekend.\n\nHe starts to walk out, but Bob follows him.\n\n                    BOB\n\n           How would you have liked having to take care of a kid you\n           never really wanted... ?\n                    KWAN\n           I wish I had the chance...\n\nKwan exits, and we...\nEXT.

Kwan busies himself around the needle, trying to alleviate the\npain of Drew's bruises.\n                    KWAN\n\n           Next time we get that guy...\n                    DREW\n                 (shaking his head)\n           No next time, Master. Maybe...\n                 (big sigh)\n           ... you should find a new student. I just can't do it \u00ad\n           I'm not getting any better!\n                    KWAN (CONT'D)\n           Don't talk like that. At Shaolin...\nHe pauses, and decides not to tell another Shaolin Temple story. Drew\nlooks at him funny \u00ad this is very against his character.\n\n                    KWAN (CONT'D)\n\n           I saw a Shaolin monk once. I was only 5 years old at the\n           time, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was\n           coming back from the market with my father. Soldiers\n           stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought.\n           It was all we had left to eat \u00ad no more money. These were\n           hard times in China, people were selling their children\n           for food, and the soldiers had no right. Who can stop\n           soldiers with guns, though? Yes?\n\nHe pauses, and takes a sip of tea, checking the needle, adjusting it\nand turning it slightly this way and that.\n\n                    KWAN (CONT'D)\n\n           Just as the soldiers were leaving, a monk stepped out of\n           the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back.\n           Well, naturally, they didn't. They pushed the monk, and\n           the next thing I knew the soldiers were in the street,\n           and the food was back in my father's arms. 5 soldiers,\n           and they were in a heap on the ground, their blood mixing\n           with the dust of the street.\n\nKwan smiles with the memory \u00ad it is a sweet and heroic one.\n                    KWAN (CONT'D)\n           The crowd whispered \"Shaolin\", and he bowed to us,\n           touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I\n           watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was\n           larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed\n           then and there to become like him, fight for right like\n           the Shaolin.\nHe pauses again, looking at Drew. Drew meets his gaze, wondering why\nhe is telling him this story.\n\n                    KWAN (CONT'D)\n           I never did, though. My family left China and ended up\n           here in New York, a young boy's dream left behind in\n\n           China.\n                     DREW\n           You mean... all the stories...?\n                     KWAN\n                   (nodding)\n           Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I\n           realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself\n           that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other\n           people.\n                     DREW\n           Why are you telling me this?\n                     KWAN\n\n           I've given you all I can, and it's not enough. It was\n           never enough. You're like a son to me, Drew, and you have\n           all the potential in the world, but I can't take you\n           where you want to go.\n\nKwan takes the needle out of Drew's arm, and then rubs the spot where\nit was with a cotton ball.\n\n                     KWAN (CONT'D)\n\n           There, that should control the swelling.\n\nHe watches Drew, who is pondering what Kwan has said.\n\n                     DREW\n\n           So you're not a Shaolin?\n\n                     KWAN\n\n           No.\n\n                     DREW\n           Never were?\n\n                     KWAN\n           No.\nDrew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his\nface. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this.\n\n                     KWAN (CONT'D)\n           What?\n                     DREW\n\n           If you are not a Shaolin warrior, then I will become one.\n                     KWAN\n\n           What are you talking about?\n                       DREW\n           I'm going to the Shaolin Temple \u00ad they can train me so I\n           will never lose like that again.\nKwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's\neyes.\n                       KWAN\n           He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold\n           cloth.\nHe starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down.\n                       DREW\n                 (eyes intent)\n\n           Don't you    see? You said    yourself I needed the right\n           training \u00ad    where better    than the Shaolin Temple? What's\n           holding me    here? I have    the chance to do what you\n           couldn't.    I will go to    the Shaolin Temple.\n\nKwan looks at him, realizes he's serious. He nods his head, giving\nthe idea serious consideration. He smiles along with Drew.\n\n                       KWAN\n\n           I must pay for your ticket...\n\n                       DREW\n\n           No! I'll make it there myself.\n\n                       KWAN\n\n           I grew up on the stories of the Shaolin, and you can be\n           those stories. You can live my dream for me \u00ad at least\n           let me help you. Let an old man make up for the trouble\n           he's caused.\nKwan touches Drew's bruised cheek, fatherly love in his eyes. Drew\nnods his head, then bows in the traditional Chinese manner.\n                       DREW\n           Master...\nMONTAGE OF DEPARTURE\nANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN AS KWAN HANDS HIM A \"NORTHWEST AIRLINES\"\nTICKET.\nANGLE ON DREW\n\nAs he packs for China.\nANGLE ON KWAN AND DREW\nAs Kwan drops drew off at the AIRPORT.

You're just chicken!\n\n                     DREW\n\n           The arts should never be about who is best \u00ad they are too\n           important for that.\n\nHe bows to Trevor and starts out of the ring.\n\nANGLE ON CROWD\n\nThey don't know what's going on.\n\nANGLE ON LI, GAO AND OTHERS\n\nThey don't know either. They want Drew to fight him.\n\nANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.\nWho know what is happening and are proud of Drew, prouder than they\nhave ever been.\n                     TREVOR\n\n           COME BACK HERE! You can't just walk away!\nDrew steps out of the ring and walks over to where San De is\nstanding. They bow, and the pride is shining in San De's eyes.\n                     SAN DE\n\n           Do you turn away from him out of fear?\nANGLE ON TREVOR\nWho is seething.\n\n                     TREVOR\n\n           I thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies!\n           Look at him \u00ad he is too scared to face me!\nANGLE ON DREW\nHis face calm.\n                    DREW\n           No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for\n           my ego.\n                    SAN DE\n           You have learned much.\nANGLE ON TREVOR\n                    TREVOR\n\n           The Shaolin monks are PUSSIES! Warrior-monks? Ha!\n\nANGLE ON SAN DE\n\nWho indicates trevor with a inclination of his head.\n\n                    SAN DE\n\n           You did the right thing.\n\nANGLE ON TREVOR\n\n                    TREVOR\n\n           How about you, baldy? Or you?\n\nHe is pointing at Li and Gao and the others, who are itching to climb\ninto the ring. Gao goes over to San De, and shoots a questioning look\nat Drew.\n\n                    GAO\n\n           Master, the American is insulting the Temple, and the\n           fighting monks.\n                    SAN DE\n                  (looking at drew)\n\n           What should be done?\n                    GAO (CONT'D)\n           Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of\n           the temple.\nSan De looks at Drew long and hard.\n                    SAN DE\n           There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some\n           people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.\n\nANGLE ON DREW\nWho understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to\nsmile slowly.\n                      SAN DE (CONT'D)\n           It's your call.\nDrew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still\nstanding, trying to get someone to fight him.\nDrew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and\nLi and together they high-five.\n                      DREW\n           For the temple...\nDrew climbs into the ring.\n\nThe crowd is going crazy. Trevor has a predator's grin on his face as\nhe sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match.\nImmediately, his contingent of people start to work on him \u00ad massage,\ndrinks, etc.\n\nANGLE ON DREW\n\nWho sits alone in the other corner.\n\nANGLE ON LI AND GAO\n\nWho see the difference. Immediately, they mobilize the other monks.\n\nANGLE ON GAO\n\nWho pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to\ngive it to Drew.\n\nANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER\n\nAs it is flooded with monks. Some of them are massaging Drew\n(painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels\nto bring air to him, etc.\n\nThe referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. They do,\nand he motions for them to bow to each other.\n\n                      TREVOR\n           Remember last time, punk?\n                      DREW\n           Nothing exists but the moment, and...\n                 (beat)\n\n           ... I'm going to enjoy it.\nThey back up, and the fight begins.\nTrevor attacks hard, but Drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu.\n\nHe continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy\ntechnique, but he can't touch Drew.\n                      TREVOR\n           Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight!\nAnd he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry.\nSoon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this    quickly. He\ngoes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that    Trevor is\ncompletely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will,    and soon has\nTrevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of    high kicks,\ntakedowns, flips and punches.\nTrevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even\nbothering to defend himself.\nDrew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his\nright hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old-\nfashioned roundhouse punch.\n\nANGLE ON LI AND GAO\n\nYelling for the knock out blow.\n\nANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DE\n\nWorried about this latest development.\n\nInstead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his\nhand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.\n\nTrevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a\nthing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.\n\nTo teach him a lesson.\n\nTrevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.\n\nThe crowd goes crazy.\n\nANGLE ON LI AND GAO\n\nWho also get the message.\nANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.\nWho knew the message all along.\n\nWIDE ANGLE OF ENTIRE RING\nDrew and Trevor standing together in the center. The monks on the\nside climb into the ring to celebrate with Drew.\nEXT. GREAT WALL \u00ad MORNING\nESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STANDING ON THE GREAT WALL, THE SUNSET OVER\nHIS SHOULDER.\n\nHe is doing the beginning of a Shaolin form. When he finishes the\nsalute, a figure comes toward him.\n\nIt is San De, and he has something in his hands.\nDrew bows to San De, and San De holds THE GOLDEN SASH out to him.\nDrew takes it and San De bows to him. Drew can't stand it anymore,\nand rushes up to San De. He gives him a hug.\nANGLE ON SAN DE\nWho is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then\nhis face softens and he returns Drew's embrace.\nThey break and bow again, and San De moves off. Drew stands there\nholding the Golden Sash, the rising sun of the first day of the rest\nof his life shining in the b.g.\nANGLE ON ASHEMA\nWho comes up to Drew, taking his arm and walks with him along the\nGreat Wall.\n\n  FADE OUT\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Shaolin: King of Kickboxers II\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Keith Strandburg\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:16.327960"}
