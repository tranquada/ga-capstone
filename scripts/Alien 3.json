An ember. \nUnseen BELLOWS blow.\n\n<b>GLASS FURNACE\n</b>\nThe embers glow.  Flame.\nThe fire GROWS.\n\n<b>A RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS\n</b>\nHeated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. \nWhite Hot.\n\n<b>GLASS FACTORY\n</b>\nFlickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls.  \nCoarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of\nintense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood,\nit too now old and dry.\n\n<b>SMOKE\n</b>\nBillows up the walls.\nHangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of\nthe vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures --\n\n<b>A MAN\n</b>\nOn a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. \nHis clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. \nHe is a MONK.\n\nLOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open.\nThe smoke begins to escape.\n\nThe Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch --\nGently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX --\na primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope.\nHe lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by --\n\n<b>MORE MONKS\n</b>\nBy their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil.\nThey blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished\npieces.  The old way.\n\n<b>ONE PARTICULAR MONK\n</b>\nBlack skinned, early fifties.\nStirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but\nhe is watching something else.  It moves him to song.\nLilting tenor lifts high into the air.\nThis is BROTHER KYLE.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBROTHER KYLE\n</b>\tWell would he guess the ascending of the star,\n\tWherein his patient's fortunes settled were.\n\tHe knew the course of every malady,\n\tWere it of cold or heat or moist or dry.\n\tBrother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.\n\nWe see the object of his song:\n\n<b>BROTHER JOHN\n</b>\nNot yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.\nThe fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.\nA good face, nonetheless.\nHe stirs a thick mixture in a mortar.\nNext to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of\nhim, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.\n\n<b>\t\t       BROTHER KYLE\n</b>\t\tTend you quickly he will,\n\t\twith bottles from a shelf.\n\t\tBut heals not, so easily,\n\t\tThe ills which plague himself.\n\nBrother John stops stirring.\n\n<b>\t\t      BROTHER JOHN\n</b>\t\t   (to Kyle)\n\t\tEnough.\n\nHe scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the\nBurned Monk's arm.

John starts up --\n\n<b>\t\t\tKYLE\n</b>\t\tNot coming down?\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\tI have someone waiting for me.\n\nKyle disappears into the crowd.\nJohn moves up...\n\n<b>THE STAIRWAY\n</b>\nA river of brown cassocks running downstream.\nJohn is the only one moving against the flow.\nHe exits the stairwell --\n\n<b>ONE FLOOR UP\n</b>\nA narrow corridor lined with doorways.\nJohn moves to one in particular.\nHe doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob.\nThis is his room.\nHe opens the door --\n\n<b>IN BROTHER JOHN'S ROOM\n</b>\nAn old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock\nwhich is now serving as its bed.\nAt the sight of John it stands.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\tCome on, Mattias.\n\nThe dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall.\nMonk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. \nPast another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down.\n\n<b>INT. LIBRARY\n</b>\nA vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches\nbetween aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves\njammed to capacity with BOOKS of all shapes and sizes.  Millions\nof books, from the looks of it.\nFrom each book hangs a long CHAIN, long enough to allow the \nbook to be carried only as far as the nearest table.\n\n<b>A CORPULENT MONK - BROTHER PHILIP\n</b>\nIn his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his\nposition behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large\nKEY hanging from his belt.  He watches the few stragglers return\ntheir chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door,\nthen rises and joins them...\n\n<b>IN THE CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY\n</b>\nJohn leans against the wall as Philip exits.\nMattias is nowhere to be seen. \n\n<b>\t\t\tPHILIP\n</b>\t\tBrother John.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\tBrother Philip.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPHILIP\n</b>\t\tFeeding the mind instead of the body\n\t\tagain?\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\tMy training has taught me to feed what's\n\t\thungry.\n\nPhilip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPHILIP\n</b>\t\tAs did mine.

He crosses to the table.\n\nJohn closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.\n\n\t\t\tJohn\n\t\tAbbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --\n\n<b>\t\t\tABBOT\n</b>\t\tMind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed\n\t\thim on the way up.  He said you'd come \n\t\tin alone.  I knew better.\n\nHe scratches the back of Mattias' neck.\n\n<b>\t\t\tABBOT\n</b>\t\tHello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?\n\nThe dog snuffles in response.\n\n<b>\t\t\tABBOT\n</b>\t\tYou know what Philip says about Mattias'\n\t\thair and his breathing.  You'll have to \n\t\ttake him out of here.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\tHe likes when I read to him and -- I \n\t\tcan't --\n\nJohn looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels\nalmost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot.  \nThe Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.\n\n<b>\t\t\tABBOT\n</b>\t\t    (smiles)\n\t\tSomeone must have left this one unlocked.\n\t\tTake the book with you.\n\nHe hands the key to John, who is shocked --\nthis is a great honor.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\tFather, I --?\n\n<b>\t\t\tABBOT\n</b>\t\tKyle tells me you did a good job at\n\t\tthe glassworks today.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\tI'll reserve judgement until the patient\n\t\tlives.\n\nJohn crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book.\nHe returns the key.\n\n<b>\t\t\tABBOT\n</b>\t\tIt will get easier.

You'll do fine.\n\nThe Abbot walks towards the door...\n\n<b>\t\t\tABBOT\n</b>\t\tJust have it back before the end of lunch.\n\t\tOh -- And I didn't see you in here.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\tThank you.\n\t\t      (to Mattias)\n\t\tLet's go upstairs, boy.\n\nJohn takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase.\nMattias at his heels.\nGoes UP --\n\n<b>INTO THE BELL TOWER\n</b>\nThe mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs\ncast scary shadows.\nA doorway leads to --\n\n<b>THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY\n</b>\nThick with sandy dust.  The wood shows through thin patches.  \nWe PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey\nis actually --\n\n<b>THE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID!\nThe curving horizon broken only by the very top of the\nAbbey bell tower poking through from the levels below.  \nSMOKE curls from vents set into the surface.\nSunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS.\n\nThis is ARCEON.\nAn manmade orbiter.\nA shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter.\nConstructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable\nlevel within finished in whatever material suits its end user.\n\nThis orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been\nsheathed in wood.\n\n<b>JOHN\n</b>\nWalks to the shore of an inland SEA.\nSits on a bare patch of wood.  Looks up.\nHis eyes grow accustomed to --\n\n<b>THE NIGHT SKY - JOHN POV\n</b>\nFreckled with tiny dots of light.\nStars.  Spread across the inky void.\nBathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow.\n\nJohn smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. \nThe atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. \nHe opens the book.\nReads aloud --\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\tIn the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother\n\t\tGerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury\n\t\tthe Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day\n\t\tby day, one by one, until I am the only \n\t\tone left.

Something catches his eye --\nSomething among the myriad points of light in the sky.\nMillions of miles away:\n\n<b>ONE OF THE STARS\n</b>\nBrighter than the rest.

Fish bob to the surface.  Bloated.  Dead.\n\n<b>JOHN\n</b>\nIs the first to hit the shore.\nSmall leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake.\nHis coracle is the first into the water.\nThe others running up behind him.\nHe cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning.\n\n<b>ON THE SEA - DAWN\n</b>\nThe sun cracks over the black water.\nJohn's hands move the rough wooden oars.\nBlistered palm opens.\nBLOOD flows.\nHe tears off a piece of his cassock --\nRips it with his teeth --\nWraps the bloody hand.\nRows.\n\n<b>THE STAR\n</b>\nShip.  Star Ship.\nSulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water.\nWhite metal skin blackened by the heat.\n\n<b>JOHN\n</b>\nRows right into it.\nHis coracle pitches in the choppy surf.  \nHe scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface.\nTeeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH.\nLooks around for a knob, a handle --\n\n<b>NEXT TO THE HATCH\n</b>\nA small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote\nurgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny\nmetal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat.\nThen quickly pulls it down...\n<b>WUORRRSH -!\n</b>Hull door OPENS.\n\nThe doorway is a black maw.\nJohn crosses himself.\nBegins to lower his foot into the hatch --\n\n<b>\t\t\tKYLE O/S\n</b>\t\tWatch it!\n\nHe almost falls backwards off the ship.

Don't go in!\n\nJohn turns back to the open hatch.\nMachine recirculated air flows out.\nHe feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool.\nCool, and artificial.  It calls to him.\nHe steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness --\n\n<b>WHOOSH-CLANG -!\n</b>The door closes behind him.\n\n<b>INT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY\n</b>\nDark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to\nthe darkness.  He sees:\n\n<b>NEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE\n</b>\nA glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its\nbase.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the\nhead of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt\nwarning -- is audible...\n\n<b>\t\t\tCOMPUTER VOICE\n</b>\t\t\t(sotto)\n\t\tSeal broken...seal broken...\n\nJohn finds himself moving towards the tube...\nLooks through the broken lid:\n\n<b>IN THE TUBE\n</b>\nThere is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white\ninterior.

His eyes follow the stains to a pile of\nBloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn.\nChild size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found.\n\n<b>JOHN\n</b>\nLooks back towards the door.\nPart of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights\nback his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone\nin here may need his help.  He presses forward -- \nAverts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and\nglowing instrument panels and their myraid -- \n\n<b>LIGHTS\n</b>\nPressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights.\nThousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky.\n\nIt's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and\nnever this close up.
