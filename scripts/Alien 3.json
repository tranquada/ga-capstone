Without a mother, one cannot\nlove.  Without a mother, one cannot die.\"\n\n\t\t\t- Hesse\n\n\n\n\n\nALIEN III\n\n\nTHE SCREEN IS BLACK\n\nA pinpoint of light appears.\nRed.  An ember. \nUnseen BELLOWS blow.\n\nGLASS FURNACE\n\nThe embers glow.  Flame.\nThe fire GROWS.\n\nA RIVER OF MOLTEN GLASS\n\nHeated by the furnace to over 1,300 degrees fahrenheit. \nWhite Hot.\n\nGLASS FACTORY\n\nFlickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls.  \nCoarsely grained wood.  Moisture blasted out by years of\nintense heat.  Timbers split.  Patched with new wood,\nit too now old and dry.\n\nSMOKE\n\nBillows up the walls.\nHangs as an angry, black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of\nthe vaulted ceiling.  Almost obscures --\n\nA MAN\n\nOn a narrow LEDGE, twenty feet about the Glassworks' floor. \nHis clothing is Medieval.  A rough textured cassock. \nHe is a MONK.\n\nLOUVERS are set into the wall.  He angles them open.\nThe smoke begins to escape.\n\nThe Monk turns, raises arms and LEAPS from his lofty perch --\nGently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a FLOWING FOX --\na primitive hand-held pulley that runs down a rope.\nHe lands next to the glass furnace, surrounded by --\n\nMORE MONKS\n\nBy their dress.  With Blowing Iron and Pontil.\nThey blow and shape the molten glass.  Crack off the finished\npieces.  The old way.\n\nONE PARTICULAR MONK\n\nBlack skinned, early fifties.\nStirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass, but\nhe is watching something else.  It moves him to song.\nLilting tenor lifts high into the air.\nThis is BROTHER KYLE.\n\n\t\t\tBROTHER KYLE\n\tWell would he guess the ascending of the star,\n\tWherein his patient's fortunes settled were.\n\tHe knew the course of every malady,\n\tWere it of cold or heat or moist or dry.\n\tBrother John, would-be Doctour of Physick.\n\nWe see the object of his song:\n\nBROTHER JOHN\n\nNot yet forty.  Strong features, but fear behind the eyes.\nThe fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence.\nA good face, nonetheless.\nHe stirs a thick mixture in a mortar.\nNext to him another MONK sits holding his arm out in front of\nhim, cassock sleeve rolled up, revealing a vicious BURN.\n\n\t\t       BROTHER KYLE\n\t\tTend you quickly he will,\n\t\twith bottles from a shelf.\n\t\tBut heals not, so easily,\n\t\tThe ills which plague himself.\n\nBrother John stops stirring.\n\n\t\t      BROTHER JOHN\n\t\t   (to Kyle)\n\t\tEnough.\n\nHe scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the\nBurned Monk's arm.  The Burned Monk INHALES sharpley as the cool\nmixture contacts the injured area.  \n\n\t\t     BROTHER JOHN\n\t\t  (to the burned Monk)\n\t\tRelax.\n\t\t  (to Kyle)\n\t\tPut those lungs of yours to better\n\t\tuse.\n\n\t\t     BROTHER KYLE\n\t\tYes, Doc Tor.\n\nKyle laughs, removes the blowing iron from the molten glass --\na BLOB of white hot glass hanging on the end.\n\nHe rolls the blob on the Marver, a flat, polished piece of \niron, then begins to blow a bottle shaped container. \n\nJohn wraps a fray-edged cloth bandage around the burn.\n\n\t\t\t     JOHN\n\t\tKeep this from getting wet.  Go home at\n\t\tlate afternoon mealtime and don't come\n\t\tback to work today --\n\n\t\t     BURNED MONK\n\t\tBut John --\n\n\t\t\t     JOHN\n\t\tI'll tell the Abbot.  Just rest today.\n\t\tYou're lucky you only burned yourself on\n\t\tthe side of the furnace.  If some of that\n\t\tglass had gotten on your arm --\n\nHe points to the top of his forearm.\n\n\t   \t            JOHN\n\t\t-- it would've burned clean through to\n\t\tthe other side.\n\nHe mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm.\nThe Burned Monk shudders at the thought.  \n\nBELLS toll.\n \n\t\t            JOHN\n\t\tThat's late afternoon.  Now get on.\n\n\t\t\tBURNED MONK\n\t\tThank you, John.  I --\n\n\t\t\t   JOHN\n\t\tYou're welcome.  Go!\n\nThe Burned Monk trundles off, injured arm against his chest.\nJohn gathers his mortar, pestle, and extra bandages into a\nburlap sack.  Kyle comes over.\n\n\t\t\t  KYLE\n\t\tGood work.\n\n\t\t\t  JOHN\n\t\tAll right, but I'm no Father Anselm.\n\n  \t\t\t  KYLE\n\t\tYou're yourself, that's better...\n\nKyle pushes him through the door...\n\nINTO THE HALLWAY\n\nThe Hallway is alive with cassocked monks.\nTheir LOW CHANTING reverberates throughout the building.\nThe wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights.\nThis is obviously a MEDIEVAL MONASTERY...\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tThe Abbot will be pleased.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tDon't.\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tDon't what?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tPlease don't tell him.  At least until\n\t\tI know if there's an infection.\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tYou want to be the Abbey's Physician,\n\t\tand you haven't learned the first rule:\n\t\tDon't worry about the patient.\n\nJohn's face drops.\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tI shouldn't have. Sorry.  Look, I know\n\t\thow you must --\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tYou don't, but thanks anyway.\n\nAT THE END OF THE HALLWAY\n\nA wide stairwell.  A constant stream of monks all moving down\nthe stairs.  Coming from floors above.  Headed for lunch.\nKyle starts down.  John starts up --\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tNot coming down?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tI have someone waiting for me.\n\nKyle disappears into the crowd.\nJohn moves up...\n\nTHE STAIRWAY\n\nA river of brown cassocks running downstream.\nJohn is the only one moving against the flow.\nHe exits the stairwell --\n\nONE FLOOR UP\n\nA narrow corridor lined with doorways.\nJohn moves to one in particular.\nHe doesn't even look as he grabs the door knob.\nThis is his room.\nHe opens the door --\n\nIN BROTHER JOHN'S ROOM\n\nAn old, worn out DOG lays in wait on an old, worn out cassock\nwhich is now serving as its bed.\nAt the sight of John it stands.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tCome on, Mattias.\n\nThe dog, MATTIAS, joins him in the hall.\nMonk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs. \nPast another dozen or so Monks who are on their way down.\n\nINT. LIBRARY\n\nA vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches\nbetween aisle after aisle of floor-to-ceiling wooden shelves\njammed to capacity with BOOKS of all shapes and sizes.  Millions\nof books, from the looks of it.\nFrom each book hangs a long CHAIN, long enough to allow the \nbook to be carried only as far as the nearest table.\n\nA CORPULENT MONK - BROTHER PHILIP\n\nIn his fifties, and the Librarian by his stern affect, his\nposition behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large\nKEY hanging from his belt.  He watches the few stragglers return\ntheir chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door,\nthen rises and joins them...\n\nIN THE CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY\n\nJohn leans against the wall as Philip exits.\nMattias is nowhere to be seen. \n\n\t\t\tPHILIP\n\t\tBrother John.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tBrother Philip.\n\n\t\t\tPHILIP\n\t\tFeeding the mind instead of the body\n\t\tagain?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tMy training has taught me to feed what's\n\t\thungry.\n\nPhilip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.\n\n\t\t\tPHILIP\n\t\tAs did mine.  As long as you're alone.\n\t\tEnjoy yourself -- and remember, no book\n\t\tleaves the library.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tHow could I forget?  Have a good meal...\n\nJohn watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs.\nWhen he's gone from sight John lifts the bottom of his cassock\nto reveal Mattias.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tPerfect.\n\nThey move into the library...\n\nTHE MEDIEVAL SECTION\n\nThe oldest books.\nJohn moves to the stacks.\nMattias trots over to a particular bench and sits.\nThis is his regular place.\n\nAT THE SHELVES\n\nJohn stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient Tome.\nHe runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding.\nA smile plays across his lips.\n\nHe carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so\nthere is slack in the chain.\nSits on the bench next to the dog.\nClears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...\n\n\t\t\tJohn\n\t    \t    (reading)\n\t\tIn the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother\n\t\tGerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury\n\t\tthe Abbot and my sixty fellow monks --\n\n\t\t\tVOICE O/S\n\t\tSometimes, I think you'd like that.\n\nJohn turns to find --\n\nTHE ABBOT\n\nLeader of the monastery.  In his seventies but looks younger.\nHis Cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden\nCHAIN in place of a rope belt.  He crosses to the table.\n\nJohn closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.\n\n\t\t\tJohn\n\t\tAbbot, I -- I didn't think anyone would --\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tMind?  Just Philip, if he knew.  I passed\n\t\thim on the way up.  He said you'd come \n\t\tin alone.  I knew better.\n\nHe scratches the back of Mattias' neck.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tHello, Mattias.  How are you, boy?\n\nThe dog snuffles in response.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tYou know what Philip says about Mattias'\n\t\thair and his breathing.  You'll have to \n\t\ttake him out of here.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tHe likes when I read to him and -- I \n\t\tcan't --\n\nJohn looks down sheepishly.  Though nearly forty, he feels\nalmost adolescent in the presence of the Abbot.  \nThe Abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\t    (smiles)\n\t\tSomeone must have left this one unlocked.\n\t\tTake the book with you.\n\nHe hands the key to John, who is shocked --\nthis is a great honor.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tFather, I --?\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tKyle tells me you did a good job at\n\t\tthe glassworks today.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tI'll reserve judgement until the patient\n\t\tlives.\n\nJohn crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book.\nHe returns the key.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tIt will get easier.  Father Anselm was...\n\t\tan unexpected loss.  You'll do fine.\n\nThe Abbot walks towards the door...\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tJust have it back before the end of lunch.\n\t\tOh -- And I didn't see you in here.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tThank you.\n\t\t      (to Mattias)\n\t\tLet's go upstairs, boy.\n\nJohn takes his book -- Moves to a spiral wooden staircase.\nMattias at his heels.\nGoes UP --\n\nINTO THE BELL TOWER\n\nThe mechanics of the bell tower -- all ropes and wooden cogs\ncast scary shadows.\nA doorway leads to --\n\nTHE ROOF OF THE ABBEY\n\nThick with sandy dust.  The wood shows through thin patches.  \nWe PULL BACK TO REVEAL what we think is the roof of the Abbey\nis actually --\n\nTHE SURFACE OF ARCEON - NIGHT\n\nThe door has opened onto the SURFACE OF A PLANTOID!\nThe curving horizon broken only by the very top of the\nAbbey bell tower poking through from the levels below.  \nSMOKE curls from vents set into the surface.\nSunken areas of the planet's sirface are SEAS.\n\nThis is ARCEON.\nAn manmade orbiter.\nA shell of lightweight foamed steel, five miles in diameter.\nConstructed by The Company on Special Order with habitable\nlevel within finished in whatever material suits its end user.\n\nThis orbiter, for reasons to be discovered later, has been\nsheathed in wood.\n\nJOHN\n\nWalks to the shore of an inland SEA.\nSits on a bare patch of wood.  Looks up.\nHis eyes grow accustomed to --\n\nTHE NIGHT SKY - JOHN POV\n\nFreckled with tiny dots of light.\nStars.  Spread across the inky void.\nBathe Arceon's surface with their celestial glow.\n\nJohn smiles at Mattias, breathes deep. \nThe atmosphere up here is thinner, but fresher. \nHe opens the book.\nReads aloud --\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tIn the year of our Lord 1348 I, Brother\n\t\tGerhado of the Minorite Abbey helped bury\n\t\tthe Abbot and my sixty fellow monks, day\n\t\tby day, one by one, until I am the only \n\t\tone left.  I stayed as long as I could bear \n\t\tit, then with my dog -- \n\nMattias lifts his ears at this part.  His favorite part.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\t- fled.  I have put this to parchment lest\n\t\tthis pestilence - this Black Death - \n\t\tstay my hand.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tThis was finished by another hand...\n\nJohn closes the book.  Something catches his eye --\nSomething among the myriad points of light in the sky.\nMillions of miles away:\n\nONE OF THE STARS\n\nBrighter than the rest.  MOVING.\nFast enough to leave a faint trail.\nAcross the stars.  And down...\nA comet.\n\nJohn stands.  Watches --\n\nTHE STAR\n\nGrowing brighter.\nDrawing nearer.\n\nJOHN\n\nJoined by three other MONKS.\nThey are older than he.\nThe Four men watch the sky...\n\nTHE STAR\n\nBrighter still.  Closer.\n\nMORE MONKS\n\nTwo dozen.  A hundred.\nThey come up through the planet's surface.\nOut of wooden trap doors.  Join the others.\nDays pass.\nNow three hundred.\nNecks bowed back.\nMouths agape.\nA SUBTITLE identifies...\n\n\t\t\tRELIGIOUS COLONY ARCEON\n\t\t\t-----------------------\n\t\t\tPOPULATION: 350 Exiles\n\t\t\tCRIME:  Political Heresy\n\nTHE STAR\n\nFills the sky.\nBurns brighter still as it hits the planetoid's atmosphere.\n\nON THE SURFACE OF ARCEON\n\nHundreds of Monks shield their eyes as the ship -- the star --\nROARS over their heads.  Trailing FIRE --\n\nJohn holds up his hands - to touch a star --\nSkin BLISTERS as it passes over him,\nHe turns and watches as it --\nArcs downward --\n\nINTO THE SEA\n\nWHOMP- SSSSSSSSSS --!!\nPLUMES of steam rise into the air.\nThe water boils.  Fish bob to the surface.  Bloated.  Dead.\n\nJOHN\n\nIs the first to hit the shore.\nSmall leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake.\nHis coracle is the first into the water.\nThe others running up behind him.\nHe cannot hear the SHOUTS of warning.\n\nON THE SEA - DAWN\n\nThe sun cracks over the black water.\nJohn's hands move the rough wooden oars.\nBlistered palm opens.\nBLOOD flows.\nHe tears off a piece of his cassock --\nRips it with his teeth --\nWraps the bloody hand.\nRows.\n\nTHE STAR\n\nShip.  Star Ship.\nSulaco escape vehicle #4 rocks on the water.\nWhite metal skin blackened by the heat.\n\nJOHN\n\nRows right into it.\nHis coracle pitches in the choppy surf.  \nHe scrambles onto the ship's cracked tile surface.\nTeeters -- balances -- moves to the unmistakeable HATCH.\nLooks around for a knob, a handle --\n\nNEXT TO THE HATCH\n\nA small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote\nurgency.  John hesitantly opens the door, revealing a shiny\nmetal LEVER.  He stares at it...a beat.\nThen quickly pulls it down...\nWUORRRSH -!\nHull door OPENS.\n\nThe doorway is a black maw.\nJohn crosses himself.\nBegins to lower his foot into the hatch --\n\n\t\t\tKYLE O/S\n\t\tWatch it!\n\nHe almost falls backwards off the ship.  Looks back --\n\nTHE OTHER MONKS\n\nAre rapidly approaching.\nKyle gestulates wildly --\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tJohn!  Wait -- !  Don't go in!\n\nJohn turns back to the open hatch.\nMachine recirculated air flows out.\nHe feels it on the skin of his face.  Cool.\nCool, and artificial.  It calls to him.\nHe steps in.  Swallowed by the blackness --\n\nWHOOSH-CLANG -!\nThe door closes behind him.\n\nINT. SULACO ESCAPE POD #4 - DAY\n\nDark.  Dim red lights.  John stands still as his eyes adjust to\nthe darkness.  He sees:\n\nNEWT'S HYPER SLEEP TUBE\n\nA glass and metal COFFIN -- pneumatic piping twines around its\nbase.  The glass lid is BROKEN.  A Small RED LIGHT pulses at the\nhead of the tube -- a soft VOICE and TONE, like your seat belt\nwarning -- is audible...\n\n\t\t\tCOMPUTER VOICE\n\t\t\t(sotto)\n\t\tSeal broken...seal broken...\n\nJohn finds himself moving towards the tube...\nLooks through the broken lid:\n\nIN THE TUBE\n\nThere is a splattered BLOOD STAIN on the sterile white\ninterior.  OLD, turned rust-brown.\nWhatever happened here happened a while ago.\nRust colored drips trail down to --\n\nTHE FLOOR\n\nDrag marks.  His eyes follow the stains to a pile of\nBloody clothing against a control panel.  A jumpsuit.  Torn.\nChild size.  The head of child's DOLL, but no body to be found.\n\nJOHN\n\nLooks back towards the door.\nPart of him wants to get the hell out here -- but he fights\nback his fear.  He is a doctor - or trying to be - someone\nin here may need his help.  He presses forward -- \nAverts his gaze from the clothing, UP to the blinking and\nglowing instrument panels and their myraid -- \n\nLIGHTS\n\nPressure lights.  Data lights.  Warning lights.\nThousands of lights.  Like the stars in the sky.\n\nIt's been decades since he's seen technology like this -- and\nnever this close up.  He steps further into the ship, his fear\nnow replaced by fascination, follows the lights....\n\nON A PALE GREEN SCREEN\n\nLED numbers race -- 7,291.01.05...06...07\nA legand identifies \"Elapsed since separation.\"\nHe moves on...\n\nA VIDEO MONITOR\n\nThrough scanning bars of snow, an image:\nA WOMAN with a YOUNG GIRL standing in front of her.\nThe Woman's arms are wrapped around the girl.\nProtective. Maternal.\n\nThe Woman speaks.  Her message repeats itself.\nA tape loop, although John has no idea what that is.\n\n\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\t...taking pod four.  The Crew of the SS\n\t\tSulaco and all Marine commandoes are dead.\n\t\tShip's sensors have interrupted the hyper\n\t\tsleep cycle.  An overlooked alien egg has\n\t\thatched.  Bishop and Hicks have been killed.\n\t\tXenomorphs have infested the cruiser.  Newt \n\t\tand I are taking pod four.  The Crew of...\n\nThe WARNING TONE of the Woman's message rekindles John's fear.\nHe moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship,\nfollowing the trail of blinking instruments --\nDrawn to touch a button.  Click...\n\nSOMETHING TENTACLE-LIKE DROPS DOWN ON HIS SHOULDER!\nJust an oxygen mask.\n\nJohn feels his rapidly BEATING heart as he pushes aside the\nplastic, dangling object and continues around the shuttle. \nHis hand brushes over a SENSOR which responds by lighting and --\n\nHSSSSSSSSS -!\nA BLAST of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe --\nJohn SHOUTS and back up into --\n\nANOTHER HYPER SLEEP TUBE!!!\n\nNext to Newt's now empty tube.\nHumming gently.  Still operational.\nJohn approaches it cautiously.\nHe can make out the occupant through the lid...\n\nA WOMAN\n\nThe woman from the screen.  This is RIPLEY.\nIn hypersleep.  Wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer-type\nshorts.  Christ, she looks beautiful.  \n\nJohn looks from Ripley to her image on the monitor, then back.\nSinks to his knees, reverent.  Fascination has replaced fear\nagain.  Moves his face closer to the lid.  \nCloser to hers...\n\nDAYLIGHT spills in --\nJohn's head WHIPS towards the source of the light --\n\nTHE DOOR\n\nOpen.  Kyle and the other monks.\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tJohn - what is it?  Is this a Supply ship?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tNo.  No supplies.  Kyle, there's someone\n\t\tin here --\n\nThe Second Monk looks at Kyle.\n\n\t\t\tSECOND MONK\n\t\tThis is forbidden.\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tJohn.  Just get the hell out of there --\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tI don't want to stay.  I have to get her\n\t\tout before this sinks.  You come in, give\n\t\tme a hand --\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tHer?  Look, this is not the supply ship,\n\t\tso this is technology forbidden to us.\n\t\tGet out of there now!\n\nJohn looks down at Ripely.\nA KEYPAD is mounted at the head of the tube.\nA red button:  \"EMERG-OPEN\"\nThat's plain enough.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tAll right --\n\nHe presses it.\nThe Tube opens with a loud BLAST of compressed air.\nThe Monks at the door recoil at the sound.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nEXT. SPACE SHIP - ON THE SEA - DAY\n\nRipley has been lowered into a large coracle.  John holds her in\nfront of him.  Unconscious.  \nHer head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves. \nThe monks start to row back to short.\n\n\t\t\tFIRST MONK\n\t\t     (reverent)\n\t\tA space ship...\n\n\t\t\tSECOND MONK\n                    (even more reverent)\n\t\tA woman...\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tYou shouldn't have gone in --\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tI'm supposed to be a doctor.\n\nHe pushes Ripley's hair away from her forehead.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tShe could've been lost.\n\n\t\t\tFIRST MONK\n\t\tBeen a long time since I saw either.\n\n\t\t\tSECOND MONK\n\t\tIt isn't sinking.  Look at it.  What are we\n\t\tsupposed to do with it?\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tWhat was it like in there --?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tLights.  So many lights --\n\n\t\t\tTHIRD MONK\n\t\tTow it in.  Bring it in.\n\n\t\t\tSECOND MONK\n\t\tIt's evil.\n\n\t\t\tFIRST MONK\n\t\tIt's just technology.\n\n\t\t\tSECOND MONK\n\t\tEvil technology.

These fish are boiled. \n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tThousands of lights.  Like the stars.\n\t\tLike Heaven on Earth.\n\nRipley stirs in John's arms.  Groans.\nFights to come out of her fugue state...\nLooks around through half-lidded eyes --\nShe is surrounded by rowing, cassocked Monks.\nMONKS?  She closes her eyes.\nTries to clear the imagine.  Opens:\nThey're still there.\nShe looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist --\nrealizes she's sitting on someone's lap.\nLooks back over her shoulder --\n\nJOHN\n\nHe smiles at her.\nFriendly, not sexual.\n\nRIPLEY\n\nShakes her head.  Tries to speak --\nHer lips form soundless words.\nShe looks over her other shoulder, sees --\n\nTHE SHIP - RIPLEY POV\n\nBobbing on the surface.  \nGrowing small with each stroke of the oars.\n\nRIPLEY\n\nBrows knit.  Fights the cobwebs in her brain.\nTries to focus on the ship --\nRemembers. \nTurns to John, tries to speak --\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tWait.  New...\n\nShe loses consciousness.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGO TO BLACK...\n\nINT. THE ABBEY - RIPLEY'S ROOM - DAY\n\nStreaks of light move across the darkness.\nForm patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls.\nThere is a sublime stillness, but coming through the walls are\nthe muted, far off SOUNDS of the Abbey --\nThe SAWING of wood.  HAMMERING.\nWHISPERED prayers.\nLILTING song.\n\nWe move down off the wall to a hand-made wooden bed.\nRipley in restless sleep.\n\nEXT. ARCEON SEA - DUSK\n\nThe waters grown rough with the approach of night.  Wind whips across\nwhite wave tops -- SPRAYS the dozen Monks who LASH their \nboats to Ripley's SHIP with thick hemp ropes --\nStart to tow it to shore...\n\nINT. RIPLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nRipley is sleeping -- but struggling against some unseen foe --\nShe tries to sit up -- can't.  Tries to shake off the effects of\nthe suspended animation...looks up through half-lidded eyes:\n\nJOHN\n\nSits next to her.  Quite asleep.\nHands swathed in white bandages.  Book resting on his lap.\n\nShe squints to make the figure standing in the shadows\nbehind him -- it's skin picks up and reflects tiny points of\nflickering cangle light - seems to ripple as it moves --\n\nTHE ALIEN\n\nBig, black shiny-smooth head moves into the taper light.\nIt moves towards her, cable-like arms held out at its side --\nmoving out of sync with its feet -- Ripley tries to move - \nto cry out -- She can't.\n\nShe can only move her eyes.  She looks over at John, sleeping\npeacefully.  He doesn't notice the Alien --\n\nThe Alien moves closer.  \nShe can feel his breath -- it evaporates the sweat  on her\nforehead -- a CHILL runs through her but she still can't move --\n\nThe Alien stands alongside her bed.\nExtends a six-fingered hand...\nGently rests it on her stomach.\nCocks its head -- like it's listening to something.\nThe implication is clear.\n\nRipley finds her voice --\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!\n\nHer eyes open wide --\nShe sits bolt upright.\n\nA hand moves to her forehead.  Gently pushes her head back to\nthe pillow.  John's.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tYou're out of it.  Out of it...\n\nRipley falls back, eyes glued to where the alien appeared.\nJohn sees her focal point, looks back over his shoulder:\nNothing.\nRipley's eyes roll back into her head.\nShe tries to speak -- It was there.\nHer hand, at her side, tightens into a fist --\n\nJohn's hand covers hers.\nEases the fingers open again.\nShe feels the coarse bandages against her palm.\n\nHe starts to read quietly from Saint Augustines' Confessions.\nShe begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her\nlike waves lapping against the shore...\n\nEXT. SURGACE OF ARCEON - DAY\n\nA HOWLING DUST STORM has kicked up.  The monks wear small round\ngoggles, have rags tied over their noses, as they work at a \nhuge BLOCK AND TACKLE arrangement --\n\nHundreds of ropes grow TAUT.\nTimbers GROAN.\nThey LIFT Ripley's SHIP -- SWING it over to a large portal --\n\nINT.

Opens her eyes.\nRolls over onto her side --\nThere is a window right next to the bed.\nRipley lifts herself up on one elbow, looks out:\n\nHER POV\n\nGarden of Earthly delights...\nMonks laboring under a beautiful, celestial blue sky --\npicking apples, fishing on the water on small inland lakes.\nWorking with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages.  Lyrical.\nIt makes her feel good.  She scans the countryside...\n\nSheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet\nup to the -- Ripley does a take --\n\nWORKERS ON A SCAFFOLDING\n\nWith crude brushes at the end of poles -- PAINT the sky blue.\nThe Abbey, the cottages, the fields outside her window are all\non one level - INSIDE THE PLANET.\n\nThe vaulted CEILING, painted to look like the sky with huge\nglass \"windows\" to allow the sunlight in, is actually the\nUNDERSIDE of the planetoid's outer shell.\n\nRipley looks back at the Monks on the ground:\nInstead of repairing, they are taking the cabins apart, stacking\nthe wood onto push carts --\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tWhat the hell --?\n\nSUDDENLY --\nThe Sulaco Escape ship APPEARS in front of her.\nSWINGS past her window suspended by ropes.\nThen disappears up, out of sight.\nRipley checks her pulse.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tThis must be a dream.  A bad one.\n\nShe rolls back onto the bed.\nStares up at the ceiling.\n\nABOVE HER - ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY\n\nMonks scurry around the Ship as it is lowered into place on\na flat area of the roof above the libaray.\nIt seats with a deeply resounding THUD...\n\nRIPLEY\n\nHears the SOUND and then another - her door OPENING.\nShe turns to find the Abbot and John standing in the doorway.\nJohn waits in the doorway as the Abbot crosses to the chair by\nthe bed and sits.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tWho are you?\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tI am the Abbot.

Whoever\n\t\ttook me out of the stasis tube must not \n\t\thave run the full D-F program...\n\t\tWhere's Newt?\n\nThe Abbot looks at her blankly.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tThere was a little girl with me --\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tYou were alone.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tNo.  She was with me.

A killer.  A monster.\n\t\tAnd now it's here.\n\nThe Abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner\nof Santa Monica and 3rd who's babbling about Judgement Day.  The\nguy with his pants down around his kness.\n\nShe sees this, releases her hold on him...\n\t\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tCalm down, Ripley.  Okay, I was with a\n\t\tplatoon of Colonial Marines on a mission\n\t\tto planetoid LV426.

A computer virus\n\t\twas threatening to wipe away all recorded\n\t\tknowledge.  There didn't seem to be any\n\t\tway it could be averted.  In the almost\n\t\tforty years since we were towed out here\n\t\tin hypersleep, the news that came with \n\t\toccasional supply ships only got worse.\n\t\tFinally, the ships stopped coming.  We \n\t\thad to resign ourselves to the fact that\n\t\tworst had come to pass, and the Earth\n\t\tno longer existed.\n\nNow she gives him that look.\n\t\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\t    (slowly)\n\t\tUh...All right...

Tiny razor sharp teeth and black, glass-like eyes\npeer from a enlongated head covered with downy, but gore-matted\nWOOL.  A quadroped, its shrunked hind legs struggling to free\nitself from the cooling morass of intestines.\n\nJohn can only SCREAM as the most horrible nightmare he can\nimagine tries to slough off the animal's mortal coil.\n\nThe Hysterical Monk, fear overcome with ANGER at the loss of\nhis beloved Sandy,  steps in front of the near catatonic Medic\nand instinctively THRUSTS his pitchfork into the creature --\nThe sharp prongs PIERCE its still forming body --\n\nThe CREATURE\n\nWAILS a high pitched SHRIEK - half alien, half sheep as it is\nroughly TORN from it's nesting place --\nThe Monk lifts --\n\nIt TWISTS at the end of the fork, acid blood dripping onto the\nwood floor -- each drop bursting into a little pool of FIRE.\n\nThe Hysterical Monk turns to the now raging hay fire --\nThe entire corner of the barn is ablaze --\nSHOVES the abomination in --\n\nThe Sheep/Alien POPS and SIZZLES as tongues of flame leap up to\nlap at it's struggling body -- tiny tail whipping about --\n\nThe creature dies, its fading screams are soon the only sound\nheard within the barn.

I don't know how to\n\t\tdescribe it -- A feeling.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tYou haven't seen a woman in thirty years.\n\t\tWhere does this feeling originate, John?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\t     (points to his head)\n\t\tHere.\n\nPause.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tI believe you.  But your feelings are\n\t\tfooling you.  \n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tIt's - It's her conviction.  I just think --\n\nThe Abbot snaps at him --\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tDon't think.\n\nJohn takes a step back at the Abbot's tone.  A tone he's never\nheard before.  The Abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair.\nForces a smile.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tIt's been a long night.  For all of us.\n\t\tYou really don't understand what you're\n\t\tdealing with here.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tThat's what she said.\n\nThe Abbot chafes.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tThese are ideas which threaten the very\n\t\tsystem we live under.  The creature is\n\t\tdead and the woman is gone.  Forget them.\n\t\tBoth.  Go read.  Go fishing.  Go anywhere,\n\t\tbut leave this alone.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tBut I --\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tAlone.  I'll get Philip to let Mattias\n\t\tinto the Library, all right?  For your\n\t\town good, just stay out of this.\n\nJohn looks like he's going to protest.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tI mean it.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\t     (slowly)\n\t\tYes, Father.\n\nJohn turns and leaves the room.  \nThe Abbot stares after him.\n\n\nINT. PRISON LEVEL - NIGHT\n\nDark. Dank. Dreary.\nA NAIL is hammered into a board.  Then another.\nThe board is old, twisted.  The grain is pronounced, splintered.\n\nAnother board is lifted into place, a nail held -- BAM-BAM-BAM -\nHAMMERED in tight.\n\n\nTWO ANCIENT WORKERS\n\nDrab, torn gray clothing.\nHammer the boards over the opening in the wall.\nMethodically covering up --\n\nRIPLEY\n\nWatching them work.\nBAM-BAM-BAM.\nDefeated.\n\n\nON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY (INTERCUT)\n\nA dozen Monks frantically hammer planks up around the Sulacco\nescape ship - A frame of wood --\nbegin to wall it in...\n\n\nIN THE PRISON LEVEL\n\nThe two ANCIENT WORKERS continue their carpentry.\nThe planks cover more of the opening.\nBAM-BAM-BAM.\n\nCovers more of Ripley.\nBAM-BAM-BAM.\nShe stares...\n\n\nON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY\n\nPlanks are rising around the ship.\nCovering it.  Locking away the good omen turned evil.\n\nIN THE LIBRARY\n\nJohn and Mattias sit before an open book.\nHe doesn't read.  He can hear the POUNDING of the hammers.\nIt seems to reverberate THROUGH the planet.\nThrough his SKULL.\nHe closes his eyes in pain.\n\nRIPLEY\n\nOnly her face is visible.\nAnother board.\nBAM-BAM-BAM.\nThen just her eyes.\n\nJust before the last plank is put in place --\n\n\t\t\tWORKER\n\t\tHere you go, woman.  Something from your\n\t\tship.  Something to keep you company --\n\nHe tosses it into the cell.  Ripley catches it.\nWatches as the last of the light is covered over.\nBAM-BAM...BAM.\n\nShe continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow\naccustomed to the darkness.  The little light creeping between\nthe planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see\nwhat it is she has caught --\n\nNEWT'S DOLL'S HEAD.\n\nRipley looks around her cell -- actually a narrow space behind\nother cells, one wall curved out -- like a narrow slice\ncrossways towards the edge of the pie. \nLooks at the Doll's head in her hand.\nA beat.\n\nShe FREAKS OUT --!\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tYou fucking idiots!  You're dead!\n\t\tYou're all dead!\n\nBEATS the walls.

In it:\n\nA MAN'S FACE\n\nBright, wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut.\nHe's looking back at her.\n\n\nON THE ROOF OF THE MONASTERY - NIGHT\n\nThe Sulaco escape pod #4 is now a memory as the Monks have\nfinished walling it up.  Now just another part of the Abbey.\n\nAs the Monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow --\nPass them -- down to an open window and into...\n\n\nINT. LIBRARY - THE MEDIEVAL SECTION - NIGHT INTO DAWN\n\nJohn is here, Mattias asleep at his feet.\nThe tables, the benches, the floor are COVERED with hundreds of\nbooks he's pulled off the shelves, their chains all TANGLED.\nAll open to --\n\nPICTURES OF DEVILS\n\nDifferent representations of Evil through the ages --\nLucifer, Shaitan, Ahriman, Asmodeus -- Satan.\n\"The Temptation of Christ\" from the Master of Schloss\nLichtenstein.  Satan roasting on an enormous grill from\n\"Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry.\"\n\nThe devil as a serpent.  As a semi-humanoid.\nGruenwald's \"Temptation of St. Anthony.\"\nPacher's \"Saint Wolfgang and the Devil.\"\nA miasma of Medieval Monsters.\n\n\nJOHN\n\nPicks his way through the mess.  Like a man possessed he fumbles\nthrough book after book.\n\nThe first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge\nstained glass windows.  John rapidly flips through the Medieval\ntome in front of him - past an illustration of Satan depicted\nas having a FACE on his ASS -- further still -- then stops.\nThis is it.\n\nWe can't see what the illustration is, but we see his REACTION:\n\nHis eyes open wide as saucers.  SLAMS the book closed as if the\nimage would strike blind.  He turns to Mattias as if to say\nsomething -- Decides not to wake the sleeping dog.\n\nJohn wraps the book's chain around his hand and puts one foot\nup against the shelf.  Pulls -- SPANKT!\nThe old chain gives way.\n\nFace set, he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag\nover his shoulder.  Clutches the book to his chest, gently pets\nhis sleeping dog and goes...\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ABBOT'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nJohn strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and\nflattens himself against the wall when the door to the Abbot's \noffice opens suddenly --\n\nBROTHER GRAHAM, The Hysterical Monk, is forcibly led from the \nroom by two burly Monks, taken down the corridor in the other\ndirection.  He is gagged.  A third Burly Monk moves out of the\ndoorway with the Abbot.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tNow find John and have him brought to \n\t\tme immediately.\n\n\t\t\tTHIRD BURLY MONK\n\t\tYes, Father.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tStart in the library.  And keep it quiet. \n\nThe Third Burly Monk nods and moves off.\nThe Abbot watches him leave, then goes back into the room and\ncloses the door.  John stares at the closed door a beat and then\nmakes up his mind.  He turns and runs back down the hallway...\n\n\nINT. GLASS FACTORY - DAY\n\nThe first Monks straggle in for the morning shift.\nKyle is among them.  He lifts his blowing iron from a wall\nmounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two\nother Monks begin to stoke the fire.\n\nJohn enters.\nLooks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find --\n\n\nKYLE\n\nAt the glass furnace.  About to dip his blowing iron into the \nMOLTEN GLASS.  John runs over to him.\nAlmost knocks him over --\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tHey!  Watch it!\n\nHe sees that John is agitated --\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tWhat?  What is it?\n\nThe other monks begin to notice the commotion, start moving in\nfor a look...\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tI -- Abbot.

Take a deep breath -\n\t\tChrist, now I sound like you --\n\nHe sees the book clutched in John's white knuckled hands.\n\n\t\t\tKYLE\n\t\tIs that it, John?  Is it the book --?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\t     (panting)\n\t\tYes.  Devil.\n\nKyle moves closer to him.  Cautiously.\nJohn sees the other monks gathering around --\nClosing in on him - whispering --\n\n\t\t\tWHISPERING MONKS\n\t\tHe's got it...\n\n\t\t\tSECOND WHISPERING MONK\n\t\tLike the Comet Woman...\n\n\t\t\tTHIRD WHISPERING MONK\n\t\tHe found her...\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWHISPERING MONK\n\t\tHe's infected...\n\nJohn sees one of the Monks run out -- undoubtedly going to tell\nthe Abbot.

SHAFT ROOM - DAY\n\nThe cage is still down, the ropes stretching into the abyss.\nJohn runs in.  Moves to the ropes.  Places the book on the floor.\nTightens his scarred hands on the rope -- Mind racing:  \nThe woman will know.  Know what it is.  How to combat it.\nHe PULLS --\n\nThere's no tension against the ropes.\nJohn FALLS back on his ass.\n\nThe ropes WHIZ through the rusty pulley overhead.\nPile on the floor in front of John. \nHe lifts the end of the rope.

Their condition, though, bespeaks the awful\ntruth -\nThe stalls furthest away from us are COBWEBBED.\nSome have had the side walls stripped for fire wood.\nOf the original hundred sinks, maybe twenty are still\nfunctional - A facility created for a much larger number of\ncolonists than are left.\n\nA SKINNY MONK washes his hands.\n\n\nIN THE STALLS\n\nMoving down the row of stalls (chest high, thank you) past a\nfew empty stalls and several grimacing faces, the second to\nlast being The Abbot --\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tCold tonight --\n\n-- continuing to the last, Bald Tribunal Member.\n\n\t\t\tBALD TRIBUNAL MEMBER\n\t\tGets colder every night.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tAnd every day.

Walk, don't pump more carbons\n\t\tinto the air.  The earliest members\n\t\trenounced technology.  Started to collect\n\t\tthe remaining books.

Wooden huts leveled.  Small fires dot the land.\nThe air thick with ash and greasy smoke.\n\nDOZENS OF MONKS swarm across the countryside like ants on a \nmound of spilt sugar.  In one hand a taper or torch held high,\nin the other hand their WEAPON: scythe, pitchfork, hoe,\nwhatever they could get ahold of, seem pitifully out of place.\nSome pound sharpened stakes into the ground, others push carts\ninto rough barricades.\n\nA \"Platoon\" of Monks huddle around trap doors open on the\nwooden \"ground.\"  More ladders.\nThey climb down to --\n\n\nAN UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT\n\nJust beneath the Monastery level of the satellite: an \nUnderground Wheatfield.  Tall golden grass stretches out for\nmiles, swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support\nthe Abbey fifty feet above --\n\nTHE CEILING\n\nA lattice-work of suspended troughs and wooden pipes --\nthe \"plumbing,\" the understructure, of the Monastery.\n\n\nTHE MONKS\n\nDescend the ladders single file.

Spread out through the field in the jaggedly\ndrawn skirmish line.\n\n\nTHE ABBOT\n\nThe Bald Tribunal Monk's dried blood splattered on his cassock,\nstands atop an empty wooden wagon.  From this vantage point he\nwatches\n\n\nTHE MONKS IN THE FIELD\n\nTHRASH and POKE their way forward leaving trails through the\nhigh grass.

Squints through the smoke to see\nwhat has happened to his flock.  Hears the WAILS of defeat\nrising up from the wounded.\n\nThe waving grass is flattened as The Alien moves towards him --\n\nHe can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon.\nHe climbs down.  As his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a\nshadow fall over him.  The little hairs on the back of his neck\nstand up.  He slowly turns...\n\nTHE ALIEN\n\nRises out of the grass in front of the Holy Man.\nSlowly rises up to its height of almost three meters.\nIt's long, smooth head is no longer black and slimy.\n\nIt is golden.\nIt's cable-like arms are sheathed in a straw-like covering.\nIt has adapted to the environment of the wheat field.  Its now\ngrass-like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile.\n\nThe Abbot SCREAMS and RUNS.\n\n\n\t\t\tJOHN O/S\n\t\tIt isn't your fault, you know.\n\n\nINT.

A certain amount of\n\t\tprimitive materials with an atmosphere\n\t\tprocessing system as fragile as a real\n\t\tenvironment but not replenishable.\n\nThe Abbot has a faraway look in his eyes...\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tPoetic justice for the anti-technologists.\n\t\tThe Company's best work.  You know, I used\n\t\tto be a corporate executive.  Middle range\n\t\tV.P.  Then my wife got hit by a speed craft.\n\t\tI chucked it all and joined the order.\n\t\tBe a monk -- see the world.  Being here,\n\t\tbeing chairman of the board...\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tNo, now I understand why I landed here.\n\t\tTo join you happy lunatics in your \n\t\tdeaths.\n\nRipley moves away...\nJohn starts after her.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tRipley, wait --\n\nThe Abbot stands, blocks his way.\n\n\t\t\tABBOT\n\t\tWhere can she go?  She's trapped.\n\t\t       (beat)\n\t\tTrapped inside her own prison.  A prison\n\t\tin her mind.  Inside her mind.

When I saw it in my room it looked\n\t\tthe way it did before -- black, mechanical --\n\t\tunless that was a dream.\n\n\t\t\tANTHONY\n\t\tI don't think it was.  I think that this \n\t\tcreature, if it is the efficient predator\n\t\tthat you say it is, has the ability to\n\t\tadapt to its environment.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tThen the reason they've always looked the\n\t\tsame to me is that I only ever saw them in\n\t\tthe same environment.\n\n\t\t\tANTHONY\n\t\tOr this may be an as yet unseen stage of\n\t\tdevelopment -- you saw a queen -- This\n\t\tcould be like a King ant -- more highly\n\t\tadvanced than the drone, bred for \n\t\tsurvival -?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tHow does this explain the thing that came\n\t\tout of the ewe's chest?  The Abbot's head?\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tMaybe it can deposit different types of\n\t\teggs.  The chest burster is probably\n\t\tdormant until the host eats - The first\n\t\tone I ever saw came out of Kane after he\n\t\tstarted to eat --\n\nAnd in one horrible moment she realizes:\nShe hasn't eaten.  The pain in her chest...\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tNo.\n\nAnthony \"looks\" towards her - does he realize as well?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tNo what?\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tNo, we're not beat yet, Father --\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tBrother --\n\nRipley gets up.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tBrother.

TECHNOLOGY ROOM\n\nJohn stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the \nceiling.  Holds a torch.\nRipley is on the ground with Anthony, his injured leg splayed \nout in front of him.  Skin is palid.\n\n\t\t\tANTHONY\n\t\tDon't have second thoughts.  Blind and\n\t\tcrippled I would only slow you down.\n\t\tGive him time to figure out what you're\n\t\tdoing.  Just leave me my staff.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tOkay.  Good luck.\n\nShe shakes his hand.  He pulls her closer.\nAnthony's empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at Ripley.\n\n\t\t\tANTHONY\n\t\tRipley, I know.  Good luck.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tSit tight.\n\nRipley crosses to John.  Poised at the bottom of the ladder they\nlook up at the trap door on the ceiling.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tHe could be waiting on the other side\n\t\tof that door.  We might not get ten feet\n\t\tbefore he kills the three of us.\n\nHe shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tWe had better go, then.\n\nHe smiles.\nShe smiles back.\nThey move up the ladder.\n\nIt leads up a damp, short shaft, walls GREEN with algae, to\n\n\nAN UNDERGROUND DOCK - NIGHT\n\nThe ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier.  Ripley and John\nclimb out onto the wooden structure.  Before them:\n\nAN UNDERGROUND SEA stretches the width of the entire planet,\nover five miles across.  The floor of the lowest level of the\ntop half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred\nfeet overhead.\n\nThe water sparkles with a golden glow.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tMust be day on the surface of the planet.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tWhere is the light coming from?\n\t\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tMirrors.  Reflect the outside light down\n\t\tgreat shafts -- through lenses.  That's\n\t\twhat they make in the glass factory. \n\t\tLenses.  Look --\n\nShe turns:\n\nA HUGE WATERFALL\n\nLit from within by daylight beaming down from above -- pours\ninto the sea a short distance from them.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tOpens to the surface.  Water flows in\n\t\tand out.  I don't know how.  There's one\n\t\tat either end.  I came down on the other\n\t\tside.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tWhat do we do?\n\nJohn points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at\nthe end of their ropes.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tWe cross.\n\n\nINT. TECHNOLOGY ROOM - DAY\n\nAnthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the\nbottom of one of the windmills.  He winces as he prods his\ntender ankle with the end of his staff.  It SPARKS.\nThe large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head.\nThe wind blows through his hair.\nWHOOSH...WHOOSH...\nFeels good.\n\nAnthony reaches up and waves his hand of his \"eyes.\"\n\n\t\t\tANTHONY\n\t\tNow the seer can only see what God wants\n\t\thim to.  Forty years on a planet of Monks\n\t\tand I've finally found religion.\n\nA floor board CREAKS.\nAnthony strains to hear:\n\n\t\t\tANTHONY\n\t\tJohn?  Ripley?\n\nWHOOSH...WHOOSH...\nHe knows it is not.\n\n\t\t\tANTHONY\n\t\tWell come then.  I haven't got forever.\n\nA shadow falls across his face.  He can feel it.\nHe doesn't have to see what is here.\n\n\nTHE UNDERGROUND OCEAN - DAY INTO NIGHT\n\nThe leather boat makes its way across the sea.\nJohn rows while Ripley holds the torch aloft.\nAs night falls she takes the oars.\n\nThe Ocean is dead calm.  The coracle glides across the glass-\nlike surface.  John flexes his scarred fingers.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tYour hands okay?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tThey'll be fine.  You've been on\n\t\ta boat before.\n\nRipley squints ahead of them.\nThe ocean seems to go on forever.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tI was a warrant officer on a ship --\n\t\tbut I did all my sailing in space.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\t\t\n\t\tFather Anselm used to take me on his\n\t\tcoracle when I was little.\n\nRipley leans forward - scans his face.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tHow old were you when they towed\n\t\tthis satellite out here?\t\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tFive.  The Abbot said they put us to \n\t\tsleep for the thirty years it took\n\t\tto get here.  We've had almost forty\n\t\tmore.  Until now.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tWhat happened to your mother?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tNever had one.  I mean, never knew her.\n\t\tI mean, I did, once.  She left my father\n\t\twhen he joined the movement.  If she\n\t\thadn't I wouldn't be here.  They kept\n\t\tthe other children with the women, on\n\t\tEarth.  That was too long ago now.  Like\n\t\ta dream.\n\nRipley's face grows strangely dark.  She turns to the water.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tDid you know that I was a mother?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tThe girl in the ship with -?\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tNo.  On Earth.  I never mentioned my\n\t\tdaughter.  My daughter.  I have - had\n\t\tI guess, by now - a daughter on Earth.\n\t\tKathy.  She was nine when I signed on to\n\t\tthe Nostromo.  Mommy will be home before\n\t\tyou know it I said.  My shares would have\n\t\tset us up good.  Then I lost sixty years\n\t\tfloating around in a rescue pod.  Thanks\n\t\tto the Alien.  I came home to face a bitter,\n\t\t70 year old woman.  My daughter.  A little\n\t\tgirl who's mother never came home.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tJesus Christ.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tThey said I should have been happy to be\n\t\talive.  Funny, huh?  That's why I went\n\t\tback the second time.  Not so I could\n\t\tfight it -- You can't fight it -- So\n\t\tI could let it kill me.\n\nShe rubs her chest --\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tYou didn't choose to get lost in space.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tThanks for the try Father --\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tBrother.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tBrother, but I'm not looking for absolution.\n\t\tI couldn't be a good mother to my daughter.\n\t\tI couldn't be a good mother to Newt.  But\n\t\tI can be a good mother to you.  I can make\n\t\tsure you survive.\n\nSuddenly they feel rain --\nRipley holds out her hand.\nHer eyes open wide at what she sees.\nJohn takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side:\n\nThe Ocean has become red with BLOOD.\nBlood DRIPS down from the ceiling around them.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tBlood.\n\nJohn looks up.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tFrom the levels above.\n\nHis face goes white.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tHe must have slaughtered all --\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tDon't think about it.  Don't think about\n\t\twhat's up there.  Just row.\n\nAs Ripley takes the torch away from the water, tiny ripples move\nacross the surface.\nShe doesn't notice.\n\n\nA SHAPE\n\nPasses underneath the boat.  A swimming CREATURE.  The Alien.\nThanks to the reflective qualities of water, it appears HUGE.\nDwarfs their coracle.\n\n\nINT.

They go  --\n\n\nUP THE LADDER\n\nA hundred foot climb.  The wood is twisted.\nRungs have been torn away in some places.\nThey pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest\nfoothold.  The temperature rises as they do.\nSweat runs into their eyes.\n\nSoon they can see the floor above them:\nBLACKENED by intense heat.\nThey climb.\n\n\nINT. UNDERGROUND WHEAT FIELDS - NIGHT\n\nRipley and John come up from the level below.\n\n\t\t\tRIPLEY\n\t\tHoly shit.\n\nJohn crosses himself.\n\nAnother testament to the terrible battle with the Alien.\nReduced to just a huge, blackened floor.\nAll the crops burned to ash --\nTheir charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted Monks.\nTheir nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead --\nRipley would puke if she had any food in her body.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\tThere's Andrew.

Air choked with gray smoke and dust\npouring in from the Orbiter's surface through rends in the\nvaulted ceiling.\n\n\nRIPLEY AND JOHN\n\nClimb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off it's \nhinges.  They look at the grim tableau:\n\nMonks impaled on their own pikes.\nTangled together in their own pungy stakes.\nAlien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies.\n\n\nTHE MONASTERY\n\nFlickering fires lit the first few floor windows.\nRipley takes a step towards it --\nReaches back and pulls John...\n\n\nINT.
