CITY SKYLINE - DAY\n\n\n               From an AERIAL VIEW we see the outline of a city.  Any city will \n               do.  Mirrored high rises.  Sprawling apartment complexes.  A \n               lot of people live here...whoever they are.\n \n               As we move closer we discover that this is not a real city at \n               all, but a scale model of one.\n \n               Everything is in miniature -- the buildings, parks, and freeways. \n                GLIDING over this tabletop metropolis, we find that none of \n               the buildings have roofs, allowing us to peak inside.\n \n                                     VARIOUS CLOSE ANGLES\n               We FLOAT through miniature coffee shops, offices, and bedrooms, \n               where toy figures are arranged in tableau of everyday life\n \n               \n               A man dines alone.  A woman walks her dog.  Two kiss on the street. \n                One waits for a bus.\n \n               Over this we HEAR Marianne Faithful's smoky-voiced cover of the \n               standard \"When We're Alone\"\n \n               Just picture a penthouse Way up in the sky, With hinges on chimney \n               For stars to go by, A sweet slice of heaven For just you and \n               I, When we're alone.\n \n               From all of society We'll stay aloof, And live in propriety There \n               on the roof, Two heavenly hermits We'll be in true, When we're \n               alone.\n \n               As the song ends we find a miniature girl who lies on a miniature \n               bed.\n \n                                     CUT TO:\n\n               INT. LORNA'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY\n\n\n               A cramped one-room studio.  Asleep on a futon is a slender girl \n               of nineteen -- LORNA.  Her blood red toenails give the place \n               its only color. An alarm clock rings it's twelve noon.  Lorna \n               uses her foot to turn it off.\n \n                                     LORNA\n               Terri.  Why did you let me sleep so late?\n\n               Lorna looks over to an empty pull-out sofa, its only occupant \n               a skinny kitten.\n \n               LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd)\n\n               Terri?\n\n               (to the cat)\n\n               She must already be at work, huh?\n\n               The cat meows -- very non-committal.\n\n                                     CUT TO:\n\n               INT. LORNA'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n\n               Still in her T-shirt and panties, Lorna opens a can of cat food \n               as the kitten looks on.\n \n                                     LORNA\n               She probably forgot what day it is, right Arthur?  Some friend \n               she turned out to be.  Not like you.  You remember what day it \n               is, don't you?\n \n               (off the cat's blank stare)\n\n               I'm not giving you any food until you tell me.\n\n               Arthur the cat responds with a pitiful meow.  Lorna smiles and \n               sets down the food.\n \n               LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd)\n\n               That's right.  I knew you'd remember.\n\n                                     CUT TO\n                                     OMITTED\n\n               EXT. STREET - DAY\n\n\n               Lorna, dressed casually, walks to the bus stop.  Reading the \n               crossword puzzle in the paper, she doesn't see the curb and trips, \n               spilling her purse.  \n \n               Embarrassed, she gathers her things, then takes a seat next to \n               a Latino Woman.  Lorna smiles and resumes work on the puzzle. \n                \n \n               Stumped by a clue, she turns to the Woman.\n\n                                     LORNA\n               Hmm.  Simon and Garfunkel hit.  Eight letters.  Any thoughts?\n \n               \n               The Woman shrugs and looks off.\n\n               Suddenly, Lorna's phone rings.  She reaches into her purse but \n               it's not there.  Then, she spots it...in the street.  But the \n               moment she goes to get it, a truck roars past and smashes it \n               to smithereens.\n \n               LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd)\n\n               Oh my god.\n\n               But as she scoops up the pieces in her hand a smile creeps across \n               her face.\n \n               LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd)\n\n               No, this is right.  This is exactly right.\n\n                                     CUT TO\n\n               INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n\n\n               A few notches up from a greasy spoon.  Lorna sits at the counter, \n               stirring her coffee.  A WAITRESS approaches.\n \n                                     LORNA\n               Excuse me, whatever happened to that sign, the one that used \n               to hang next to the pies?\n \n               The Waitress looks over her shoulder.\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n               What sign?\n\n                                     LORNA\n               The one that said, \"Today is the first day of the rest of your \n               life.\"\n \n                                     WAITRESS\n               That thing?  We got rid of it.\n\n                                     LORNA\n               Oh.\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n               Have you decided?\n\n               Before Lorna can speak, we hear--\n\n                                     WOMAN\n               She'll have the steak and egg special.\n\n               Lorna turns as TERRI, her roommate, joins her at the counter. \n                A little older than Lorna, Terri is cute but a little dangerous.\n \n               \n                                     TERRI\n               Look at her, she needs protein.  Lots of protein.\n\n                                     LORNA\n               (to the Waitress)\n\n               White toast.  Dry.\n\n               The Waitress leaves.\n\n                                     LORNA\n               Working early today, huh?\n\n                                     TERRI\n               No, I had something important to do...\n\n               Terri opens her bag and pulls out a small, gift-wrapped box.\n \n               \n                                     TERRI\n               ...Miss nineteen.\n\n                                     LORNA\n               I knew you'd remember.\n\n               Terri gives Lorna a kiss on the lips.\n\n                                     TERRI\n               Of course I remembered.  Go on, open it.\n\n                                     LORNA\n               No, no.  I wasn't born until ten minutes before midnight.  And \n               that's when I'll open it.\n \n                                     TERRI\n               You better like it.  I don't want to tell what I had to do to \n               pay for it.\n \n                                     LORNA\n               Ooh.  It must be good.\n\n                                     TERRI\n               So what's the plan, Stan?  Something special today?  Other than \n               splurging on toast.\n \n                                     LORNA\n               Yes.  There is something.\n\n                                     TERRI\n               Good.  Count me in.\n\n                                     LORNA\n               No.  Something big.  Something I've been thinking about for a \n               long time.\n \n               Terri sighs -- she knows exactly where this is going.\n\n                                     LORNA\n               I can't do this forever, Terri.  Look...\n\n               Lorna points to the corner of her eye.\n\n                                     LORNA\n               Crow's feet!  I'm nineteen!  Crow's feet!  I know I keep talking \n               about it, but this time I'm going to do it.  In fact, I did it. \n                This is my last day.\n \n                                     TERRI\n               Okay...\n\n                                     LORNA\n               I called them.  I told them I was out.\n\n                                     TERRI\n               You did not.\n\n                                     LORNA\n               Uh-huh.  I have one more appointment.

I'm calling them back right now.\n\n               Lorna smiles and pours the shattered remnants of her phone on \n               the counter.\n \n                                     LORNA\n               A bus ran over it.  Isn't that perfect?  It's a perfect sign.\n \n               \n               Terri pops a cigarette in her mouth as the Waitress delivers \n               the toast.\n \n                                     WAITRESS\n               (to Terri)\n\n               Can't do that here, Miss.\n\n                                     TERRI\n               I know, I know.

TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n\n               Someone is flipping through a stack of wedding photos.  Festive \n               shots of various couples.  At the altar.  Cutting the cake.  \n               Posing with relatives.\n \n                                     CUT TO\n               We're in --\n\n               A living room, Lorna sits on the couch browsing the wedding photos. \n                She has a quizzical look, as if the photos were of some incomprehensible \n               alien culture. The apartment is cluttered but not dirty.  The \n               decor suggests an occupant of modest means and bohemian taste.\n \n               \n               The occupant is TODD, who ENTERS counting a wad of money.  Late \n               twenties.  Unshaven.  By turns, cocky and nervous.\n \n               He sets the money in front of Lorna.\n\n                                     TODD\n               Seventy-five, right?

About a buck and a quarter.\n\n               (to the couple)\n\n               We just need to reload.\n\n               As they do--\n\n                                     PHIL\n               Since when do you have a hundred and twenty-five dollars to throw \n               away?\n \n                                     TODD\n               I'm sure you spend just as much on porn rentals.\n\n                                     PHIL\n               There's no comparison.

That's a two-day rental.  That means \n               you can get off at least a couple times before it's due.  $125 \n               divided by $2.65 equals approximately 47.  47 X 2 = 94.  I can \n               get off ninety-four times for the same amount you paid to get \n               off once.  Now tell me who gets the better deal.\n \n                                     TODD\n               You're right.

He's still on the front porch.\n \n                                     SARAH\n               He hasn't moved.\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n               Good.  Keep an eye on him.\n\n                                     SARAH\n               Why?\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n               Because I'm going to tell you something he shouldn't hear.  Something \n               no one knows.  Once, I had two lovers.  One was your grandfather. \n                He had prospects, then.  He had a car and we drove everywhere \n               and people would look at us and say, \"Now, there goes a couple.\" \n                He never pushed me.  He told me he respected my virginity.  \n               And I liked that.\n \n               They hear a loud creak.\n\n                                     SARAH\n               Don't worry.  He's not moving.\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n               The other man -- he was a boy, really -- he had no prospects. \n                And he had no car.  And he had no respect...for anything.  He \n               certainly had no respect for my virginity.  And I liked that, \n               too.\n \n               She takes a long, luxurious drag.\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n               But I had to make a choice.  I chose your grandfather.  The day \n               before the wedding, I went to let the other boy down.  Met him \n               by a river where we used to swim.  Well, one thing led to another, \n               and when I returned home that night, I'd left my virginity back \n               in the tall grass by that river.\n \n               Sarah sits on the edge of her chair.\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n               But I did bring something back.  A bite mark.  That sonuvabitch \n               left on my neck, the size of a peach pit.\n \n                                     SARAH\n               Did Pappy see it?\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n               He did and he didn't.  On the wedding night -- in this house \n               -- I managed to squeak by.  It was dark.  We were shy.  He took \n               me in his arms and said, \"I'm glad you waited for me.\"  In other \n               words, I lost my virginity twice in the same week.\n \n               They both laugh.\n\n                                     SARAH\n               No small feat.\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n               It's an accomplishment.  But the next morning, your Pappy saw \n               it.  He demanded an explanation.  And, Sarah, do you know how \n               I got out of that pickle?\n \n                                     SARAH\n               You lied.\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n               Damn right.  I said, \"What, you don't remember giving me this?\" \n               He said, \"No.\"  And I said, \"Well, you were so fired up last \n               night, it's a wonder you can remember anything.\"\n \n               (beat)\n\n               And the beast was tamed.\n\n               Sarah considers the story.\n\n                                     SARAH\n               And you've never been tempted to...\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n               What?

Look at Eric and Sylvia. \n                At the beginning, you couldn't pry them apart.  They were joined \n               at the genitals.  And, then...total burn-out.  A marriage cannot \n               sustain that kind of intensity.  It's good for people to grow \n               bored with each other.  That way, they can meet and fall in love \n               again.\n \n               She snuggles up to him, strokes his back.\n\n                                     GWEN\n               In case you hadn't noticed...I'm trying to seduce you.\n\n                                     JOSH\n               I can feel that.\n\n                                     GWEN\n               You're welcome to reciprocate.\n\n               Josh turns on the light and sits up.\n\n                                     JOSH\n               I can't.\n\n                                     GWEN\n               It's alright.\n\n                                     JOSH\n               To seduce...to be seduced, there needs to be an element of surprise. \n                I know all your moves.

Think \n               of...the vibrant colors of Haiti.\n \n                                     JOANNE\n               Personally, Haiti does nothing for me.  When your father and \n               I were there -- this was before you were born, I almost died \n               from a piece of lettuce, and I wouldn't want anything to remind \n               me of that trip.\n \n               (beat)\n\n               Anyway, quit changing the subject.\n\n               Gwen puts down the swatches.\n\n                                     GWEN\n               Alright.

It can be quite detrimental.\n\n               Gwen begins to pace in exasperation.\n\n                                     JOANNE\n               Alright.  Confront him.  You know where it will get you.  Your \n               whole marriage will unravel, and you'll have nothing.  All the \n               things you take for granted -- month-long vacations in St. Lucia \n               -- they'll disappear.  You'll be a divorced woman in her late \n               30s.  Lonely.\n \n                                     GWEN\n               Why did I invite you over?

In short...trouble.\n \n               She and David made eye contact.  She springs up and advances \n               toward him.\n \n                                     DAVID\n               Why are you here?\n\n                                     ROSALIE\n               You weren't going to return my calls.\n\n                                     DAVID\n               Don't you have more important things to do?

That's the first lesson of hotel management.  Never lose \n               your cool, no matter how annoying the guest is.  Not that I plan \n               to go into hotel management.  I don't have ambitions in that \n               direction.  Or any direction, if I recall you correctly.\n \n               The desk phone rings again.
