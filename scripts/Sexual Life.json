Something \n               no one knows.  Once, I had two lovers.  One was your grandfather. \n                He had prospects, then.  He had a car and we drove everywhere \n               and people would look at us and say, \"Now, there goes a couple.\" \n                He never pushed me.

And he had no respect...for anything.  He \n               certainly had no respect for my virginity.  And I liked that, \n               too.\n<b> \n</b>               She takes a long, luxurious drag.\n\n<b>                                     GRANDMOTHER\n</b>               But I had to make a choice.  I chose your grandfather.  The day \n               before the wedding, I went to let the other boy down.  Met him \n               by a river where we used to swim.  Well, one thing led to another, \n               and when I returned home that night, I'd left my virginity back \n               in the tall grass by that river.\n<b> \n</b>               Sarah sits on the edge of her chair.\n\n<b>                                     GRANDMOTHER\n</b>               But I did bring something back.

On the wedding night -- in this house \n               -- I managed to squeak by.  It was dark.  We were shy.  He took \n               me in his arms and said, \"I'm glad you waited for me.\"  In other \n               words, I lost my virginity twice in the same week.\n<b> \n</b>               They both laugh.\n\n<b>                                     SARAH\n</b>               No small feat.\n\n<b>                                     GRANDMOTHER\n</b>               It's an accomplishment.
