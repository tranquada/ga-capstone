But\r\n\r\nJaden wasn't born to run. Dodging up an alley he slows, turns.\r\n\r\nThe BMW doors open. Three men get out, follow him.\r\n\r\nThe glint and sound of shanks being drawn, ready.\r\n\r\nBreathing hard but measured, Paul turns and faces them: a big\r\nblack guy, an ugly white guy and a tall Chinese guy.\r\n\r\nJaden feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine.\r\n\r\n<b>                            JADEN\r\n</b>                      (between breaths)\r\n               Aight \u00ad am done runnin'.\r\n               Do what ya gotta do.\r\n\r\nThe big black guy comes at him with the shank.

She's losing the battle.\r\n\r\nCaleb suddenly stands, pushing the chair back. The sudden\r\nSOUND of the chair scraping on the floor makes her start.\r\n\r\n<b>                            CALEB\r\n</b>               Oh for fuck's sake.\r\n\r\nHe goes to the medicine cupboard, gets her drugs out.\r\n\r\n90 | P a g e\r\n<b>                            CALEB\r\n</b>               What do ya need?\r\n\r\nHe grabs various drugs and dumps them on the table in front of\r\nher.

He then forces the\r\nglass of water to her lips and makes her take the pills.\r\n\r\nShe gasps for air. He stands over her.\r\n\r\n<b>                            CALEB\r\n</b>               She swallows.

She's shaking and sweating with pain from her\r\nwounded shoulder. He caresses her cheek with his gun.\r\n\r\n<b>                            CALEB\r\n</b>               Babes \u00ad come on.

At the same time she snap PUNCHES his\r\nTHROAT, collapsing his oesophagus completely. In less than a\r\nsecond, Caleb goes from being in charge to being a grovelling,\r\nscreaming piece of crap on the floor at her feet. But now he\r\n\r\n<b>FIRES\r\n</b>\r\nHis gun wildly up at her \u00ad anywhere.
