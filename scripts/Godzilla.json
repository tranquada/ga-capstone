It is almost as through the reptiles of the\n     island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously\n     move about.\n\n     Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a\n     nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky.\n\n     We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the\n     over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the\n     French government held in this tropical region.\n\n     Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One\n     building after the next, accelerating in momentum,\n     culminating in one final EXPLOSION.\n\n     The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like\n     fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands\n     below.\n\n     We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile,\n     unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the\n     lizard's eggs.\n\n     Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to\n     clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the\n     eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash.

In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v.\n     program playing.\n\n     At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an\n     overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy\n     satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match.\n\n     Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled,\n     the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to\n     the console.\n\n     The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly\n     toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a\n     KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the\n     radio/intercom.\n\n<b>                            SKIPPER\n</b>                      (in Japanese)\n               Captain. This is the bridge.

The crew rushes out of their quarters\n     and into the hall. Quickly they race for the upper\n     decks.\n\n\n<b>  5  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - BY KITCHEN                              5\n</b>\n     The ship's elderly COOK pokes his head out of the\n     kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by.\n\n<b>                            COOK\n</b>                      (in Japanese)\n               What's going on?

The crew TUMBLES as the ship SWAYS VIOLENTLY.\n\n     The old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up\n     nervously.\n\n\n<b>  6  INT.

An enormous CRASHING SOUND is\n     HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain\n     and Skipper to the floor.\n\n     Suddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of\n     our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in\n     the Captain's eyes at the sound.\n\n\n<b>  7  INT. HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                           7\n</b>\n     The crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the\n     horrible WAILING SOUND.\n\n     Suddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something\n     enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew\n     members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS.\n\n     Water RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly\n     filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the\n     crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases\n     them.\n\n\n<b>  8  INT.

As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls\n     in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system.\n\n<b>                            CAPTAIN\n</b>                      (in Japanese)\n               Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the\n               lifeboats...\n\n     But before he can say anything more, something WHIPS\n     across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE\n     GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big.\n\n\n<b>  9  EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SAME - NIGHT                              9\n</b>\n     The doors BURST open as the crew and the Cook rush out\n     onto the deck. Again, the ship is HIT, ROCKING it\n     violently.\n\n\n<b>     A TARP\n</b>\n     is ripped away, revealing a life boat. Two more life\n     boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately\n     tries to hoist them up and over the side.\n\n\n<b>     ANGLE - WATER BESIDE THE TANKER\n</b>\n     Something ENORMOUS jolts out of the water towards the\n     ship. Through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what\n     it is, but it SLAMS into the side of the ship, RIPPING\n     INTO IT, pulling down the starboard side as it does.\n     Could that have been a CLAW?\n\n\n<b>     THE CREW\n</b>\n     Are thrown backwards. The lifeboats swing WILDLY,\n     several of them SMASHING INTO BITS as they slam against\n     the ship.\n\n\n<b>     THE CLAW\n</b>\n     Or whatever it is, RIPS INTO THE SIDE AGAIN. This time\n     the entire ship begins to FLIP OVER.\n\n\n<b>     A LIFEBOAT\n</b>\n     Bounces off the deck and slides off the side. Following\n     it is the Cook.\n\n     Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing\n     to keep from falling off. He looks back and SEES\n     something so horrible that he SCREAMS IN TERROR and lets\n     go of the railing.\n\n     The old Cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker\n<b>     FLIPS OVER.\n</b>\n<b>                                             CUT TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>     WINDSHIELD WIPERS\n</b>\n     Clearing at their highest speed, we see through the rain\n     doused windshield, DR.

PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           281\n</b>\n     We FLOAT through the demolished station almost as though\n     we were a moving point of view. We travel thorough the\n     debris of the station into one of the tunnels.\n\n     We travel deeper and deeper into the distance. A shaft\n     of light up ahead. We move closer to it.\n\n     As we get nearer we realize it's one of Godzilla's\n     gigantic EGGS. WE move closer and closer to the solitary\n     egg. Just as we are about to collide with it. <u>CRACK</u>. <u>IT</u>\n     <u>OPENS</u>.\n\n<b>                                             FADE OUT:\n</b>\n\n<b>                              THE END\n</b>\n\n   </pre>\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Godzilla</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Dean Devlin\" title=\"Scripts by Dean Devlin\">Dean Devlin</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Roland Emmerich\" title=\"Scripts by Roland Emmerich\">Roland Emmerich</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Godzilla Script.html#comments\" title=\"Godzilla comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:06:29.415573"}
