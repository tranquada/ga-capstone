Take Sick Boy, for instance, he came off junk at the\n     same time as me, not because he wanted too, you understand, but\n     just to annoy me, just to show me how easily he could do it,\n     thereby downgrading my own struggle. Sneaky fucker, don't you\n     think?

So anyway, it comes to the final ball, the deciding shot\n     of the tournament: I'm on the black and he's sitting in the\n     corner, looking all biscuit-arsed. Then this hard cunt comes in.\n     Obviously fancied himself. Starts looking at me. Right fucking at\n     me. Trying to put off, like, just for kicks. Looking at me as if\n     to say, 'Come ahead, square go.' Well, you know me, I'm no looking\n     for trouble but at the end of the day I'm the cunt with the pool\n     cue and I'm game for a swedge. So I squared up, casual like. So\n     what does the hard cunt do, or so-called hard cunt? Shites it.\n     Puts down his drink, turns around and gets the fuck out of there.\n     And after that, the game was mine.\n\n<b>INT.

That was Begbie's story. Or at least that was\n     Begbie's version of the story. But a couple of days later I got\n     the truth from Tommy. It was one of his major weaknesses: he never\n     told lies, never took drugs, and never cheated on anyone.\n\n<b>INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY\n</b>\nRenton's hand flicks through a long row of videos on the floor while the\nsound of weights being lifted (by Tommy) emanates from nearby.\n\nMost of the videos are feature films or comedy shows, some with titles\nwritten in Tommy's hand, but two catch Renton's attention.\n\nThey are 100 Great Goals and Tommy and Lizzy Vol. 1, the latter a\nhandwritten title.\n\nRenton looks from the video round to Tommy, who is engrossed in lifting\nweights.\n\n<b>                                    TOMMY\n</b>\n     Well, sure it was Wednesday morning, we were in the Volley playing\n     pool, that much is true.\n\n<b>INT.

He's got a hangover\n     so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue, never mind pot the\n     ball. I'm doing my best to lose, trying to humour him, like, but\n     it's not doing any good: every time I touch the ball I pot\n     something, every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up.\n     So he's got the hump, right, but finally I manage to set it up so\n     all he's go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a\n     little pride and maybe not kick my head in, right. So he's on the\n     black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. What does\n     he do? Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him\n     of putting him off by looking at him. Can you believe it? I mean,\n     the poor cunt hasn't even glanced in our direction. He's sitting\n     there quiet as a mouse when Beggars gubs him with the cue. He was\n     going to chib him, I tell you, then I thought he was going to do\n     me. The Beggar is fucking psycho, but he's a mate, you know, so\n     what can you do?\n\nThe events are as follows:\n\nBegbie and Tommy are playing pool.\n\nBegbie, furious, miscues, goes in off, etc.\n\nTommy deliberately misses sitters and tries to look annoyed.\n\nBegbie lines up to play the black. It is unmissable.\n\nAt the bar beyond sits a harmless young Man, wearing the same clothes as the\nHard Man in Begbie's account except that they are now baggy rather than\ntaut. He is clearly not staring at Begbie but drinks a half-pint and eats\nsome crisps.\n\nAs Begbie plays, the Man bites a crisp.\n\nBegbie miscues, rips the cloth and the ball flies off the table.\n\nTommy catches it and looks up to see Begbie assaulting the young Man.\n\nTommy cautiously restrains Begbie and he reaches into his jacket for a\nknife.\n\nBegbie turns and for a moment looks as though he might attack Tommy.\n\n<b>INT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY\n</b>\nTommy puts down his weights.\n\nRenton holds up 100 Great Goals.\n\n<b>                                   RENTON\n</b>\n     Can I borrow this one?\n\n<b>INT. PUB 2.

Just stand back and watch and try not to get\n     involved. Begbie didn't do drugs either, he just did people.

Renton smiles and waits.\n                                    (v.o)\nSooner or later, this sort of thing was bound to happen. One of the\nDetectives runs straight past him, after Spud.\nThe other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch in the stomach.\n\n<b>INT. COURT. DAY\n</b>\nSpud and Renton stand in the dock. Renton's Mother and Father, Sick Boy,\nBegbie, and Spud's Mother (Mrs. Murphy) are among those in the gallery.\nThe Sheriff delivers his sentence.\n<b>                                   SHERIFF\n</b>\n     ...because shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and, despite\n     what you may believe, there is no such entity as victimless crime.\n     Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse\n     them. Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret or\n     remorse. In sentencing you to six months' imprisonment my only\n     worry is that it will not be long before we meet again. Mr Renton,\n     I understand that you have entered into a programme of\n     rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. The\n     suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued\n     cooperation with this programme. Should you stand guilty before me\n     again, I shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence.\n\n<b>                                   RENTON\n</b>\n     Thank you, your honour. With God's help, I'll conquer this\n     affliction.\n\nThe Sheriff and Renton stare at one another for a moment. Renton turns to\nlook at Spud, then back towards the Sheriff, who is now leaving the court.\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     What can you say? Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.\n\n<b>INT. PUB I. DAY\n</b>\nThe pub is crowded.

Behind him stands Spud's mother.\n<b>                                   RENTON\n</b>\nMrs Murphy, I'm sorry about Spud. It's wasn't fair, him going down and not\nme --\n\nTears in her eyes, Mrs Murphy turns and walks away.\nRenton watches her go. Behind him Begbie shouts.\n<b>                                   BEGBIE\n</b>\n     It's no our fault. Your boy went down because he was fucking\n     smack-head and if that's not your fault, I don't know what is.\n\nBegbie turns back to Renton.\n\n     Right. I'll get the drinks in.\n\nHe moves towards the bar.\nRenton slips away.\nRenton walks through the bar towards the toilets, then out of a back door.\n\n<b>EXT. YARD.

Here I was surrounded by\n     my family and my so-called mates and I've never felt so alone,\n     never in all my puff. Since I was on remand they've had me on this\n     programme, the state-sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet doses\n     of methadone a day instead of smack. But it's never enough, and at\n     the moment it's nowhere near enough. I took all three this morning\n     and now I've got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a\n     sweat on my back like a layer of frost. I need to visit the mother\n     superior for one hit, one fucking hit to get us over this long,\n     hard day.\n\nRenton climbs the wall. He stands on top, then dives off the other side,\nexecuting a somersault in mid-air.\n\n<b>INT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. NIGHT\n</b>\nSwanney is cooking up.

Just one. Just one.\n\nMother retreats past Father, who closes the door. The bolts go home again.\nRenton lies back and closes his eyes. His forehead is damp with sweat. He\nbegins to shake. He tosses and turns, becoming wrapped up in a swathe of\nblankets. As he unravels them, he is astonished to find a fully clothed\nBegbie in the bed with him.\n<b>                                   BEGBIE\n</b>\n     Well, this is a good laugh, you fucking useless bastard.

Renton rips away the blankets, but\nBegbie has gone. Renton looks up. Baby Dawn is crawling across the ceiling.\nRenton looks down to see Diane sitting on the end of the bed. Diane sings\n'Temptation' by New Order.\n<b>                                    DIANE\n</b>\n     'Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got red eyes, and I've\n     never met anyone quite like you before.'\n\nRenton looks back up. Dawn continues her slow crawl, leaving behind a thick\nrail of unidentifiable slime. Renton looks down. Sick Boy sits on the end of\nthe bed, holding a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit. Mother stands behind\nhim.\n<b>                                  SICK BOY\n</b>\n     It's a mug's game, Mrs Renton. I'm not saying I was blameless\n     myself, far from it, but there comes a time when you have to turn\n     your back on that nonsense and just say no.\n\nSick Boy takes a bit of his biscuit. Dawn crawls on. She has fangs now. Spud\nsits on the end of the bed, in a caricature prison uniform with arrows on\nit, plus a ball and chain. Dawn has claws as well. Tommy sits on the end of\nthe bed. He looks terrible.\n<b>                                    TOMMY\n</b>\n     Better than sex, Rents, better than sex. The ultimate hit. I'm a\n     fucking adult. I'll find out for myself. Well, I've found out all\n     right.\n\nRenton looks up again just as the baby drops on to his face. He tears her\noff and throws her into a corner. Renton's Mother and Father are washing\nhim. Mother bends down and picks up the large, damp sponge from the corner,\nwhere it landed. She wipes her son's face with it.\n<b>                                   FATHER\n</b>\n     Mark, there's something you need to do.\n\n<b>---------\n</b>\n<b>INT. CONSULTING ROOM.

He produces a set of kitchen\nscales from his bag and weighs the two bags.\n<b>                                   RENTON\n</b>                                    (v.o)\n\n     Straight away he clocked us from what we were: small-time wasters\n     with an accidental big deal.\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>\n     So what do you want for it?\n\n<b>                                   BEGBIE\n</b>\n     Twenty thousand.\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>\n     But it's not worth more than fifteen.\n\n<b>                                   BEGBIE\n</b>\n     Ninteen.\n\nThe man shakes his head and lights a cigarette.\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>\n     Nineteen I can't offer you, I'm sorry.\n\n<b>                                   RENTON\n</b>                                    (v.o)\n\n     This was a real drag to him. He didn't need to negotiate. I mean,\n     what the fuck were we going to do if he didn't buy it? Sell it on\n     the streets. Fuck that.\n\nThe deal is done. The Man hands over the money and waits as it is counted,\nthen leaves with the drugs.\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     We settled on sixteen thousand pounds. He had a lot more in the\n     suitcase, but it was better than nothing. And just for a moment it\n     felt really great, like we were all in it together, like friends,\n     like it meant something. A moment like that, it can touch you deep\n     inside, but it doesn't last long, not like sixteen thousand\n     pounds.\n\n<b>INT. LONDON PUB. DAY\n</b>\nThe pub is crowded with afternoon drinkers.

Spud and Renton look at each other and the bag\nof money.\n\n     Are you game for it?\n\nSpud looks at the bag and around the pub towards the toilet door and Begbie.\nBegbie stands at the bar, awaiting the pints.\n\n     Well?\n\n<b>                                    SPUD\n</b>\n     Are you serious?\n\nRenton looks around.\n<b>                                   RENTON\n</b>\n     I don't know.

I know I would. Where's Franco?\n\nRenton turns to see Begbie making his way through the crowd with the pints\nhelf precariously. As he reaches the table a Man standing with a group of\nfriends accidentally nudges Begbie, causing a pint to spill over him.\n<b>                                   BEGBIE\n</b>\n     For fuck's sake.\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>\n     Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.\n\n<b>                                   BEGBIE\n</b>\n     All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>\n     Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.\n\n<b>                                   BEGBIE\n</b>\n     Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.\n\n<b>                                   RENTON\n</b>\n     Cool down, Franco.

If you can't hold a pint, you shouldn't be in the pub,\n     mate. Now fuck off.\n\nBegie drops the remaining three pints. As the Man looks down to the falling\nglasses, Begbie punches him in the face and knees him in the groin. A fight\nbreaks out between the Man and Begbie. Sick Boy rushes forward to restrain\nBegbie. Renton sits still, not even looking at the fight or what follows.\nHis eyes are fixed on the bag while his hands fiddle. Begbie stabs Spud in\nthe hand.\n<b>                                    SPUD\n</b>\n     Jesus Christ.\n\n<b>                                  SICK BOY\n</b>\n     Good one, Franco.\n\n<b>                                   BEGBIE\n</b>\n     Shut you mouth or you'll be next.\n\n<b>                                    SPUD\n</b>\n     You've stabbed me, man.\n\n<b>                                   BEGBIE\n</b>\n     You were in my way.\n\nBegbie, blade still in hand, addresses the entire pub.\n\n     And anyone in my way gets it, fucking gets it. Everybody hear\n     that? Everybody happy?\n\nNobody says anything. Renton is seated as before, avoiding Begbie's gaze.\nBegbie addresses him.\n\n     Hey, Rent-boy, bring us down a smoke.\n\nRenton does not move.\n<b>                                  SICK BOY\n</b>\n     We'd better go, Franco.\n\n<b>                                    SPUD\n</b>\n     I've got to get to the hospital, man.\n\n<b>                                   BEGBIE\n</b>(to Spud)\n\n     You're not going to and fucking hospital.\n\n(to Sick Boy)\n\n     You're staying there.\n\n(to Renton)\n\n     And you bring me a fucking cigarette.\n\nRenton swivels and stands up.\n\n     And the bag.\n\nRenton lifts the bag and slowly approaches Begbie. Renton, nervous, hand\nshaking, pulls a packet of cigarettes from a pocket and holds it towards\nBegbie. Begbie does not move. Renton holds out the bag. Begbie takes it. Now\nRenton selects a cigarette and hands it over to Begbie. Begbie inhales\ndeeply and then blows the smoke towards Renton\n\n<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY\n</b>\nRenton lies awake, sharing a bed with Sick Boy, who is asleep. Spud and\nBegbie lie on the other, both asleep. Begbie has an arm draped over the bag,\nholding it close. Renton gets up and goes to the small bathroom. He puts the\nlight on above the mirror and looks at himself. He washes his face and\ndrinks a glass of water, then walks back to the bedroom. Renton pulls on his\njacket and shoes. He stands over Begbie, then reaches carefully down to life\nBegbie's arm up. As he does so he realizes that Spud is watching him. They\nsay nothing. Renton takes the bag. Begbie stirs but does not wake.\n\n<b>----------\n</b>\nRenton looks down at Spud for a moment before unzipping the bag. He pulls\nout a small wad of cash, which he hands to Spud. Spud tucks the wad away.\n\n<b>----------\n</b>\nRenton walks to the door and opens it. He nods to Spud, then disappears.\n\n<b>INT. LOCKER.

My so-called mayes. But Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about\n     him, and Sick Boy, well, he'd have done the same to me if only\n     he'd thought of it first, and Spud, well, OK, I felt sorry for\n     Spud -- he never hurt anybody.\n\n<b>INT.
