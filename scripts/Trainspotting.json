STREET. DAY\n\nLegs run along the pavement. They are Mark Renton's.\n\nJust ahead of him is Spud. They are both belting along.\n\nAs they travel, various objects (pens, tapes, CDs, toiletries, ties,\nsunglasses, etc.) either fall or are discarded from inside their jackets.\n\nThey are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical uniforms.\nThe men are fast, but Renton and Spud maintain their lead.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                (voice-over)\n\n     Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family,\n     Choose a fucking big television, Choose washing machines, cars,\n     compact disc players, and electrical tin openers.\n\nSuddenly, as Renton crosses a road, a car skids to a halt, inches from him.\n\nIn a moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver, then at\nSpud, who has continued running, then at the Two Men, who are now closing in\non him.\n\nHe smiles.\n\nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT ROOM. DAY\n\nIn a bare, dingy room, Renton lies on the floor, alone, motionless and\ndrugged.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Choose good health, low cholesterol and dental insurance. Choose\n     fixed-interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose\n     your friends.\n\nEXT. FOOTBALL PITCH. NIGHT\n\nOn a flood lit five-a-side pitch, Renton and his friends are taking on\nanother team at football.\n\nThe opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal), whereas Renton and his\nfriends wear an odd assortment of gear.\n\nThree girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side,\nwatching.\n\nThe boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier.\n\nAs each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their\nname is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (T-Shirt,\nbaseball cap, shorts, trainers). In Begbie's case, his name appears as a\ntatoo on his arm.\n\nSick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it.\n\nBegbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it.\n\nSpud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs.\n\nTommy kicks the ball as hard as he can.\n\nRenton's litany continues over the action:\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Choose leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose a three piece\n     suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY\n     and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on\n     that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game shows,\n     stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at\n     the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing\n     more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you\n     have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life.\n\nRenton is hit straight in the face by the ball. He lies back on the\nastroturf. Voice-over continues.\n\n     But who would I want to do a thing like that?\n\nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY\n\nRenton lies on the floor.\n\nSwanney, Allison and Baby, Sick Boy and Spud are shooting up or preparing to\nshoot up. Sick Boy is talking to Allison as he taps up a vein on her arm.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the\n     reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got\n     heroin?\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better\n     than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative\n     poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course,\n     Thunderball was a notable success.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and\n     all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget -\n\nSpud is shooting up\n\n     is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all,\n     we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid.\n     Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and\n     you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only\n     one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to\n     worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get\n     pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance\n     of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about\n     bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking\n     winds, about human relationships and all the things that really\n     don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every\n     sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster,\n     but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic\n     lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you\n     have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -\n\nINT. PUB I. NIGHT\n\nBegbie, smoking and drinking, speaks to camera.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     No way would I poison my body with that shite, all they fucking\n     chemicals, no fucking way.\n\nINT. PUB I. NIGHT\n\nTommy sits beside Lizzy. He speaks to camera.\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     It's a waste of your life, Rents, poisoning your body with that\n     shite.\n\nINT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT\n\nRenton's father and mother sit at the table eating.\n\nRenton is seated but not eating.\n\n                                   FATHER\n\n     Every chance you've ever had, you've blown it, stuffing your veins\n     with that filth.\n\n--------\n\nINT. ELECTRICAL RETAILERS. DAY\n\nGav wears the corporate jacket.\n\n                                     GAV\n\n     Get off that stuff, Rents and get a job. It's not as bad as it\n     looks. While you're here, you don't fancy buying a cooker, do you?\n\n--------\n\nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY\n\nSick Boy and Spud lie drugged up. Allison and Baby wait while Swanney cooks\nup.\n\nRenton is standing up.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.\n\n                                   SWANNEY\n\n     Are you serious?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.\n\n                                   SWANNEY\n\n     Well, it's up to you.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     I'm going to get it right this time.

He knew all about it. On it, off it, he knew it all. Of\n     course I'd have another shot: after all, I had work to do.\n\nINT. RENTON'S FLAT ROOM. DAY\n\nThe door opens and Renton enters carrying shopping bags. He empties them on\nto a mattress beside three buckets and a television.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Relinquishing junk. Stage One: preparation. For this you will\n     need: one room which you will not leave; one mattress; tomato\n     soup, ten tins of; mushroom soup, eight tins of, for consumption\n     cold; ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of; Magnesia, Milk of, one\n     bottle; paracetamol; mouth wash; vitamins; mineral water;\n     Lucozade; pornography; one bucket for urine, one for feces, and\n     one for vomitus; one television; and one bottle of Valium, which I\n     have already procured, from my mother, who is, in her own domestic\n     and socially acceptable way, also a drug addict.\n\nRenton swallows several Valium tablets. Voice-over continues.\n\n     And now I'm ready. All I need is a final hit to soothe the pain\n     while the Valium takes effect.\n\n--------\n\nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY\n\nSwanney, Sick Boy, Spud and Allison and Baby all lie inert while the\ntelephone rings.\n\n--------\n\nINT. CALL BOX. DAY\n\nRenton curses as he slams down the receiver.

DAY\n\nRenton holds two opium suppositories in the palm of his hand.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     This was typical of Mikey Forrester.\n\n                                 (on screen)\n\n     What the fuck are these?\n\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Under the normal run of things I would have had nothing to do with\n     the cunt, but this was not the normal run of things.\n\n                                    MIKEY\n\n     Opium suppositories.

The heroin from my last hit is\n     fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt. I am no longer\n     constipated.\n\nHe looks around the local amenities. He is in discomfort, clutching his\nabdomen and falling to his knees.\n\nHe notices a betting shop.\n\nINT. BETTING SHOP. DAY\n\nRenton walks through the crowded, smoky betting shop towards a door marked\n'toilet' with a bit of card.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     I fantasize about massive pristine convenience.\n\nHe stumbles through.\n\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Brilliant gold taps, virginal white marble, a seat carved from\n     ebony, a cistern full of Chanel No. 5, and a flunky handing me\n     pieces of raw silk toilet roll. But under the circumstances I'll\n     settle for anywhere.\n\nINT. HORRIBLE TOILET. DAY\n\nThis is the most horrible toilet in Britain.\n\nAlone, Renton makes his way through the horrors to a cubicle.\n\nINT. HORRIBLE TOILET CUBICLE. DAY\n\nRenton locks the door.\n\nHe looks into the bowl and winces with disgust, even in his state.\n\nHe pulls the chain. The chain comes off.\n\nHe drops his trousers, sits on the bowl and closes his eyes.\n\n--------\n\nMONTAGE\n\nA lorry on a building site dumps a load of bricks, B52's shed their load on\nVietnam, the Blue Peter elephant, etc.\n\n--------\n\nINT. CUBICLE. DAY\n\nRenton has his eyes closed. They snap open.\n\nHe looks down between his legs.\n\nHe drops to his knees in front of the bowl and rolls his sleeve up.\n\nWith no more hesitation he plunges his arm into the bowl and trawls for the\nsuppositories.\n\nIt seems to take ages. He cannot find them. He sticks his arm further and\nfurther into the toilet, moving his whole body close. He strains to find it.\n\nHis head is over the bowl now. Gradually he reaches still further until his\nhead is lowered into the bowl, followed by his neck, torso, other arm, and\nfinally his legs, all disappearing.\n\nThe cubicle is empty.\n\nINT. UNDER WATER. DAY\n\nRenton, dressed as before, swims through murky depths until he reaches the\nbottom, where he picks up the suppositories, which glow like luminous\npearls, before heading up towards the surface again.\n\nINT. HORRIBLE TOILET CUBICLE. DAY\n\nThe toilet is empty.\n\nSuddenly Renton appears through the bowl, then his arms as he lifts himself\nout. Still clasping his two suppositories, he walks out of the toilet.\n\nINT. RENTON'S ROOM. DAY\n\nThe mattress, buckets and supplies are laid out as before.\n\nThe door opens and Renton enters, still soaking and dripping.\n\nThe suppositories are in his hand. He holds them up, and they twinkle in the\nlight.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Now. Now I'm ready.\n\nINT. RENTON'S ROOM.

Renton and Sick Boy appear,\ndressed as before but for the addition of cheap sunglasses.\n\nRenton is carrying a battered old cassette player and a carry-out in a\nplastic bag.\n\nSick Boy is carrying a small, tatty suitcase from Oxfam.\n\nThey scan the horizon and give each other the nod.

It was\n     awful: they reminded me so much of myself I could hardly bear to\n     look at them. Take Sick Boy, for instance, he came off junk at the\n     same time as me, not because he wanted too, you understand, but\n     just to annoy me, just to show me how easily he could do it,\n     thereby downgrading my own struggle. Sneaky fucker, don't you\n     think? And when all I wanted to do was lie along and feel sorry\n     for myself, he insisted on telling me once again about his\n     unifying theory of life.\n\nEXT.

DAY\n\nSeen through the telescopic sight of an air rifle that wanders over various\npotential targets (children, pensioners, couples, gardeners, etc.).\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     What do you mean?\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's\n     gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it\n     and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Some of his solo stuff's not bad.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your\n     heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's\n     actually just shite.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     So who else?\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?\n\nEXT.

The sympathy vote.\n\n                                   RENTON\nRight. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Yeah.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     That's your theory?\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Give me the gun.\n\nEXT.

Have you got it in you sights?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant\n     problem.\n\nThe gun fires and the dog yelps, jumps up and bites its owner (the\nSkinhead).\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     For a vegetarian, Rents, you're a fucking evil shot.\n\nEXT.

DAY\n\nA Woman and Two Men (1 and 2) are interviewing Renton. His job application\nform is on the desk in front of them.\n\n                                    MAN 1\n\n     Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh\n     College.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.\n\n                                    MAN 1\n\n     One of Edinburgh's finest schools.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness\n     and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft\n     know of willow on leather --\n\n                                    MAN 1\n\n     I'm an old boy myself, you know?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Oh, really?\n\n                                    MAN 1\n\n     Do you recall the school motto?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Of course, the motto, the motto --\n\n                                    MAN 1\n\n     Strive, hope, believe and conquer.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is,\n     after all, a dark and often hostile world.\n\nRenton looks pious under scrutiny.\n\n                                    MAN 2\n\n     Mr. Renton --\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Yes.\n\n                                    MAN 2\n\n     You seem eminently suited to this post but I wonder if you could\n     explain the gaps in your employment record?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Yes, I can. The truth -- well, the truth is that I've had a\n     long-standing problem with heroin addiction. I've been know to\n     sniff it, smoke it, swallow it, stick it up my arse and inject it\n     into my veins. I've been trying to combat this addiction, but\n     unless you count social security scams and shoplifting, I haven't\n     had a regular job in years. I feel it's important to mention this.\n\nThere is silence.\n\nA paper clip crashes to the floor.\n\n--------\n\nINT. OFFICE. DAY\n\nThe same office. The same team are interviewing Spud.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you\n     wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College\n     instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in\n     this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather\n     than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but\n     what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When?\n     Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one,\n     but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right?\n     That I am.\n\n                                    MAN 1\n\n     Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?\n\n                                    MAN 1\n\n     You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no\n     need for you to get you \"foot in the door\", as you put it.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the\n     governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But\n     obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I\n     don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?\n\n                                    MAN 2\n\n     Mr. Murphy, what attracts you to the leisure industry?\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     In a word, pleasure. My pleasure in other people's leisure.\n\n---------\n\n                                    WOMAN\n\n     What do you see as your main strengths?\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I\n     think they're OK, you know.

Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my\n     mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes\n     over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having\n     a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face,\n     right --\n\n---------\n\n                                    WOMAN\n\n     Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as\n     having any weaknesses?\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me,\n     it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be\n     bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to\n     me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects,\n     a lot of things to think about, for all of us.\n\n                                    MAN 1\n\n     Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to.

OFFICE. DAY\n\nThe Woman and Two Men sit in silence.\n\n--------\n\nINT. PUB 2. NIGHT\n\nIt is Saturday night in a busy, city-centre pub on two levels. On a large\nupper balcony, overlooking the bar and floor downstairs, sit Spud, Gail,\nRenton, Sick Boy, Tommy, Lizzy and Begbie.\n\nBegbie's story overlaps with the subsequent depiction of the incident.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Picture the scene. Wednesday morning in the Volley. Me and Tommy\n     are playing pool. No problems, and I'm playing like Paul fucking\n     Newman by the way. I'm giving the boy here the tanning of a\n     lifetime. So anyway, it comes to the final ball, the deciding shot\n     of the tournament: I'm on the black and he's sitting in the\n     corner, looking all biscuit-arsed. Then this hard cunt comes in.\n     Obviously fancied himself. Starts looking at me. Right fucking at\n     me. Trying to put off, like, just for kicks. Looking at me as if\n     to say, 'Come ahead, square go.' Well, you know me, I'm no looking\n     for trouble but at the end of the day I'm the cunt with the pool\n     cue and I'm game for a swedge. So I squared up, casual like. So\n     what does the hard cunt do, or so-called hard cunt? Shites it.\n     Puts down his drink, turns around and gets the fuck out of there.\n     And after that, the game was mine.\n\nINT. POOL HALL. DAY\n\nThe events in the pool hall, as described by Begbie.\n\nBegbie and Tommy are playing pool.\n\nBegbie is playing like a wizard.\n\nTommy looks defeated.\n\nLining up for the final ball, Begbie is distracted by a large Hard Man\nstanding at the bar staring at him.\n\nBegbie stands up and walks slowly towards the Hard Man.\n\nThey stand, eye to eye, for a moment.\n\nBegbie swings the pool cue slowly into his palm.\n\nThe Hard Man turns and leaves.\n\nBegbie drinks the Hard Man's pint, then pots the black with a brilliant\nshot.\n\nINT. PUB 2. DAY\n\nBegbie, his story complete, finishes his pint. The others continue to stare\nat him, frozen as though expecting something more. Begbie smiles and throws\nthe pint over his head.\n\nFreeze-frame: the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     And that was it. That was Begbie's story. Or at least that was\n     Begbie's version of the story. But a couple of days later I got\n     the truth from Tommy. It was one of his major weaknesses: he never\n     told lies, never took drugs, and never cheated on anyone.\n\nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY\n\nRenton's hand flicks through a long row of videos on the floor while the\nsound of weights being lifted (by Tommy) emanates from nearby.\n\nMost of the videos are feature films or comedy shows, some with titles\nwritten in Tommy's hand, but two catch Renton's attention.\n\nThey are 100 Great Goals and Tommy and Lizzy Vol. 1, the latter a\nhandwritten title.\n\nRenton looks from the video round to Tommy, who is engrossed in lifting\nweights.\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     Well, sure it was Wednesday morning, we were in the Volley playing\n     pool, that much is true.\n\nINT. POOL HALL. DAY\n\nTommy's account over a depiction of his version.\n\n                                    TOMMY\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     But Begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash. He's got a hangover\n     so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue, never mind pot the\n     ball. I'm doing my best to lose, trying to humour him, like, but\n     it's not doing any good: every time I touch the ball I pot\n     something, every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up.\n     So he's got the hump, right, but finally I manage to set it up so\n     all he's go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a\n     little pride and maybe not kick my head in, right. So he's on the\n     black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. What does\n     he do? Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him\n     of putting him off by looking at him. Can you believe it? I mean,\n     the poor cunt hasn't even glanced in our direction. He's sitting\n     there quiet as a mouse when Beggars gubs him with the cue. He was\n     going to chib him, I tell you, then I thought he was going to do\n     me. The Beggar is fucking psycho, but he's a mate, you know, so\n     what can you do?\n\nThe events are as follows:\n\nBegbie and Tommy are playing pool.\n\nBegbie, furious, miscues, goes in off, etc.\n\nTommy deliberately misses sitters and tries to look annoyed.\n\nBegbie lines up to play the black. It is unmissable.\n\nAt the bar beyond sits a harmless young Man, wearing the same clothes as the\nHard Man in Begbie's account except that they are now baggy rather than\ntaut. He is clearly not staring at Begbie but drinks a half-pint and eats\nsome crisps.\n\nAs Begbie plays, the Man bites a crisp.\n\nBegbie miscues, rips the cloth and the ball flies off the table.\n\nTommy catches it and looks up to see Begbie assaulting the young Man.\n\nTommy cautiously restrains Begbie and he reaches into his jacket for a\nknife.\n\nBegbie turns and for a moment looks as though he might attack Tommy.\n\nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. DAY\n\nTommy puts down his weights.\n\nRenton holds up 100 Great Goals.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Can I borrow this one?\n\nINT. PUB 2. NIGHT\n\nThe freeze-frame of the glass in mid-air and Begbie's smiling face.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Yeah, the guy's a psycho, but it's true, he's a mate as well, so\n     what can you do? Just stand back and watch and try not to get\n     involved. Begbie didn't do drugs either, he just did people. That\n     what he got off on: his own sensory addiction.\n\nThe glass falls into the crowd.\n\nScreaming starts. A Woman is bleeding from a wound in her head. The Men\nbeside her turn furiously around to look for the source of the glass.\n\nUp on the balcony, Begbie stands up. The screams and shouting continue\nbelow.\n\nBegbie appears at the bottom of the staircase down from the balcony.\n\nHe strides towards the bleeding Woman and begins shouting.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     All right. Nobody move. The girl got glassed and no cunt leaves\n     here until we find out which cunt did it.\n\nA man stands up from one of the tables.\n\n                                     MAN\n\n     And who the fuck do you think you are?\n\nBegbie kick the Man in the groin. Another moves towards him but is blocked\nby the Men surrounding the girl. Soon the whole mass dissolves into a brutal\nscrum, in which Begbie plays a prominent part.\n\nUp on the balcony, the rest of the gang watch in silence.\n\nINT. RENTON'S FLAT.

They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking\n     toilet.\n\nThey stop at the school gates.\n                                    DIANE\n\n     Calm down.

It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who\n     don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped\n     doing smack.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just\n     saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I\n     could be doing.\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     Such as?\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking,\n     smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?\n\nThey sit in silence.\n\n---------\n\nEXT. STATION. DAY\n\nThe station is in the middle of a moor. There appears to be no habitation\naround. In the distance are some hills.\n\nThe train stands at the station.\n\nAs it pulls away, Renton, Spud, Tommy and Sick Boy are left standing on the\nplatform, looking around.\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Now what?\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     We go for a walk.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     What?\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     A walk.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     But where?\n\nTommy points vaguely across the moor.\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     There.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Are you serious?\n\nThey step across the tracks toward the vast moorland. They stop.\nAll but Tommy sit down on rocks or clumps of heather.\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     Well, what are you waiting for?\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.\n\nA group of three serious Walkers trudge past from the other end of the\nplatform, decked out in regulation Berghaus from head to foot. They tramp\noff towards the wilderness. The boys watch them go.\nSpud opens a can.\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     It's the great outdoors.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     It's fresh air.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but\n     there's no need to take it out on us.\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     I hate being Scottish. We're the lowest of the fucking low, the\n     scum of the earth, the most wretched, servile, miserable, pathetic\n     trash that was ever shat into civilization. Some people hate the\n     English, but I don't. They're just wankers. We, on the other hand,\n     are colonized by wankers. We can't even pick a decent culture to\n     be colonized by. We are ruled by effete arseholes. It's a shite\n     state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make\n     any fucking difference.\n\nThe three serious Walkers are receding into the distance.\nThe boys troop back towards the platform.\n                                    (v.o)\nAt or around this time, we made a healthy, informed, democratic decision to\nget\n\n     back on drugs as soon as possible. It took about twelve hours.\n\nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY\n\nRenton hands over money to Swanney.\nRenton then begins cooking up.\nAlso present and cooking or shooting up are Spud, Swanney, Allison and Baby,\nand Sick Boy.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     It looks easy, this, but it's not.

The embodiment of his superiority to us: beautiful,\n     exotic, highly sexual and yet unavailable to everyone but him.\n     Shite. Let's face it: if she'd shag one punter from Edinburgh,\n     she'd shag the fucking lot of us.\n\nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT.

Renton shows barely a flicker of awareness.\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     Lizzy's gone, Mark, she's gone and fucking dumped me. It was the\n     video tape and that Iggy Pop business and all sorts of other\n     stuff. She told me where to go and no mistake. I said, is there\n     any chance of getting back together, like, but no way, no fucking\n     way.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL WARD SITTING-ROOM. DAY\n\nA few elderly patients sit in armchairs watching daytime television.\nRenton and Spud jump and climb through an open window.

DAY\n\nRenton and Tommy slumped side by side as before.\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     I want to try it, Mark. You're always going on about how it's the\n     ultimate hit and that. Better than sex. Come on, I'm a fucking\n     adult. I want to find out for myself.\n\nRenton huddles up and leans away from Tommy.\nI've got the money.\nTommy produces ten pounds from his pocket.\n\nEXT. STREET.

At\n     least you know where you are with a woman like that. Not much to\n     look at, like, but personality, that's what counts, that's what\n     keeps a relationship going through the years. Like heroin. I mean,\n     heroin's got fucking great personality.\n\nSick Boy opens the heel of a his shoe to reveal a syringe.\n\n---------\n\nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY\n\nSwanney hands over a small bag of heroin in exchange for ten pounds from\nRenton.\n\n---------\n\nINT. FLAT TO BE BURGLED, KITCHEN.

We stole\n     drugs, we stole prescriptions, or bought them, sold them, swapped\n     them, forged them, photocopied them or traded them with cancer\n     victims, alcoholics, old age pensioners, AIDS patients, epileptics\n     and bored housewives. We took morphine, diamorphine, cyclozine,\n     codeine, temazepam, nitrezepam, phenobarbitone, sodium amytal\n     dextropropoxyphene, methadone, nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine,\n     buprenorphine, dextromoramide chlormethiazole. The streets are\n     awash with drugs that you can have for unhappiness and pain, and\n     we took them all. Fuck it, we would have injected Vitamin C if\n     only they'd made it illegal.\n\nThe GP examines Renton's chest and smiles.\nThe GP turns to wash his hands. Renton pulls on his shirt and steals a\nprescription pad off the desk.\n\n---------\n\nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY\n\nRenton lies back with his eyes close.

SWANNEY'S FLAT. DAY\n\nRenton lies as before. Around the room are Swanney, Allison, Tommy, Spud and\nSick Boy.\nAllison begins screaming and wailing.\nSlowly, the others rouse themselves to varying degrees.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really\n     registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for\n     all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though\n     surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely\n     to fuck someone must have.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     What's wrong, Allison?\n\nAllison points toward the bundle of dirty blankets in which her baby is\nwrapped.

In point of fact,\n     nothing at all was going to be just fine. On the contrary,\n     everything was going to be bad. Bad? I mean worse than it already\n     was.\n\nSick Boy stands over the bundle. The baby is dead.\n                                  SICK BOY\nOh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine.\n     Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew.\n     Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something\n     sympathetic, something human.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\nSay something, Mark, say something --\n                                   RENTON\nI'm cooking' up. There is a silence.\nRenton begins scrambling around through the works.\n                                   ALLISON\n\n     Cook one for me, Renton. I need a hit.\n\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     And so she did, I could understand that. To take the pain away. So\n     I cooked up and she got a hit, but only after me. That went\n     without saying.\n\nEXT. STREET. DAY\n\nRenton, Spud and Sick Boy cross the road to approach the shop.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Well, at least we knew who the father was now. It wasn't just the\n     baby that died that day. Something inside Sick Boy was lost and\n     never returned. It seemed he had no theory with which to explain a\n     moment like this.\n\n---------\n\nINT. SHOP. DAY\n\nRenton, Spud and Sick Boy are stuffing their pockets, as seen before.\nRenton's theft is interrupted by Diane's voice.\n                                    DIANE\n\n     Hello there, Mark.\n\nDiane is standing just beside him.\n\n     What are you doing?\n\nRenton is speechless, but a few stolen items fall from inside his jacket\ndown to the floor.\nDiane looks down.\nSpud and Sick Boy start to snigger.\nOne of the Store Detectives become aware of the group. He starts walking\ntowards them.\n\n     You didn't tell me you were a thief.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     Hey, go easy, lady. The boy's got a habit to support.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Opium doesn't just grow on trees, you know.\n\nA few more items fall from Renton's jacket as the store Detective closes in.\nRenton looks at Diane.\n\n---------\n\nEXT.

Our only response was to keep on going and fuck everything. Pile\nmisery upon misery, heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of\nbile, then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all over again.\nKeep on going: getting up, going out, robbing, stealing, fucking people\nover, propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go\nwrong. As seen in the opening scene, Renton is nearly hit by a car that\nscreeches to a halt as he crosses a road.\nHe looks at the driver, at Spud running away and the Store Detectives\napproaching.\n                                    (v.o)\nBecause no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you never have\nenough. No matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over you\nalways need to get up and do it all again. Renton smiles and waits.\n                                    (v.o)\nSooner or later, this sort of thing was bound to happen. One of the\nDetectives runs straight past him, after Spud.\nThe other Detective crashes into Renton with a mighty punch in the stomach.\n\nINT. COURT. DAY\n\nSpud and Renton stand in the dock. Renton's Mother and Father, Sick Boy,\nBegbie, and Spud's Mother (Mrs. Murphy) are among those in the gallery.\nThe Sheriff delivers his sentence.\n                                   SHERIFF\n\n     ...because shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and, despite\n     what you may believe, there is no such entity as victimless crime.\n     Heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse\n     them. Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret or\n     remorse. In sentencing you to six months' imprisonment my only\n     worry is that it will not be long before we meet again. Mr Renton,\n     I understand that you have entered into a programme of\n     rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. The\n     suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued\n     cooperation with this programme. Should you stand guilty before me\n     again, I shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Thank you, your honour. With God's help, I'll conquer this\n     affliction.\n\nThe Sheriff and Renton stare at one another for a moment. Renton turns to\nlook at Spud, then back towards the Sheriff, who is now leaving the court.\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     What can you say?

You're\n     nothing but trouble to me, but I still love you.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     Clean up your act, sunshine. Cut that shite out for ever.\n\n                                   MOTHER\n\n     You listen to Francis, Mark, he's talking sense.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\nFucking right I am. See, inside, you wouldn't last two fucking days.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\nThere's better things that the needle, Rents. Choose life.\n\nHe winks.\n                                   MOTHER\n\nI remember when you were a baby, even when you would never do what you were\ntold.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     But he pulled it off, clever bastard, and he got a result.\n\nThey laugh, then fall silent.\nRenton turns around. Behind him stands Spud's mother.\n                                   RENTON\n\nMrs Murphy, I'm sorry about Spud. It's wasn't fair, him going down and not\nme --\n\nTears in her eyes, Mrs Murphy turns and walks away.\nRenton watches her go. Behind him Begbie shouts.\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     It's no our fault. Your boy went down because he was fucking\n     smack-head and if that's not your fault, I don't know what is.\n\nBegbie turns back to Renton.\n\n     Right. I'll get the drinks in.\n\nHe moves towards the bar.\nRenton slips away.\nRenton walks through the bar towards the toilets, then out of a back door.\n\nEXT. YARD. DAY\n\nRenton emerges into a narrow yard surrounded by a high wall. He looks\naround. The steel back gate is locked.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     I wished I had gone down instead of Spud. Here I was surrounded by\n     my family and my so-called mates and I've never felt so alone,\n     never in all my puff. Since I was on remand they've had me on this\n     programme, the state-sponsored addiction, three sickly sweet doses\n     of methadone a day instead of smack. But it's never enough, and at\n     the moment it's nowhere near enough. I took all three this morning\n     and now I've got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a\n     sweat on my back like a layer of frost. I need to visit the mother\n     superior for one hit, one fucking hit to get us over this long,\n     hard day.\n\nRenton climbs the wall. He stands on top, then dives off the other side,\nexecuting a somersault in mid-air.\n\nINT. SWANNEY'S FLAT. NIGHT\n\nSwanney is cooking up. Renton lands on the floor behind him like a gymnast.\n                                   RENTON\n\n     What's on the menu this evening?\n\n                                   SWANNEY\n\n     Your favourite dish.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Excellent.\n\n                                   SWANNEY\n\n     Your usual table, sir?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Why, thank you.\n\nRenton sits on his usual cushion on the floor.\n                                   SWANNEY\n\n     And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Stick it on my tab.\n\n                                   SWANNEY\n\n     Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and\n     breached a long time ago.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     In that case --\n\nHe produces twenty pounds.\n                                   SWANNEY\n\n     Oh, hard currency, why, sir, that'll do nicely.\n\nHe swipes the notes underneath a UV forgery checker.\n\n     Can't be too careful when we're dealing with your type, can we?\n\nRenton begins his search for a vein.\n\n     Would sir care for a starter? Some garlic bread perhaps?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection\n     of hard drugs, please.\n\n                                   SWANNEY\n\n     As you wish.\n\nHe hands Renton the syringe. Renton inject, then lies back on the dirty,\nred, carpeted floor. He lies completely still. His pupils shrink. His\nbreathing becomes slow, shallow and intermittent. He sinks into the floor\nuntil he is lying in a coffin-shaped and coffin-sized pit, lined by the red\ncarpet. Swanney stands over him.\n                                   SWANNEY\n\n     Perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi?\n\nAn ambulance siren becomes faintly audible.\n\nINT. SWANNEY'S STAIRWELL. NIGHT\n\nThe siren is a little louder. Swanney holds Renton under his arms and drags\nhim backwards down the steps.\n\nEXT. STREET. NIGHT\n\nAs Swanney emerges, still dragging Renton, the siren grows louder and then\nan ambulance speeds by without stopping. Swanney drags Renton across the\npavement and into the open door of a waiting taxi. Swanney then steps out of\nthe taxi's other door, pausing only to tuck a ten-pound note into Renton's\npocket before closing the door.\n\nINT. TAXI. NIGHT\n\nRenton lies on the floor of the taxi, as Swanney left him, rolling slightly\nas the taxi takes a corner.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL/TAXI. NIGHT\n\nThe taxi is stationary. We do not see the driver's face but his hand opens\nthe door and then drags Renton out on to the pavement by his ankles before\ntaking the ten pound note, getting back in the cab and driving away. Renton\nlies on the pavement. Two Porters life him by arms and ankles on to a\ntrolley. We do not see the Porters's faces as they wheel Renton into the\nhospital.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. NIGHT\n\nRenton is wheeled through the department, then into a bay surrounded by a\nwhite nylon curtain.\n\nINT. TROLLEY BAY. NIGHT\n\nThe Porters lift Renton from one trolley on to another, then leave him alone\nin the bay surrounded by the curtain. Renton lies alone. His breathing is\nstill shallow and erratic. Around him is the usual accident and emergency\nparaphernalia: blood pressure machine, oxygen tap, bandages, etc. A Doctor\ncomes in and gives Renton an injection, then leaves.\n                                   DOCTOR\n\n     Wake up. Wake up.\n\nRenton breathes more easily.\n\n---------\n\nThe Two Porters return with another trolley. They lift Renton roughly on to\nit and wheel him away.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. NIGHT\n\nThe Porters wheel Renton along.\n\nINT. WARD. NIGHT\n\nThe Porters lift Renton off the trolley and dump him on the bed. A nurse\nsticks a thermometer in his mouth.\n\nINT. WARD. DAY\n\nRenton's Father and Mother lift Renton, now fully conscious, off the bed and\ndump him in a wheelchair.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. DAY\n\nMother walks ahead. Behind her, Father pushes Renton in the wheelchair.\n\n---------\n\nINT. TAXI. DAY\n\nMother and Father sit on either side of Renton.\n\nINT. RENTON'S BEDROOM. DAY\n\nFather shoves Renton on to the bed, then walks out past Mother, who looks at\nRenton for a moment before closing the door.\n\nINT. OTHER SIDE OF RENTON'S BEDROOM DOOR. DAY\n\nRenton's Father's hand slides three bolts across to lock the door.\n\nINT. RENTON'S BEDROOM. DAY\n\nRenton lies on the bed.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     I don't feel the sickness yet, but it's in the post, that's for\n     sure. I'm in the junky limbo at the moment, too ill to sleep, too\n     tired to stay awake, but the sickness is on its way. Sweat,\n     chills, nausea, pain and craving. Need like nothing else I have\n     ever known will soon take hold of me. It's on the way.\n\nThe door opens. Renton's Mother walks in with a bowl of soup and a piece of\nbread. Father watches from the doorway.\n                                   MOTHER\n\n     We'll help you, son. You'll stay with us until you get better.\n     We'll beat this together.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Maybe I could go back to the clinic.\n\n                                   MOTHER\n\n     No. No clinics, no methadone. That made you worse, you said so\n     yourself. You lied to us, son, your own mother and father.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     At least get us some Tempazepam.\n\n                                   MOTHER\n\n     No, you're worse coming off that than you are with heroin. Nothing\n     at all.\n\n                                   FATHER\n\n     It's a clean break this time.\n\n                                   MOTHER\n\n     You're staying where we can keep an eye on you.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     I do appreciate what you're trying to do, I really do, but I need\n     just one score, to ease myself off it. Just one. Just one.\n\nMother retreats past Father, who closes the door. The bolts go home again.\nRenton lies back and closes his eyes. His forehead is damp with sweat. He\nbegins to shake. He tosses and turns, becoming wrapped up in a swathe of\nblankets. As he unravels them, he is astonished to find a fully clothed\nBegbie in the bed with him.\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     Well, this is a good laugh, you fucking useless bastard. Go on,\n     sweat that shite out of your system, because if I come back and\n     it's still there, I'll fucking kick it out.\n\nBegbie laughs and covers himself up. Renton rips away the blankets, but\nBegbie has gone. Renton looks up. Baby Dawn is crawling across the ceiling.\nRenton looks down to see Diane sitting on the end of the bed. Diane sings\n'Temptation' by New Order.\n                                    DIANE\n\n     'Oh, you've got green eyes, oh, you've got red eyes, and I've\n     never met anyone quite like you before.'\n\nRenton looks back up. Dawn continues her slow crawl, leaving behind a thick\nrail of unidentifiable slime. Renton looks down. Sick Boy sits on the end of\nthe bed, holding a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit. Mother stands behind\nhim.\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     It's a mug's game, Mrs Renton. I'm not saying I was blameless\n     myself, far from it, but there comes a time when you have to turn\n     your back on that nonsense and just say no.\n\nSick Boy takes a bit of his biscuit. Dawn crawls on. She has fangs now. Spud\nsits on the end of the bed, in a caricature prison uniform with arrows on\nit, plus a ball and chain. Dawn has claws as well. Tommy sits on the end of\nthe bed. He looks terrible.\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     Better than sex, Rents, better than sex. The ultimate hit. I'm a\n     fucking adult. I'll find out for myself. Well, I've found out all\n     right.\n\nRenton looks up again just as the baby drops on to his face. He tears her\noff and throws her into a corner. Renton's Mother and Father are washing\nhim. Mother bends down and picks up the large, damp sponge from the corner,\nwhere it landed. She wipes her son's face with it.\n                                   FATHER\n\n     Mark, there's something you need to do.\n\n---------\n\nINT. CONSULTING ROOM. DAY\n\nA Doctor stands up as Renton enters.\n                                   DOCTOR\n\n     Come in. Sit down, please.\n\nThey both sit down.\n\n     Well, you've already spoken to one of our counsellors, but before\n     we go on there're just a few questions I'd like to ask you.\n\n---------\n\nINT. RENTON FAMILY HOME, LIVING-ROOM. DAY\n\nRenton, his mother and Father sit watching television.\n\nINT. STUDIO. DAY\n\nRenton is sitting inside a plastic booth shaped like a giant syringe. The\nDoctor, now dressed as a game-show host, stands in front, with Renton's\nMother and Father beside him.\n                                   DOCTOR\n\n     Question number one: the human immunodeficiency virus is a - what?\n\n                                   FATHER\n\n     Retrovirus?\n\n                                   DOCTOR\n\n     Retrovirus is the correct answer.\n\nFanfare.\n\n     Question number two: HIV binds to which receptor on the host\n     lymphocyte? Which Receptor?\n\nMother and Father confer.\n                                   FATHER\n\n     CD4.\n\n                                   DOCTOR\n\n     CD4 receptor is the correct answer.\n\nFanfare.\n\n     And now, question number three: is he guilty or not guilty?\n\n                                   MOTHER\n\n     He's our son.\n\n                                   DOCTOR\n\n     Is the correct answer.\n\nFanfare.\n\n     And now it's time to 'Take the Test'.\n\nLights flash. Music. A garish Hostess walks on with two envelopes. She holds\nthem out for Mother to choose one.\n\nINT. CONSULTING ROOM. DAY\n\nThe Doctor watches in silence as the Hostess, now dressed as a medical\ntechnician, draws blood from Renton's arm and puts it into a tube. She marks\nthe tube with a pre-printed, numbered label.\n\nINT. STUDIO. DAY\n\nMother opens one of the envelopes. She is speechless with joy. The plastic\nbooth opens up. Lights flash again, etc. Renton steps out.\n\nINT. SOCIAL CLUB. NIGHT\n\nRenton, his Mother and Father sit at a table in the local social club. It is\na Saturday night and the club is busy. Everyone sits in rapt silence. It is\nnot initially clear what is going on. Near the bar a Caller with a\nmicrophone calls over the PA - Two and four,\ntwenty-four...seven...fifteen...clickety-click, sixty-six - And so on, as he\ndraws the numbers from the drum. Everyone studies their cards, except\nRenton, who studies the people instead, his drink untouched. The\nnumber-calling continues until suddenly interrupted by Mother's voice.\n                                   MOTHER\nMark...Mark, you've got a house. House! House! For goodness's sake, Mark.\nThey bustle around him and pass his card to the front.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     It seems, however, that I really am the luckiest guy in the world.\n     Several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic,\n     surrounded by the living dead, but not me -- I'm negative. It's\n     official. And once the pain goes away, that's when the real battle\n     starts. Depression. Boredom. You feel so fucking low, you'll want\n     to fucking top yourself.\n\nHis mother counts a wad of money in front of him.\n\nEXT. HOUSING ESTATE. DAY\n\nOn the door of a flat 'plaguer', 'HIV', and 'junky AIDS scum' are daubed on\nthe walls. The sound of a ball being regularly bounced against a wall can be\nheard.\n\nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT. NIGHT\n\nIt is poorly furnished. Tommy is seated. Renton has the football, which he\nkicks against the wall and catches, then drops and kicks again, and so on.\nThe ball is slightly flat.\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Are you getting out much?\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     No.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Following the game at all?\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     No.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     No. Me Neither.\n\nRenton drops the ball. It rolls to a halt in the corner. He sits down.\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     You take the test?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Aye.\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     Clear?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Aye.\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     That's nice.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     I'm sorry, Tommy.\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     Have you got any gear on you?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     No, I'm clean.\n\n                                    TOMMY\n\n     Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.\n\nRenton produces some of his bingo win. As he hands the notes over, their\neyes and hands meet for a moment. Tommy puts the money away.\n                                    TOMMY\n                                 (continued)\n\n     Thanks, Mark.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     No problem.\n\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite\n     for blood.\n\n---------\n\nINT. HOSPITAL. NIGHT\n\nRenton walks along a corridor and into a ward.\n\nINT. WARD. DAY\n\nSheets cover the lower half of Swanney in bed.

Pa-pah!\n\nRenton sits down and takes it in silence.\n\n     Hit the artery by mistake. Common enough error, or so the quack\n     tells us, as though that's going to make my leg grown back. Still,\n     it could have been worse, it could have been my fucking dick. And\n     I tell you what, in this place you get looked after: clean sheets,\n     regular meals and all the morphine you can eat.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Great.\n\n                                   SWANNEY\n\n     And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get\n     myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women\n     really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a\n     king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your\n     pocket.

Sounds horrible.\n                                   RENTON\nIt wasn't that bad.\n                                  SICK BOY\nDid he -- you know?\n                                   RENTON\nWhat?\n                                  SICK BOY\nYou know.\n                                   RENTON\nNo, he didn't make me touch it.\n                                  SICK BOY\nOh no, don't even mention it.\n                                   RENTON\nHe made me lick it.\n                                  SICK BOY\nGod, you're sick.\n                                   RENTON\n\n     And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and\n     the whole fucking stump fell off.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Cut it out.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     When are you going to visit him?\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Don't know. Maybe Thursday.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him\n     yet?\n\nSick Boy is silent. He stiffens as he avoids Renton's gaze. They shift\nfractionally apart. RENTON tuts.\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The\n     gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up.\n     Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     You're all hear.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what\n     they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the\n     punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not\n     exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it\n     here.' Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get\n     into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts,\n     get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Fuck you.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with\n     losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm\n     getting on with life. What are you doing?\n\n---------\n\nINT. RENTON'S BEDSIT. NIGHT\n\nRenton sits alone on the bed, making a joint and reading a book. There is a\nknock at the door.

RENTON'S BEDSIT. NIGHT\n\nRenton and Diane are lying in the bed. Diane, wearing one of Renton's\nT-shirts, is rolling a mega-joint, quite unaware of the scrutiny of Renton.\n                                    DIANE\n\n     You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music\n     is changing, even drugs are changing.

I mean, the guy's dead anyway.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.\n\n                                    DIANE\n\n     The point is, you've got to find something new.\n\nDiane completes the joint.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     She was right. I had to find something new. There was only one\n     thing for it.\n\nEXT. LONDON. DAY\n\nAs contemporary retake of all those 'Swinging London' montages: Red\nRoutemaster/Trafalgar Square/Big Ben/Royalty/City gents in suits/Chelsea\nladies/fashion victims/Piccadilly Circus at night. Incut with close-ups of\nclassic street names on a street map (all the ones made famous by Monopoly.\n\nINT. ESTATE AGENT'S OFFICE. DAY\n\nThe montage ends on one street, then draws back to reveal the whole map of\nLondon pinned to a wall. A Man holding a telephone walks in front of the\nmape and belches loudly. Revealing more, he is in a scruffy, cramped office\nwith half a dozen occupied desks and twice as many telephones. Seated at the\none nearest to the belching Man is Renton. He is wearing a shirt and tie\nnow. He turns in response to the belch.\n                                     MAN\n\n     Can you take this call?\n\nRenton takes the telephone and reaches for a piece of paper from which he\nreads.\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Hello, yes, certainly. It's a beautifully converted Victorian town\n     house. Ideally located in a quiet road near to local shops and\n     transport.\n\nRenton checks his watch.\n\nEXT. THE AI IN NORTH LONDON. DAY\n\nRenton stands waiting beside this busy London road, outside some very\nunfortunate housing, as the traffic streams past.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Two bedrooms and a kitchen/diner. Fully fitted in excellent\n     decorative order. Lots of storage space. All mod cons. Three\n     hundred and twenty pounds per week.\n\nA couple approach. Renton unlocks the door of a flat and holds the door open\nwhile he ushers them in.\n\nINT. LONDON FLAT. DAY\n\nRenton shows the Couple round a typical London flat nightmare. A poor\nconversion, poor decor, everything small and ill-fitting. The windows rattle\nas the traffic roars by.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     I settled in not too badly and I kept myself to myself. Sometimes,\n     of course, I thought about the guys, but mainly I didn't miss them\n     at all. After all, this was boom town where any fool could make\n     cash from chaos and plenty did. I quite enjoyed the sound of it\n     all. Profit, loss, margins, takeovers, lending, letting,\n     subletting, subdividing, cheating, scamming, fragmenting, breaking\n     away. There was no such thing as society and even if there was, I\n     most certainly had nothing to do with it. For the first time in my\n     adult life I was almost content.\n\nINT. LONDON BEDSIT. NIGHT\n\nRenton finishes eating a pot noodle. He puts it down and picks up a letter.\nHe lies back and reads. Intercut with:\n\nINT. SCHOOLROOM. DAY\n\nA class is in progress. A teacher lectures to a mixed class, but Diane is\nnot listening as she is writing.\n\nEXT. SCHOOL. DAY\n\nDiane is leaving the school when Sick Boy catches up with her. They stop and\nthen she walks away.\n\nEXT. PARK. DAY\n\nDiane walks along a concrete path. As she does so she has to step over Spud,\nwho lies asleep/unconscious beside the remains of a carry out.\n                                    DIANE\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Dear Mark, I'm glad you've found a job and somewhere to live.\n     School is fine at the moment. I'm not pregnant but thanks for\n     asking. Your friend Sick Boy asked me last week if I would like to\n     work for him but I told him where to go. I met Spud, who sends his\n     regards, or at least I think that's what he said. No one has seen\n     Tommy for ages. And finally, Fracis Begbie has been on television\n     a lot this week. --\n\nINT. LONDON BEDSIT.

Take care. Yours with love,\n     Diane.\n\nThere is a buzz at the door. Renton re-examines the letter. There is another\nbuzz.\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Oh no.\n\nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BEDSIT. NIGHT\n\nRenton opens the door to an unseen figure. It is Begbie.\n\nINT. BEDSIT. NIGHT\n\nRenton sits on the bed. Begbie stands over him, pointing a gun at his head.\nHe pulls the trigger. It clicks harmlessly.\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     Armed robbery? With a replica? How can it be armed robbery? It's a\n     fucking scandal.\n\nHe 'fires' the gun a few more times at his own head, then chucks it to the\nfloor.\n\n     And the haul. Look.\n\nHe digs a few rings out of his pocket and throws them to Renton.\n\n     Solid silver, my arse. I took it to a fence -- it's trash, pure\n     trash. There's young couples investing all their hopes in that\n     stuff, and what are they getting?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     It's a scandal, Franco.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm\n     fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.\n\nINT. BEDSIT. DAY\n\nBegbie is sitting on the bed in his underwear, eating cereal while watching\ntelevision.

LONDON BEDSIT. DAY\n\nWhere the first empty packet of cigarettes fell to the floor there is now a\nlarge heap of empty packets: the product of weeks at sixty a day. Another\none lands on the pile. Begbie, still in his underwear, still can in hand,\nsits watchig the racing as before. Behind his, cigarettes and alcohol are\nstacked up like a miniature duty-free warehouse. Renton sits behind him,\nreading a book.\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Can you not go yourself.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     I'm a fugitive from the law.

Other people dance nearby. Begbie gives the thumbs\nup to Renton, who sits on a stool at one side drinking from a bottle of\nbeer. Begbie and the Woman walk away. Renton looks around the club at the\nvarious men and women.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Diane was right. The world is changing, music is changin, drugs\n     are changing, even men and women are changing. One thousand years\n     from now there'll be no guys and no girls, just wankers.

I decided to put them in the worst\n     place in the world.\n\nEXT. BUSY LONDON ROAD. DAY\n\nTraffic floods past as before.\n\nINT. LONDON FLAT.

He switches on a light.\n                                     MAN\n\n     As you can see, it's a beautiful conversion. Two bedrooms,\n     kitchen/diner. Fully fitted. Lots of storage. All mod cons. Three\n     hundred and twenty quid a week.\n\nFrom nowhere, Begbie and Sick Boy spring out at him.\n\n----------\n\nINT. BEDSIT.

I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So\n     there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what\n     happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over\n     the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on\n     smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from\n     cat shit.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     I didn't either. What the fuck is it?\n\nINT. TOMMY'S FLAT.

There he has a stroke. A fucking stroke. Just like\n     that.

Until he sold the telly, of course, then he\n     was just lying there.

One plam tree, a couple of rocks, and a\n     sewage outflow.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy\n     some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out\n     like, and treat her -- properly.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     Shag her senseless.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's\n     all --\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as\n     well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     I got a round already.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     I got the last one.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     It's your round Franco.\n\nBegbie stands up.\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     OK. Same again?\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     The moment you turn your back, we're out that door.\n\nSick Boy walks away towards the toilet.\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     I'll be right after you.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come\n     back --\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     We'll be half-way down the road with the money.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     I'd fucking kill you.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     I guess you would, Franco.\n\nBegbie walks away to the bar. Spud and Renton look at each other and the bag\nof money.\n\n     Are you game for it?\n\nSpud looks at the bag and around the pub towards the toilet door and Begbie.\nBegbie stands at the bar, awaiting the pints.\n\n     Well?\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     Are you serious?\n\nRenton looks around.\n                                   RENTON\n\n     I don't know. What do you think?\n\nSpud says nothing. Suddenly they are interrupted.\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Still here, I see.\n\nSick Boy sits down.\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Why not? I know I would. Where's Franco?\n\nRenton turns to see Begbie making his way through the crowd with the pints\nhelf precariously. As he reaches the table a Man standing with a group of\nfriends accidentally nudges Begbie, causing a pint to spill over him.\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     For fuck's sake.\n\n                                     MAN\n\n     Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.\n\n                                     MAN\n\n     Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.\n\n                                   RENTON\n\n     Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.\n\n                                     MAN\n\n     Fuck you. If you can't hold a pint, you shouldn't be in the pub,\n     mate. Now fuck off.\n\nBegie drops the remaining three pints. As the Man looks down to the falling\nglasses, Begbie punches him in the face and knees him in the groin. A fight\nbreaks out between the Man and Begbie. Sick Boy rushes forward to restrain\nBegbie. Renton sits still, not even looking at the fight or what follows.\nHis eyes are fixed on the bag while his hands fiddle. Begbie stabs Spud in\nthe hand.\n                                    SPUD\n\n     Jesus Christ.\n\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     Good one, Franco.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     Shut you mouth or you'll be next.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     You've stabbed me, man.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n\n     You were in my way.\n\nBegbie, blade still in hand, addresses the entire pub.\n\n     And anyone in my way gets it, fucking gets it. Everybody hear\n     that? Everybody happy?\n\nNobody says anything. Renton is seated as before, avoiding Begbie's gaze.\nBegbie addresses him.\n\n     Hey, Rent-boy, bring us down a smoke.\n\nRenton does not move.\n                                  SICK BOY\n\n     We'd better go, Franco.\n\n                                    SPUD\n\n     I've got to get to the hospital, man.\n\n                                   BEGBIE\n(to Spud)\n\n     You're not going to and fucking hospital.\n\n(to Sick Boy)\n\n     You're staying there.\n\n(to Renton)\n\n     And you bring me a fucking cigarette.\n\nRenton swivels and stands up.\n\n     And the bag.\n\nRenton lifts the bag and slowly approaches Begbie. Renton, nervous, hand\nshaking, pulls a packet of cigarettes from a pocket and holds it towards\nBegbie. Begbie does not move. Renton holds out the bag. Begbie takes it. Now\nRenton selects a cigarette and hands it over to Begbie. Begbie inhales\ndeeply and then blows the smoke towards Renton\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY\n\nRenton lies awake, sharing a bed with Sick Boy, who is asleep. Spud and\nBegbie lie on the other, both asleep. Begbie has an arm draped over the bag,\nholding it close. Renton gets up and goes to the small bathroom. He puts the\nlight on above the mirror and looks at himself. He washes his face and\ndrinks a glass of water, then walks back to the bedroom. Renton pulls on his\njacket and shoes. He stands over Begbie, then reaches carefully down to life\nBegbie's arm up. As he does so he realizes that Spud is watching him. They\nsay nothing. Renton takes the bag. Begbie stirs but does not wake.\n\n----------\n\nRenton looks down at Spud for a moment before unzipping the bag. He pulls\nout a small wad of cash, which he hands to Spud. Spud tucks the wad away.\n\n----------\n\nRenton walks to the door and opens it. He nods to Spud, then disappears.\n\nINT. LOCKER. DAY\n\nEnvelope being removed.\n\nINT. LEFT LUGGAGE. DAY\n\nRenton takes the passport from the envelope.\n\nEXT. STREET. DAY\n\nRenton walks away.\n                                   RENTON\n                                    (v.o)\n\n     Now, I've justified this to myself in all sorts of ways: it wasn't\n     a big deal, just a minor betrayal, or we'd outgrown each other,\n     you know, that sort of thing, but let's face it, I ripped them\n     off. My so-called mayes. But Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about\n     him, and Sick Boy, well, he'd have done the same to me if only\n     he'd thought of it first, and Spud, well, OK, I felt sorry for\n     Spud -- he never hurt anybody.\n\nINT.

I could offer a million answers, all false.\n     The truth is that I'm a bad person, but that's going to change,\n     I'm going to change. This is the last of this sort of thing. I'm\n     cleaning up and I'm moving on, going straight and choosing life.\n     I'm looking forward to it already.
