MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          COLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy,\n          no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at\n          the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off\n          through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks,\n          sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon\n          (the ideograms say--flash--\"Departed\").\n          \n          EXT. CHINATOWN. MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          BILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where\n          a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes\n          through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement.\n          BILLY backs away, gets out of there.\n          \n          INT.

BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into\n          Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the\n          door.

There are still\n          tea things on the counter. A basic life is still possible\n          here. Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here,\n          reading in bed. Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking\n          vulnerable and honest.\n          \n                              BILLY\n                    Thanks.

In\n          the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to\n          make a cup of tea. She perseveres, comes out holding two\n          cups. Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the\n          apartment.\n          \n                                 MADOLYN\n                       Do you want some...\n          \n                                  BILLY\n                       Sugar?   No...\n          \n          She hands him the cup of tea. Strung out, he spills his tea,\n          slightly, unobserved by Madolyn. Madolyn looks over at the\n          bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that\n          she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin..\n          \n                                 MADOLYN\n                       I've always needed my own place.\n          \n          \n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                 104.\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n          \n          \n                              BILLY\n                    Hedging your bets?\n          \n                              MADOLYN\n                    No. I'm not \"hedging my best\"...I\n                    told you when we had\n                    coffee...There's a choice.

THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY\n          \n          POLICE TAPE, plenty of cars. Three corpses being loaded onto\n          ambulances.

I\n                       attempted to subdue Trooper\n                       Barrigan and in the ensuing\n                       struggle was struck several times\n                       with the Walther pistol. I was\n                       able to wrestle the weapon away, at\n                       which time Barrigan drew his own\n                       weapon and took aim at me. I was\n                       able to get off a single shot,\n                       striking Barrigan in the head.

But later...\n          \n          COLIN and MADOLYN are walking through the graves.\n          \n                                 COLIN\n                       What about the baby?\n          \n          She moves away from him without answering. MADOLYN walks out\n          through the cemetery gates. COLIN hesitates.\n          \n          INT. THE STAIRWAY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. EVENING\n          \n          COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine. Living the\n          Beacon Hill dream. He climbs the steps slowly. He nods to a\n          neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who\n          incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN\n          briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit\n          French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and\n          nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and\n          sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows,\n          DIGNAM. Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the\n          right thing to do. COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has\n          plastic hospital boots on his feet.\n          \n                                   COLIN\n                             (accepting it, sort of,\n                              but only in a COLIN way)\n                       OK.\n          \n          DIGNAM fires. Flash groceries fall all over the floor.\n          DIGNAM'S FEET step over COLIN's body, crushing one of a half\n          dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive\n          staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The\n          strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the\n          dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so\n          it's not in the shot when it\n          \n          FREEZES.\n          \n \n\n\n\nDeparted, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0William Monahan\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:23:52.537666"}
