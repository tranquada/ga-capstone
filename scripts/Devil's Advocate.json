What he neglected to\n                 tell you is what this case is\n                 really about. He left out the most\n                 important fact of all: Alex Cullen\n                 was somewhere else when these\n                 murders took place. Now, Alex\n                 Cullen has done a lot of things I\n                 don't like. He's been a terrible\n                 husband to all three of his wives.\n                 He's been a destructive force in\n                 the lives of his step-children.\n                 He's cheated the city. His partners.\n                 His employees. He's paid hundreds of\n                 thousands of dollars in penalties and\n                 fines over the years. I don't like\n                 those things. I don't expect you to\n                 like them. There will be other things\n                 during the course of this trial that\n                 you will hear about and like even\n                 less.
