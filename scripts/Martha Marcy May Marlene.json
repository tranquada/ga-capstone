FARM - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house,\r\n          several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit\r\n          between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated\r\n          valley.\r\n                         \r\n          TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an\r\n          overgrown paddock.\r\n                         \r\n          THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden.\r\n                         \r\n          TWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line.\r\n                         \r\n          TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car.\r\n                         \r\n          FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling\r\n          front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The\r\n          others knit a large blanket.\r\n                         \r\n          TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole.\r\n                         \r\n          A MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading.\r\n                         \r\n          A MAN chops wood.\r\n                         \r\n          A bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          A large room with unfinished wood walls has several\r\n          blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor.\r\n                         \r\n          TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food.\r\n                         \r\n          MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but\r\n          appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered\r\n          face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          The men sit around a table eating dinner.\r\n                         \r\n          One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK.\r\n          Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is\r\n          WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy\r\n          beard.\r\n           2.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The\r\n          men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk\r\n          outside.\r\n                         \r\n          The women file into the dining room, clear the men's\r\n          dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a\r\n          new serving of food.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\r\n                         \r\n          The women sit around the table eating very small portions\r\n          of low protein food. Katie sits at the head of the table.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE - EARLY MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          The kitchen is filled with dishes.\r\n                         \r\n          TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken\r\n          crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the\r\n          crib.\r\n                         \r\n          People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly,\r\n          a figure passes quickly through frame.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up\r\n          the driveway. She carries a small bag.\r\n                         \r\n          Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to\r\n          see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window\r\n          watching.\r\n                         \r\n          Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the\r\n          woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins\r\n          to run.\r\n                         \r\n          SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS.\r\n                         \r\n          Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently\r\n          yells out: \"MARCY MAY\"\r\n                         \r\n          The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind.\r\n          For a moment everything is quiet.\r\n           3.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly, A MAN and TWO WOMEN enter frame and run into\r\n          the woods, chasing after Martha.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          The woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She\r\n          hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man\r\n          and two women are chasing her.\r\n                         \r\n          Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps\r\n          running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls.\r\n                         \r\n          Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see\r\n          the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and\r\n          begin their descent.\r\n                         \r\n          Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her\r\n          pass by.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Martha uses a pay phone at a diner. She dials and waits.\r\n          She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms\r\n          from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Hello.

When\r\n           you're scared it forces you to be\r\n           completely aware of your surroundings and\r\n           the moment you're in. It brings you to\r\n           NOW and that makes you truly present. And\r\n           when you are truly present, that's\r\n           nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is\r\n           pure love.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

LAKE HOUSE DOCK - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Martha stands on the dock. She strips down to her\r\n          underwear and dives in.\r\n           80.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Martha swims out into the lake. She drops under the water\r\n          and out of sight, a burst of bubbles pop up to the\r\n          surface. A few seconds pass by and she is not coming up.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for\r\n          air.\r\n                         \r\n          She looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice\r\n          homes that appear to be empty now. No one else is\r\n          swimming.\r\n                         \r\n          Martha sees a scruffy MAN sitting on a neighboring dock,\r\n          he seems familiar. He is in his mid twenties, his jeans\r\n          are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water. His shirt\r\n          is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette. He\r\n          looks directly at Martha. They make eye contact.\r\n                         \r\n          He finishes his smoke, throws the cigarette in the water,\r\n          puts on his shirt and just sits there.\r\n                         \r\n          Martha swims back to the house.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. TED'S CAR - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Martha sits in the back seat of Ted and Lucy's car. Ted\r\n          drives and Lucy sits up front. They drive up the driveway\r\n          and turn out onto the road. Ted and Lucy talk. Martha \r\n          gets a concerned look on her face. Ted slams on the \r\n          breaks. \r\n                         \r\n                          TED \r\n           Jesus Christ. \r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Are you okay?\r\n                         \r\n                          TED\r\n           Yeah.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Fucking idiot. What was he doing?\r\n                         \r\n          The MAN from the dock walks past the car. They almost hit\r\n          him. As they drive away, Martha turns to see him get into\r\n          the a brown car, start the engine and drive. The car\r\n          drives behind Ted's car.\r\n                         \r\n          Martha looks forward for a long moment, then turns back\r\n          again to see that he is still there.\r\n           81.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          She is frozen with fear, she thinks about saying\r\n          something but then stops herself. Instead she sits in\r\n          silence.\r\n                         \r\n           CUT TO:BLACK\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nMartha Marcy May Marlene\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Sean Durkin\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:30:45.484440"}
