It's a gorgeous\n          picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur\n          Magazine. Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his\n          own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack.\n<b>          \n</b>          6) Kirk is walking home.

Molly turns back to the\n          screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look.\n          The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another\n          man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and\n          stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's\n          gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind\n          Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is\n          oblivious to this exchange.\n<b>          \n</b>          3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has\n          stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up,\n          he is tackled by two cops.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                 COP\n</b>                       Nice try pervert!\n<b>          \n</b>          Molly spins around, horrified.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                 COP (CONT'D)\n</b>                       It's okay ma'am.

He demonstrates a metal\n          detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out\n          of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels\n          he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has\n          come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and\n          carrying an arm-load of toy jets.

Molly kisses her sister on the forehead\n          as she has obviously coached the response. Immediately Patty\n          is behind Kirk, pushing him. Kirk tries to politely decline\n          but now Katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the\n          piano bench.

He reaches for the keys but he is now\n          white as a ghost. Molly watches in suspense, rethinking\n          what she's done. Kirk's hands shake. He moves them around,\n          hunting for a place to begin. The party-goers stare and the\n          room gets quiet. Kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though\n          he might vomit.\n<b>          \n</b>          Molly presses play on a CD player behind the bar. Suddenly,\n          a Cheap Trick song kicks in over the restaurant's sound\n          system. Katie jumps up to dance with her friends.\n<b>          \n</b>          Kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off.    Talon\n          appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              TALON\n</b>                    It's okay Kirk.
