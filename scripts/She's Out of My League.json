KIRK'S APARTMENT\n          \n          It's Friday night and several college parties are raging in\n          the complex. Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the\n          balcony hall toward his door. They pass a few college\n          students on the way; a couple making out, a guy vomiting in a\n          bush. Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of\n          Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf.\n          \n          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT\n          \n          Kirk and Molly enter.

Kirk quietly\n          hides a framed picture of Marnie. Molly passes his computer\n          desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears.\n          Just as she passes it, she bumps the mouse and the computer\n          comes to life, revealing a \"Hot Back-Door Asians\" website.\n          Molly didn't see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the\n          monitor. She turns to see what he's doing. He smiles. She\n          moves on to a rack of DVDs.\n          \n                              MOLLY (CONT'D)\n                    Wow, we have a lot of the same\n                    DVDs.

You\n                    poor thing.\n          \n          Molly brushes his hair back with her hand. Kirk is frozen\n          with fear. Molly leans in. Kirk also leans in but not too\n          far. Molly smiles, realizing that it's up to her to make\n          this official. She takes him by the collar, reels him in and\n          kisses him. They make out for a moment. Kirk is near panic\n          but he does his best to keep it together.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Sorry.

KIRK'S APARTMENT KITCHEN\n          \n          He pours a glass of water. He's about to return when he sees\n          his reflection in the window. The boner under his khakis is\n          not subtle. He looks down and starts to panic.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Um...

He takes a\n          few deep, calming breaths.   He closes the fridge - still at\n          full alert. Kirk searches the kitchen, his panic building.\n          He grabs a Time Magazine. He flips through frantically. He\n          turns to a bikini model in an ad, then a naked aboriginal\n          women, then bare breasts in a breast cancer article.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Oh come on!\n          \n          He is sweating like crazy.\n          \n                              MOLLY (O.S.)\n                    Can I give you a hand?\n          \n                               KIRK\n                    No.   I got it!\n          \n          Kirk finally flips to a picture of Barbara Bush.

KIRK'S APARTMENT\n          \n          As Molly exits, she gives him one last kiss. Two studly male\n          college students are playing foosball on their patio. They\n          stop when one points out the hottie who's kissing Kirk.\n          Molly trots off.\n          \n                                 COLLEGE STUDENT #1\n                    Damn, man!     That chick is fine!\n          \n          Kirk returns a cool \"whassup\" nod to the guys.\n          \n                              COLLEGE STUDENT #2\n                    All right Mr. Kettner!\n          \n                                                                   52.\n          \n          \n          \n                              COLLEGE STUDENT #1\n                    You wanna play some foos!?\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    No thanks fellas.\n          \n          Kirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside.\n          \n          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT\n          \n          He drifts over to his piano and sits down. The joy of what\n          has just happened is plastered on his face. He launches into\n          a furiously happy Jerry Lee Lewis style romp. Soon a\n          neighbor is pounding on the wall. Kirk stops playing.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Sorry, Mrs. Neusbaum!\n          \n          Kirk continues his celebration, dancing around the apartment.\n          He picks up the picture of Marnie and speaks to it.\n          \n                              KIRK (CONT'D)\n                    Ron seems like a swell guy. I love\n                    Pizza Hut. What? Who's this?\n                    Why, this is my girlfriend, Molly.\n                    Oh, don't be that way. Oh, there,\n                    there, now. Here's a tissue.\n          \n          He drops the picture and continues the dance.\n          \n          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan. The smile\n          continues as he drifts off to sleep. Time lapses as Kirk\n          sleeps and the sun comes up. Still smiling, his eyes open\n          like a shot and he reaches for his phone - \"No Missed Calls.\"\n          \n          MONTAGE OVER MUSIC:\n          \n          1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom.   He checks his\n          gut and hairline in the mirror.\n          \n          2) From under his bed, he pulls out a Total Gym still in the\n          box. It is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached\n          along with a card that reads, \"Happy Graduation - Love Mom\n          and Dad.\" He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads\n          the directions. The parts are spread out all over the floor.\n          He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses\n          underneath him. He checks his phone. \"No Missed Calls.\"\n          \n          3) He throws away unhealthy snacks and treats from the\n          cupboards.\n          \n                                                                    53.\n          \n          \n          He opens an untouched box of Healthy Bran and fills a bowl.\n          He watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal\n          and then checks his phone. \"No Missed Calls.\"\n          \n          3) He surfs the web. He reads info on the Hair Club For Men\n          site. He moves to Hot_or_Not.com. The first woman is very\n          pretty. He rates her a seven, the next is also pretty and\n          gets another seven, the next girl is very unattractive. Her\n          score is three. Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten.\n          He checks his phone. He moves on to \"BackDoorAsians.com.\"\n          \n          4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on TV. The lower\n          third reads, \"AMC's 24 Hours of Bond.\" No Missed Calls. The\n          sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls.\n          Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them\n          as he watches. It's dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching\n          Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls. The morning light is\n          creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is\n          still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls.\n          \n          5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk. He is a mess -\n          tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit. He passes the\n          magazine rack and something catches his eye. It's a gorgeous\n          picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur\n          Magazine. Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his\n          own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack.\n          \n          6) Kirk is walking home. Every street sign, billboard and T-\n          shirt he sees reads, \"NO MISSED CALLS.\"\n          \n          MUSIC FADES OUT\n          \n          INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY\n          \n          He stands in the shower sulking. He hears the phone ring in\n          the next room. He jumps out, grabs a small towel and starts\n          to dry off as he runs into the bedroom. He reaches the\n          charger base but the phone is not there. He stands and\n          listens hard to the ringing. He runs into the living room.\n          Angle on the phone. It's hiding under a pillow on the couch.\n          In the background, Kirk rushes around the room flipping up\n          papers and magazines. The phone keeps ringing and Kirk's\n          panic increases until he finally spots the phone. Kirk dives\n          for it, losing his towel in the process.\n          \n                               KIRK\n                    Hello!?

What were\n                    you doing, taking a growler?\n          \n          Kirk notices a woman on the landing outside behind him.   She\n          can see his ass through the window. He covers up.\n          \n                                                                  54.\n          \n          \n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Sorry, Mrs. Nuesbaum.\n          \n          EXT. DOWNTOWN SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY\n          \n          Kirk and Stainer come out of a record store and walk past the\n          shops and restaurants. Kirk holds a stack of flyers for\n          Stainer's band. As they walk, Kirk hands flyers to Stainer\n          who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer.\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    Kirk, it's a simple rule of life.\n                    Look around. People are pretty\n                    evenly matched.\n          \n          Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus\n          stop, sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk.\n          Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty,\n          ugly with ugly, heavy with heavy, fit with fit.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Yeah, but Stainer, she was the one\n                    who asked me out. So, why...\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    That first night, were you\n                    intimidated by her?\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    No, I didn't think I had a chance.\n          \n                             STAINER\n                    Exactly. So you were relaxed and\n                    funny. You were on.\n          \n          Stainer posts several \"Wheel in the Sky\" flyers on a kiosk.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    So I gotta get back to that.\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    That's just it, Kirky. Now that\n                    she's opened the door, you can't\n                    get back to that.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    So I'll have to fake it?\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    Forget it. You can't fake that\n                    far. A broad like her - she'll\n                    smell that horseshit a mile away.\n          \n                                                                  55.\n          \n          \n          \n          Kirk and Stainer enter a...\n          \n          EXT.

Stainer rolls his eyes.\n          \n                              KIRK (CONT'D)\n                    You know what - this is ridiculous.\n                    I'm just going to call her.\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    Fuck you are!

What do\n                    you think she's doing this weekend?\n          \n                                                                   56.\n          \n          \n          \n                              KIRK\n                    So what am I supposed to do?\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    What can you do? She hasn't called\n                    - she's not going to.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    You're probably right.\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    Just count yourself lucky.

A chick like that can\n                    raise the bar too high and then\n                    once she dumps you, nobody else\n                    measures up.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    No, you're right. You know what -\n                    it's good. It's better. I'm\n                    actually relieved. You should have\n                    seen this Talon guy. Man! All\n                    I've been thinking about is having\n                    to be naked in front of her. I\n                    don't need that kind of pressure.\n          \n          The valet pulls a red Ferrari up to the mismatched couple and\n          the nerdy guy opens the door for her. Stainer shakes his\n          head as if to say, \"Was there even a doubt?\"\n          \n          Kirk's phone is sitting on the table - it rings.   Kirk and\n          Stainer can see Molly's name on the caller ID.\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    Don't do it!\n          \n          The phone rings again. Kirk glances down at the phone.\n          Stainer keeps a stern eye on Kirk. RING! Close on Kirk's\n          eyes turning weak. RING! Close on Stainer's threatening\n          eyes. RING! Kirk gives up and looks away. Stainer's eyes\n          calm. Kirk snatches the phone but Stainer grabs Kirk's\n          wrist, pinning it to the table. RING!\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Cut it out!\n          \n                                 STAINER\n                    Let it go!\n          \n                                                                    57.\n          \n          \n          \n          RING! Kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but\n          Stainer's free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around\n          like battling snakes. Kirk presses the button to answer the\n          call and, instead, moves his head down to the phone.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Hello!?... Oh, no problem!

Oh, I wouldn't want to\n                    subject you to them... Okay. If\n                    you want to. I can pick you up...\n          \n          Kirk gives a confident smile and an \"I told you she'd call\"\n          nod.

We scramble in\n                    ten.\n          \n                               TALON\n                    Roger!\n          \n          Talon finishes the long hug. He and the other Blue Angels\n          walk off in formation. Stainer rejoins Kirk.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    That was Talon.\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    Who? The Blue Angel guy?    (cracking\n                    up) Duuuuude!\n          \n          Molly joins them.\n          \n                                                                  75.\n          \n          \n          \n          MONTAGE OVER LOUD CATCHY TUNE:\n          \n          1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd.\n          Kirk's POV as every guy that passes checks her out. Close on\n          Kirk's proud expression. The Blue Angels take flight. Close\n          on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate\n          formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell\n          out \"MOLLY\" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly\n          (worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his\n          insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.)\n          \n          2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes\n          his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the\n          screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look.\n          The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another\n          man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and\n          stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's\n          gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind\n          Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is\n          oblivious to this exchange.\n          \n          3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has\n          stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up,\n          he is tackled by two cops.\n          \n                                 COP\n                       Nice try pervert!\n          \n          Molly spins around, horrified.\n          \n                                 COP (CONT'D)\n                       It's okay ma'am. This fat tub of\n                       shit was following you but we got\n                       him.\n          \n          Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the\n          cop's grasp.\n          \n          4) Kirk, in his TSA uniform, addresses a group of patients at\n          the Children's Cancer Center. He demonstrates a metal\n          detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out\n          of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels\n          he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has\n          come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and\n          carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up\n          and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him.\n          \n          FADE MUSIC\n          \n          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n          \n          Dressed up and wearing party hats, Kirk, Stainer, Devon, Jack\n          and about thirty others stand in a small, classy restaurant.\n          \n                                                                      76.\n          \n          \n          The place is decorated with balloons and streamers.   A huge\n          banner reads, \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATIE!\"\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    Seriously, what's with the banner?\n                    She's blind, right? Seems like\n                    they could have saved a few bucks\n                    there.\n          \n          Patty runs in.\n          \n                              PATTY\n                    Here they come! Everybody hide!\n          \n                              STAINER\n                    Is that really necessary?\n          \n                               KIRK\n                    Stainer!   Just hide.\n          \n          They hide. Molly leads her sister, KATIE, into the\n          restaurant. \"Surprise!\" Molly hugs Katie.\n          \n                              KIRK (CONT'D)\n                        (to Stainer)\n                    Still think she's Al Qaeda?\n          \n          Stainer brushes off the comment.   Molly waves Kirk over.\n          \n                              MOLLY\n                    Katie, I'd like you to meet Kirk.\n          \n                              KATIE\n                    It's so nice to meet you, I've\n                    heard great things.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Oh, thank you. Molly raves about\n                    her big sister non-stop.\n          \n                                KATIE\n                    May I?\n          \n          Katie reaches out to feel Kirk's face. She's a bit perplexed\n          by the result. Two blind teenaged boys approach.\n          \n                              BLIND TEEN\n                    Mrs. McCall?\n          \n                                KATIE\n                    Robert!    Is Jerry with you?\n          \n                              JERRY\n                    Yes, ma'am. Happy Birthday.\n          \n                                                                    77.\n          \n          \n          \n                              KATIE\n                    It's so nice you came. (to Molly)\n                    These are two of my star pupils,\n                    Robert and Jerry. Boys, this is my\n                    sister, Molly.\n          \n                              JERRY\n                    It's nice to meet you.\n          \n          They each feel Molly's face and then start elbowing one\n          another like a couple of horny construction workers.\n          \n          A cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but\n          uncopyrighted birthday song. Katie blows out her candles.\n          \n                              MOLLY\n                    What's your wish, Katie?\n          \n                              KATIE\n                    I wish Kirk would play the piano\n                    for me.\n          \n          Kirk's face drops. Molly kisses her sister on the forehead\n          as she has obviously coached the response. Immediately Patty\n          is behind Kirk, pushing him. Kirk tries to politely decline\n          but now Katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the\n          piano bench. Everyone applauds and cheers for him to play.\n          \n                               KIRK\n                    Really.   I can barely play.\n          \n                              KATIE\n                    Come on, Kirk! For my birthday?\n          \n          Kirk is sweating. He reaches for the keys but he is now\n          white as a ghost. Molly watches in suspense, rethinking\n          what she's done. Kirk's hands shake. He moves them around,\n          hunting for a place to begin. The party-goers stare and the\n          room gets quiet. Kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though\n          he might vomit.\n          \n          Molly presses play on a CD player behind the bar. Suddenly,\n          a Cheap Trick song kicks in over the restaurant's sound\n          system. Katie jumps up to dance with her friends.\n          \n          Kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off.    Talon\n          appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder.\n          \n                              TALON\n                    It's okay Kirk. You'll rock us\n                    next time right chief?\n          \n                                                                    78.\n          \n          \n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Oh, hey Talon. Thanks.\n          \n                              TALON\n                    I'm glad you're here. I feel\n                    terrible about our little\n                    misunderstanding. I don't know\n                    what had me thinking you were a gay\n                    fella. Molly tells me you two have\n                    been seeing each other.\n          \n          Patty passes between them and gives Talon a dirty look.\n          \n                              TALON (CONT'D)\n                    She's got every right. I'd hate me\n                    too. (THEN) I want to congratulate\n                    you, Poncho. You're the better man.\n                    Now, I'll step aside and truly wish\n                    you the best of luck. I wouldn't\n                    wish losing that girl on my worst\n                    foe. But, make no mistake, you blow\n                    it and I'll be waiting in wings.\n                    Love and war, right chief?\n          \n          Talon gives Kirk a respectful military salute. Kirk holds\n          his forced confidence until Talon departs. Once alone,\n          Kirk's poise deflates and he plops down into a chair.\n          \n          The party goes on and Katie opens a small present.\n          \n                              MOLLY\n                    Oh, it's a DVD.\n          \n                              KATIE\n                    Who's this from?\n          \n          Nobody claims it but Jack and Devon look at Stainer.\n          \n                               STAINER\n                    What?   It's closed captioned.\n          \n          Patty and Kirk are sitting and talking at a table that is\n          away from the group. Across the room, Talon raises a glass\n          to them. Patty gives Talon the finger.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    What did he do?\n          \n                              PATTY\n                    Listen, Molly would kill me if she\n                    knew I was telling you this but I'm\n                    trying to do you a favor.\n          \n                                                                     79.\n          \n          \n          \n                               KIRK\n                    Okay.\n          \n                              PATTY\n                    Molly has this physical...um issue.\n                    You know, kind of like a birth\n                    defect?\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    Oh, my God.\n          \n                              PATTY\n                    It's not a big deal but she's\n                    really self-conscious about it.\n                    Talon and some other guys she's\n                    dated have been weirded out and\n                    made her feel like a freak.\n          \n                              KIRK\n                    What is it?\n          \n                              PATTY\n                    It's better if she tells you but if\n                    you can't deal with it, just get\n                    lost now and don't put her through\n                    that heartbreak again.\n          \n                               KIRK\n                    No, no.

(she\n                    stands) Cake?\n          \n          Patty heads off to get some cake. Kirk sits, considering\n          this information. He looks at Molly. She is wearing a small\n          black dress. She looks perfect in every way. Kirk crosses\n          the room and walks out to the...\n          \n          EXT. RESTAURANT FRONT SIDEWALK\n          \n          He throws his hands up in the air and does a happy dance\n          similar to the one he had done after their first kiss.\n          \n          Stainer, Devon and Jack are around the corner as Stainer and\n          Jack are smoking a bowl. Devon hears Kirk's celebration and\n          peers around the corner. He waves the others over. The guys\n          come around the front to join Kirk.\n          \n                               STAINER\n                    Dude?\n          \n                                                                    80.\n          \n          \n          \n                              KIRK\n                        (playfully chipper)\n                    My friends!

He\n          lights a candle. He is now in a normal state of nervousness\n          but nothing like he had been before. He pulls out a stick of\n          gum. He chews it quickly and spits it out.\n          \n          Kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this.   He\n          decides to sit.\n          \n          Molly opens the door.
