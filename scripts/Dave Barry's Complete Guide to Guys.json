This is\r\n          a best case scenario here, something\r\n          both these guys can appreciate.\r\n          Plus they've opened up the middle\r\n          for the third guy --\r\n          The THIRD GUY comes in.

You want to be able to do\r\n          more with someone than just read\r\n          book reviews together - which is\r\n          something a guy would never do anyway.\r\n          (then as the others\r\n\r\n                         LISTEN CLOSER)\r\n          But what a guy will do? Is at eleven\r\n          o'clock at night he'll show up at\r\n          your door and bring cheese steaks.\r\n          And he doesn't care that you look\r\n          all rumply and dreadful from not\r\n          expecting anyone. He might not even\r\n          remember that you're a vegetarian\r\n          and don't eat cheese steaks -- but\r\n          that doesn't really matter either.\r\n          Because the point is he wanted one,\r\n          and he can't come out and say it but\r\n          he didn't want to eat it alone.\r\n\r\n                         MIA\r\n          And you're the person he thought of.\r\n\r\n                         LILA\r\n          (off her look; nods)\r\n          I can't tell you what that feels\r\n          like, when they do that.\r\n          (a beat; and then)\r\n          I swear, if they knew how adorable\r\n          they are sometimes, they'd be\r\n          dangerous. I mean -- more dangerous.\r\n          The other Girls think about that.
