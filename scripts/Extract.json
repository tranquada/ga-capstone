REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY\n</b>\n          An idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in\n          front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with\n          flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We\n          see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a\n          company of about 50 - 75 employees.\n\n<b>          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY\n</b>\n          We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line\n          production.

The\n          camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short,\n          beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and\n          mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he\n          says sound as macho and important as possible.\n\n<b>                         STEP\n</b>          You get this job through Manpower?\n\n<b>                         HECTOR\n</b>          Yeah.\n\n<b>                         STEP\n</b>          I started here with Manpower too.\n          Started out on the line just like\n          you.\n\n<b>                         (DEAD-SERIOUS)\n</b>           Only I did better... 40 crates a\n          day. \n          Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about.\n          STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only\n          polite reaction would be one of total amazement.\n\n<b>                         STEP (CONT'D)\n</b>          I'm the best sorter in here.\n          That's why they made me full time\n          with benefits.

He\n          flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each\n          application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping\n          each box when he's done, generally making the activity look\n          like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step\n          and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets.\n\n<b>                         RORY\n</b>          (hands them each a flier)\n          My band's playing this Friday, come\n          check us out.\n          Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties\n          clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, \"God's\n          Cock\". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much\n          English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the\n          flier.\n          AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets,\n          sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-\n          wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack,\n          and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear-\n          shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always\n          shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a\n          clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her\n          head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her\n          forties.\n\n<b>                         MARY\n</b>          You see that... That new guy.\n          He's holding us up.

He\n          stays in the car, checking it out.\n          Scanning Joel's POV, we see the band, Godscock, playing in\n          the backyard, with Rory on bass. They are set up on the\n          patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house. Most of the\n          people at the party are crowded around the keg, which is on\n          the other side of the backyard, ignoring the band. The band\n          sounds awful -- loud as hell, unmusical, uninspired. The\n          lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style, but even\n          more loud and overly dramatic. Rory acts all intense, in\n          stark contrast to the non-intensity of the music.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          55.\n</b>          They all have that baggy-shorts tattooed mid-nineties look.\n          It's downright pathetic.\n          There's one drunk guy off to the side banging his head,\n          playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes.\n          Joel spots Cindy over by the keg, drinking, mingling. He\n          watches her for a beat, then shakes his head and drives away.\n\n<b>                          CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>          INT.

He may be a\n          stupid, dull-witted moron, but he\n          can get any girl he wants. Me, I\n          had to work for it. I had to work\n          hard, get a career going, take\n          Suzie out a bunch of times, marry\n          her. But not Brad. He gets to\n          waltz into my house and have sex\n          with my wife just like that. Oh,\n          and by the way?
