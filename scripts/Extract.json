REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY\n\n          An idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in\n          front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with\n          flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We\n          see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a\n          company of about 50 - 75 employees.\n\n          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY\n\n          We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line\n          production. It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge\n          vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring\n          products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc. It has a\n          high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big\n          windows overlooking this manufacturing area.\n          We PAN up to the main office.\n\n          INSIDE THE OFFICE\n          JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the\n          phone with his friend DEAN.\n          DEAN (v.o.)\n          You should come by tonight. Half\n          price well drinks while the game's\n          going.\n\n                         JOEL\n          You always give me free drinks\n          though.\n          DEAN (v.o.)\n          Oh yeah. Well come by anyway.\n\n                         JOEL\n          Yeah?... Might as well. No action\n          going on at my house, that's for\n          sure.\n          DEAN (v.o.)\n          Really? The wife out of town?\n\n                         JOEL\n          No... I just haven't been laid in\n          a month.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          2.\n          DEAN (v.o.)\n          You guys having problems or\n          something?\n\n                         JOEL\n          No. This is pretty much normal\n          these days...\n          As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the\n          manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down\n          through various stages of assembly line production, then\n          follows several bottles of orange extract moving past\n          HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The\n          camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short,\n          beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and\n          mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he\n          says sound as macho and important as possible.\n\n                         STEP\n          You get this job through Manpower?\n\n                         HECTOR\n          Yeah.\n\n                         STEP\n          I started here with Manpower too.\n          Started out on the line just like\n          you.\n\n                         (DEAD-SERIOUS)\n           Only I did better... 40 crates a\n          day. \n          Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about.\n          STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only\n          polite reaction would be one of total amazement.\n\n                         STEP (CONT'D)\n          I'm the best sorter in here.\n          That's why they made me full time\n          with benefits. I'll probably be\n          floor manager this year.\n          A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with\n          too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail,\n          lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of\n          pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought\n          to be out of style by now.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          3.\n          Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun. He\n          flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each\n          application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping\n          each box when he's done, generally making the activity look\n          like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step\n          and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets.\n\n                         RORY\n          (hands them each a flier)\n          My band's playing this Friday, come\n          check us out.\n          Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties\n          clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, \"God's\n          Cock\". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much\n          English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the\n          flier.\n          AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets,\n          sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-\n          wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack,\n          and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear-\n          shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always\n          shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a\n          clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her\n          head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her\n          forties.\n\n                         MARY\n          You see that... That new guy.\n          He's holding us up. It's not my\n          job to tell them to hold the line\n          either.\n\n                         GABRIELLA\n          And then Joel's gonna come yell at\n          us, cuz he's not doing his job.\n\n                         MARY\n          (folds her arms, fed up)\n          I'm just gonna sit here.\n\n                         GABRIELLA\n          You're not gonna shut it off?\n\n                         MARY\n          I'm not gonna hold the line. If\n          they're not gonna do their job, why\n          should I do mine.\n          Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause\n          the conveyor belt.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          4.\n\n          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Joel is still on the phone with Dean.\n\n                         JOEL\n          If I don't get home before about\n          8:00, she puts on the sweatpants\n          and once the sweatpants are on,\n          it's over -- I get nothing.\n          (notices something down\n\n                         BELOW)\n          Shit. I'm gonna have to call you\n          back.\n          Joel hangs up and runs downstairs.\n\n          ON THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR:\n          Boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line.\n          Step sees this, runs to shut off the line, yelling at Mary.\n\n                         STEP\n          What are you doing?!\n\n                         MARY\n          What are YOU doing?!\n          (pointing at Hector)\n          What is he doing?\n          A YELLING/BICKERING MATCH breaks out between Mary, Step, Rory\n          and Gabriella. Joel runs over, shuts off the conveyor belt.\n\n                         JOEL (CONT'D)\n          All right. Now, what's the\n          problem?\n          They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING.\n\n                         JOEL (CONT'D)\n          Okay! Okay, everyone settle down.\n          Now Mary. Hector here is new okay?\n          It's gonna take him a couple of\n          days, maybe his English isn't so\n          good. You gotta be patient.\n\n                         STEP\n          That's what I was tryin' to say.\n\n                         JOEL\n          And Step, if you wanna be Floor\n          Manager, this is the kind of thing\n          you're going to have to deal with.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          5.\n\n                         STEP\n\n                         (KISS-ASS)\n          Exactly.\n\n                         JOEL\n          Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's\n          get this cleaned up, and get\n          rolling again. We can't afford to\n          fall behind today.\n          Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts\n          right back up with Gabriella.\n\n                         MARY\n          You see that? We always get the\n          blame.\n\n          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER\n\n          Joel sits in his swivel chair, looking down at the production\n          floor, shaking his head. BRIAN, Joel's second in command,\n          walks in. He's a little older than Joel, neatly trimmed\n          beard, aviator glasses, and a bit of a gut. He wears a\n          Reynold's Extract golf shirt and Khaki pants. He walks over\n          to the window, joins Joel, looking down at the employees.\n\n                         JOEL \n          Jesus... They're like a bunch of \n          goddamned children. \n\n                         BRIAN\n          Tell me about it. Sorry I missed\n          the drama; I was showing boy-genius\n          down there how to back up a\n          forklift.\n          ANGLE ON Rory, driving the forklift, handing out a flier as \n          he passes someone. \n\n                         BRIAN (CONT'D)\n          That's his whole career, driving\n          that damn forklift.

Just like that. I told her\n          maybe if she figures out how to\n          fill out the time sheets correctly\n          I'll give her more personal days...\n          (Off Joel's look)\n          Don't worry, she will never fill\n          out her time sheets correctly.\n          Joel looks down at the production floor. Joel's POV: \n           ANGLE ON: Mary and Step bickering. Step walks off. Mary and \n           Gabrielle shaking their heads and yapping like a couple of \n          old hens. \n\n          JOEL (O.S.)\n          Look at 'em... I am so sick of baby\n          sitting these assholes.\n          (looks at his watch)\n          I better get going...\n          Joel leaves in a hurry, mumbling something about \n          \"sweatpants.\" \n\n          INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n          Joel drives home, in a hurry, checking his dashboard clock.\n          It's an upscale neighborhood of McMansions in a town like\n          Lincoln Nebraska. He turns a corner, slows down suddenly\n          when he sees something.\n\n                         JOEL'S POV:\n          NATHAN, a middle-aged, overweight, annoying guy is going out\n          to the street to get his mail.\n\n                         JOEL\n          (to himself, praying)\n          Please go back inside...

No problem...\n          Oh wait a second. I don't think I\n          have his number.\n\n                         JOEL\n          What? I thought you called him\n          last night.\n\n                         DEAN\n          Yeah, but I got his number from\n          Vic.\n\n                         JOEL\n          Well get it from him again.\n\n                         DEAN\n          Vic doesn't have a phone right now.\n\n                         JOEL\n          Shit!

It's like Lopez, or Sanchez\n          or something.\n          Joel looks at his watch.

What do you mean \"easy\"?\n\n          BRAD (V.0.)\n          Oh, I don't mean easy like she was\n          easy -- like she was a slut or\n          anything.

Well, she let me in, so I\n          went back like I was cleaning the\n          pool...\n\n          EXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY\n\n           As Brad's dopey narration continues, we see the story he's\n           telling. It plays out like a bad soft-porn flick on Cinemax.\n           We see Brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag.\n\n           BRAD (V.0.)\n           .I don't know anything about pool\n           cleaning, so I was just faking it.\n           She was in her bathing suit...\n          Suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs.\n\n           BRAD (V.0.)\n          .So I struck up a conversation...\n\n                         BRAD\n          This is a really nice house.\n\n                         SUZIE\n          Thanks.\n\n                         BRAD\n          Is it your Dad's house?\n\n                         SUZIE\n          No. It's ours.\n\n                         BRAD\n          Wow, you look so young to be living\n          in a house this nice.\n\n                         SUZIE\n          Oh, thanks.\n          Beat.\n\n                         BRAD\n          Do you have any sunscreen?

See, 'cuz that way,\n          once she gave me some, I could ask\n          her if she wanted some too, and rub\n          some on her back, instead of just\n          coming out and asking her to rub\n          some on her. Pretty smooth huh?...\n          We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie's back as she lies face-\n          down on the chair.\n\n          BRAD (V.0.)\n          Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on\n          her, the rest was easy...\n          We see Brad's hands working their way down Suzie's back.\n          Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel\n          interrupts, YANKING US OUT OF THE FLASHBACK.\n\n                         JOEL\n          Okay that's enough!

Hey, like I say, if\n          you know of anyone else, or if you\n          ever need me to do it again--\n\n                         JOEL\n          NO! No. Look, I gotta go. Bye.\n          Joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair, in a\n          state of shock.\n\n                         JOEL\n          (quietly, to himself)\n          Holy shit.\n\n          INT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n          Joel drives home from work. He still looks freaked out.

Joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his\n          driveway.\n\n                         NATHAN\n          How's it goin'?\n\n                         JOEL\n          Oh, I'm kind of busy actually.\n\n                         NATHAN\n          Yeah. Well I won't keep you. I\n          just wanted to let you know, I got\n          those tickets to that dinner we\n          talked about on the 7th. I think I\n          told you they were forty dollars a\n          piece, but it turns out it's a tad\n          more this year -- fifty-five -- so\n          if I could go ahead and just get a\n          check from you guys...\n\n                         JOEL\n          Look, ah, we can't go.

Suzie has a glow about\n          her, looking better than ever -- relaxed, satisfied, etc.\n          Joel's has a quietly pissed off demeanor.

Ah, one\n          more thing I just need to ask you:\n          We had a little incident up in\n          Templeton a couple weeks back where\n          someone stole an expensive guitar\n          from a music store?

Like I say, it's 55\n           dollars a plate, so that'd be 110\n           total. There's no tax...\n          Nathan leans up to scratch his back. Joel seizes the\n           opportunity and pulls away, burning a little rubber.\n\n          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER\n\n          Joel is on his cell phone, yelling in hushed tones at Brad.\n          He has the door shut so Suzie won't hear him.\n\n                         JOEL\n          What the hell were you doing at my\n          house today?!\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          54.\n\n          BRAD (V.0.)\n          Oh, umm... nothing.\n\n                         JOEL\n          Bullshit!\n\n          BRAD (V.0.)\n          Look, don't worry about it bro'. I\n          won't charge you for this one.\n\n                         JOEL\n          Won't charge me for...? You had\n          sex with my wife again?!\n\n          BRAD (V.0.)\n          Well, I figured we already did it\n          once, so what's the big deal? I\n          mean, she said to stop by if I was\n          in the neighborhood, so... Besides,\n          I'm not gonna charge you--\n\n                         JOEL\n          Not gonna charge...? God damn you!\n          Yes you are gonna charge me! I'm\n          gonna pay you! You're not having\n          sex with my wife for free! And I\n          better not ever catch you anywhere\n          near my house ever again!\n          Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it's a cell phone,\n          picks it back up and hits the \"End\" button.\n\n          INT. JOEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n          Suzie is asleep on the couch in her sweatpants. Joel walks\n          through, mumbles something about going to a party.\n\n          INT. JOEL'S CAR -- NIGHT\n\n          Joel pulls up to the house where the party is going on. He\n          stays in the car, checking it out.\n          Scanning Joel's POV, we see the band, Godscock, playing in\n          the backyard, with Rory on bass. They are set up on the\n          patio of this small two-bedroom suburban house. Most of the\n          people at the party are crowded around the keg, which is on\n          the other side of the backyard, ignoring the band. The band\n          sounds awful -- loud as hell, unmusical, uninspired. The\n          lead singer sings in that awful Eddie Vedder style, but even\n          more loud and overly dramatic. Rory acts all intense, in\n          stark contrast to the non-intensity of the music.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          55.\n          They all have that baggy-shorts tattooed mid-nineties look.\n          It's downright pathetic.\n          There's one drunk guy off to the side banging his head,\n          playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes.\n          Joel spots Cindy over by the keg, drinking, mingling. He\n          watches her for a beat, then shakes his head and drives away.\n\n                          CUT TO:\n\n          INT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT\n\n          Joel sits at the bar talking to Dean, drinking a beer.\n\n                         JOEL\n          I can't believe my wife slept with\n          that guy.\n\n                         DEAN\n          Well... I thought you said it\n          wouldn't bother you.\n\n                         JOEL\n          I guess I didn't really think about\n          it long enough... I just wish it\n          hadn't been so easy for him.\n\n                         DEAN\n          Yeah, I'm tellin' ya, chicks really\n          go wild for that Brad...\n          (Off Joel's look)\n          Sorry.\n\n                         JOEL\n          No, you're right. He may be a\n          stupid, dull-witted moron, but he\n          can get any girl he wants. Me, I\n          had to work for it. I had to work\n          hard, get a career going, take\n          Suzie out a bunch of times, marry\n          her. But not Brad. He gets to\n          waltz into my house and have sex\n          with my wife just like that. Oh,\n          and by the way? That little prick\n          was at my house again today.\n\n                         DEAN\n          No shit? What was he doing?\n\n                         JOEL\n          Take a wild guess.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          56.\n\n                         DEAN\n          Wow... You pay a guy to do a job,\n          then he comes back and does it for\n          free.\n\n                         JOEL\n          I'm not going to let him do it for\n          free. No way. I'm paying him.\n\n                         DEAN\n          Really? How much?\n\n                         JOEL\n          Oh, I don't know. The same, I\n          guess. Why?\n\n                         DEAN\n          Hmm... So should I get my twenty\n          dollars from Brad then or...\n          Joel shoots Dean an angry look.\n\n                          DEAN (CONT'D)\n          We can worry about that later...\n          Look at the bright side, now you\n          can call Cindy.\n\n                         JOEL\n          I don't know...

He's\n          still got one ball - barely. He's\n          still a man. A man who's very\n          manhood has been jeopardized, but\n          still a man. And that manhood,\n          that very sense of what you are as\n          a human being is hanging by a\n          thread. Jesus, you can't get more\n          dramatic than that.

Then suddenly looks\n          worried.\n\n                         JOEL (CONT'D)\n          Oh shit!\n          He scrambles for his pants, then looks relieved as he\n          realizes his wallet is still there. He sets down the pants,\n          then after a beat, picks them up again, checks inside the\n          wallet and sees there's still cash and credit cards. Then he\n          looks up at the chest of drawers and sees: Mary's purse,\n          Sylvia's wallet, and a watch, placed side by side.\n          He lies back in bed, and shuts his eyes, grinning again.\n\n          INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT /MANUFACTURING AREA -- MORNING\n\n          Extract bottles moving along the assembly line full steam.\n          Mary and Gabriella gossiping.\n\n                         MARY\n          (looks at her watch)\n          Joel hasn't been in all morning.\n          can you believe that?\n\n                         GABRIELLE\n          If we come in late, we get fired.\n          And here we're working our tails\n          off, and he's gonna get rich.\n          Joel walks in, bright-eyed and cheery, greeting people.

Mary looks at it, not quite sure\n          how to react, not ever wanting to appear grateful for\n          anything -- not in her nature.\n\n                         JOEL (CONT'D)\n          And by the way, Hector didn't take\n          it. Cindy did.\n          Joel walks off. Mary just shakes her head at him. She\n          whispers to Gabriella.\n\n                         MARY\n          Can you believe that? Blaming\n          Cindy just to protect Hector.\n\n          INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n          Joel is at his desk.
