He makes for the door. He nearly collides\r\n          with someone, gives and receives an apology, and suddenly understands who\r\n          this man in Guards uniform must be.

Hum-\r\n          bled and angry with himself and the world, he takes off his top hat and\r\n          considers putting his fist through it, but jams it back on his head. A horse-\r\n          cab comes along. Levin waves it down.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

THE UNICORN, KHITROVKA--NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Levin goes up a dimly lit, dingy staircase. Snatches of MUSIC and SING-\r\n          ING drift up the stairs.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          TOP OF THE STAIRS\r\n                         \r\n          Levin knocks at a door, then louder. The door is flung open. Nikolai\r\n          Levin is the spirit of consumptive, bohemian radicalism. He peers at Levin,\r\n          surprised.\r\n                         \r\n                          LEVIN\r\n           It's Kostya.\r\n                         \r\n          Nikolai roars with laughter which turns to wheezing.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          28\r\n                          NIKOLAI\r\n           God, look at him!

She's all\r\n           grown-up, and a bit frightened of you--the\r\n           belle of St. Petersburg society!\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           Is that who I am?\r\n                         \r\n           Dolly . . . Stiva has told me.\r\n                         \r\n          Dolly bursts into tears. Anna embraces her.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA (CONT'D)\r\n           Dolly, I'm sorry from the bottom of my\r\n           heart.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          40\r\n                          DOLLY\r\n          I don't know what to do.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n                          (SOOTHING)\r\n          I know, I know.\r\n                         \r\n                          DOLLY\r\n          I can't bear to be with him. And he doesn't\r\n          care, he's got what he wants.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n          What he wants is you. He loves you, Dolly.\r\n          You and the children are everything to him.\r\n                         \r\n                          DOLLY\r\n          Are we? And there is room for a governess?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n          That was shameful, disgraceful. But it was\r\n          not love. It was the animal in man, not the\r\n          soul. Stiva's remorse is from the soul.\r\n                         \r\n                          DOLLY\r\n          What about me? Does his remorse make it\r\n          easier for me?--\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n          I know you are suffering. But, Dolly, you\r\n          must tell me . . . is there enough love left in\r\n          your heart . . . enough to forgive him?\r\n                         \r\n                          DOLLY\r\n          When I think of them together, I can't for-\r\n          give him, no!\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          41\r\n                          ANNA\r\n           My poor lamb. So you'd rather accept your\r\n           fate . . .\r\n                         \r\n                          DOLLY\r\n           My fate?\r\n                          (OUTRAGED)\r\n           But I haven't done anything! It's him\r\n                          WHO'S--\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           Do you love him, Dolly?\r\n                         \r\n          Dolly nods tearfully.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA (CONT'D)\r\n           You love him, and he loves you, but you\r\n           can't forgive, so your lives must continue\r\n           like this for ever, with both of you wretched.\r\n                         \r\n          She's winning.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Anna, Kitty, Tanya and Grisha are at a handsome card table where\r\n          board games, dominoes, cards, etc., are kept. There is a spill of alphabet\r\n          bricks, each with a letter printed in it. They are spelling out their names in\r\n          alphabet bricks. Grisha is on Anna's lap pulling at her hair. The spelling\r\n          business, including misspellings by Grisha, creates a noise of laughter and\r\n          mock-rebuke. Tanya at the same time is trying to pull a ring from Anna's\r\n          finger.\r\n                         \r\n          Kitty is not at all frightened of Anna now; enraptured by her, laughing.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          42\r\n                          ANNA\r\n           Grisha, don't pull so hard, you're getting it\r\n           all in a tangle--and look for another G for\r\n                          GRIGORI--\r\n           (She takes off her ring for Tanya)\r\n           --here, darling, you can wear it till you go\r\n                          TO BED--\r\n                         \r\n          Dolly sits apart, embroidering. She looks up at the sound of voices down-\r\n          stairs, Oblonsky coming home. The children hear their father and abandon\r\n          the card table, running out to greet him. Dolly stands up to leave by a dif-\r\n          ferent door, giving Anna a collusive glance.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna pushes aside the alphabet bricks.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA (CONT'D)\r\n           Well, that's the end of that.\r\n                         \r\n                          KITTY\r\n           Will you stay for the Bobrishchev's ball,\r\n           Anna?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           Oh . . . I always feel dull at a ball.\r\n                         \r\n                          KITTY\r\n           How can you ever be dull?\r\n                         \r\n          Oblonsky arrives in the doorway with Tanya and Grisha hanging on him.\r\n                         \r\n                          KITTY (CONT'D)\r\n           Stiva!

Anna moves her head:\r\n          upstairs.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           . . . and God go with you.\r\n                         \r\n          Kitty catches the moment.\r\n                         \r\n                          OBLONSKY\r\n                          (LEAVING)\r\n           You can introduce me to your new governess.\r\n                         \r\n                          TANYA\r\n           She's old! She's a hundred!\r\n                         \r\n          Which leaves Anna and Kitty alone.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           I know why you want me to come. You want\r\n           everyone to be there because you're sure it's\r\n           going to be your night.\r\n                         \r\n                          KITTY\r\n           How did you know?\r\n                         \r\n          Anna's smile is her acting out a mock-mysteriousness.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           I know everything.\r\n                         \r\n          She has moved alphabet letters around to spell out VRONSKY. She laughs\r\n          at Kitty's tearful, joyful nodding, genuinely happy for Kitty.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA (CONT'D)\r\n           Oh, to be your age again . . . surrounded by\r\n           that blue mist, like mist on the mountains\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          44\r\n           that clears slowly to reveal the terrifying,\r\n           beautiful valley you must enter to become\r\n           grown-up . . .

RECEPTION ROOM, OBLONSKY HOUSE--NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          With only a lamp or two lit, and the door open, Anna sits alone at the\r\n          card table, with a neglected book, one hand playing idly with the alpha-\r\n          bet bricks. Their pleasant clicks are the only sound as she remains lost in\r\n          thought. She closes her book, marking the place. She is going to go up to bed.\r\n          She hears the sound of the doorbell.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

He's just gone\r\n           up. . . . The Princess retired early . . . Is\r\n           there a message?\r\n                         \r\n          Vronsky glances up and sees Anna looking down. Their eyes meet. A second\r\n          passes. Vronsky is about to speak. Anna turns away and moves out of his\r\n          view, towards further stairs, with her book.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           No.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          45\r\n          EXT. NEAR POKROVSKOE--DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Levin is coming home in a sleigh, driven by his one-eyed coachman, Ignat.\r\n          He is huddled under a bearskin blanket. The house is in sight.\r\n                         \r\n          The sleigh overtakes a Peasant Woman, Serafina, walking to the house car-\r\n          rying a big bundle of willow wands strapped to her back: a strong young\r\n          woman with a handsome face. She stops and bows her head. Levin looks at\r\n          her. She then looks him in the face.\r\n                         \r\n          Laska, barking joyfully, races from the house.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. BATHHOUSE, POKROVSKOE-- DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The bathhouse has a stove which heats water. There is a brazier to create\r\n          instant steam, but not now. Levin, almost naked, lies on a plank deck,\r\n          thoughtful, staring at something . . . no, at someone: Serafina, who is put-\r\n          ting on her clothes. Postcoitum. She has no angst. Dressed, she crosses herself.\r\n                         \r\n                          LEVIN\r\n           Will you go to confession?\r\n                         \r\n          Serafina nods indifferently.\r\n                         \r\n                          LEVIN (CONT'D)\r\n           God will forgive you.\r\n                         \r\n                          SERAFINA\r\n           And you also, master.

The Host\r\n          and Hostess are positioned to welcome each guest. Dancing has started-- a\r\n          waltz.\r\n                         \r\n          Kitty and her parents enter the ballroom and are received by their hosts.\r\n          Everything has come together for Kitty--her dress, her hair, her skin, her\r\n          moment. She radiates happiness. An Officer stands aside to let them pass,\r\n          openly admiring Kitty, smoothing his moustache. A Youth having trouble\r\n          with his white tie hurries past but turns back to Kitty.\r\n                         \r\n                          YOUTH\r\n           Kitty!

Kitty smiles for Vronsky but his eyes have followed Anna, know-\r\n          ing she cut him. He remembers himself after an awkward hiatus. Kitty's\r\n          mother and father are watching from afar. Vronsky obliges. He invites her\r\n          into the waltz.\r\n                         \r\n                          PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY\r\n           . . . this vile, idiotic matchmaking of\r\n           yours . . .\r\n                         \r\n                          PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKY\r\n           For goodness' sake, what have I done?\r\n                         \r\n                          PRINCE SHCHERBATSKY\r\n           Levin is a thousand times better than this\r\n           Petersburg fop.

He\r\n          stand waiting for the music to start.\r\n                         \r\n                          KITTY\r\n           Is anything the matter?\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          50\r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           No. You look . . . as lovely as ever, Princess\r\n           Kitty.\r\n                         \r\n          The music starts and they dance on.\r\n                         \r\n          At the end of the waltz, Vronsky leaves Kitty with her mother, bows and\r\n          departs. Princess Shcherbatsky is beginning to have doubts. She starts to ask.\r\n                         \r\n                          KITTY\r\n                          (SHARPLY)\r\n           Don't ask me, Maman!\r\n                         \r\n          Boris the Youth pops up to claim his dance. Dancing, Kitty sees Vronsky\r\n          talking to a couple of Officers. She is anxious but not disillusioned.\r\n                         \r\n          Grumpy Prince Shcherbatsky is dancing with Countess Nordston.\r\n                         \r\n                          COUNTESS NORDSTON\r\n           He'll dance the mazurka with Kitty, you'll\r\n           see. I call the mazurka the now-or-never.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna watches the dancing. She rejects an offer with a smile. She sees Vron-\r\n          sky and to her discomfort Vronsky looks up and catches her looking.\r\n                         \r\n          She turns away at once, and notices that ladies are curtseying and men are\r\n          bowing as the Host and Hostess escort an overweight but glittering young\r\n          couple towards a decorative buffet in an adjoining salon: the Austrian\r\n          royal honeymooners . . . attended by the Guards Officer from the station.\r\n          Anna stands and curtseys as they pass by into the salon . . . where Oblonsky\r\n          is roaring with laughter, champagne in hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          AUSTRIAN PRINCESS\r\n           . . . we were shut up in the train for an hour!\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          51\r\n          Anna steals a sidelong glance towards Vronsky but he is no longer there.\r\n          She looks for him among the dancers, smiles at Kitty going by with the\r\n          enthusiastic, inexpert Boris.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly, Vronsky is at Anna's side.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           Dance with me.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n                          (CALMLY)\r\n           I am not used to being spoken to like that\r\n           by a man I met once at a railway station.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           I dare say, but if I'm not to dance with you,\r\n           I'm getting out of this operetta and going\r\n           home.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           Then, for Kitty's sake.\r\n                         \r\n          She gives him her hand.\r\n                         \r\n          Kitty looks for Vronsky, can't see him, then is taken aback to see him with\r\n          Anna. Kitty watches Anna dancing. Anna says something which makes\r\n          Vronsky laugh. Anna laughs. Anna blossoms in front of Kitty's eyes. Vron-\r\n          sky twirls Anna around and she comes smiling into his arms.\r\n                         \r\n          It goes on like that. Kitty watches them from within the arms of young men,\r\n          old men, from the wall. Anna and Vronsky dance slow, they dance fast,\r\n          gaily, solemnly, gazes locked.\r\n                         \r\n          Others are noticing too: Countess Nordston, Princess Shcherbatsky, and\r\n          eagle-eyed matrons. Anna, oblivious, has found a release in herself.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          52\r\n          Countess Nordston finds Kitty sitting alone. Korsunsky announces the\r\n          Mazurka.\r\n                         \r\n                          COUNTESS NORDSTON\r\n           You're not dancing the mazurka? I won't\r\n           have it.\r\n                         \r\n          She pulls Kitty to her feet.\r\n                         \r\n           countess nordston (cont'd)\r\n           I'm engaged by General Glub--I give him\r\n           to you.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          THE MAZURKA . . .\r\n                         \r\n          Korsunsky supervises a large circle of couples who change partners as they go\r\n          round, with one couple dancing in the middle of the circle.\r\n                         \r\n                          KORSUNSKY\r\n           . . . the lady chooses a lady and a\r\n           gentleman . . . !\r\n                         \r\n          The lady in the middle beckons to Anna and the man who, changing part-\r\n          ners, happens to be dancing with her. They enter the middle where they\r\n          have their solo turn as a couple, while the original couple reenter the circum-\r\n          ference. Anna is flushed with pleasure. Among the surrounding dancers,\r\n          Vronsky has no eyes for his partner, only for Anna. Kitty, dancing, watches\r\n          Vronsky incredulous.\r\n                         \r\n                          KORSUNSKY (CONT'D)\r\n                          (ADDRESSING ANNA)\r\n           . . . and the lady chooses a lady and a\r\n           gentleman . . . !\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          53\r\n          Anna looks smilingly around the dancing circle and sees Kitty staring\r\n          at her. Anna \"wakes up.\" Everything which made her drunk makes her\r\n          sober in the instant. She waits until the change of partners brings Kitty\r\n          and Vronsky together. She beckons them into the middle. Her own partner\r\n          expects to re-join the circumference with Anna, but she makes an apology\r\n          and escapes through the circle, running towards the door.\r\n                         \r\n          With a howl and clatter, the St. Petersburg express seems to crash through\r\n          the ballroom.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         MONTAGE\r\n                         \r\n          An abstract, nightmarish, discordant noise of clattering and howling\r\n          accompanies unexplained flame--light on wood, glass, iron . . . blackness\r\n          opens like a door on a blizzard of light, and slams shut.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna's face, eyes closed, floats ghostlike.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Wind and snow batter on the window. The\r\n          Carriage Stoker, in long coat and cap, deals with the stove, clears frost off\r\n          a thermometer on the wall. He leaves, opening the door to snow and wind\r\n          and slamming it behind him.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

She is reading\r\n          without taking it in. She turns back a page and tries again, but almost at\r\n          once she turns to the window where the dark reflection of her face looks back\r\n          at her. Kitty's face staring as she stared at Anna, betrayed.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna turns away from the window. The Guard comes through the door,\r\n          letting in wind and snow, and shuts it.

The wind blows a few\r\n          snowflakes through the station but the roof keeps off the snow. She is glad of\r\n          the fresh air. Here and there, men are walking, smoking, laughing together.\r\n          She feels better.\r\n                         \r\n          A tall outline of a man in a greatcoat and military cap emerges from the\r\n          flickering gloom.

She knows at once\r\n          that Vronsky isn't there. Betsy beckons to her across the room. Anna, self-\r\n          possessed, smiling, nodding to friends, pressing a hand held out to her,\r\n          offering the other hand to be kissed, glides through a crowd of Betsy's guests.\r\n                         \r\n                          VOICES\r\n           Wasn't Nilsson glorious?

She kisses Anna.\r\n                         \r\n                          BETSY\r\n           He's gone. But you're just in time for the\r\n           surprise.\r\n                         \r\n          There is a series of minor explosions outside and the darkness out there turns\r\n          into an illuminated garden lit by fountains of fire, sprays of light. The\r\n          guests react with cries of pleasure and applause.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          72\r\n          Anna turns at once to the window near her, puts her face up against the\r\n          glass, putting her hands to her temples as if to see the illuminations better.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         REVERSE\r\n                         \r\n          Her self-possessed face, lit by fireworks, falls apart in misery.\r\n                         \r\n          The firework display continues for a short minute and is applauded. Betsy\r\n          acknowledges the congratulations and sycophancy which are her due. Foot-\r\n          men come through the room with trays of ices.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna is still at the window, unaware that there is only darkness outside.\r\n          In the room, Betsy notes the oddity: Anna alone with her back to the room.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          REVERSE ON ANNA\r\n                         \r\n          Anna opens her eyes. She is lost for a moment, perplexed.\r\n                         \r\n           vronsky (O.C.)\r\n           May I have the honour of bringing you an\r\n           ice?\r\n                         \r\n          Anna turns, understanding nothing.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY (CONT'D)\r\n           Ices are being served.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           I would prefer to try a cigarette.\r\n                         \r\n          She sits down. Vronsky takes out a cigarette case. He lights her cigarette.\r\n          She tries it and coughs.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          73\r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n                          (IN FRENCH)\r\n           Courage!\r\n                         \r\n          Anna smiles. Puffs delicately once.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           Thank you.\r\n                         \r\n          She gives the cigarette to him.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA (CONT'D)\r\n           I'll try another one sometime.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           When?\r\n                         \r\n          She looks at him in surprise. He dunks the cigarette in an abandoned dish\r\n          of ice cream.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY (CONT'D)\r\n           Where?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           Just as I was thinking your manners have\r\n           improved since Moscow.

Vronsky follows\r\n          Anna. This is watched by more than one guest. Betsy hands the cup\r\n          to Anna.\r\n                         \r\n                          BETSY\r\n           How nice--Alexei Aleksandrevich has\r\n           arrived.\r\n                         \r\n          Karenin enters smiling. Lisa Merkalova and Anna's Friend share a\r\n          delicious-malicious moment.\r\n                         \r\n                          LISA MERKALOVA\r\n           I'm not sure my nerves can stand another\r\n           Alexei at this moment.\r\n                         \r\n          As Betsy and Karenin move smilingly to greet each other, Karenin's radar\r\n          picks up the two women's intimate laughter.\r\n                         \r\n          Karenin remains at apparent ease, as though unaware of people's glances\r\n          at Vronsky and Anna, and he kisses Betsy's hand. Princess Myagkaya has\r\n          meanwhile gone over to Anna. Anna likes her and is glad of the diversion.\r\n                         \r\n                          PRINCESS MYAGKAYA\r\n           So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner. The\r\n           sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou-\r\n           bles, and it was ghastly. We had to ask them\r\n           back. I gave them a sauce that cost eighty-\r\n           five kopeks and it was a triumph.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna and Vronsky laugh. Princess Myagkaya moves on.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           Were you glad to see me or not?\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          75\r\n                          ANNA\r\n           This must stop. You make me feel as if I\r\n           were guilty of something.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           What do you want me to do?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty\r\n           to forgive you.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           No, that's not what you want. Moscow? I\r\n           can do better than that. Tonight I refused a\r\n           posting to Tashkent. I can change my mind,\r\n           and you'll never see me again.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           If you have any thought for me, you will\r\n           give me back my peace.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           I have no peace to give. There can be no\r\n           peace for us--only misery or the greatest\r\n           happiness. You are my whole life now.\r\n                         \r\n          She looks at him and nods slowly, as if in thought.\r\n                         \r\n          Betsy diplomatically leads Karenin to Anna.\r\n                         \r\n                          BETSY\r\n           Your husband is impossible!-- his opinions\r\n           are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he\r\n           wins every argument.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna looks up at her, hearing nothing.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          76\r\n                          ANNA\r\n           What?\r\n                         \r\n          She notices Karenin, who kisses her hand.

She is animated,\r\n          excited, at a small table, involved in a game of cards-- which she wins, to\r\n          local applause. She speaks a \"must go\" to Betsy, and swiftly goes to the door.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

He raises a warning finger, and reaches to close the\r\n          communication window behind the coachman's box.\r\n                         \r\n                          KARENIN\r\n           By making plain your feelings when one of\r\n           the riders fell. Your conduct was improper.\r\n           It must not occur again. I have said it before.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna smiles faintly. He is misled by that.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          108\r\n                          KARENIN (CONT'D)\r\n           You are going to say my concern is unneces-\r\n           sary and ridiculous. You are my wife. I am\r\n           wrong to think that . . . yes--perhaps I was\r\n           mistaken.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna looks at him despairingly.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           No, you were not mistaken. I love him. I\r\n           am his mistress. I can't bear you, I'm afraid\r\n           of you, I hate you. Do what you like to me.\r\n                         \r\n          Karenin is literally winded--gasping for breath, slowly getting his breath-\r\n          ing under control. Anna huddles away from him in her corner. Karenin\r\n          recovers himself only to the point of sitting stock-still, looking at nothing,\r\n          not moving.\r\n                         \r\n          The coach lurches, unbalancing him so that he is pushed against Anna. He\r\n          recoils as if from a contamination.\r\n                         \r\n          The coach slows. The coach stops. A Servant comes to the coach door, opens\r\n          the door.\r\n                         \r\n                          KARENIN\r\n           Wait, please. Move away.\r\n                         \r\n          The Servant backs off.\r\n                         \r\n                          KARENIN (CONT'D)\r\n           I will not have a scandal. Therefore . . . You\r\n           will not see . . . this man again. You will\r\n           behave in such a way that nothing is known\r\n           against you, by society or by the servants.\r\n           In return, you will keep the privileges of a\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          109\r\n           wife--and the duties. Tomorrow you will\r\n           return home. That is all.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna gets out of the coach and runs into the maze.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. MAZE--NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Anna comes to Vronsky. She is still shaken by the showdown with\r\n          Karenin in his coach, but is now overtaken by concern for Vronsky after his\r\n          fall.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           Are you hurt?\r\n                         \r\n          Vronsky shakes his head. He is moved by the sight of her, full of love and\r\n          desire, but in her embrace he detects something new, a nervous exaltation.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           What's happened?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           I told him I'm your mistress.\r\n                         \r\n          Vronsky lifts her face, strokes her cheek. He waits.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA (CONT'D)\r\n           He thinks I can give you up and go on\r\n           living.\r\n                         \r\n          He embraces her for that, relieved, grateful, loving--understanding that\r\n          she is not going to give him up.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          110\r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           No, you cannot.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Karenin bows low.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. IMPERIAL SALON, ST.

His\r\n          place is behind an old man, Theodore, who is scything as if without effort.\r\n          Just in time for Levin, Theodore calls a halt and takes Levin's scythe to\r\n          sharpen it with a whetstone. Levin attracts a few grins and comments.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          113\r\n                          YOUNG PEASANT\r\n           Konstantin Dmitrich, you'll know your\r\n           rows when the field's all done!\r\n                         \r\n          Levin's row has stalks of differing heights between the even swathes on\r\n          either side.

Levin watches her discreetly.\r\n          He has settled down at a discreet distance from the men. His attention\r\n          is caught by a grown-up Boy and his young Wife who have chosen to sit\r\n          slightly apart.

Vronsky is here as the escort of a Foreign Prince (an Indian), watch-\r\n          ing a \"risqu\u00e9\" show with Can-Can Girls, much relished by the visitor.\r\n                         \r\n          Vronsky's glance casts about in the gloom.

She beckons him. He excuses himself to the\r\n          Foreign Prince, who doesn't notice, and goes over to the other table. Under\r\n          the music, he is introduced to Stremov, and kisses the hands of the women.\r\n          He takes the empty chair.\r\n                         \r\n                          VRONSKY\r\n           He's some kind of prince at home.

As Vronsky\r\n          approaches the door, it opens and Kapitonich comes out with a folded rug.\r\n          Kapitonich is wrong-footed by seeing him. Karenin comes out of the door,\r\n          into the gaslight. When he sees Vronsky he hesitates for a fraction but con-\r\n          tinues. Kapitonich is holding open the door of the coach. Vronsky bows,\r\n          Karenin, expressionless, touches his hat and gets into the coach, taking the\r\n          rug. Vronsky walks into the house as the coach moves off.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

He wakes. For a beat he hardly knows where he is.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Across the carriage she sees through the window that\r\n          her train is overtaking another passenger train on the next line.\r\n                         \r\n          She looks at the windows of the other train \"going by\" . . . seeing the pas-\r\n          sengers inside.\r\n                         \r\n          Unexpectedly, she seems to see a Man who might be Vronsky sitting opposite\r\n          a laughing Woman who might be Princess Sorokina.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          191\r\n          Anna's body jerks involuntarily. She half rises. The image, however, is\r\n          brief and is borne away, as her own train goes by, accelerating. The win-\r\n          dows opposite pick up speed as she leaves them behind--\r\n                         \r\n          And then she has the same illusion again-- a \"Vronsky\" and a \"Sorokina\"\r\n          glimpsed in the other train and snatched away in the instant.\r\n                         \r\n          Now she stands up and goes to the opposite window, where the windows\r\n          of the other train are flashing by in the (anachronistic) manner of pro-\r\n          jected film-frames, and she sees \"Vronskys\" and \"Sorokinas\" flashing by at\r\n          gathering speed. And then the train has gone and there's nothing going by\r\n          but the view.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna collapses into the nearest seat.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

The platform is well populated by people\r\n          waiting to board the train or to meet the arriving passengers. There is an\r\n          energy about the people-- shouting, laughter, movement. Porters shout for\r\n          custom. A couple of Young Men seem to be laughing rudely directly at her,\r\n          but they pass by, ignoring her.\r\n                         \r\n          Anna pauses, bewildered, lost, not knowing what to do next.\r\n                         \r\n          She sees the Sorokina Coachman on the platform, recognising his distinctive\r\n          livery, a cockade in his hat.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNA\r\n           Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina?\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          192\r\n                          COACHMAN\r\n           No, Your Excellency, both princesses are at\r\n           the house of Countess Vronsky.

A Boy selling drinks grins\r\n          at her. A little group of Ladies and Children meeting a bespectacled man\r\n          off the train are laughing and chattering but fall silent and look at her. She\r\n          increases her pace. She hurries away towards the far end of the platform.\r\n          Beyond her, a goods train is slowly approaching. Between her and the train,\r\n          two Maidservants are walking towards her. They turn their heads to look\r\n          at her, remarking on her dress.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAIDSERVANT\r\n           Look at that lace on her . . .\r\n                         \r\n          There is a rough bench near the end of the platform. Anna reaches it and\r\n          sits down. The two girls turn again to look back at her, and are struck\r\n          by the sight of Anna sitting alone in profile. The goods train reaches her\r\n          and the first wagon goes past her. The two girls stop and watch, vaguely\r\n          puzzled by her.\r\n                         \r\n          As they watch, the beautiful woman on the bench gets up and walks the\r\n          few steps to the edge of the wooden platform and into the path of the train,\r\n          disappearing from view between the wheels of one of the wagons.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.
