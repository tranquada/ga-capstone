BELEM BRAZIL - JULY... \n\n     EXT. BELEM STREETS - NIGHT\n\n     A taxi careens down narrow roadways at breakneck speeds.\n\n     INT. TAXI - NIGHT\n\n     In the back seat is WHITTLESLEY. Early 40's, the wreck of a once\n     handsome man. Unshaven.  Sweat stained.  Rail thin.  Scratches on his\n     arms, a fresh scar on one cheek.  As the taxi roars downhill towards\n     the harbor, Whittlesley leans over the front seat.  (Italics indicate\n     Portuguese to be subtitled)\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    Faster!  We won't make it.\n\n                              DRIVER\n                    You want to die?\n\n     Whittlesley pulls out A KNIFE, puts it to the driver's jugular vein.\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    Do you?\n\n     Sweat pouring down his brow, the driver re-doubles his speed.\n\n     EXT. BELEM STREETS - NIGHT\n\n     The taxi swerves around a corner, nearly crashing into a fruit cart,\n     flies out of sight.\n\n     EXT. HARBOR - BELEM - NIGHT\n\n     Light rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters.  We hear\n     faint laughter leavened with Portuguese phrases, distant Calypso music\n     from waterfront bars.  One of the smaller boats, the SANTA LUCIA, is\n     loading as the TAXI fishtails to a halt.\n\n     Whittlesley gets out, sees the boat still at dock.  His face floods\n     with relief.\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    Thank God.\n\n     He tosses a handful of bills into the driver's lap, sprints up the\n     pier as the driver shouts curses after him in Portuguese.  Whittlesley\n     shoves past the dock hands as the last load goes onto the Santa Lucia.\n     The boat's engines churn to life.\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    I need to speak to the captain!\n                    Where is he?\n\n     The sailors hold Whittlesley back.\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    Get your hands off me!  I'm trying\n                    to save your lives, you fools!\n\n     Several crew members murmur the word \"loco\".  Hearing the commotion, a\n     squat man wearing a billed hat and smoking a cigar approaches.  CAPTAIN\n     FRANCO.\n\n                              FRANCO\n                    American?\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    Yes.  Thank Christ somebody speaks\n                    English.  I'm Dr. John Whittlesley.\n                    You have some crates of mine on\n                    board.  They were shipped by mistake\n                    to the Natural History Museum.  We\n                    have to get them off the boat.\n\n                              FRANCO\n                    You have I.D.?\n\n     Whittlesley runs a trembling hand through his hair, trying to keep\n     control and appear reasonable.\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    No.  Let me explain.  I was on an\n                    expedition for the museum on the\n                    Upper Xingu.  Something horrible\n                    happened.  I'm the only one who got\n                    out alive.  I lost everything, my\n                    I.D., everything.  I have to make\n                    sure no one else dies.  The crates,\n                    the crates were sent out before we\n                    knew.  There's something unspeakable\n                    inside.  If your boat leaves harbor\n                    with those crates on board, I can't\n                    be responsible.  My God, if they\n                    reach New York... \n\n     Whittlesley's fists clench spasmodically.  Franco looks to his men.\n\n                              FRANCO\n                    Loco.\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    No!  I'm not crazy!  As God is my\n                    witness, I'm telling the truth.\n\n     Franco barks an order and several sailors grab Whittlesley by the\n     arms.  They start to lead him back to shore.\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    Don't do this!  You have to believe\n                    me.  Your lives are in danger.\n\n     The sailors laugh.  But with an almost super-human strength born of\n     desperation, Whittlesley throws them off.  He pulls out his wallet.\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    Cash.  Cash, you see?  American money.\n\n     Whittlesley throws the money down on the deck.  The breeze scatters the\n     bills across the bow and all the men, including Captain Franco,\n     scramble for the money, chattering in Portuguese.  While they are\n     occupied, Whittlesley slips by unnoticed and disappears below deck.\n\n     INT. HOLD - SANTA LUCIA - NIGHT\n\n     Whittlesley ducks between cages of goats, boxes of farm equipment, his\n     movements jerky with panic.  As he continues searching, the camera\n     moves past him, into the darkness of the hold.  We hear Whittlesley\n     mumbling between low, ragged breaths.  At the back of the boat the\n     camera finds... \n\n     A STACK OF CRATES... clearly labeled NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM.  Move in on\n     these as... The CRATES VIBRATE.  The boat has started to move!\n     Whittlesley stands bolt upright, realizing what's going on.\n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    No!\n\n     Too late.  He turns to run back on deck but then stops, sniffs the air.\n     A look of desperation fills his eyes.  With one hand he pulls out THE\n     KNIFE, and unexpectedly puts it to HIS OWN NECK.  Better to kill\n     himself than face what comes next.  The knife touches... \n\n     A NECKLACE of TWO ARROWS, one gold, another silver.\n\n     Whittlesley stares wide-eyed into the blackness of the hold.  The goats\n     start BLEATING in blind panic.  A shaft of moonlight comes through a\n     porthole as the boat turns.  The moonlight falls on\n\n     THE CRATES.  Whittlesley's eyes lock onto them and he inches towards\n     them, drawn inexorably closer... closer... \n\n                              WHITTLESLEY\n                    No... no... \n\n     He begins mumbling a prayer.\n\n     MOVE IN ON HIS EYES... filled with dread as he falls to his knees,\n     staring, always staring at THE CRATES... \n\n     EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT\n\n     The crew tends to business and the Santa Lucia points out of the\n     harbor, disappears into the night.\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     EXT. LOUISIANNA COAST - DAY... TITLE CARD... JUNE\n\n     Squad cars roar down the back roads, sirens flashing.  In the center of\n     the column is an unmarked car.\n\n     INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY\n\n     At the wheel is a strikingly dignified and imposing black man wearing\n     a simple, old-fashioned dark suit, narrow black tie, and white shirt.\n     This is SPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST, FBI.\n\n     A BACH SONATA for violin and harpsichord plays on the tape deck.\n     Pendergast hums along as he drives.  A SMALL TOWN COP rides shotgun.\n     The cop is intimidated both by Pendergast and the morning's events.  He\n     sweats heavily as he brings Pendergast up to date.\n\n                              SMALL TOWN COP\n                    One of the locals found it at dawn.\n                    Didn't believe him 'till I saw it\n                    myself.  Even then I didn't believe\n                    it.  Scared my men shitless.  Me too.\n                    I mean... hell... You could smell it a\n                    half mile away, Mr. Pendergast.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                        (unperturbed)\n                    Any of your men go on board?\n\n                              SMALL TOWN COP\n                    No sir.  No way.  None of us wanted\n                    to, I'm the first to admit it.  I\n                    said, \"Don't get within a mile of\n                    this thing.  It's way to big for us.\n                    I'm calling the FBI.\"\n\n     Pendergast nods his approval, resumes humming along with a\n     particularly intricate harpsichord riff.  As always, the man is\n     unflappable and totally calm as he drives.\n\n     EXT. LOUISIANA BEACH - DAY\n\n     The ocean is still, the air stifling and close.  A hot sun beats down\n     on the deck of the SANTA LUCIA.  The boat lists at a crazy angle where\n     it has been washed up on the shore.  At first glance, it appears to be\n     deserted.  A barrel rolls back and forth as the boat is rocked by each\n     successive wave.  We hear sirens approaching and the phalanx of squad\n     cars pulls up.  Joining them now are TWO AMBULANCES.\n\n     PENDERGAST gets out along with the others.  All of the cops immediately\n     cover their faces, gagging violently at the smell.  Pendergast sniffs\n     once and frowns.  Apart from this, he doesn't react.\n\n                              SMALL TOWN COP\n                        (choking)\n                    Goin' up-wind if you don't mind.\n\n     Pendergast nods.  The cops all fall back in revulsion.  They watch from\n     a safe distance as Pendergast approaches the ghost ship.  His shiny\n     laced wing-tips sink in the sand.  He leans down, pulls them off one at\n     a time.  He balls both socks, puts them carefully into his shoes and\n     proceeds barefoot towards the boat.\n\n     Using a piece of driftwood as a plank, Pendergast leans it against the\n     Santa Lucia.  With surprising agility, he leaps up the plank to the\n     deck.  At the top he touches a rail.  It's covered in a DARK STICKY\n     LIQUID.\n\n     BLOOD.  Flies buzz loudly.  A LARGE MACHETE lies abandoned in the stern.\n     Chairs are overturned.  A DEAD GOAT, eviscerated, lies in the bow.  A\n     lifeboat hangs half off the stern.  Pendergast moves aft.  The COPS\n     watch from the sand below, unwilling to get any closer.  Pendergast\n     hears A DOOR slamming open and closed.  He follows the noise and\n     sees... \n\n     THE DOOR TO THE HOLD.  He approaches, pushes it open and looks down the\n     stairwell.  Below deck are\n\n     BODIES... stacks of them.  They've been TORN TO SHREDS.\n\n     THE CAMERA MOVES down to one particular man who is nearest the top of\n     the stairs.  It's CAPTAIN FRANCO.  His face is frozen in a howl of\n     terror.  Flies congregate in the eye sockets.  With his foot, Pendergast\n     nudges the body over.  The skull has been torn open.\n\n     THERE IS NO BACK TO FRANCO'S HEAD.\n\n     FADE TO BLACK:\n\n     Silence then we begin hearing sounds of the city... horns, traffic,\n     construction work.\n\n     SUPER TITLE... NEW YORK CITY, FOUR MONTHS LATER as we... \n\n     FADE IN:\n\n     ON A NECKLACE of TWO ARROWS, one of gold, the other silver.  The twin\n     to the one seen on Whittlesley.  Widen to... \n\n     EXT. ROOFTOP GARDEN - MARGO'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING\n\n     And the woman wearing the necklace... MARGO GREEN.  She sips her morning\n     coffee as she makes notes on several large FOSSILIZED TEETH.  Her hair\n     is neatly combed.  No make-up.  She doesn't need it.  She has a natural,\n     unselfconscious beauty and a mind like a steel trap.\n\n     At Margo's elbow is a small T.V.  A CNN world news report plays.\n     Margo's New York Times is open to the crossword puzzle, which she's\n     been doing rapidly, in ink.  Clearly this is a woman who likes order,\n     with a mind that can handle more than one thing at a time.\n\n     An alarm on her watch beeps and she fills in the last two lines of the\n     crossword puzzle, makes one final note on the fossil specimens, and\n     shuts off the T.V.  She reaches for her back pack and looks out at\n     CENTRAL PARK with remarkably clear eyes.\n\n     EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING\n\n     HELICOPTER SHOT... Swooping over the fall foliage of the Park, a riot\n     of color and botanical life... The camera picks out MARGO'S BICYCLE\n     making its way along the winding roads, dodging taxi cabs.  Margo wears\n     jeans, a work shirt, a fine blue gabardine jacket with a rhinestone\n     DOUBLE HELIX PIN.  On her back is a LEATHER BACK PACK which holds her\n     lap top computer.  She emerges from the park, catches the green light\n     and rolls up to... \n\n     EXT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY\n\n     As Margo arrives, the camera moves up and over the building, comes to\n     rest on the imposing turrets, intersecting roof lines, and Gothic\n     arches of the MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.  This is not an ordinary\n     building; it's a 19th century monument to science and mankind.  The\n     structure fills an entire city block.\n\n     Happy visitors pour into the museum as Margo takes the imposing wide\n     stone steps two at a time.  We hear SCREAMS of pleasure and release,\n     the normal raucous noises of a large group of THIRD GRADE CHILDREN.\n     Margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids.  Their teacher,\n     MRS. BEASLEY, a stern woman in glasses with a thick New York accent,\n     calls after them as they all head inside.\n\n                              MRS. BEASLEY\n                    Don't run, children!  Stay with your\n                    partner and do not run!  If anyone\n                    runs they will be sent back to the\n                    bus!\n\n     Ignoring Mrs. Beasley, TWO BOYS charge past Margo.  HENRY and LARRY.\n     Henry has a buzz cut; Larry has rasta dread knots.  Both are 8 years\n     old, wear high top sneakers and shorts so big they graze their ankles.\n\n                              MRS. BEASLEY\n                    Henry!  Larry!  What did I just say!\n                    You walk right this minute!  Did you\n                    hear me?!\n\n     Reluctantly, Henry and Larry slow to a rapid race-walk as they reach\n     the huge doorway flanked by two Northwest Coast Indian totem poles.\n     Above the doorway WORKMEN are hanging a LARGE BANNER.  It reads:\n     \"SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT... OPENING OCT. 29\"\n\n     INT. MUSEUM ROTUNDA/STAIRWELL - DAY\n\n     The school children burst into a three story space dominated by a\n     life-sized statue of a HERD OF ELEPHANTS.  The kids chatter with\n     excitement, look up in awe.  Margo nods to a GUARD who smiles as she\n     pins on a plastic I.D.\n\n                              GUARD\n                    Morning, Dr. Green.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Morning Joe.  Beautiful day.\n\n     Henry watches Margo pass through the turnstiles without paying.  He\n     swaggers over.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    You work here?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Yes, I do.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    What do you do?\n\n                              MARGO\n                        (leans down, amused)\n                    I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What\n                    do you do?\n\n                              HENRY\n                    Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's\n                    a revolutionary what ch'a ma'\n                    callit?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how\n                    life on earth evolved over millions\n                    of years.\n\n                              HENRY\n                        (brightens)\n                    Way cool.  Then you know where the\n                    dinosaurs are.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Fourth floor, West wing, but stay\n                    with your class.\n\n     Mrs. Beasley heads into the museum and Larry and Henry merge with the\n     rest of the kids.  Margo turns towards the stairwell, passing... \n\n     IAN CUTHBERT... Museum Director... a pudgy man in wire rim glasses who\n     dresses and thinks like a banker.  Hired for his amazing ability to\n     raise money, Cuthbert is one of a new generation of Museum Directors\n     whose focus must always be on the bottom line.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Hello, Ian.  Everything ready for the\n                    opening of the Superstition Exhibit?\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    I'm on my way to get the last piece\n                    out of storage right now.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I'd wish you luck but I'm not\n                    superstitious.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    You will be after tomorrow night.\n\n     Cuthbert waves merrily.  A workman uses a LADDER in the stairwell.\n     Cuthbert is about to walk under the ladder, stops and carefully walks\n     around it instead.  Margo smiles, goes on upstairs.\n\n     INT. MUSEUM BASEMENT - DAY\n\n     Cuthbert enters from the lower stairwell.  He is now in one of the\n     hundreds of areas of the museum that are closed to the the general\n     public.  He follows a labyrinthine route down a dim passageway lined\n     with rumbling steam pipes.  There are storage areas on both sides\n     labeled ORNITHOLOGY, HERPITOLOGY, CENTRAL ASIA EXPEDITIONS, AKELEY\n     EXPEDITIONS, WHALE BONE FOSSILS and so on.  Finally Cuthbert comes to a\n     door marked\n\n     \"WHITTLESLEY EXPEDITIONS 1978-95\".  Cuthbert pauses and gets out a key,\n     but to his surprise the door pushes open.  The lock and doorknob\n     mechanism are both broken off!  Cuthbert frowns.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    What the... ?\n\n     He goes inside.\n\n     INT. WHITTLESLEY COLLECTION BASEMENT - DAY\n\n     Cuthbert flips on a light to see a tall, narrow space.  Stacks of metal\n     shelves reach up into the gloom.  Everywhere we see spears, shields,\n     masks, various artifacts.  Ancient tribal costumes lie shrouded in\n     plastic like corpses against the walls.  And in the middle of the\n     gloom, sitting ominously in the light of a sole hanging bulb are... \n\n     THE WHITTLESLEY CRATES.  The same ones last seen in the hold of the\n     ill-fated Santa Lucia.  They are scattered about in disarray.  One in\n     particular has been broken open, its contents spread on the floor.\n     Cuthbert mutters in surprise and dismay, kneels by the crate.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    No, it can't be.\n\n     Cuthbert feels gently through the packing material, lets out a sigh of\n     relief as he pulls out a figurine.  It is a small, beautifully carved\n     statue of A MONSTER crouched on all fours.\n\n     The room falls totally silent as Cuthbert studies THE RELIC.  It's a\n     truly frightening piece... massive, razor sharp claws, large round\n     nostrils, enormous teeth and red rimmed eyes.  Suddenly Cuthbert sees a\n     DROP OF BLOOD on his hand!  He's been CUT!\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Damn.\n\n     Cuthbert rises, shakes his finger in pain.  Blood drips on the floor.\n     He pulls out his pocket handkerchief and wraps the wound.  The\n     handkerchief rapidly soaks through.  Suddenly a HAND CLAMPS on\n     Cuthbert's shoulder!  He's not alone!  He lets out a YELP, almost\n     dropping the Relic and spins to see... \n\n     A MUSEUM GUARD standing behind him.  His nameplate reads... BEAUREGARD.\n     He's a gentle young fellow with white blond hair and a rolling\n     southern accent.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Beauregard!  You scared me half to\n                    death.\n\n                              BEAUREGARD\n                    I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Someone broke into this room.\n\n                              BEAUREGARD\n                    Anything missin'?\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Doesn't look like it.  We're damned\n                    lucky.  This statue is priceless.\n\n     Cuthbert holds up the RELIC of THE MONSTER.  Beauregard stares.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Mbwun.  A South American warrior\n                    deity.  He carries a powerful curse.\n                    Every member of the expedition that\n                    found this statue, died.\n\n     Beauregard sees Cuthbert's cut finger.\n\n                              BEAUREGARD\n                    Looks like the curse is still at\n                    work.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    The claws are sharp... I must have\n                    cut myself.\n                        (uneasy laugh)\n                    Better move these crates to the\n                    secure storage area where they'll be\n                    safe.\n\n     Beauregard studies the door as Cuthbert heads out with the figurine.\n\n                              BEAUREGARD\n                    Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr.\n                    Cuthbert.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Why not?\n\n                              BEAUREGARD\n                    No one broke into this room, sir.\n                    Someone broke out.  That lock was\n                    torn off from the inside.\n\n     Cuthbert glances at the evil face of Mbwun, pales.  As he exits, HOLD\n     ON BEAUREGARD, left alone with the crates.\n\n     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - DAY\n\n     Huge centrifuges, hissing autoclaves, electrophoresis apparati,\n     glowing monitors, elaborate blown-glass distillation columns and\n     titration set-ups.  One of the most advanced technical facilities of\n     its kind.  And mixed in with all the modern machinery are\n\n     SKELETONS OF ALL KINDS.  Complete homo sapien specimens are scattered\n     around the room.  Standing midst all this is GREGORY KAWAKITA, early\n     twenties.  Kawakita makes sharp, jerky overhead movements with his left\n     hand, waving something about.  He's practicing casting.  We hear the\n     zing of a line and the whirring of the fly reel as MARGO ENTERS.  A fly\n     whips out, passing right under her nose.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Third from the end!  Right shoulder.\n                    Aleut, provenance unknown.\n\n     The fly zooms across the room and lights on the shoulder of the third\n     skeleton from the end, labeled \"Aleut, provenance unknown.\" Margo\n     rolls her eyes and Kawakita smiles with pride.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    If I spent half the time on my\n                    Fractal Evolution thesis that I\n                    spend on this fly rod, I'd have my\n                    PhD.\n\n                              MARGO\n                        (small smile)\n                    But at what a price.\n\n     Kawakita reels in his line as Margo drops her backpack on her large\n     desk.  An enormous MICROSCOPE stands by the equally imposing computer\n     topped by a tiger skull.  A screen saver of an animated pterodactyl\n     plays.  Margo unpacks boxes of fossil teeth, hits some keys revealing\n     columns of seemingly indecipherable chemical equations on the computer\n     screen.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I have the species identification on\n                    these teeth.  We can extract DNA and\n                    start running tests on the\n                    extrapolator program.  Call Dr.\n                    Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Margo, you haven't heard?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    What?\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Frock's been fired.\n\n     Margo straightens, stunned.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    That's impossible.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                        (awkward)\n                    I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad\n                    tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph.\n                    Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the\n                    definitive word from Cuthbert's\n                    secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last\n                    week.\n\n     Margo is already out the door.\n\n     INT. CORRIDORS/STAIRWELL - MUSEUM - DAY\n\n     Margo charges through double doors leading into the southwest tower.\n     She half runs down an elegant, Edwardian fifth-floor corridor, her\n     footsteps lost in the thick carpet.  At the very end is a heavy oak\n     door bearing a plate entwined with bronze leaves that reads simply\n     \"Dr. Frock\".\n\n     INT. FROCK'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Margo bursts into the unique office, which is in startling contrast to\n     the modernity of her own.  Two large bow windows look out over the\n     park.  Upholstered Victorian chairs in a leaf motif sit on needlepoint\n     carpets featuring large red roses.  Plant specimens and drawings of\n     flora and fauna line the walls.  Cardboard boxes cover the floor.\n     Seated in a wheelchair is a white-haired man in a tweed jacket and a\n     loud floral tie.  Glasses slip down his nose.\n\n     This is DR. FROCK, and he's in the middle of packing.  He looks up,\n     smiles apologetically.\n\n                              DR. FROCK\n                    Hello, Margo.  Sorry about the mess.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Is it true?  Greg said you'd been\n                    fired.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert\n                    so tactfully put it, the museum\n                    needs new blood.  And since I've been\n                    here since the Mesozoic Era --\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I don't believe it.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert\n                    has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving\n                    makes perfect sense.  This isn't\n                    exactly early retirement.  I've\n                    overstayed the party a bit.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    We can't do without you.  You're one\n                    of the foremost authorities on\n                    primitive pharmacology.  You're\n                    practically an institution around\n                    here.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    That, apparently, is the problem.\n                    I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a\n                    Curator of Plant Biology in a museum\n                    with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters\n                    and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans\n                    are the new currency of the realm.\n\n     Frock goes back to his work packing to hide his emotion and Margo\n     moves to his side.  She pulls Frock's books back out of the box,\n     returns them to his desk.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    \"Phyletic Transformation and the\n                    Tertiary Fern Spike\" is not going\n                    anywhere.  I'll talk to Cuthbert and\n                    put a stop to this right now.\n\n     She starts for the door and Frock wheels into her path.  Now for the\n     first time she sees what he's been carefully hiding... the deep pain in\n     his eyes.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Please.  Don't humiliate me further.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Let me help.  I can take care of\n                    everything.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    No, Margo.  This is one problem you\n                    can't solve.  You have to stay out of\n                    it.  The fact is, I want to retire.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    How can you say that?  You know it's\n                    not true.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no\n                    longer needed --\n\n                              MARGO\n                    My work on fossil intermediates\n                    would be crippled without you.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    With all due respect, dear, that's\n                    bull.  You dance rings around me with\n                    your new technology.  You've left me\n                    in the dust.\n\n                              MARGO\n                        (stubbornly loyal)\n                    Your work is highly relevant.  What\n                    about your display on Primitive\n                    Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me\n                    himself he was going to feature it\n                    prominently in the Superstition\n                    Exhibit.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Healing plant use among the Ki tribe\n                    of Bechuanaland has been cancelled\n                    to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.\n\n     Frock reaches out and squeezes her hand gently with a look that says\n     the discussion is over.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Come on.  I'll walk you back to the\n                    elevator.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I'm not giving up.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    You must.\n\n     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAYS - DAY\n\n     Frock rolls back down the hall the way Margo just came.  Margo is\n     beside him, downcast.  She's not used to defeat.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    This isn't a death sentence.  Greg\n                    has promised to teach me fly\n                    fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    You are this museum.  It won't be the\n                    same without you.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Everyone needs a change of scenery.\n                    I've been rolling down these halls\n                    for forty-odd years.  That's quite\n                    enough.\n\n     Margo gets in the elevator reluctantly.  He smiles and meets her eye.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    I'll see you at lunch.\n\n     He waves her off merrily.  But once the doors close and Margo's out of\n     sight, Frock's smile fades and his shoulders sag.  He ducks his\n     wheelchair quickly into the Hall of African Mammals.\n\n     INT. HALL OF AFRICAN MAMMALS - AFTERNOON\n\n     Two stories high, dark and dramatic.  A very special display.  Dioramas\n     of lions, hippos, wart hogs etc.  In the middle is a large statue of a\n     GORILLA beating its chest.  Frock takes refuge in the darkness of the\n     exhibit.  His wheelchair sits in a quiet corner and we see him quickly\n     wipe the back of his hands across his eyes.\n\n     INT. MOLLUSKS EXHIBIT - DAY\n\n     Shells and sea life line the walls.  A sign announces the exhibit\n     \"Mollusks and Our World.\"  The THIRD GRADE CLASS sweeps in.  Larry and\n     Henry start to sing \"Mollusks and Our World\" to the tune of \"Welcome\n     to Our World\", the F.A.O. Schwartz theme song.  Mrs. Beasley shoots\n     them the evil eye and Henry whines... \n\n                              HENRY\n                    Mrs. Beasley, it's almost time to go\n                    and we still haven't seen the\n                    dinosaurs!\n\n                              BEASLEY\n                    If you ask me about the dinosaurs\n                    once more, I'II strangle you both!\n\n     She starts to lecture about horseshoe crabs in a droning monotone.\n     Henry and Larry hang back.\n\n                              LARRY\n                        (whispers)\n                    This room sucks.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    She's never going to take us to see\n                    the dinosaurs.  That lady said they\n                    were on the fourth floor.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    Let's ditch and find them ourselves.\n\n     They dart off down a side corridor and up a wide stairs.\n\n     INT. REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS ROOM - DAY\n\n     Larry and Henry emerge and walk wide-eyed among the cases of lizards,\n     chameleons, tortoises.  High windows light the room.  Outside the sun is\n     going down.  A woman pushing a child in a stroller exits and the boys\n     have the hall to themselves.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    Look at this.  A Komodo dragon.\n\n     As Larry checks out, the huge, dragon-like reptile, which has just\n     sunk its Jaws into a stuffed boar.  Henry points to a stuffed Gecko\n     climbing vertically up the side of its case.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    Check out this one.  It can walk up\n                    walls.\n\n     Larry already has his eyes on the far end of the hall where temporary\n     barricades have been put up to prevent access to the next room.\n     Painting is in progress.  Scaffolding just begs to be climbed.  Henry\n     runs over and starts up the scaffolding.  Larry hesitates.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    We're not supposed to go back there.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    Chicken.  This is a great short cut.\n\n     Henry drops on the other side of the scaffolding and Larry follows.  In\n     a moment both disappear from sight.\n\n     INT. MUSEUM HALL OF BIRDS - DAY\n\n     Windowless and dark.  A closed display under maintenance.  Thousands of\n     little stuffed birds line the walls from floor to ceiling, white\n     cotton poking out of sightless eyes.  Henry and Larry enter and slow\n     down.  Larry's getting scared.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    I don't want to go this way.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    Don't be a wuss.  Come on.\n\n     The boys continue onward more slowly, their footfalls echoing in the\n     silence.\n\n     INT. BACK HALLWAYS - DAY\n\n     The children are now far from the other tourists and their class.\n     Larry is frightened.  The hall takes a sharp dog-leg, ending in a\n     darkened cul-de-sac full of display cases filled with hideous carved\n     masks.  Against the side of the chamber is a barricade of wood which\n     looks much like a wall.  Henry tugs at it and the barricade moves.  He\n     looks behind.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    Hey, there's a secret staircase back\n                    here.  Cool.\n\n     Henry disappears behind the barricade leaving Larry completely alone\n     in the dark room with the Shaman masks.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    Henry, come back!\n\n     Henry doesn't respond.  The lights in the cases throw strange shadows.\n     Larry starts to sniffle, falls to hiccuping, sits down.  He pulls on a\n     little flap of rubber that's coming off the toe of his sneaker, all\n     bravado gone.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    Henry!  Henry!\n\n     No answer.  Larry rises and peeks behind the barricade.  He sees the\n     circular stair.  It descends into total darkness.  From below comes a\n     strange smell that makes Larry's nose wrinkle.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    Henry?\n\n     No answer.  Larry puts his first foot on the stair.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    Henry!  Come up!  Please!\n\n     With no other option but staying alone in the dark, Larry follows\n     Henry down.\n\n     INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - DAY\n\n     Larry clutches the banister, whispers... \n\n                              LARRY\n                    Henry?  Where are you?  Henry?\n\n     Larry takes another step.  Another.  And another.  He stops.  Below him he\n     hears SNUFFLING, rather like a large dog.  Larry freezes, starts to\n     cry.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    Henry!  Henry!  It smells awful.\n                    Answer me!  Are you all right?\n\n     Larry can barely see a dim hallway stretching out in two directions.\n     He pauses near the bottom of the stairs, eyes wide, holding his\n     breath.  There appears to be a darker area of SHADOW at the end of the\n     hall.  It's gliding TOWARDS THEM!\n\n     Suddenly something CLOSES on Larry's leg and he YELPS.  It's HENRY.\n     Henry pulls Larry the rest of the way down the stairs.  They stand\n     alone together in the darkness.  Henry hisses.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    Quiet!\n\n                              LARRY\n                    What is it?\n\n                              HENRY\n                    I don't know.  But I think it's bad.\n\n     They keep their eyes locked on the shape at the end of the hall as\n     they back up, step by step.  Move in as their faces suddenly TWIST WITH\n     FEAR.  THE BOYS... SCREAM BLOODY MURDER... The sound echoes in the\n     darkness as we... \n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     INT. MARGO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Margo sits up in the darkness, gasping.  Moonlight cuts across the bed.\n     It takes a moment for her to realize that she's had a nightmare.  She\n     reaches for her light.  As she switches it on, we see a photo on her\n     bedside table.  It shows a group on a mountain in TIBET.  There are\n     several people with their arms slung around each other.  At the end is\n     a younger MARGO holding hands with JOHN WHITTLESLEY.  They appear to be\n     more than friends.\n\n     ON MARGO... she looks at the photo a moment, then turns off the light\n     and lies back, alone in her bed.\n\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY\n\n     Yellow crime tape encircles the museum.  Dead leaves swirl in clusters\n     and the sky is overcast.  Overnight, fall turned to winter.  The front\n     of the museum is ringed with police cars.  Margo rides up on her bike\n     and pauses, startled at the sight.  We watch as she crosses, has a few\n     words with one of the officers who motions her to a side entrance.  She\n     wheels her bike under a stone tunnel as we pick up... \n\n     A TAXI CAB arriving at the front entrance.  Out steps SPECIAL AGENT\n     PENDERGAST.\n\n     INT. LOWER ROTUNDA - DAY\n\n     Margo enters.  The huge hall is taken up by an enormous boat carved\n     from the trunk of a single tree.  Inside it are mannequins of Northwest\n     Coast Indians.  Milling around are at least twenty COPS.  One\n     approaches.\n\n                              COP\n                    ID.\n\n     Worried, Margo hands it over.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    What's going on?\n\n                              COP\n                    All employees are to go to the IMAX\n                    room for a briefing, Dr. Green.\n\n     INT. SIDE HALL - MUSEUM - DAY\n\n     Several cops go by with tracking dogs.  Margo looks back at the dogs,\n     increasingly uneasy, almost bumps into... \n\n     HENRY AND LARRY.  Surprisingly, they are alive and well and seated with\n     MRS. BEASLEY outside an office.  Margo exchanges a look with both boys,\n     remembering them from yesterday.  A tentative smile starts but Henry\n     and Larry don't return it.  Serious and chastened, they drop their\n     eyes.  Margo continues on.\n\n     TWO COPS stand outside the door to the rest room, their backs turned\n     to Margo as she approaches.\n\n                              COP ONE\n                    What was that?  Six?\n\n                              COP TWO\n                    Lost count.\n\n     Margo glances past them to see an OLDER MAN wearing the badge of a\n     NIGHT WATCHMAN, leaning over a sink.  He wipes his mouth.  Margo's eyes\n     move down to see... THE MAN'S SNEAKERS are soaked in blood.\n\n     INT. HALL OF ADVANCED FOSSIL MAMMALS - DAY\n\n     More cops gather, surrounded by skeletons of primates... humans,\n     monkeys, gorillas.  It's an odd sight.  They all look up with interest\n     as in walks the imposing figure of... \n\n     SPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST.  He turns to a young eager beaver, OFFICER\n     BAILEY, flashes his badge.  Bailey straightens to attention.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Could you please take me to the\n                    officer in charge?\n\n     INT. CIRCULAR STAIRWELL - DAY\n\n     Pendergast follows Bailey as they descend the rickety old metal\n     staircase that goes into the bowels of the museum.  The hall below them\n     is narrowand lit by an occasional bare bulb.  The stairway opens onto a\n     maze-like set of rooms in the basement.  Everything around them is\n     STREAKED and SPATTERED in BLOOD.  There are trails of it on the floor,\n     the walls, the overhead light.\n\n     Several COPS stand guard as DETECTIVE VINCE D'AGOSTA goes over the\n     area.  He is a round, balding, man with an unmistakable air of\n     authority.  A modern knight in shining armor in disguise... deep\n     disguise.  He has on a cheap polyester short sleeved shirt.  His t-shirt\n     is plainly visible underneath.  On his worn plastic belt is a badge.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Don't touch anything until the\n                    S.O.C.  has finished with those\n                    stairs.  Keep everyone clear of the\n                    perimeter.  I don't want any\n                    contamination.  There's an incredible\n                    amount of blood evidence down here.\n                    We need more light.  Where's the\n                    photographer?  Tell him to quit\n                    eating donuts, I need him.\n\n     As Pendergast enters, D'Agosta looks up at this serious African-\n     American in simple black suit, white shirt and dark tie.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Who are you?  The undertaker?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Not at all.  I think we may be\n                    working on the same case.  If so, I\n                    could use your help.\n\n     The two men shake hands.  They couldn't be more different.  Pendergast\n     is an elegant intellectual... D'Agosta a working class spark plug who\n     operates from the gut.  Pendergast gestures to the form on the ground.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    The body?\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    What's left of it.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Mind if I have a look?\n\n     D'Agosta calls to A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER who comes down the staircase\n     carrying lights, a donut stuffed in his mouth.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    We need light in here, stat.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Where's the head?\n\n     D'Agosta points to a lump the size of a bowling ball that's in the\n     corner.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Careful.  That mess on the ground is\n                    brains.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Whose footprints?\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Night watchman who found the body.\n                    Sweet old man.  Been tossing his\n                    cookies for over an hour.  Not a\n                    likely suspect.\n\n     The photographer is finally ready and he floods the dark room with\n     light.  And now everyone (but not us) gets a very clear look at the\n     body.\n\n     THE PHOTOGRAPHER... spits out his donut.  His eyes roll up and he drops\n     in a dead faint.  Just like that.  D'Agosta swallows hard.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Woof.\n\n     Pendergast looks down, utterly impassive.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Yes, I'd say we're definitely\n                    working on the same case.\n\n     INT. IMAX ROOM - DAY\n\n     An old 19th century theater.  Balconies.  Heavy curtains.  It looks like\n     the theater where Lincoln was shot, with the exception of the most\n     recent addition, an IMAX SCREEN five stories high.  The room is filling\n     with museum employees, all murmuring anxiously.  Margo sits down next\n     to Frock's wheelchair.  Her face is ashen.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Dr. Frock, I just saw a man back\n                    there who'd been wading in blood.\n\n     As Greg Kawakita sits in the chair next to Margo... \n\n                              MARGO (CON'T)\n                    For once I'm glad you're rumor\n                    central.  What in the world is going\n                    on?\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Someone's been murdered.  Not shot,\n                    strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn\n                    limb from limb.  There's talk of a\n                    psychotic killer or even an animal.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    For heaven's sake, Greg, someone's\n                    been killed.  Look, it's Cuthbert.\n                    Let's hear what really happened.\n\n     At this everyone falls silent and IAN CUTHBERT steps forward to\n     address the crowd.  He appears drawn and grey.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    This has been a tragic and upsetting\n                    morning.  I have terrible news for us\n                    all.  A member of our security force\n                    has been found murdered.  The police\n                    have just informed me it was Daniel\n                    Beauregard.\n                        (murmuring fills the room)\n                    Quiet.  Please.  With the help of our\n                    head of security, Mr. Ippolito... the\n                    museum has been secured.\n\n     IPPOLITO... rises in the back and nods to the crowd... He's an imperious\n     looking, pompous man with shifty eyes.  Right now he's defensive.\n     Overnight, his job is on the line... \n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    The police are satisfied we're in no\n                    danger, that we're all perfectly\n                    safe.  We've been asked to remain in\n                    the Gem Room and be available for\n                    questioning for the rest of the day.\n                    Obviously, we will all do everything\n                    we can to cooperate.  Are there any\n                    questions?\n\n     Ippolito raises a hand.\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    The party for the opening of the\n                    Superstition Exhibit... I imagine in\n                    the light of what's happened it will\n                    be pushed back.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    No action has been taken yet.  The\n                    opening of the exhibit is crucial to\n                    the financial health of this museum.\n                    So for now, we expect that the\n                    Superstition Exhibit will open on\n                    schedule, tomorrow night.\n\n     Ippolito registers surprise.  The audience buzzes again.\n\n     INT. GEM ROOM - DAY\n\n     Margo, Dr. Frock and Greg Kawakita enter.  The room is full of\n     spectacular displays of gemstones of every type.  Greg drapes himself\n     over a grey sofa.  Margo leans on a giant geode.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work.\n                    Someone's dead and all he cares\n                    about is his Superstition Exhibit.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Cuthbert's counting on the\n                    exhibition's success.  The museum is\n                    in debt.  Contributions and public\n                    funding have dried up.  Admissions no\n                    longer cover overhead.  The last big\n                    infusion of cash we had was the King\n                    Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to\n                    get us out of the red.  If the\n                    Superstition Exhibit isn't\n                    lucrative, he'll have to start\n                    auctioning off some of these gems.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    With all this bad publicity, it's no\n                    wonder he looks like that.\n\n     They glance over and see Cuthbert in the corner.  He appears ill, is\n     compulsively fingering his watch chain from which hangs a RABBIT'S\n     FOOT.  Frock goes over to speak to him, followed by Margo and Greg.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Ian.

I\n                    may have been the last one to see\n                    him alive.  He was with me just\n                    yesterday, when I got out the statue\n                    of Mbwun.\n\n                              MARGO\n                        (taken aback)\n                    Mbwun.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                        (sensing more gossip)\n                    What's that?\n\n     Margo frowns, suddenly uneasy.

Dr.\n                    John Whittlesley led an expedition\n                    that found the only known\n                    representation of Mbwun.

Beauregard was there.\n                    The crates had been broken into and\n                    the contents were strewn about.  But\n                    nothing was missing.  It was\n                    downright weird.  We joked that it\n                    was the curse of Mbwun.

But you're among\n                    scientists here.  We deal in facts.\n                    That statue had nothing to do with\n                    what happened to Beauregard.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    All I know is, everyone who has come\n                    in contact with that relic, is dead.\n\n     INT. BUSINESS OFFICES - MUSEUM - DAY\n\n     D'Agosta has set up a temporary command post among the antique desks\n     and chairs.  The room is on the ground floor with a view of the park.\n     Gawkers are outside looking in.

Twelve bodies\n                    on board.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil,\n                    wasn't it?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours.\n                    All the corpses were badly mutilated\n                    in a very particular way.\n                    Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs\n                    torn to shreds.  It looked like the\n                    work of a large animal, but there\n                    was no sign of an animal on board.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    So the method of death is the only\n                    connection?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    No.  There's more.

MUSEUM CLASSROOM - DAY\n\n     A modern classroom that has been taken over by the police for the\n     purpose of interrogation.  Seated on small chairs at a plain table\n     are... \n\n     HENRY and LARRY, looking like two little boys with a story they are\n     desperate to share.  Standing behind them is MRS. BEASLEY, starchier\n     than ever.  D'Agosta takes a chair across from the boys, at their eye\n     level.  By this time of day he looks pretty rumpled and tired.\n     Pendergast stands upright and unruffled in a doorway behind.  This\n     isn't hard duty for D'Agosta.  He's surprisingly genial and at ease\n     with kids.  Larry kicks his sneaker against the table leg in\n     excitement.  Henry tugs his t-shirt.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Hi.  I'm Lieutenant D'Agosta.  You can\n                    call me Vince.  This is Special Agent\n                    Pendergast.  You can call him... \n                        (he looks to Pendergast, so formal)\n                    Special Agent Pendergast.\n\n                              BEASLEY\n                    This is Henry Weiss and Larry\n                    Bowers.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    So... Tell us about this monster.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    We were lost and trying to find a\n                    short cut to the dino--\n\n     Henry elbows him hard.  Larry shuts up.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    We were just lost, okay?  And we went\n                    down this curvy staircase.  At the\n                    bottom was a big shadow.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    Big as a house.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    Not that big.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    Well almost.  Depends which house.  It\n                    smelled like old hamburger, and it\n                    made this weird noise.\n\n     Henry makes a low GROWL in his throat.  D'Agosta suppresses a smile,\n     shoots Pendergast a look.  But Pendergast watches the kids intently.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    And it snuffled the ground like a\n                    dog.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    Like this.\n\n     He goes on hands and knees, sniffs the ground.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    It had a long tongue, teeth this big\n                    and yellow eyes.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    They were green eyes and they were\n                    slit like a lizard's.\n\n                              LARRY\n                    They were yellow!\n\n                              HENRY\n                    You're color blind.\n\n                              BEASLEY\n                    Boys, please!\n                        (to D'Agosta)\n                    These two get in a lot of mischief\n                    and they tell some amazing whoppers.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    I can see that.\n\n                              HENRY\n                    This isn't a whopper!

And\n                    we got through a little door just in\n                    time.  There was a guard there and he\n                    went back to check.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    A guard?

NEW YORK CITY MORGUE - EVENING\n\n     D'Agosta and Pendergast thread their way down a hall lined with bodies\n     on gurneys.  It's dark and quiet.  They go into the autopsy room.\n\n     INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\n     A large gurney, currently empty, sits like an uninvited guest under\n     the bright lights of the autopsy suite.  Beside it is a tall, imposing\n     doctor in her late 50's, with intense eyes.  This is DR. ZIEWZIC.  With\n     her are the PHOTOGRAPHER seen passing out at the museum, and a young\n     intern, DOCTOR GROSS.\n\n                              DR.

Pendergast, Dr.\n                    Ziewzic.  She runs the best chop shop\n                    in New York.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    We've met.

Afterwards\n                    you sent me that amazing case of\n                    Chateau Lafitte.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I hope you liked it.\n\n                              DR.

The shape under the plastic seems too small to be human.  To\n     the side of it is a large bump, presumably the head.  The two pieces of\n     cadaver are slid onto the gurney and wheeled under the lights.  A\n     stainless steel bucket is placed under the gurney's outlet pipe.

The photographer goes green, but is\n     determined not to clutch this time.  PENDERGAST leans closer, totally\n     impassive.  He puts on a small pair of wire rim glasses, assumes an\n     expression much like a man reading a menu in a restaurant.\n\n                              DR.

Blond.\n                    Height well I can't give a height\n                    because Mr. Beauregard has been\n                    decapitated.  The state of the body\n                    is such that other identifying marks\n                    are out of the question.

This is a massive\n                    wound, two feet long and a foot\n                    wide.  The head has suffered severe\n                    trauma and the occipital portion of\n                    the calavarium has been crushed and\n                    removed.

I'm now probing the wound\n                    and... there's a piece of foreign\n                    material deep in the muscle, lodged\n                    on a rib.  Photograph.\n\n     The photographer gathers his courage, steps forward with D'Agosta and\n     Pendergast.  Zwiezic rinses the object off in a beaker of sterile\n     water.  It turns brownish red.  She holds it up.  They all stare in\n     astonished silence.  D'Agosta swallows.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Sweet Jesus.\n\n                              DR.

If there's one thing\n                    that makes me queasy it's being part\n                    of a food chain.  My first case as a\n                    rookie, two brothers climbed a fence\n                    at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over\n                    ninety.  The polar bear was inside\n                    his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in\n                    there.  All they saw was the pool.\n                    They got to swimming and splashing.\n                    The noise woke up the bear.  By the\n                    time I arrived, both little boys\n                    were in pieces.  The bear was\n                    dragging one kid around by the foot.\n                    I can still hear the mother\n                    screaming --\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    This isn't an animal, Vince.

He developed his own theory\n                    that he called the Calisto Effect.\n                    It held that evolution wasn't always\n                    gradual or driven by natural\n                    selection.  The environment would\n                    sometimes cause sudden and grotesque\n                    changes which could result in a\n                    \"monster species\".  It made no sense.\n                    But he felt he had evidence that\n                    Mbwun was such a monster, living in\n                    isolation on the tepui for thousands\n                    of years.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    What happened?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No one knows.  The Kothoga who live\n                    on the tepui are cannibals.\n\n     Margo's voice catches again.  Pendergast reaches for his handkerchief\n     but she shakes her head, determined to keep control.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this\n                    affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get\n                    help.  His ego endangered the lives\n                    of others.  His theory came first.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    What if Whittlesley arrived on the\n                    tepui and no monster was there?  Was\n                    he desperate enough to create one?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I don't understand.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Something came up in autopsy\n                    tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's\n                    body we found a claw.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    My God.  Then it was an animal.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I don't think so.  I think we were\n                    meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did\n                    Whittlesley's monster have claws?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I don't know.  He sent back a statue\n                    that's supposed to be an exact\n                    representation.  But I've never seen\n                    it.  It's in the exhibit.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Would you mind showing it to me?\n\n     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT\n\n     This exhibit is unlike anything we've seen in the museum.  Horrifying\n     artifacts under single spots appear to float in a velvet blackness.\n     Patterns of light and shadow play over skeletons and voodoo dolls.\n     There are tombs, a torture chamber, and endlessly curving, maze-like,\n     winding halls.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Where would we find it?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I'm not sure.  We should split up.\n                    You take that hall and I'll take\n                    this one.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    All right.  I'm as macho as you are.\n                    Perhaps.\n\n     Without further discussion, Margo takes the right fork leaving\n     Pendergast behind.\n\n     ON MARGO... \n\n     As she finds herself alone.  The silence is intense.  She heads slowly\n     into another long, dark, tunnel passing a set of Maori tattooed heads.\n     The eyes are stuffed with fibers, the shriveled lips are drawn back\n     from rotting teeth.  Margo passes without a look.\n\n     ON PENDERGAST\n\n     In another part of the exhibit, he nears a Mayan tomb.  A skeleton in\n     the center wears a headdress and tribal robes.  Gold rings encircle\n     bony fingers.  Pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it, heads into\n     the next hall.\n\n     ON MARGO\n\n     getting farther from pendergast, and ever deeper into the gloom.  The\n     walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft.  There are\n     shaman dancers, masks covered in grasses and shells.  From the New\n     Guinea coast there is Kokpah, God of a secret male society, and Zoe-\n     ba, an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed mask.\n\n     Finally the walls open up into another gallery.  Beyond it is more of\n     the shadowy hall.  Margo stops and for the first time she wavers.  This\n     gallery is the most frightening yet.  It features images of THE DEVIL\n     from different cultures around the world.\n\n     In the dim light, Margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of SATAN,\n     TORNARSUK (the Eskimo evil spirit), INCUBI from India, Tibet, New\n     Guinea etc.  And there in the center of the gallery sitting on an altar\n     and lit by a spot, is a small figurine.  Margo is instantly drawn to\n     it.  As she gets close enough she sees the label in Gothic letters.\n\n                              MBWUN\n\n                    Savage God of the Kothoga, also\n                    known as \"HE WHO WALKS ON ALL\n                    FOURS\".\n\n     The statue is terrifyingly life-like.  Margo stares at The Beast.  Mbwun\n     is covered in scales and stiff hair, with glittering green eyes and\n     crude, reptilian features.  The figure is hunched over in a threatening\n     crouch.  It's long forearms trail to the ground ending in THREE LARGE\n     CLAWS!\n\n     ON MARGO... she starts, then remembers Pendergast.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Mr. Pendergast!  I found it.\n\n     No answer.  She turns, tries again, louder.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Pendergast!  Over here --\n\n     Her voice catches as she stops and sniffs the air.  A STENCH rolls over\n     her.  She covers her face, backs up, holding her breath.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    What the... \n\n     She steps directly into a nasty statue of the Tibetan lord of the\n     Dead.  Margo starts, steadies the statue.  The room is silent once more.\n     But then, unmistakably... she hears it.  An odd rustling sound.  Slow.\n     Deliberate.  Maddeningly soft on the thick carpet.  And another wave of\n     THE SMELL.  Margo looks in the direction she came, down the long dark\n     hall.  Her voice comes out a bit frightened as she calls... \n\n                              MARGO\n                    Pendergast?\n                        (no answer)\n                    Who's there?\n\n     But now she freezes.  At last she's truly scared.  A shadow, black\n     against black, is gliding stealthily towards her, moving over the\n     display cases and grinning artifacts!\n\n     Margo stands stock still, her eyes on the shadow.  She lets out a small\n     gasp of shock.  She can't believe her eyes.  It defies reason.  Slowly,\n     she backs up.  She slips quietly through the exhibit and out the other\n     side.  In the next room she pauses again, listens... now hearing a\n     distinctly animal, SNUFFLING SOUND!\n\n     Something large is TRACKING HER!  There's no doubt.\n\n     Overcome by a blind panic, Margo turns and runs.  She passes through a\n     display on mythical creatures, disappears down another winding dark\n     hall.\n\n     Behind her comes... \n\n     THE POUNDING OF SOMETHING IN A HEAVY, LOPING RUN!  Whatever it is, it's\n     charging after her!  She turns another corner.  And another, tearing as\n     fast as she can!  But now the walls up ahead are narrowing, leading to\n     ... a DEAD END!\n\n     Margo slams up against a locked door with a window of glass.  The hall\n     features displays of terrifying totem poles.  All around the ghoulish\n     carved faces seem to leap out!  She pounds on the door but it's\n     useless.  She's trapped.  And the thing is coming behind her!  It's just\n     around the last bend when it stops!  Silence again envelops her.  She's\n     afraid to turn.  She can hear HEAVY BREATHING, and something like a low\n     growl!  Reflected in the glass of the door in front of her is the long\n     dark hall.  Margo starts as a face appears IN THE REFLECTION... \n\n     The image is wavering and unclear.  It's a large, hulking form behind\n     her!  TWO GLOWING SLIT GREEN EYES in the dark!  Margo SCREAMS as the\n     thing leaps forward, hitting one of the totem poles.  Margo sinks to\n     the ground, unconscious.  At last we hear Pendergast calling as\n     darkness falls.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Dr. Green!  Dr. Green!\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT\n\n     ON MARGO... lying on the carpet.  There's a large, nasty bump on her\n     forehead.  The totem pole is on the floor beside her.  Leaning over her\n     is PENDERGAST.  Margo starts to sit up.  Pendergast gently restrains\n     her.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    What happened?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I don't know.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I heard you calling and I ran after\n                    you, but you kept disappearing and I\n                    couldn't keep up.\n\n                              MARGO\n                        (she touches her forehead)\n                    You were behind me?  Running after\n                    me?\n\n     Pendergast nods.  As Margo rises he tries to help her but she waves him\n     off, collecting her thoughts.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember\n                    now... It was an animal.  Something\n                    large!  I could smell it.  It was\n                    hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in\n                    the dark.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Where did you see it?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Behind me.  Over there.\n\n     Margo turns and points behind her to... \n\n     A large NORTHWEST COAST INDIAN MASK.  It's carved out of wood in a\n     horrible grimace, inset with two glowing green eyes.  Pendergast sees\n     it too, says nothing.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    That's not what I saw.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    All right.  If you're positive.\n\n     She leans against the wall, touches her forehead, panic overcoming her\n     again.\n\n                              MARGO (CON'T)\n                    I can't think straight at the\n                    moment.  I know how crazy this seems.\n                    Please, Mr. Pendergast, I need some\n                    fresh air.  Could you get me out of\n                    here?\n\n     EXT. ROTUNDA FRONT ENTRY - EXHIBIT - NIGHT\n\n     THREE COPS including MCNITT, RODRIGUEZ and ROGERS prepare to enter the\n     exhibit.  All are armed.  Margo watches as Pendergast gives them\n     instruction.  She appears rattled and confused.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Stay in formation together.  Take it\n                    room by room.  Check for footprints,\n                    any signs of disturbance.  If you see\n                    or hear anything the least bit\n                    suspicious, I want to know.\n\n     He points to DOYLE, an older red-haired cop who takes up a post\n     outside the exhibit.  Pendergast hands Doyle his walkie talkie.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Bailey's going to be in the guard\n                    house outside.  Officer Van Dorn is\n                    right down that hall.  When McNitt's\n                    done, he'll relieve you.\n\n     Doyle nods.  Pendergast and Margo walk out.\n\n     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n     Margo and Pendergast exit.  The cold air is like a slap in the face.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Dr. Green... \n\n                              MARGO\n                    I didn't imagine it.  I know what I\n                    saw.  Are you sure there are enough\n                    men in there?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    They're all heavily armed.\n\n                              MARGO\n                        (stops)\n                    All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm\n                    a scientist.  I like order and logic.\n                    Sometimes too much.  There's got to\n                    be an explanation.  There can't be an\n                    animal in there.  But I saw\n                    something.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    What was it?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I don't know.\n                        (she has a thought)\n                    Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get\n                    me a DNA readout on that claw.\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n     All is quiet.\n\n     INT. MUSEUM FRONT - EXHIBIT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT\n\n     The doors to the exhibit are closed.  Doyle looks at his watch,\n     impatient.  It's almost eleven now.  He pulls out his walkie talkie.\n\n                              DOYLE\n                    Bailey?  Doyle here.  I'm still\n                    waiting outside the exhibit.  Where\n                    the hell is McNitt?\n\n                              BAILEY\n                    Should be there any minute.  They\n                    came out a side door a while ago.\n                    Said the exhibit's clear.  McNitt's\n                    headed back to spell you.\n\n                              DOYLE\n                    I'm on double over-time, man.\n\n                              BAILEY\n                    I know.  You can go home if you want\n                    to.  I'll come relieve you myself.\n\n     Doyle shuts off his walkie talkie, frowns.  He fidgets, looks at his\n     watch once more.\n\n                              DOYLE\n                    What the hell.\n\n     He turns, takes off the walkie talkie and leaves it, but then he hears\n     something, stops.  It's a low SCUFFLING from inside the exhibit, coming\n     from behind the closed doors.  Doyle freezes, turns.\n\n                              DOYLE\n                    McNitt?\n\n     No answer.  Doyle pauses.  His hand goes to his gun for reassurance as\n     he hears a footstep and a muffled thump.  He moves to the door of the\n     exhibit, opens it and takes a step inside.\n\n                              DOYLE\n                    McNitt?  Cut the crap.  I know it's\n                    you.  You're not scaring me.  Come on.\n\n     Silence meets him.  The shadows of the exhibit loom.  Doyle takes one\n     more step inside, scanning the darkness with his gun.  Does he hear\n     BREATHING?  He freezes.  Yes, he does.  The hair on his neck rises and he\n     loses the spit in his mouth.  He takes a step backwards, but he's half\n     a second too late.  The door SLAMS BEHIND HIM and a HUGE DARK FORM\n     LEAPS OUT!\n\n     INT. EXHIBIT ENTRANCE - NIGHT\n\n     Officer MCNITT enters from a side corridor, zipping up his fly.  The\n     hall is still.  McNitt checks his watch, sees Doyle's walkie talkie and\n     turns it on.\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    McNitt here.  I'm outside the\n                    exhibit.  All's quiet.  But I don't\n                    see Doyle.\n\n                              BAILEY (OS)\n                    He called a minute ago looking for\n                    you.  He starts vacation tomorrow and\n                    he wanted out.  I said you were on\n                    the way.  He could split.\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    Well he's gone.\n\n                              BAILEY (OS)\n                    Any sign of a green-eyed monster?\n\n                              MCNITT\n                        (chuckles)\n                    Nope.\n\n     McNitt shuts off the walkie talkie, settles at his post.\n\n     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT\n\n     In the blackness a large shape is MOVING QUIETLY, dragging it's prey\n     across the floor.  We move in on the lifeless form of DOYLE.  His face\n     is rigid with terror, his eyes frozen, open wide.  The last thing we\n     hear as the hulking form heads back into the darkness, is the SNAPPING\n     of Doyle's skull.\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     EXT. MUSEUM - DAY\n\n     Signs announce that the Superstition Exhibit opens tonight.  The museum\n     is back in business, but not many people are going in.  A crowd lingers\n     at the margins, pointing at the building.  Several hold a copy of the\n     POST with a graphic photo of the bloody floor by the circular stair.\n\n     INT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Cuthbert stands by the window of his palatial office, looking out at\n     the scene below.  His face is pinched with worry.  Slumped in a chair is\n     Lieutenant D'Agosta.  Pendergast surveys some paintings on the wall.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I had no idea the Museum had a\n                    complete collection of Piranesi's\n                    Forum sketches.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    If you like them, they're for sale.\n                    Another day like yesterday and half\n                    the collection will be on the block.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I've read about the Museum's\n                    financial troubles.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    We've been operating in the red for\n                    years.  That was the whole idea\n                    behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It\n                    was designed to pull people in.\n                    We've spent every penny we have on\n                    advance publicity, betting\n                    everything on the opening's success.\n                    If we postpone at the last minute... \n                    No.  I don't want to think about\n                    that.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                        (chews on his toothpick, mild)\n                    We all love the museum.  I come here\n                    myself with my kids.  We're trying to\n                    work with you.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    I appreciate that.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    If the party goes forward, and\n                    that's a big if... I've arranged for\n                    a large police presence.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Do they have to wear uniforms?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Yes.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    I don't want to scare people.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert,\n                    we've got bigger problems.  Depending\n                    on what we find today, we may have\n                    to shut you down.\n\n     Cuthbert looks grim.\n\n     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - DAY\n\n     D'Agosta examines the huge centrifuges, autoclaves, electrophoresis\n     apparati, monitors, computers etc.  as Margo and Greg Kawakita look at\n     the claw.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    What do you make of it, Margo?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    It's not mammalian, that's for sure.\n                    I think it's reptilian.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    That would jive with what we got\n                    from the preliminary DNA read-out.\n                    Here, have a look.\n\n     He hands them a computer read-out.  Margo checks it quickly as Kawakita\n     looks on.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    According to this, twenty-five\n                    percent of the claw DNA is\n                    unidentifiable, about a third is\n                    homo sapien, and the rest is\n                    Hemidactylus Turcicus.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                        (looks over)\n                    What's that?\n\n     Margo pulls off her glasses.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same\n                    strand?  Impossible.  The sample must\n                    be contaminated.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    There's another possibility.  A lot\n                    of repeated base pairs could suggest\n                    a high level of genetic damage.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Genetic damage?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    When DNA is defective, it often\n                    uncontrollably replicates long\n                    repeating sequences of the same base\n                    pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can\n                    radiation, certain chemicals.  Even\n                    cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it\n                    out.  I have to get started.  This\n                    will take several hours.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    We need someone to take us to the\n                    secure storage area.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Try Dr. Frock.  He's the curator of\n                    Plant Biology.  All the curators\n                    have keys.  And he knows every inch\n                    of this museum.  The rest of us still\n                    get lost.\n\n     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAY AREA - DAY\n\n     Pendergast, D'Agosta and Dr. Frock get off are in an older, plain\n     corridor with a long row of locked heavy steel doors.  The doors are\n     numbered up to eight, then the corridor turns.\n\n     As the three go forward, the creaking of the wheelchair echoes faintly\n     in the hall.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Thank you for taking the time to\n                    help us with this, Dr. Frock.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough\n                    these days.  According to security,\n                    Beauregard put the Whittlesley\n                    crates in storage area 1012.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    How many storage areas are there?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    They fill seven floors.  We have the\n                    largest collection of mammals and\n                    dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give\n                    you an idea, there are more than\n                    three million insects specimens.  Not\n                    to mention amphibians, reptiles,\n                    birds, anthropological artifacts,\n                    meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only\n                    about five percent of the museum\n                    collection is actually on display.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    This place is a maze.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    I'm one of the few who know every\n                    inch it, now that John is gone.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                        (looks over)\n                    Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Yes.  John made quite a study of the\n                    whole museum.  He had a copy of my\n                    original plans.\n\n     Frock heads through a double door that leads to a FREIGHT ELEVATOR\n     that's as big as a small room.  The operator, KARL has it decorated\n     with a table, chair, and PICTURES.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Osteo prep, Karl.\n\n     The doors creak closed.  They are now inside... \n\n     INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY\n\n     Headed down.  D'Agosta chews on a toothpick, stares at Karl's home-made\n     picture show.  The photos have all been cut from nature magazines.  They\n     are of ANIMALS MATING in extreme positions and undreamed of ways.\n     D'Agosta turns to Pendergast, dead pan.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    My kind of art.\n\n     Karl, who is sixty and wears a red toupee, leers.\n\n                              KARL\n                    They keep me company.  Gets kinda\n                    lonely sometimes.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    My favorite is the two camels.\n\n                              KARL\n                    Really?  I'm partial to the skunks.\n\n     Finally the doors open and they exit to a hail, enter another set of\n     doors.  Now they are in\n\n     INT. OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATION AREA - DAY\n\n     It looks more like a bizarre industrial kitchen than anything else.\n     Deep stainless steel tanks line one wall.  On the ceiling near the\n     tanks hang massive pulleys and grappling hooks for the larger\n     carcasses.  In a far corner of the workshop is a stainless-steel gurney\n     bearing a DEAD GORILLA.  A pink faced eighty year old man is working on\n     the carcass with sharp tools.  This is DON OSTERBAAN.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Did you ever wonder where we get all\n                    our skeletons?  This is the\n                    laboratory where animal carcasses\n                    are reduced to bones.\n                        (to Osterbaan)\n                    What's cooking today, Don?\n\n                              DON\n                    Zebra.\n\n     Frock looks into a large maceration tank with Pendergast and D'Agosta.\n     A zebra carcass can be seen under the muddy surface, its flesh and\n     soft tissues falling off.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Man, that's ripe.\n\n     Frock now opens the door on a humid closet adjacent to the main room.\n     Inside on a stainless steel table lies the corpse of a fox.  It's\n     crawling with BLACK BEETLES which are devouring it.  D'Agosta and\n     Pendergast watch the grizzly scene, properly impressed.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Dermestid beetles.

Got one right here.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Thanks Don.  We're in a hurry.  Some\n                    other time.\n\n     INT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\n     More rows of stainless steel doors under hissing steam pipes.  The\n     light is dim here, and several bulbs are burned out.  But the numbers\n     on the storage rooms are much higher now.  The three men come out of\n     the darkness.  Frock rounds a last corner and wheels to a stop.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    This should be it.  Can you read the\n                    number?\n\n     Pendergast reaches up above them and TAPS THE LIGHT BULB.  It comes on\n     and they all see the heavy steel door of the storage area.  D'Agosta's\n     jaw drops and his toothpick falls out.  The door has been scored from\n     top to bottom by long, vicious, CLAWS!\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Holy shit.\n\n     Frock stares in amazement, shaken.  He runs a finger down the deep\n     ruts.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Something tried to get into this\n                    room!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    And failed.  These doors are solid\n                    steel.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    This means there must be an animal\n                    loose in the museum!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I wouldn't be so sure.\n\n     Pendergast takes Frock's keys and opens the door.  It swings wide on\n     oiled hinges.  D'Agosta turns on a light.\n\n     INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     They all enter.  Nothing has been disturbed.  The crates sit in the\n     middle of the small room, untouched.  Pendergast kneels by the only one\n     that's been opened.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    This must be the one that held the\n                    statue.  Let's see what else is\n                    inside.\n\n     Pendergast removes the lid and hands it to D'Agosta, pulls out a BLOW\n     DART GUN, SEED PODS, a CARVED STONE.  D'Agosta takes the lid and turns\n     it.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    The lid of this crate is scratched\n                    with claw marks, just like the door.\n\n     As D'Agosta studies the lid, a brittle, water damaged envelope slips\n     out.  D'Agosta picks it up.  The envelope bears an imprint of TWO\n     ARROWS, one silver overlaid with another of GOLD.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Look.  It's some kind of letter.\n\n                              FROCK\n                        (excited)\n                    May I see that?\n\n     D'Agosta hands the letter to Frock.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    It's from John.  Those two arrows\n                    were his insignia.  It's addressed to\n                    Louis Moriarty, a patron who\n                    financed his expeditions.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Read it out loud.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    \"Dear Louis,\n                    \tTomorrow we go to the south\n                    end of the tepui where we'll be in\n                    the greatest danger, so I'm sending\n                    Carlos back with the crates.  You\n                    always believed in me, Louis, even\n                    in the darkest days.  So it gives me\n                    great pleasure to tell you your\n                    faith has been rewarded.  We've made\n                    an incredible find.  I enclose a\n                    representation of Mbwun.  Note the\n                    exaggerated claws, the reptilian\n                    attributes, the hints of bipedalia.\n                    It's beyond belief, but this statue\n                    is accurate.  I know because I've\n                    seen the beast.\"\n\n     Frock stops, looks up at D'Agosta and Pendergast.  His face flushes\n     with the thrill.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Did you hear that?  My God.  He says\n                    that Mbwun is real!\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                        (snorts)\n                    Pardon my French, but bull shit.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    This on top of the scratches... isn't\n                    it proof!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I think the scratches were put there\n                    to scare us.  Perhaps even lead us to\n                    this note.\n\n     Pendergast looks out to the dark corridors.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    You said John Whittlesley made a\n                    study of your blueprints of the\n                    museum.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Yes.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Are there any hidden rooms or\n                    staircases?  Places where someone\n                    could hide?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Not really.  Just the sub-basement.\n\n     D'Agosta and Pendergast exchange a look.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Where is that?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    I don't know.  It was walled over.  No\n                    one's been down there in years.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    You said you had plans of the\n                    museum.  Could we see them, please?\n\n     EXT. MUSEUM SIDE DOOR - DAY\n\n     A series of boxes labeled \"PROFESSOR FROCK\" sit on the loading dock.  A\n     small moving van, partially loaded with the contents of Frock's\n     office, sits waiting.  Frock delves through one of the boxes while\n     Pendergast and D'Agosta look on.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    I know they're here somewhere.  It's\n                    a good thing we caught the movers in\n                    time.  They're nineteen century\n                    blueprints from when the museum was\n                    built.  I remember the sub-basement\n                    was below the regular basement,\n                    linked to the city sewer.  I only\n                    know about it because it flooded all\n                    the way up to the museum during the\n                    hurricane of '49.  I lost so many\n                    precious books.\n\n     Frock continues to unload boxes, scattering things right and left.\n     It's the most amazing assortment of paraphernalia.  A collection of\n     wildflowers, soil samples, a stuffed owl.  Finally he pulls out some\n     very old blueprints and flashes a triumphant smile.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Eureka.  Who says it doesn't pay to\n                    be a pack rat?  Now please be careful\n                    with these.  When you're done, I'd\n                    like them back.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE AFRICAN MAMMALS - DAY\n\n     Visitors scatter as Pendergast enters with D'Agosta, TWO DEPUTIES, a\n     dog handler, JONATHAN HAMM and Jonathan's pair of HUGE BLOODHOUNDS.\n     The deputies are armed with large shotguns.  Pendergast scans the\n     blueprints as they walk.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    How big is the sub-basement?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Apparently it's huge.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    I think I should come with you.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    We haven't got time.  You have to\n                    meet with museum security so we can\n                    make a decision about tonight.\n\n     INT. MUSEUM - STAIRCASE - DAY\n\n     Pendergast, Jonathan, his dogs and the deputies make their way down an\n     industrial set of stairs into the basement.\n\n     INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n     In a moment they arrive at the site of Beauregard's murder.  The area\n     at the bottom of the spiral stairway is still littered with chalk,\n     crime tape, spray paint and the remains of scores of people tramping\n     in and out.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    These plans indicate there's a\n                    walled over entrance to the sub-\n                    basement right around here.\n\n     They move carefully down the dark corridor which we remember from the\n     time we last saw it with Henry and Larry.  Unknown to Jonathan or\n     Pendergast, the dogs are walking directly towards the spot where the\n     boys faced the monster.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    The dogs are picking up something,\n                    Mr. Pendergast.\n\n     The dogs start barking in animation, sniffing the wall.  Pendergast\n     studies the blueprints with a flashlight, moves to the spot.  There's\n     nothing to be seen.  He shines his flashlight over the water-stained,\n     uneven stucco between two steel beams.  The dogs sniff furiously at the\n     point where the wall meets the floor.  Pendergast moves his fingers to\n     the joint between the stucco and the beam, shoves hard.  The wall\n     pushes back.  It's a door!\n\n     INT. STAIRWELL - SUB-BASEMENT - DAY\n\n     They enter a dank stairwell with brick stairs.  Water drips on the\n     walls.\n\n                              DEPUTY ONE\n                    What is this?  A dungeon?\n\n     Jonathan looks uneasy, double wraps the dogs' leashes around his\n     black-gloved hands.  The two deputies remove their 12 gauges from their\n     shoulders.  Then they all follow the animals, descend down the inky\n     stairwell.\n\n     INT. SECURITY COMMAND CENTER - MUSEUM - DAY\n\n     The place looks like the control room of a nuclear power plant.  Two\n     SECURITY GUARDS monitor a battery of closed-circuit screens.  D'Agosta\n     is now accompanied by the pompous head of security, IPPOLITO.  Clearly\n     Ippolito feels D'Agosta is pissing on his territory and he's trying to\n     assert control.\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    This huge police presence tonight\n                    isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll\n                    just scare people off.  I can handle\n                    the security behind scenes with this\n                    system.  It's state of the art.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    The cops are non-negotiable,\n                    Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me\n                    how this space station works.\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    It's fool proof, basically.  I\n                    designed this whole thing myself.\n                    Every valuable object in the Museum\n                    carries a small electronic chip.  If\n                    anything's moved so much as an inch,\n                    we get an alarm pinpointing the\n                    exact location of the attempted\n                    theft.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    That's great if you're stopping a\n                    burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are\n                    there motion detectors?\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    In every exhibition room.  The\n                    museum's divided into five cells.\n                    The reception and exhibit are in\n                    cell five.  We could arm the motion\n                    detectors in cells one to four, then\n                    seal the perimeter with our fire\n                    doors.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    That would leave one exit for\n                    hundreds of people.  You'd be\n                    violating every fire regulation on\n                    the books.  We'll guard the perimeter\n                    with my men and engage the motion\n                    detectors in the other cells.  One\n                    more question.  I see a big hole.  If\n                    this entire thing is run by\n                    computer, what happens if the power\n                    fails?\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                        (snorts)\n                    You don't know much about computers,\n                    Lieutenant.  There are safeguards\n                    built in.  We have back-up systems\n                    with redundancies.  There's no way\n                    these computers can fail.\n                    \n     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHRO LAB - DAY\n\n     Margo, Kawakita and Frock are studying the contents of the crate.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    I can't help thinking there's\n                    something that Pendergast\n                    overlooked.  If the scratches were\n                    made by whatever killed Beauregard,\n                    it wants something that's in here.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant\n                    press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Let me see the plant press.\n\n     Frock opens the plant press and sees a specimen inside.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    What is it?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    I'm not sure.  As you know, the\n                    Kothoga lived outside civilization\n                    on the tepui for thousands of years.\n                    Species flourished in isolation when\n                    man and pollution rendered them\n                    extinct.  This could be one of the\n                    last remaining samples of an unknown\n                    plant.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Whatever it is, it must be common on\n                    the tepui.

SUB-BASEMENT - DAY\n\n     Black as night.  The only light comes from the men's flashlights.\n     They're at a crossroads.  Crooked corridors, with arched ceilings\n     barely the height of a man stretch in several directions.  Jonathan is\n     crouched down, resting with the panting dogs.  The deputies are having\n     a smoke.  They all look both uneasy and exhausted except for\n     Pendergast.  He stares at the blueprints.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Hard to read in this light.  The ink\n                    is so faded.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    The dogs have lost the scent, Mr.\n                    Pendergast.  Maybe we should head\n                    back.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the\n                    left.\n\n     The men reluctantly shoulder their shotguns and push on.  The hounds\n     walk ahead, carelessly nosing the ground.  The flashlight beams\n     illuminate lime-encrusted, cave-like walls.\n\n                              DEPUTY TWO\n                    This place gives me the creeps.\n\n     At this the dogs begin to WHINE.  The HAIR on their backs rises in a\n     ridge.  Pendergast turns as a BREEZE stirs his clothes.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    They've got something.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Keep the light up.  I can't see.\n\n     The dogs strain and pull forward, sniffing the air ahead.  The deputies\n     raise up their shotguns as they all move deeper into the darkness.  The\n     flashlight beams streak crazily in all directions, barely penetrating\n     the gloom.  Suddenly the dogs break into a terrifying BAYING which\n     bounces off the walls.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Shut them up!\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!\n\n     The dogs drag Jonathan forward, paying no attention, foaming at the\n     mouth.  Jonathan is now frightened.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    They're going crazy!  I need help!\n\n     Too late.  As Jonathan tries to grab the collars, one of the dogs LEAPS\n     forward, and the leash slips through Jonathan's hands.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    He's loose!  Argo!\n\n     Argo BOLTS into the darkness.  The men start after the dog, following\n     the frantic barking which echoes farther and farther in the distance.\n     Pendergast is in the lead.  Suddenly he throws out his arms, halts.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Stop!\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Holy mother, what is that?\n\n     A goatish odor envelops them all.\n\n                              DEPUTY ONE\n                    Smells God-awful.  Like rotten meat.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Argo!  Come!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Quiet!\n\n     A SCUFFLING sound of claws dragging on brick is heard followed by a\n     ROAR.  The men all freeze.  The other dog leaps and twists with\n     excitement.  In the confusion it also breaks free!  It tears after the\n     first dog, disappearing into the darkness.  Now Jonathan is wild-eyed.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    No!  Hobbes!\n\n     The deputies are terrified, retreat.  The darkness is stifling,\n     claustrophobic.  The flashlights are small help.  Pendergast alone\n     remains dead calm.  His voice is cool and commanding.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Forget the dogs.  You two, get back\n                    here.  Don't point that gun at me.\n\n     The deputies regain control and follow Pendergast's orders.  They fall\n     into position, pump their shotguns and aim them down the hall.  In the\n     echoing darkness ahead of them, the barking falters and stops.\n\n     There is a moment of silence, then a terrible, unearthly SHRIEK.  The\n     deputies quail, frozen in their tracks.  Jonathan leaps forward.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Argo!  Hobbes!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Get back!  Now!\n\n     At that moment a SHAPE hurtles at them from the darkness!  The men YELL\n     in terror.  There are two stunning BLASTS from the shotguns, two\n     FLASHES of light accompanied by a deafening roar.  The rumble echoes\n     and dies and there's an intense silence, followed by a sob.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    You shot my dog!\n\n     Hobbes lies five feet from them, a black shadow of death.  Jonathan\n     kneels by the dog, tears in his eyes.  Down the animals side is a GASH.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    My dog... \n\n                              DEPUTY ONE\n                        (stammers)\n                    He was coming right at me... \n\n     In the distance they can hear a terrified howl.  It's the second dog,\n     hurt or frightened.  It's a pitiful sound.\n\n                              DEPUTY TWO\n                    Let's get out of here!\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    I'm not going anywhere!  Not without\n                    my dog!\n\n     Pendergast grabs at Jonathan who slips from his grasp.  Jonathan inches\n     back down the hallway calling desperately.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Hobbes!\n\n                              DEPUTY ONE\n                    Get back!\n\n     Jonathan shakes his head no.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    There's something out there!  Let's\n                    go get it now!  That's why we came\n                    down here, isn't it?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                        (to the deputies)\n                    He's right.  Follow me.\n\n     But the two deputies are terrified.  They cling to the wall, inching\n     backwards, sheer horror in their eyes.\n\n                              DEPUTY ONE\n                    No way.  I say we get help.  A lot\n                    more guns.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I'm ordering you!  Cover me!\n\n                              DEPUTY TWO\n                    We'll cover you from here!\n\n     Jonathan is disappearing in front of them.  Pendergast has no choice.\n     Grim faced, he pulls his Colt .45 Anaconda from a shoulder harness.\n     It's a narrow and evil-looking gun.  From a pocket comes a handful of\n     255 grain wadcutter and 147 grain FMJ flatnose ammunition.  He loads\n     up, goes after Jonathan, who's no longer in sight.  Pendergast passes\n     down a long, sloping hallway into cavernous blackness ahead.  At the\n     bottom Pendergast stops.  He has to stoop down as he goes through an\n     archway and into... \n\n     A VAST ARCHING ROOM... \n\n     A dark stream of water runs between concrete walls with tunnels going\n     off from all sides.  It appears to be part of the sewer system.  The dog\n     cowers in a corner.  Jonathan moves to his side.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Come on.  Let's get back to the\n                    others.  We can't leave them alone.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    It's alright.  I can tell by the way\n                    the dog's acting that whatever was\n                    out there is gone.  What is this\n                    place?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Not on the map.  Looks like it\n                    connects with the city sewer.\n\n     Pendergast calls back down the tunnel for the deputies.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    We're coming back!\n\n     The words go unanswered.  From the hall comes a loud REPORT.  It's the\n     shotguns, blasting desperately.  Something flies up all around them as\n     the sound echoes.  BATS!\n\n     Pendergast and Jonathan shield themselves from the flurry of beating\n     wings.  Finally the animals settle and Pendergast and Jonathan exchange\n     a look.  The silence is filled by a soft RUMBLING SOUND.  They stand\n     together, waiting.  Pendergast points his gun at the hall leading back\n     to the deputies.  A ridge of hair on the dog's back rises and it\n     growls.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Identify yourself!  Who's there?\n\n     No answer.  The rumbling continues, growing louder.  Then a dark object\n     appears.  It comes rolling out of the hallway, bounces in front of them\n     and stops.  Pendergast shines his light on... \n\n     DEPUTY ONE'S HEAD!  The mouth is open wide in terror.  Across the cheek\n     is a vicious claw mark.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Oh... my... God!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                        (hisses)\n                    Quiet.\n\n     And now they hear a GUT WRENCHING SHRIEK that's abruptly cut off,\n     followed by a second rumbling sound!  Jonathan grabs Pendergast by the\n     shirt, panicked.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Stay calm.\n\n     They head quietly for the exit at the other end of room which seems to\n     slope up.  After they're gone a few moments the head of DEPUTY TWO\n     rolls to a stop.\n\n     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n     Cabs and limousines tangle outside the west entrance.  A huge rotating\n     SPOTLIGHT is now turned on.  Elegantly dressed men in dinner jackets\n     and women in gowns rush to get out of the pelting rain, umbrellas\n     jousting.\n\n     INT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - EVENING\n\n     Cuthbert's putting on his tux.  He adjusts the cummerbund, humming\n     happily as D'Agosta looks on.  D'Agosta paces, highly agitated and\n     worried.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    I'm telling you, something's wrong.\n                    I still haven't heard from\n                    Pendergast.  I think you should call\n                    it off.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    It's too late now.  Guests are\n                    arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling\n                    up.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    I'll go down and speak to him.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                        (irritated)\n                    You haven't got the authority.  Only\n                    Pendergast can pull the plug.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't\n                    you understand?  He still hasn't come\n                    back.  It's been over three hours --\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good\n                    shape.  Your security is air tight.\n                    There've been no more incidents,\n                    nothing suspicious.  There's no\n                    reason to call off the opening now.\n\n     INT. GREAT ROTUNDA - NIGHT\n\n     Resounding with the echoes of several hundred expensive shoes crossing\n     the marble expanse and heading down the rows of palm trees leading to\n     the Hall of Heavens.  The palms themselves are festooned with orchids\n     and violet lights.  Somewhere inside, an invisible band is playing \"New\n     York, New York\".  An army of waiters in white tie thread their way\n     through the guests carrying large silver platters crowded with\n     champagne glasses.  Cuthbert enters and crosses to meet The MAYOR and\n     THE MAYOR'S WIFE.  Photographers step forward and flashbulbs pop.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT\n\n     Food is out.  Hundreds of tables are set with black linen table cloths.\n     Decorations have a dark, haunted house theme.  A hum of activity floats\n     up past the vast Corinthian columns into the circular dome above.\n\n     INT. MARGO'S LABORATORIES - NIGHT\n\n     An explosive sneeze rattles the beakers and dislodges the plant\n     specimens.  Margo interrupts her work at the computer to hand Greg a\n     tissue as Frock looks on.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    What kind of egg is it?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    It's reptilian.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Like the claw.\n\n                              MARGO\n                        (cautious)\n                    Let's not jump to conclusions.  This\n                    egg could belong to any number of\n                    reptiles, Dr. Frock.\n\n                              FROCK\n                        (excited)\n                    Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge\n                    of something huge.  Let's consider\n                    the possibility, just the three of\n                    us, alone in this room.  What if John\n                    was right.  I mean, what if?  And he\n                    sent back an egg of his monster in\n                    the crates.  When it got to the\n                    museum, it hatched.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Several problems with that theory.\n                    For one thing, this egg is intact.\n                    For another, according to\n                    Pendergast, the crates were shipped\n                    here on a boat.  Everyone on board\n                    was killed like Beauregard.  If the\n                    thing hatched in mid-ocean, where\n                    did it go?\n\n     Frock has no answer.  Greg gestures to his computer screen.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    I guess you're not interested in\n                    this plant anymore, but the chemical\n                    analysis is done.  Frock reads the\n                    computer over Greg's shoulder.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    \"Genus: Unknown.

An ambyloid reovirus\n                    protein.  That explains why the\n                    computer's confused.  The plant's\n                    infected with a virus.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    That's not so unusual.  Many plants\n                    carry viruses.  Like the burls on\n                    Maple trees.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    But a virus normally codes for other\n                    viruses.  This one's making human and\n                    animal proteins.  Listen to this.\n                        (reads)\n                    \"Glycotetraglycine collagenoid.\n                    Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4-\n                    monoxytocin supressin hormone.\"\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    These plant fibers are loaded with\n                    hormones!\n\n                              MARGO\n                    What kind of hormones?\n\n     Kawakita pulls a heavy book from the shelf.

He turns a corner and something\n     JUMPS OUT at him.  He almost screams.  It's a DRUNK.\n\n                              DRUNK\n                    Hey, where 'za little boys room?\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Down that hallway.

ENTRANCE TO SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - ROTUNDA - NIGHT\n\n     The crowd is now packed into the rotunda as the MAYOR cuts a red\n     ribbon across the entrance to the exhibit and everyone applauds.\n     Cuthbert is by the mayor's side.  He steps forward and raises his hand\n     for quiet.  The crowd falls silent.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Thank you everyone and welcome.\n                    We're glad all of you were willing\n                    to brave the inclement weather to be\n                    with us tonight.

More applause.\n\n                              CUTHBERT (CON'T)\n                    Some people have questioned whether\n                    a superstition exhibit belongs in a\n                    Museum of Science.  Spells,\n                    incantations, demons, magic... these\n                    are forces that defy the natural\n                    laws.  Superstition provides answers\n                    to the great questions based on\n                    fear.  Science provides answers to\n                    the great questions based on truth.\n                    Science and superstition, then, are\n                    polar opposites.  Mortal enemies, if\n                    you will.  And that is why we are\n                    here tonight.  We have come to learn\n                    more about the enemy, and thus to\n                    bring about its defeat.  For every\n                    good, there is an evil, for every\n                    dark, a light.  And so tonight... my\n                    friends, I give you ignorance,\n                    terror, unreasoning fear, pure evil.\n                        (smiles, gestures to the exhibit)\n                    Have a great time.\n\n     Everyone laughs, applauds again as Cuthbert and the Mayor lead the way\n     inside.  Kawakita is making his way over to D'Agosta.  The crush at the\n     entrance is incredible.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Lieutenant!

Please.  You have to\n                    come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found\n                    out something.\n\n     D'Agosta pulls out his walkie talkie.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    McNitt?  D'Agosta here.\n\n     INT. SECURITY COMMAND CENTER - MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n     Officer McNitt stands in the corner of the computer room, bathed in\n     neon light.  Running the security system is GEORGE, your basic computer\n     nerd.  Multiple screens all over show various rooms in the museum.  Most\n     are empty with the exception of those showing the exhibition.  On\n     these, the crowds can be seen entering the various rooms.  McNitt holds\n     his walkie talkie.\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    Yeah Lieutenant?  I'm here.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)\n                    I'm heading to the Evolutionary Bio\n                    labs.  Any sign of Pendergast?\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    Not yet.\n\n     At this moment a NOISE comes from the adjoining room.  McNitt's head\n     SWIVELS.  It's a LOUD THUMP.\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    Hold on Lieutenant.\n                        (to George)\n                    What was that?\n\n                              GEORGE\n                    Probably just something wrong with\n                    the air conditioning.  There's a shit\n                    load of electrical rooms back there.\n\n     George is playing an elaborate computer game and not paying attention.\n     McNitt returns to his walkie talkie as the THUMP comes again.  Now he\n     looks distinctly nervous.\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    Lieutenant?  There's something wrong\n                    in the computer room.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)\n                    Goddamn it.  I'll get Ippolito and\n                    send him up.\n\n     George rises.\n\n                              GEORGE\n                    You're over-reacting.  Sounds like\n                    the air conditioning to me.\n\n     McNitt watches uneasily as George opens the door, disappears into the\n     next room.\n\n     INT. ENTRANCE - SUPERSTITION EXIBIT - NIGHT\n\n     D'Agosta turns to Kawakita who waits, shifting from foot to foot.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Damn.  There's some kind of problem\n                    in the computer room.  I have to go\n                    get Ippolito.  You wait here.\n\n     D'Agosta heads into the exhibit before Kawakita can protest.\n\n     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT\n\n     We see various cuts of people as they move into the different rooms.  A\n     TEENAGE GIRL (LAUREN) and her FATHER (DAVID) examine a lidless,\n     rotting European style coffin, complete with corpse.  A white haired\n     gentleman (DR. POUND), leans on his cane as he looks at a display on\n     primitive medicine practiced with implements that look like torture\n     tools.\n\n     Cuthbert and Ippolito are at the head of a press of people, giving the\n     MAYOR and HIS WIFE a guided tour.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Here we have a very rare sacrificial\n                    table from Mesoamerica.  The priests\n                    would kill the victim on this slab,\n                    cut out the heart and eat it while\n                    it was still beating.\n\n                              MAYOR\n                    I could use one of these things in\n                    City Hall.\n\n     Cuthbert laughs right on cue.  They pass a Congo power figure with its\n     bulging eye sockets and torso riddled with sharp nails.  Several people\n     recoil from it, looking repulsed.  The MAYOR's WIFE sees it and looks\n     distressed.\n\n                              MAYOR'S WIFE\n                    You're letting kids see this?  I\n                    should think they'd have nightmares.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Kid will love it.  They're our target\n                    audience.  Nothing here is as violent\n                    as what they see on T.V.\n\n     They pass a MUMMY dripping in BLOOD.  The Mayor gestures to it.\n\n                              MAYOR\n                    I don't know.  That could be a little\n                    over the top.  It's not even\n                    scientific.  Mummies don't bleed.\n\n     Cuthbert's smile fades as he sees the mummy.\n\n     CLOSE ON... the MAYOR'S WHITE CUFF as he extends his hand to point at\n     the mummy.  The pristine white of his cuff is suddenly colored by a\n     falling RED DROP OF BLOOD.\n\n     Cuthbert sees it.  So does the Mayor and Ippolito.  They look up as\n     another DROP OF BLOOD falls right on Cuthbert's face.  And yet another\n     droplet falls on THE MAYOR'S WIFE'S white bosom, exposed by her low\n     cut dress!\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Oh... my... God... \n\n     THEIR POV... above the mummy's head, the top of the case is cut away,\n     exposing a ceiling crawling with steam pipes and ductwork.  A hand, a\n     watch, and the cuff of a blue shirt protrude over the edge of the\n     case.  A small icicle of blood hangs from the middle finger.  And\n     another drop FALLS.\n\n     CUTHBERT SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS!  Conscious of the panic\n     factor, Ippolito yells.\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    Quiet everyone!\n\n     But it's too late.  The room is packed with people.  And D'Agosta\n     himself is just pushing through the door as another woman cries out... \n\n                              WOMAN\n                    There's a body up there!\n\n     A ripple of fear goes over the faces in the room, titters as people\n     wonder if it's a joke.  At that moment from the darkness above, the\n     ceiling buckles and something FALLS!\n\n     It's OFFICER DOYLE'S HEADLESS TORSO, dripping blood!\n\n     UTTER PANDEMONIUM breaks loose!  The close space ECHOES with screams\n     and shouts.  People claw at each other, stumbling desperately trying to\n     get to the door.  A YOUNG WOMAN falls and D'Agosta runs to her to keep\n     her from being trampled in the stampede.\n\n     INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     McNitt is staring in horror at the remote camera images showing the\n     chaos in the exhibition, the faces registering blind fear.  Alarms\n     start going off all over the place.  McNitt calls out... panicked... \n\n                              MCNITT\n                    George!  Get out here, now!\n\n     McNitt looks around, desperate.  But George still isn't here.  The door\n     to the electrical room is still open.  The ceiling shudders from\n     thundering feet.  McNitt can hear distant SCREAMS!  It's raising the\n     hair on the back of his neck.  He calls out.\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    George!  Where are you?\n\n     No answer.  He moves to the open door, a new fear in his eyes.  He looks\n     inside.\n\n     INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     BLACKNESS.  McNitt can't find a light switch.  He stays in the doorway,\n     silhouetted by light from the computer room.  With shaking hands McNitt\n     pumps a slug into the chamber of his shotgun.  There's a strange, low,\n     gurgling sound.  It's McNitt's stomach.  He silences it, swallows.\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    Hey you?  George!  Damn it.  Where are\n                    you?  No response.\n\n     McNitt edges into the darkened rooms.  The first one's empty.  He tries\n     the next.\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    George!  We've got an emergency!  Are\n                    you here?\n\n     Suddenly there's a HUGE THUMP and a scuttling to his left!  It's a\n     terrifying sound!  McNitt drops to his knees and pumps three rounds,\n     each with a light and a deafening blast!  A SHOWER OF SPARKS and a gout\n     of flame licks upwards, illuminating the room with orange light.  A\n     HUGE DARK SHAPE ducks out the door!\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    Oh God.  Oh God!\n\n     Gunpowder hangs in the air like a blue fog.  On the far wall, a mounted\n     metal box is smoking from three large, ragged holes!  With a sudden\n     pop, an electrical arc slices across the ruined box, followed by a\n     crackling and a shower of sparks.  McNitt ducks back into the computer\n     room, slams the door and locks it, breathing hard.\n\n     INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Every single screen flickers and dims.  But to McNitt's relief, George\n     has returned.  He is sitting with his back to the doorway in his chair.\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    George!  I saw something in there!  I\n                    fired but I think I missed it!\n\n     George remains still, his back to McNitt, staring at the computer game\n     on the flickering screen.\n\n                              MCNITT\n                    George, for Chrissake answer me!\n\n     McNitt puts a hand on George's shoulder, swivels his chair around.\n\n     ON GEORGE... His face ripped off.\n\n     INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     ON THE CENTRAL SWITCHING BOX... sparking and shorting as an ENORMOUS\n     CLAWED ARM SWIPES IT OFF THE WALL!\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT\n\n     Everyone pours out of the exhibit, running for the door leading to the\n     Rotunda.  People are getting trampled.  It's a terrible crush.  Screams!\n     Tables over-turned everywhere.  Food scatters to the floor.  D'AGOSTA\n     pushes his way out of the exhibit, crosses to Kawakita, who is\n     appalled.  Above, the chandeliers are flickering.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    What happened?!\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    There's a dead body in the exhibit!\n                    People are panicking, trampling each\n                    other trying to get out.\n\n     Ippolito runs over to join them.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    What the hell is going on?!\n\n     Above them THE LIGHTS dim again and come back on.\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    The whole system is shutting down!\n                    We have to get out quickly before\n                    the fire doors fall!\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    What doors?\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    I told you!  They seal off all the\n                    cells.  They were designed to fall\n                    automatically in a system failure --\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    You said the system couldn't fail!\n\n     At this there's a low rumble from above.  D'Agosta looks up and sees A\n     LARGE METAL DOOR IS DESCENDING from a slot in the ceiling, and not in\n     an orderly fashion.  It's falling fast.  Below are crowds of people, all\n     pushing to get out!  Officer Bailey, near the door, sees it.\n\n                              BAILEY\n                    Above you!  Look out!\n\n     His voice is lost in an ocean of screaming.  Kawakita stands in total\n     horror a moment, then joins Bailey and D'Agosta.\n\n     All of them try to restrain people from trying to beat the door.\n     Ippolito, on the other hand, elbows his way to the front of the\n     fleeing crowd!\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Ippolito!  Get back here!\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    Like hell!\n\n     Ignoring D'Agosta, Ippolito pushes past.  He barrels over an OLD MAN\n     who stumbles and falls DIRECTLY BENEATH THE FALLING DOOR!  Ippolito\n     jumps over him and is out!\n\n     The old man looks up at the descending wall of steel and SCREAMS!\n     D'AGOSTA runs forward, dives for the old man but he's not in time.\n\n     Kawakita covers his eyes, unable to watch as the lights flicker a\n     third and last time.  The room is plunged into darkness.  And over the\n     screams we hear the rumble and CRASH, the horrifying cries of the old\n     man, as the door comes down.\n\n     INT. MARGO'S LAB - NIGHT\n\n     Margo and Frock stand in the darkness.  Through a high window we can\n     see lightning flash.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    What's going on?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Some kind of power failure.  Maybe\n                    it's the storm.  Do you have a\n                    flashlight?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I think so.\n\n     She gets one from a cupboard.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Greg's been gone over a half hour.\n                    We'd better get out of here.  Get the\n                    crate.\n\n     INT. HALLWAYS - NIGHT\n\n     Frock wheels his chair as fast as he can.  Margo runs beside him\n     carrying the crate with the fibers inside.  A peel of thunder ends and\n     distant screaming is heard.  Margo stops, appalled.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Don't stop now.\n\n     Up ahead they hear METALLIC RUMBLING and a CRASH!  They round a corner\n     and come up against a huge STEEL DOOR.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    What's that?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    It's one of the fire doors.  Good\n                    Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!\n\n     INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Pendergast stands at the end of a cul de sac, studying the blue prints\n     by a stone wall.  Jonathan and the dog are with him, exhausted and\n     terrified.  Jonathan keeps an eye on the corridor behind them as\n     Pendergast works.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I know where we are now.  We're\n                    getting out, Jonathan.  This should\n                    be another door.\n\n     Taking a pen knife from his pocket, Pendergast places it into the\n     plaster and gently twists the blade.  A piece of plaster the size of a\n     dinner plate falls, revealing the tracings of another doorway.\n     Pendergast shoves the door open to reveal a dark, dusty room.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Hallelujah, Pendergast.  Where the\n                    hell are we now?\n\n     INT. \"ALCOHOLIC\" ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Jonathan and Pendergast enter quickly from the hidden rear door.\n     Pendergast shines his beam on dusty shelves filled with specimens.  All\n     are stored in jars of alcohol.  There are fetuses of many different\n     species.  We see a pig, a cow, a duck billed platypus as well as brain\n     sections, a disembodied monkey head.  One rectangular glass container\n     holds a skinned human foot.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Jesus, what is this?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Another storage room.\n\n     Pendergast tries the light switch to no effect.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Something's happened.  The power's\n                    out.\n\n     They cross the room to the main door and exit.  Now they're in... \n\n     INT. OSTEO PREP - LAB - NIGHT\n\n     Pendergast shines his light on the maceration tanks.  The humming of\n     the bugs can be heard in their cabinet.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    All right.  I know where we are.  This\n                    is the osteo prep lab.  I was in here\n                    earlier.  We're safe now.\n\n     With these words, the dog GROWLS.  Jonathan freezes and sniffs the air.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Oh no.  I smell it.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Keep the animal quiet.\n\n     Jonathan kneels by Hobbes as Pendergast listens, every nerve on end.  A\n     sound comes from the adjacent hallway that leads to the secure storage\n     area.  It's unmistakable HEAVY BREATHING and the creeping movement of\n     claws.  Pendergast lifts his gun.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Go out the other doorway.  There's a\n                    stair at the end of the hall.  Up\n                    five flights is a corridor that\n                    leads to the Hall of the Heavens.\n                    Find Lieutenant D'Agosta.  Bring\n                    help.\n\n     Jonathan doesn't have to be told twice.  He takes the dog and exits\n     from the other side of the lab leaving Pendergast alone.  Pendergast\n     waits a moment until Jonathan's safely out of sight.  He switches off\n     his flashlight, backs up slowly, step by step.  He opens the door to\n     the alcoholics storage.  As he slips inside a DARK SHAPE appears.\n\n     INT. \"ALCOHOLICS\" STORAGE - NIGHT\n\n     Slowly, making no sound, Pendergast lifts the .45 Anaconda, passes his\n     finger over the cylinder, checking the loaded chambers.  Then he\n     steadies the revolver and levels it at the door.  The hideous pickled\n     specimens seem to hover all around him.  The smell is overwhelming and\n     the snuffling is louder now.\n\n     It's coming closer.  After a long moment there is a faint bump at the\n     door.  This is followed by a low scratching noise... Pendergast watches\n     frozen in horror, holding his breath.\n\n     THE DOORKNOB BEGINS TO TURN!  Not knowing what else to do, Pendergast\n     simply grabs it from the inside and holds on!\n\n     OUTSIDE he hears an AMUSED SNORT, then a LOW GROWL.  There's ONE HARD\n     HIT and the door shivers.  THE DOORKNOB FALLS OFF!  It's over now.\n     Pendergast kneels down, bracing the gun in both hands.  From this\n     position he can see right through the hole where the doorknob fell.\n     His mouth literally drops in astonishment as he sees... \n\n     a HUGE, red-rimmed, GREEN EYE!\n\n     Involuntarily Pendergast LEAPS BACK, nearly falls and drops the gun!\n     Beakers crash around him.  He scrambles in the darkness.  The flashlight\n     falls and pops back on.  The beam streaks up crazily.  It's chaos.\n     Pendergast is an easy target now.  He grabs for the light, the gun,\n     steadies himself, breathing fast and low.  His heart pounds.  But\n     nothing more happens.  The silence is heavy.  The eye is gone.  And\n     suddenly Pendergast understands.\n\n     In the distance he can hear HUMAN VOICES and a rolling wheelchair!\n     Somewhere nearby are MARGO AND FROCK!  The monster has left him to get\n     bigger game.  Fear for Margo and Frock lights Pendergast's eyes.  All\n     panic and disorganization are gone.  He holds his revolver at 12\n     o'clock and KICKS the door open, leaps out as\n\n     A HUGE DARK SHAPE DARTS FROM THE ROOM.  It's headed for the secure\n     storage areas again!  Pendergast takes off.  Not knowing how else to\n     address this thing he finds himself calling... \n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Halt!\n\n     INT. SECURE STORAGE HALLWAY - BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Pendergast runs into the hallway but he's already too late.  The\n     hulking shape of the quadruped is moving at incredible speed.\n\n     ON PENDERGAST... as he levels his gun and shoots.\n\n     THE CREATURE... stops, rears back on its haunches, looks once at\n     Pendergast, pissed.  As the VOICES around the far corner fall silent,\n     Pendergast FIRES.  The shot blasts off a piece of the wall.\n\n     With astonishing speed and agility for its bulk, the beast turns and\n     leaps around the corner, passing out of Pendergast's sight.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Margo!  Frock!  It's coming!  Run!\n\n     AROUND THE CORNER... \n\n     Are MARGO AND FROCK... Frock holds the keys to secure storage area 1012\n     in his hand.  Margo has the flashlight and the crate with the fibers.\n     They can hear the sound of thundering movement.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Look!\n\n     Margo points her light in the distance and illuminates the beast!  It's\n     descending like a freight train.  One split second of sheer amazement,\n     then... \n\n                              MARGO\n                    Dr. Frock!  Quick!\n\n     Frock, immobilized in his wheel chair, stares at the monster, like a\n     trapped rabbit looking at a descending hawk.  Margo grabs his keys from\n     him, fumbles desperately to open the door.  It swings wide at last.  She\n     grabs the handles of the wheelchair, tugs with all her might.  The\n     wheels bump into the door frame but somehow she wrestles the damn\n     thing inside.\n\n     INT. SECURE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT\n\n     Margo shoves Frock behind her, slams the door shut.  Seconds later, the\n     beast throws itself against the storage door.  They hear it outside,\n     growling in fury, claws lashing out.  Margo and Frock press back in the\n     darkness, terror in their eyes.\n\n     INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n     Pendergast runs forward in the echoing hallway, his gun drawn, his\n     flashlight on.  A few more steps and he holds hard.  His eyes go wide in\n     astonishment as his light illuminates the beast.  It's tearing at the\n     steel door furiously with incredible force.\n\n     As the flashlight beam hits it, MBWUN roars and looks up.  Now we see\n     it clearly for the first time.  The monster is MASSIVE, putrid, rank.\n     Slit reptilian green eyes are rimmed in red.  A ridge of stiff black\n     hair rises on the creature's buffalo-like humped back.  The withers are\n     muscled and covered with plates.  A forked TONGUE licks out as purple\n     lips draw back exposing razor sharp teeth.  The claws raise up to fend\n     off the light.\n\n     PENDERGAST steadies himself with difficulty, takes a few seconds to\n     aim with the greatest care.  Mbwun makes a move towards him and he\n     squeezes the trigger hard.  The gun echoes in the hall.  A split second\n     and a white streak moves right up the beast's cranium.  A direct hit.\n     The shot echoes and Mbwun drops it's claws.\n\n     The flashlight continues to shine like a high beam right into the\n     beast's eyes.  Angry and blinded, the creature turns and in a moment,\n     lopes off.  Pendergast watches, unimaginably relieved.  Realizing what\n     just happened, his knees start to buckle.  He catches himself, wipes\n     one hand across his eyes.  A voice comes from the storage room.\n\n                              MARGO (OS)\n                    Pendergast?  Are you all right?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    No.  I think I'm hallucinating.\n\n     The storage door opens slowly and Margo looks out.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    You're not.  Where is it?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                        (shakes his head)\n                    Gone.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Wounded?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45\n                    caliber bullet bounced off that\n                    thing's skull like a spit ball.  I\n                    think it was bothered by my light.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    That would fit.  It's nocturnal.\n                    Quick.  Come inside.\n\n     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n     As hundreds of the guests emerge into the pounding rain... crying,\n     terrified, unclear what exactly happened.  These are the lucky ones.\n     Among them we find IPPOLITO.  His walkie talkie is squawking.  The\n     windows of the museum behind him are black.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA ON RADIO\n                    Ippolito!  Where the hell are you?\n                    We're trapped in here!  We need help!\n                    Ippolito!  Come in, dammit!\n\n     Ippolito sits down on the steps in the rain, knowing the extent of\n     what he's done.  The wheels are working hard now, trying to figure out\n     damage control.  The walkie talkie keeps calling.  He doesn't respond.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT\n\n     Tables are overturned, food lies on the ground, people cower in the\n     darkness.  D'Agosta crouches in some broken glass with his walkie\n     talkie.  He shuts it off, rises, looks around.  Light comes from a few\n     sputtering candles.\n\n     Most of the guests still trapped inside are grouped around the lowered\n     steel door.  Among them are KAWAKITA and CUTHBERT.  From the BODY of the\n     man crushed underneath the door extends a large puddle of blood.\n     Bailey is working in desperation on a brass panel by the door.\n\n                              BAILEY\n                    Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm\n                    getting nothing, Lieutenant.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Great.\n\n     Frank, the father of the teenage girl, Lauren, steps forward.\n\n                              FRANK\n                    There's no power.  The whole system's\n                    down.\n\n     The crowd starts to murmur.  One man yells.\n\n                              MAN\n                    We're trapped!  And there's a killer\n                    in here!\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    We'll get out safely if everyone\n                    stays calm.  Is anyone else hurt?\n\n     The MAYOR stands.  His wife's forehead is bleeding.\n\n                              MAYOR\n                    Yes.  My wife.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Is there a doctor?\n\n     The distinguished grey haired man with a cane comes forward.  DR.\n     POUND.\n\n                              POUND\n                    I'm Dr. Pound.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Check this woman and see if anyone\n                    else needs you.\n\n     Pound moves off.  Everyone spins now at the incongruous sound of a DOG\n     BARK.  D'Agosta pulls his gun.  The door to a stairwell at the far end\n     of the room opens and Hobbes bounds into the hall!  He's followed by\n     Jonathan, who is filthy and wild-eyed.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                        (calls)\n                    Lieutenant D'Agosta!  Don't shoot.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Where's Pendergast?\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                        (crossing, breathless)\n                    Five flights down.  We were lost in\n                    the sub-basement.  Something's down\n                    there.  It killed our two deputies.\n                    When I left Pendergast it was coming\n                    back.  He sent me for help.  We have\n                    to hurry.\n\n     D'Agosta makes a quick sweep of the room with his flashlight.  The\n     remote corners of the hall are so black the light seems to disappear.\n     In the center, two men are bending over a still form.  One of them is\n     Dr. Pound.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Both of you.  Get back here.\n\n                              POUND\n                    But he's still alive --\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Get back now!\n\n     The urgency in D'Agosta's voice gets everyone's attention.  The Mayor\n     brings his wife over.  Cuthbert comes too.  They huddle apart from the\n     others.  Cuthbert's white with fear.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    What's going on?\n\n     D'Agosta speaks low.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    There's some kind of animal loose in\n                    the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He\n                    needs help.  I want volunteers to go\n                    with me.\n\n                              BAILEY\n                    I'm in.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                        (swallows)\n                    Me too.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                        (voice rising in fear)\n                    I'd do it gladly but someone needs\n                    to stay with these people.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    All right.  You're elected.  Bailey,\n                    get all the guns and flashlights,\n                    give the mayor your walkie talkie so\n                    we can keep in touch.  Cuthbert, keep\n                    everyone together and make sure they\n                    stay quiet.\n\n     Frank steps forward.\n\n                              FRANK\n                    I was in the Marines.  Give me a gun.\n                    I'd go with you, too, but I've got\n                    my daughter.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    What's your name?\n\n                              FRANK\n                    Frank.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    All right.  You guard these people\n                    and your daughter.\n\n     D'Agosta gives Frank his service revolver.\n\n                              MAYOR'S WIFE\n                        (to D'Agosta)\n                    Where are you going?  Don't leave us\n                    alone!\n\n     The remaining crowd begins to whimper.  The Mayor rises.\n\n                              MAYOR\n                    Everyone quiet.  The Lieutenant's in\n                    charge.\n\n     Bailey and D'Agosta carry shot guns.  They quietly move to the back\n     stairwell at the far end of the Hall of the Heavens.  Everyone else\n     bunches together and watches.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Bailey, we'll go first and check the\n                    stairwell.  Jonathan, you and Greg\n                    guard the door.\n\n     Jonathan gives Hobbes' leash to the Mayor.  D'Agosta hands Greg\n     Kawakita a shotgun, tightens his grip on his own.  Then he gives the\n     signal and Bailey yanks open the door to the stairwell.\n\n     INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n\n     D'Agosta and Bailey go in slowly.  Jonathan stays in the doorway,\n     sweeping the stairwell with his flashlight.  Kawakita gingerly holds\n     his shotgun.  He's scared out of his mind.  He turns to Jonathan,\n     whispers.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Excuse me.  Could you tell me how\n                    this thing works?\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Oh Jesus.  Don't point it at me.  Just\n                    aim and shoot.\n\n     D'Agosta heads down the stairs in the lead, with Bailey close behind.\n     The stairwell is windowless and dark.  D'Agosta shines his light and it\n     cuts into the blackness.  He moves quietly, makes the first landing and\n     stops.  Bailey watches his back from several steps behind as D'Agosta\n     signals for him to wait.  The flashlight flares into a glass door one\n     flight down.  D'Agosta raises his hand.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                        (low)\n                    Hold on.  I thought I saw something.\n\n     Everyone stops.  Bailey pumps his shotgun.  So does Jonathan.  Kawakita\n     fumbles to do like the others.  They wait.  D'Agosta moves alone down\n     several more steps.  The silence is heavy.  Suddenly D'Agosta wrinkles\n     his nose.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Whoa... You smell that?\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Lieutenant!  Get back!\n\n     Too late.  At this something DROPS FROM ABOVE!  A huge dark shape LEAPS\n     INTO THE STAIRWELL, descending two floors!  It lands, pounces on BAILEY\n     and the marble walls echo with a ROAR.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    BAILEY!!!\n\n     Bailey SCREAMS in terror as Mbwun pins him down!\n\n                              BAILEY\n                    NOOOOO!\n\n     CLOSE ON BAILEY... Three claws close on his neck and WRENCH HARD!\n     There's a horrifying snap as Bailey's HEAD COMES OFF!  Blood SPURTS all\n     over and drips down the stairs.\n\n     D'AGOSTA levels his shotgun at the monster and fires, with no apparent\n     effect.  When the shots stop echoing we hear SCREAMS and FRANTIC\n     BARKING from the hall.\n\n     MBWUN'S GREEN EYES look up and it's FORKED TONGUE LICKS OUT.  The\n     monster LEAPS PAST Bailey's body and heads for the door!  D'Agosta,\n     seeing what's happening, screams at the top of his lungs.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Jonathan!  Don't let it get into the\n                    hall!\n\n     ON JONATHAN... frozen in the doorway, Kawakita by his side.  Both of\n     them are rigid with horror.  Disbelief in their eyes.  The BEAST leaps\n     up directly at them as they jump to try and close the door.\n\n     D'Agosta keeps firing until he's pumping an empty chamber.  Plaster is\n     falling all around.  SCREAMS resound in the Hall of the Heavens as\n     D'Agosta stumbles up the stairs.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT\n\n     D'Agosta throws open the doors and charges into the Hall.  Jonathan\n     lies on the ground, dazed.  Kawakita stands to one side, teeth\n     chattering in shock.  His hand shakes so badly that the barrel of the\n     gun swings in his hand.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                        (yells)\n                    Where is it?!\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    I don't know!  It hit me hard.\n\n     D'Agosta pumps two shells in the shotgun.  Screams can be heard from\n     the people crouched together at the edge of the room.  Hobbes is\n     barking wildly, foaming at the mouth.  It's too dark to see what's\n     happening.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                        (screams)\n                    Somebody tell me!  Where is it now?\n\n                              MAYOR\n                        (quiet)\n                    Lieutenant.  In the south corner.\n\n     D'Agosta sweeps his light to the Mayor who stands rigid in front of\n     the others, points to his left.  The light moves to the far end of the\n     room where THE DARK SHAPE OF MBWUN crouches over the body of a man.\n     It's lunging up and down with odd, jerking motions.  The man is long\n     past making a sound.  From the monster comes a faint crunching and\n     slobbering.  Jonathan rises, comes to D'Agosta.  So does Frank.  They\n     stand shoulder to shoulder, raise their guns.  D'Agosta motions for\n     Kawakita.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    On three.\n\n     Kawakita stumbles to join them, tries to join in.  The barrel of his\n     shot gun still swings wildly.  He steadies it by taking it in both\n     hands.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    One, two... three.\n\n     All three fire.  There's a loud report.  The kickback knocks Kawakita\n     backwards.  Screams erupt from the huddled group.  Hobbes abruptly shuts\n     up.  The men fire and fire until there's nothing left.  D'Agosta reaches\n     for more shells, comes up empty.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Jonathan!  Get everyone behind me!\n\n     Jonathan moves.  D'Agosta sweeps his light across the room but already\n     the shape is gone.  Cuthbert hides behind the Mayor, calls out in a\n     terrified squeal.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    It went out the door to the rotunda!\n\n     D'Agosta runs across the room to a set of double industrial doors.\n     There's a noise in the darkness beyond and he just manages to slam\n     both doors.  He picks up a metal chair and jams it through the handles.\n     Backs up.  The doors shudder as something hits them hard.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Get everyone into the stairwell!\n\n     Jonathan, the Mayor, Cuthbert and Kawakita together herd everyone\n     towards the stairwell.  They move inside.\n\n     INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n\n     Dark and close.  The smell of gunpowder and death.  The Mayor's Wife\n     sees Bailey's body and clutches her mouth so as not to throw up.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Sweet Jesus!\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Get his gun and his walkie talkie,\n                    Jonathan.

Kawakita\n                    and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest\n                    of you can go with Cuthbert!\n\n                              MAYOR\n                    I think we should stick together!\n\n                              FRANK\n                        (taking Bailey's shotgun)\n                    Me too.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    I'm leaving.  Whoever wants can come\n                    with me.\n\n     No one follows.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Wait!\n\n     Cuthbert's gone.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Jonathan, go with him!  He isn't\n                    armed.\n\n     Jonathan grabs Hobbes' leash from the Mayor and bounds up the stairs.\n\n                              MAYOR\n                    Good luck!\n\n     Everyone else follows D'Agosta.  Together, they head down.\n\n     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n     Police cars are pulling up outside the museum.  Sirens wail.  Torrents\n     of rain limit the number of onlookers.  Crowds of people are scattered\n     about.  There's disbelief on everyone's faces.  Many people are in\n     shock.  Ippolito sprints through the pelting rain to a GUARD STATION\n     near the gate.  He yanks the door open and jumps inside.\n\n     INT.

We can\n                    go through them, but it would take\n                    hours.\n\n                              WATERS\n                    The quickest way in would be to go\n                    through the roof, sir.  Cell two goes\n                    up to the fifth floor.  There are sky\n                    lights up there.\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    Co-ordinate with the fire department\n                    and SWAT teams.  Move.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT\n\n     It's very dark.  The huge shape of MBWUN can barely be seen sliding out\n     of the stairwell and into the Hall of the Asian Peoples.  Then DIM RED\n     HALL LIGHTS come on in the corners of the ceiling.  The monster utters\n     a low growl.  The emergency generators are beginning to come on.  The\n     animal lopes to the spot where we last saw D'Agosta and his group,\n     sniffs the ground.  It looks up and, with a curiously human gesture,\n     cocks its massive head.\n\n     The silence is broken by VOICES!  They're in the distance and muffled,\n     but definitely there.  The monster crouches eagerly, lopes forward with\n     great stealth.  The voices are getting louder.  We follow as it goes\n     through the hall and down... \n\n     A STAIRWELL... At the bottom, Mbwun quickly turns a corner... The voices\n     have stopped.  Mbwun creeps forward, enters... \n\n     INT. HALL OF MARINE ANIMALS - NIGHT\n\n     A huge room several stories high.  A WHALE hangs suspended from the\n     ceiling.  Dioramas of fish line all the walls.  Mbwun pauses next to a\n     diorama of the gentle, vegetarian sea cow, THE MANATEE.  The two make a\n     startling contrast.\n\n     A pause and then the voices are heard again, much louder now.  The\n     source is right around the edge of the Manatee display.  Mbwun LEAPS\n     FORWARD, claws lashing out.  He turns the corner and crashes through a\n     wall of GLASS as he grabs at the source of the voices... \n\n     A display of small, extraordinarily life-like TALKING HOLOGRAMS!\n     They've been re-activated with the emergency power system.  Each little\n     talking figure is no more then five inches high.  They move around a\n     small three dimensional display of marine animals, explaining the lung\n     systems of fish.\n\n     MBWUN... stands in the pile of broken glass, stares at the holograms,\n     mesmerized.  He makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a CHUCKLE!\n     Then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to touch\n     one of the holograms.  But the shadowy creatures can't be caught.  The\n     beast seems to realize this, SNORTS and moves off.  As he goes he\n     passes behind a\n\n     LARGE GLASS ELEVATOR.  It stands in middle the open room.  The elevator\n     is designed to carry people upstairs and down in the two story\n     exhibit.  In the dim light, with his poor vision, the monster doesn't\n     see D'Agosta, the Mayor, Kawakita, and their entire group SANDWICHED\n     INSIDE.  The monster exits the exhibit and quietly D'Agosta slides the\n     doors open.  Everyone, all thirty-five people in evening clothes,\n     quickly get out and run across the exhibit to another stairwell at the\n     far side of the hall.\n\n     INT. SECURE STORAGE AREA 1012 - NIGHT\n\n     Margo, Frock and Pendergast wait in the darkness.  Pendergast, for the\n     first time, seems fazed.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I don't know how to deal with this.\n                    It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever\n                    saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a\n                    monster, a supernatural creature\n                    like that.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an\n                    animal.  Part lizard, part human, a\n                    genetic freak of some kind, like the\n                    half-goat, half-sheep they found\n                    last year in the jungles of Vietnam.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    But this isn't the jungle!  This is\n                    New York.  How did it get here?  A\n                    thing like that crossed two\n                    continents.  It makes no sense!\n\n                              FROCK\n                        (lame)\n                    We think it may have something to do\n                    with the eggs we found in the crate.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I don't believe it.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    None of that matters now.  The people\n                    upstairs need us.  We have to help.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    We can't.  We've managed to get\n                    inside the one place that's safe.  I\n                    think we should sit tight and wait\n                    for reinforcements.  If we go\n                    outside, we're risking more lives.\n                    You have to accept it, Margo,\n                    there's nothing we can do.  The\n                    building must be swarming with\n                    police by now.  It won't take long\n                    for them to get through the doors.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    That thing could kill ten people in\n                    a matter of minutes.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    But what can we do?  Our guns are\n                    useless --\n\n                              MARGO\n                    We have the fibers.  Don't you see?\n                    The creature is hungry.  It wants the\n                    hormones in these plants.  It would\n                    take hundreds of human brains to\n                    supply what's in these fibers.  We're\n                    just a poor substitute.  To make it\n                    stop hunting, we have to give it\n                    what it wants.\n\n     INT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n     Cuthbert enters with Jonathan and the dog, Hobbes.  Cuthbert locks the\n     door with shaking hands.  He mutters to himself in terror.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Solid oak.  Two inches thick.  Tell me\n                    they'll hold.\n\n     Cuthbert scurries to his desk and pulls out a Ruger .38 Magnum.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    I got it after I was mugged in the\n                    subway last spring.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Where's the walk-in safe?\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Behind you.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    What's the combination?\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    I'll do it.  Just let me find my\n                    portable phone.\n\n     He rummages in the darkness, going through his desk.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Forget it!\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Calm down.  I found it!\n\n     Cuthbert flips the phone open and turns it on.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Battery's dead.  Shit.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Let's go!\n\n     Cuthbert crosses to a huge wall safe, starts frantically turning the\n     tumblers.  Jonathan follows with the dog.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    That thing won't come after us,\n                    right?  It's going for bigger game.\n                    The group blundering around in the\n                    basement.  Poor fools.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Hurry up!\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the\n                    gun.\n\n     Cuthbert fumbles to hand over the Ruger.  As he does, something drops.\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Oh God!  I dropped my rabbit's foot!\n\n     Cuthbert drops to his knees, groping in the darkness.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's\n                    the combination?!\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    To the left twice then five no... \n                    sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's\n                    been a while... \n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Oh Jesus... \n\n     Jonathan starts again, sweating.  The tumblers fall with agonizing\n     slowness.  Cuthbert continues groping frantically for his good luck\n     charm.  Meanwhile, unnoticed by Jonathan, the dog is staring at the oak\n     doors.  We see the HAIR ON HIS BACK rise!\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Fifteen... what's next?\n\n                              CUTHBERT\n                    Eight to the right!  Look!  I found\n                    it!\n\n     Clutching the rabbit's foot like a talisman, Cuthbert leaps up just as\n     the last tumbler falls.\n\n     At this the oak doors behind them CRASH OPEN, splintering like so many\n     match sticks.\n\n     Cuthbert SCREAMS in a high pitch whine at the sight of the beast.  The\n     dog barks wildly at Mbwun!  Jonathan lifts his shot gun.  But the\n     monster barrels past him and zeros in on Cuthbert!\n\n     A HUGE RED TONGUE LICKS OUT and encircles Cuthbert's waist!  It\n     squeezes him horribly, drags him towards the open jaws!  Cuthbert\n     bellows like a lamb being led to the slaughter.  He opens his hand and\n     the rabbit's foot drops!  The last Jonathan sees of Cuthbert is his\n     head disappearing down Mbwun's throat.\n\n     Hobbes barks and whines in terror.  Jonathan takes the leash and drags\n     the animal out.\n\n     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAYS - NIGHT\n\n     Jonathan and Hobbes tear down the hallway and disappear.  Behind them\n     comes a roar so loud it rattles the walls.\n\n     INT. HALLWAYS - SECURE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT\n\n     The door opens slowly and Pendergast appears.  He shines his beam in\n     both directions.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    All clear.\n\n     Margo and Frock quickly come out.  Margo holds the crate.  Frock tries\n     to follow in his wheelchair.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    I'm coming with you.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    You'd slow us down and put Margo in\n                    danger.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Unlock one of the other storage\n                    rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll\n                    leave a trail back to 1012 and try\n                    to trap the monster in here.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Margo, this is too dangerous.  You\n                    always think you can solve\n                    everything.  This time you don't have\n                    enough information.  The animal might\n                    behave in unexpected ways.\n                        (to Pendergast)\n                    Leave her here with me.  Don't put\n                    her in danger.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    He's right.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No.  You'll need me --\n\n     At this a LOUD SOUND comes from upstairs!\n\n                              FROCK\n                    What's that?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Footsteps!\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No, not footsteps!  People running\n                    for their lives!\n\n     All three know this ends the discussion.  Frock opens the door to room\n     1010.  Inside are shelves of priceless ivory tusks.  Margo takes\n     Pendergast's handkerchief and wraps her hand.  She quickly sprinkles\n     some of the fibers inside the door to room 1012.  Before Dr. Frock\n     disappears into room 1010, he looks back to Margo one last time.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Come back and get me.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    We will.\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It\n                    hunts with its sense of smell.  So\n                    for God's sake, Margo, don't get\n                    those fibers on your clothes!\n\n     INT. OSTEO PREP - NIGHT\n\n     Margo and Pendergast emerge from the hall to the storage rooms and run\n     for the far stairs.  From somewhere above the sound of running is\n     louder now.\n\n     INT. PLANETARIUM - NIGHT\n\n     D'Agosta and his group enter the large domed space in disarray.\n     They're spread out and panicked, the young helping the old.  Dr. Pound\n     is finding it hard to keep up.  Frank and his daughter Lauren bring him\n     along.  The Mayor quietly urges people forward.  His wife's face is\n     streaked with tears.

D'Agosta calls out... \n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Pendergast!\n\n     INT. HALL OF NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT\n\n     Margo and Pendergast run.

Pendergast\n     and Margo run for it.  Pendergast shoves at the door.  It won't budge.\n     There's a small glass window.  In it, D'Agosta's face appears.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                        (through the window)\n                    Pendergast!  Help!

The shots echo wildly.  The sound is terrifyingly loud.  The\n     small glass window shatters.  Then the men lean heavily on the door.  It\n     still won't budge.  D'Agosta looks through the window.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    It's no use.  We have to get out of\n                    here!\n                        (to Kawakita)\n                    Give them your walkie talkie.\n\n     Kawakita hands his walkie talkie through the window.  Margo takes it.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Is Dr. Frock safe!\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of\n                    yourself!\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT\n\n     Pendergast looks desperately at the blueprints.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Is there another way around?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    No.  The planetarium is in the next\n                    cell.  This is one of the fire\n                    doors... \n\n     Pendergast returns to the window.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Vince?  There's no way we can get to\n                    you with the fire doors down.\n                    There's an entrance to the sub-\n                    basement in the hall off the north\n                    side exit.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    The sub-basement?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I've been down there.  It links up to\n                    the old sewer system.  I can guide\n                    you out.\n\n     D'Agosta turns to the others.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    How much ammo do we have to make a\n                    stand?\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    You're asking me?  I don't even know\n                    how to load this thing.\n\n                              FRANK\n                    Four rounds... \n\n     There's a movement of air... and a ripe, fetid smell.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Oh shit.\n\n     D'Agosta pumps his shot gun.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    I smell it.  It's here.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Go out the north exit!  There's a\n                    hallway and a false wall by the\n                    Greek vases.  Run!\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Everybody.  Get behind me.\n\n     The others move past.  D'Agosta, Frank and Greg Kawakita hold the rear.\n     The group runs to the side exit to the planetarium and in a moment,\n     disappears.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT\n\n     Pendergast remains at the window watching anxiously.  From the south\n     entrance to the planetarium, an ENORMOUS DARK SHAPE slinks into view!\n     Pendergast steps back from the doorway, turns to Margo.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Hide quickly!\n\n                              MARGO\n                    What are you going to do?\n\n     Pendergast checks his gun, totally calm.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Buy them some time.\n\n     Margo turns and looks around at the looming dioramas.  There's a plain\n     door at their end of the hall.  Pendergast faces the broken window.\n\n     HIS POV... the beast is slinking away after D'Agosta and the others,\n     headed to the north exit from the Planetarium!\n\n     PENDERGAST calls out... \n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Hey you big tub of lard!  Over here!\n\n     THE BEAST PAUSES, turns.\n\n     Pendergast puts his palms up at his ears, wiggles his fingers and\n     makes a face through the window.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Come on, you smelly pile of refuse.\n                    Come get me.  I dare you!\n\n     A LOW surprised GROWL comes from the beast.  It crouches as if to\n     pounce.  Pendergast makes more faces, sticks his tongue out.  The beast\n     watches in silence, its evil eyes fixed.\n\n     ON MARGO... watching Pendergast.  She can't leave him yet.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    What is it doing?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                        (loud)\n                    It's scared of me.\n\n     Suddenly there's a CRASH and the door BENDS like cardboard.  TWO HUGE\n     SETS OF CLAWS lash through!  Margo screams as the claws pass inches\n     from Pendergast's face.  He leaps back, lifts his gun which looks like\n     a pea shooter in the face of Mbwun.\n\n     Two sets of claws curve around the bent edges of the door, then Mbwun\n     simply LIFTS it out of the frame.  This leaves Pendergast face to face\n     with the foul, enormous monster!  It regards him evenly, blinks once.\n     Then the tongue slides out, licks its lips eagerly and... \n\n     Pendergast FLICKS on his high powered FLASHLIGHT, shining it at close\n     range right in the beast's eyes!  Then carefully, with total calm he\n     FIRES ONCE, TWICE.  The beast howls more in anger than pain, REARS UP\n     and swipes at Pendergast.  Pendergast dives to one side and, the claws\n     miss again by inches as the beast is temporarily blinded by the light.\n     Now Pendergast spins and runs for all he's worth.  Margo's been\n     waiting, holding the door.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Drop the fibers!\n\n     She leaves the crate behind as Pendergast dives inside with her.  Margo\n     shoves the door shut hard as Mbwun, still blinded, leaps into the\n     hall.  But now, suddenly, all is quiet.  No sign of Margo and\n     Pendergast.  The beast moves forward, snuffling slowly.  It starts for\n     the door which hides Margo and Pendergast, but stops as it finds... \n\n     THE CRATE!  The beast moves to it, clearly surprised.  It pokes at the\n     crate carefully, inhales the fragrance and grunts.  The monster seems\n     to be struggling with itself!  It sniffs the fibers, lifts a few out\n     carefully, then SHOVES THE CRATE AWAY HARD.  Then it rises on its\n     haunches and squints into the dark.\n\n     On all sides are glowing displays of stuffed buffalo, gazelle, wild\n     horses, wolves, giant elk, sabre tooth tigers.  Mbwun moves close to\n     one after another.  Suddenly we notice, in the back of one of the\n     dioramas... \n\n     Margo and Pendergast!  They stand frozen, crouching behind mannequins\n     of native Americans riding horses across the plains.  The beast sniffs\n     RIGHT AT THEIR WINDOW, then turns away.  Confused, it heads back\n     towards the Planetarium and slinks from the room.\n\n     INSIDE THE DIORAMA... Pendergast and Margo exchange an astonished look.\n     They whisper.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    What happened?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Its eyesight is worse than I\n                    thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it\n                    couldn't smell us through the glass.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    It didn't want the fibers.  What does\n                    that mean?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I think... it means it's full.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Then it won't go after the others?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No.  It's still hunting, but not for\n                    the hormones.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    For what?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I think... for the pleasure of the\n                    kill.\n\n     INT. HALLWAY - MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n     Greg, the Mayor, D'Agosta and the others are in a hallway lined with\n     at least a dozen vases.  A GREEK VASE has been shoved aside revealing\n     the outlines of a door.  Behind is a sloping dark corridor.  The last of\n     the thirty-five people pack in.  Greg and D'Agosta cover the corridor.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    That's it, let's go!\n\n     Grim-faced, D'Agosta follows Kawakita as they duck through the\n     doorway, shutting it behind them.  The impact rattles the wall and the\n     Greek vase falls.\n\n     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Kawakita and D'Agosta reach the bottom and turn to see the Mayor, his\n     wife, Dr. Pound and their whole group standing in several feet of\n     rushing water.  Lauren is shivering.  Her father has his arm around her\n     tight.  Behind them are two corridors, one forking left and the other\n     straight.  D'Agosta gets out the walkie talkie, clicks it on.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                        (into walkie talkie)\n                    Pendergast.  We made it.  You all\n                    right?\n\n     INT. DIORAMA - NIGHT\n\n     Pendergast has the plans open as he studies them.  He speaks into the\n     walkie talkie.  Margo paces behind him, thinking hard.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    We're fine.  Take the left fork\n                    behind you.  You'll be in a straight\n                    passage.  When the hall forks again\n                    in fifty yards go right.  Then radio\n                    back.\n\n     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     D'Agosta shuts off his walkie talkie.  Everyone's staring at him.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Oh shit.\n\n                              FRANK\n                    No, Lieutenant.  He's not a good\n                    enough shot.  I'll do it if you take\n                    care of my daughter.\n\n     D'Agosta nods.  Frank expertly reloads.  D'Agosta holsters the walkie\n     talkie and they plunge down the left hand passage.  Kawakita takes\n     charge of Lauren, who is confused and terrified.  The tunnel has a\n     slight downhill grade, and the water begins to move faster, tugging at\n     everyone's legs.  People slip and slide as they half make their way\n     down the hill.  D'Agosta calls behind them.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Damn.  It's getting deep.  See\n                    anything?\n\n     ON FRANK... back not far from the first fork.  He looks towards the head\n     of the tunnel, calls out... \n\n                              FRANK\n                    You'll be the first to know.\n\n     Frank turns and plunges after the others.  But then suddenly, he stops.\n\n     ON D'AGOSTA... he reaches the second fork and takes a right.  This\n     tunnel is narrower and consequently the water is even deeper.  Slimy\n     plants hang down and slap at their faces as they push on.  D'Agosta\n     pulls out his walkie talkie.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Pendergast?  I made the right hand\n                    fork.  We're already in about three\n                    feet of water.  Where should we go?\n\n     But before Pendergast can answer, D'Agosta hears the loud report of\n     Frank's gun!  Everyone freezes in the darkness.  The walkie talkie\n     cackles and D'Agosta shouts!\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Hello!\n\n                              FRANK (OS)\n                    Sweet Jesus, help!\n\n     They hear SPLASHING in the water.  Lauren SCREAMS, tries to run back.\n     Kawakita grabs her.  There's more thrashing water and then silence.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Frank!  Are you all right!\n\n     D'Agosta starts for Frank but the Mayor catches his arm and holds him.\n\n                              MAYOR\n                    It's too late!\n\n     Everyone waits, staring into the darkness.  Still no answer.  Lauren\n     SCREAMS AGAIN.\n\n                              LAUREN\n                    Dad!\n\n     D'Agosta turns his flashlight on the water.  It's running red!  He spins\n     to the Mayor, points down the tunnel.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Run!\n\n     People start to cry and whimper as the Mayor urges them on.  He takes\n     charge of Lauren.  Only Greg Kawakita stays with D'Agosta.  They stand\n     shoulder to shoulder and completely alone.  Thrashing in the water can\n     be heard as the beast comes closer.  There's a low, pleasurable growl!\n     Both men lift their guns.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    On three.\n\n     Kawakita nods.  Behind them in the tunnel is total blackness.  Ahead is\n     equally dark.  The noise of their friends gets ever fainter.  The water\n     now rushes half way up their thighs.  Kawakita's teeth start to\n     chatter.  He bites them shut, steadies his gun.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    One... two... \n\n     Silence as the water murmurs.  D'Agosta holds the count.  A long,\n     agonizing moment.  Kawakita takes his eyes away from the tunnel.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    I think it's gone.\n\n     Suddenly a HUGE CLAW snakes out of the water right in front of them\n     and the beast roars up!  It was beneath the surface, directly before\n     them!  The claw closes on D'Agosta and his shot gun goes off.  D'Agosta\n     screams as the beast lifts him towards its mouth!\n\n     For one horrible moment, Kawakita is frozen.  Then he leaps forward,\n     shoves the barrel of his gun behind D'Agosta, right in the beast's\n     open jaws!  He pulls the trigger and the shotgun explodes, the recoil\n     throwing him back, ass over tea cups in the water.  With a roar of pain\n     the monster drops D'Agosta and retreats in the dark.  D'Agosta grabs\n     Kawakita.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    I think you took its tonsils out!\n\n     They haul ass down the tunnel, firing behind them as they go.  Ahead is\n     another fork.  The group is waiting.  When they see D'Agosta and\n     Kawakita, a cheer goes up.\n\n                              MAYOR\n                    Which way!\n\n     As he runs up, D'Agosta grabs for his walkie talkie.  The holster IS\n     EMPTY, the walkie talkie gone!  Without missing a beat he registers\n     what's happened, then covers it up with the next breath.  He points to\n     the right as if there's no doubt and says... \n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    This way!\n\n     D'Agosta exchanges a look with Kawakita, who understands exactly what\n     happened.  As they plunge into the right tunnel, Greg mutters... \n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Holy shit.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE AFRICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT\n\n     Pendergast and Margo come out of the door leading to the back entry to\n     the dioramas.  Pendergast holds the walkie talkie, desperate.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Vince?  Can you hear me?  Vince!\n\n     Nothing but static comes in response.  Margo paces in agitation.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    We have to try and draw it off!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    How?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    The answer's right in front of us.\n\n     She points to one of the dioramas.  It shows a bird being stalked by a\n     fox.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    That's a ptarmigan, feigning a\n                    broken wing.  The bird pretends to be\n                    injured to draw the fox away from\n                    its nest!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                        (starts running)\n                    It's deceptively simple.  Like a\n                    Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.\n\n     Margo heads for the Planetarium, calling... \n\n                              MARGO\n                    Help!  Please someone!  Help!\n\n     They disappear down the hall with the Greek vases, both calling with\n     all they've got.\n\n     EXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT\n\n     There are increasing numbers of SWAT vehicles around.  A HELICOPTER\n     lands on the roof.  The rescue effort continues to be slowed by rain\n     pouring down.  Ippolito is in the thick of the action.  The S.W.A.T.\n     commander, JENNINGS, comes over buckling an ammo belt over his\n     fatigues.\n\n                              JENNINGS\n                    We're ready.  We've got enough\n                    firepower to turn a herd of lions\n                    into a fine red mist.\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    Then do it.\n\n     Jennings nods, goes off.  As Ippolito watches the S.W.A.T. team break\n     the glass skylights, gets ready to go in.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE REPTILES - NIGHT\n\n     Jonathan crouches in the staircase at the end of the Hall of the\n     Reptiles.  Hobbes is still by his side.  He keeps the gun pointed out\n     into the room, his eyes scanning the dark.  He whispers to Hobbes, as\n     if to comfort both of them.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    It's okay, Hobbes.  We'll be all\n                    right.  Help has got to come\n                    eventually... We'll make it.  We'll be\n                    fine.\n\n     Suddenly he sees something.  What appears to be a BODY lying on a glass\n     case!  Jonathan pumps his gun, approaches slowly.  The man wears a\n     tuxedo, is lying very still.  As we get closer we see it's THE DRUNK\n     Kawakita ran into in the stairwell so long ago!  He suddenly HICCUPS.\n     Jonathan starts.  Now the man gently snores.  Jonathan moves to him,\n     shakes the drunk's shoulder.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Hey!  Wake up!\n\n     The man snorts, opens his eyes and frowns.\n\n                              DRUNK\n                    Who the hell are you?\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    You first.\n\n     Jonathan helps the drunk off the glass case.  The man's a little\n     unsteady as he tugs at his tux.\n\n                              DRUNK\n                    I got lost tryin' to find the\n                    bathroom.  I was walkin' in circles.\n                    I lay down for a nap.  What's going\n                    on?\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    You wouldn't believe me if I told\n                    you.\n\n     Hobbes has started to wag his tail and tug at the leash to draw\n     Jonathan's attention.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    What is it, boy?\n\n     From above comes the beating of a distant HELICOPTER and then the\n     sound of breaking glass.  Hobbes pulls Jonathan back to the staircase.\n     Jonathan grins, follows behind with the drunk.\n\n                              DRUNK\n                    Where we going?\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    I think we're going home.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT\n\n     Huge skeletons of Tyrannosaurus, Stegosaurus and Brontosaurus loom in\n     the darkness.  Rain is pouring in.  Jonathan, Hobbes and the drunk\n     enter, looks up to the sky lights.  A FLASH OF LIGHTING hits,\n     illuminating the dinosaurs and a S.W.A.T. team which is descending on\n     a series of ropes.  It's a sixty foot drop.  Jonathan steps forward.\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    Hello!  We're over here!\n\n     They run across the long hall and wait as the the men descend.  The\n     first one down is Jennings.\n\n                              JENNINGS\n                    Are you hurt?\n\n                              JONATHAN\n                    We're fine.  I don't know about the\n                    people downstairs.  In the Hall of\n                    the Heavens.  The basement... you'll\n                    need help.  There's a monster down\n                    there.\n\n     A sling suspended on ropes is lowered down.\n\n                              JENNINGS\n                    The rescue workers will lift you out\n                    one at a time.\n\n     Jennings signals to a group of five men, heavily armed and in flack\n     jackets.  They prepare to get the drunk out.\n\n     INT. HALL WITH GREEK VASES - NIGHT\n\n     Pendergast and Margo are at the top of the long, narrow shaft.\n     Pendergast's flashlight sends a circle of light onto a sheet of black,\n     oily water below.  Both of them continue calling, trying to draw off\n     the monster.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Help someone!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Oh God!  Help!\n\n     They suddenly hear the sound of splashing.  An updraft rustles their\n     clothes.  Margo sniffs the air, turns to Pendergast.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    You smell that?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    It's coming.  Run.\n\n     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     The group has reached another intersection of tunnels.  The left fork\n     turns back uphill.  D'Agosta indicates this tunnel.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    At least we'll be dry.\n\n     They all press forward in the low vaulted darkness.  As they move\n     steadily upwards the water recedes.  Kawakita's flashlight flickers and\n     he bangs it.  It comes on again.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    I believe in you a hundred percent,\n                    Vince, but that's the second time\n                    we've been at that intersection.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Not so loud.\n\n     D'Agosta shines his light forward and they see that the shaft ends in\n     a large round PIPE.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    What's that?\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    All right everybody, hold up!\n\n     Kawakita and D'Agosta move past the shivering people who are strung\n     out along the sides of the tunnel.  D'Agosta touches each person as he\n     passes.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    We don't know what's in there.  Let\n                    me go first.\n\n     INT. PIPE - NIGHT\n\n     The Mayor follows behind with the group as Kawakita and D'Agosta lead\n     the way.  The pipe is dry and rusted.  They move forward with stealth.\n     In twenty feet the pipe ends abruptly in darkness.  D'Agosta steps out\n     first.\n\n     INT. CAVERN - NIGHT\n\n     The group huddles at the mouth of the pipe, confused, as D'Agosta pans\n     his flashlight around the huge space.  The walls are carved out of dirt\n     and rounded like a cave.  From the ceiling hang huge cobwebs.  There's a\n     large pile of sticks in one corner fashioned rather like a bed.  On a\n     mound of dirt beside this bed rests a battered duffel bag.\n\n     Greg moves to it, shines his light on the side.  A name is written in\n     marker.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    What does it say?\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                        (looks up, shocked)\n                    Dr. John Whittlesley.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    What's that doing here?\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    I don't know.  I thought Dr.\n                    Whittlesley died in South America.\n\n                              MAYOR\n                        (interrupts)\n                    Look.  There's a ladder at the end.  I\n                    think it goes up to the street!\n\n     They move forward into the darkness eagerly, towards the ladder which\n     leads up to a manhole.  But as they pass the bed of twigs, something\n     loud CRUNCHES underfoot.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    What is that?\n\n     D'Agosta shines his light down and everyone freezes.  Then one woman\n     SCREAMS!\n\n     The wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white BONES!  The\n     HUMMING noise is louder and we see its source.  Atop the bones is the\n     body of CUTHBERT!  It's covered with BLACK DERMESTID BEETLES.  They're\n     stripping the skeleton clean, devouring the flesh!\n\n     The group panics and breaks for the ladder.  Kawakita and D'Agosta once\n     more guard the rear.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    I'd say we're in its home.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE NORTHWEST COAST INDIANS - NIGHT\n\n     Pendergast and Margo run down the long dark room, passing an enormous\n     hollowed-out canoe.  As they exit the far end, the dark shape of Mbwun\n     emerges.  It leaps forward, closing in fast.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT\n\n     Margo and Pendergast enter a series of maze-like room with hidden\n     corners, nooks and crannies with cases full of esoteric Buddhist and\n     Japanese Art.  They're running through the twists and turns as fast as\n     they can.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    We're not going to make the storage\n                    room!\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's\n                    DNA is part homo sapien.  In\n                    primates, the eye is a direct path\n                    to the brain!  If you get a clean\n                    shot, there's only one place you can\n                    kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!\n\n     AT THIS THEY ROUND A CORNER AND MBWUN LEAPS OUT!  It circled ahead and\n     was waiting in front of them!  The animal swipes at Margo and\n     Pendergast.  The force of the monster's blow sends Margo reeling and\n     slams Pendergast into the wall.  He falls, crumples and drops his gun!\n     The case beside him SHATTERS spewing relics, as Mbwun pushes past.\n     Pendergast groans and gets to his knees with difficulty.\n\n     MARGO is frantically crawling away in the dark!  The beast makes a low\n     sound of pleasure and reaches out one claw, easily pins her down.\n     Pendergast looks frantically for any kind of weapon!\n\n     ON MARGO now PINNED BENEATH the heaving body of the monster!\n     Powerless, she looks up into the horrible face of death as Mbwun\n     raises an enormous claw!  Pendergast, desperate, cries out --\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Please, no!  Don't hurt Margo!\n\n     Oddly enough, the beast pauses for once.  Talking to the damn thing is\n     the one tactic no one has tried!  The claw halts in mid-air.  The beast\n     blinks once and looks from Pendergast to Margo.  Margo sees a flash of\n     something unexpectedly HUMANin its eyes!  In astonishment, she\n     whispers... \n\n                              MARGO\n                    My God.  You understand.\n\n     As they stare, amazed, imperceptibly, the beast appears to narrow its\n     eyes in response!  Margo controls her voice, keeps it even.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Please let me go.  We won't hurt you.\n\n     A strange noise comes out of the monster.  A low, confused growl.  He\n     doesn't loosen his grip on Margo, but he leans down to look at her\n     closer with one green, unblinking eye.\n\n     She struggles not to turn away in revulsion.  His enormous jaws are\n     right near her throat.  Everything is very still.  And then... \n\n     A BARRAGE OF FIRE breaks out!  The S.W.A.T. team is in the doorway,\n     laying down everything they've got.  The creature ROARS as if betrayed,\n     leaves Margo and LEAPS UP.  It barrels down on the S.W.A.T. team, picks\n     up Jennings and SPIKES HIM TO THE GROUND.  Jennings hits the floor with\n     his neck at a crazy angle.  It snaps like a twig.  The other men drop\n     back.  Mbwun follows, tearing through the men, cutting a deathly swath!\n\n     Pendergast moves to help the S.W.A.T. team.  Margo struggles to her\n     feet and her hand touches the wall.  Beside her is a FIRE HOSE in a\n     cabinet!  In a split second Margo hauls it out, throws a switch and\n     gets a BLAST OF WATER.  She turns it on the beast as it grabs for\n     Pendergast.  The force of the water is enormous.  It pushes the monster\n     out the end of the hall.\n\n     Pendergast runs towards her, takes the hose and holds it.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Run!\n\n     She takes off blindly in the maze-like room.  From somewhere behind her\n     she hears a horrible HOWL.\n\n     ON MARGO... as she twists and turns through the rows of display cases,\n     tearing blindly in the dark.  Ahead is a door.  She dives through it and\n     finds she's in... \n\n     INT. MEN'S ROOM - MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n     A row of mirrors and urinals line the wall.  It's a huge room, designed\n     to handle crowds of visitors.  Margo ducks into one of the stalls as\n     MBWUN crashes in.  Margo looks through a crack in the door to see... \n\n     THE ANIMAL AT FULL STOP.  IT'S STARING AT ITSELF IN THE ROW OF MIRRORS!\n     The sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound!  The claws\n     lash out, breaking every mirror in the place, littering the floor with\n     glass!\n\n     Then the beast turns and backs up, groaning, as if cornered.  Margo\n     sees now that one limb is dragging, leaving a trail of blood.  The\n     mouth, too, appears to be bleeding.  The S.W.A.T. team's bullets had an\n     affect.\n\n     Margo presses back in the stall, bracing as the beast gets closer.\n     It's just outside.  It sniffs the air once and suddenly turns, rears\n     up, furious and crashes through the bathroom door.  Margo screams and\n     the thing grabs her!  It holds Margo up before it and roars.  It closes\n     its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for\n     everything.  The claws tighten!  She struggles and fights to no purpose\n     ... but then the beast pauses... it's seen something!\n\n     THE NECKLACE WITH TWO ARROWS AROUND HER NECK!\n\n     It stops and its grip loosens!  A pained look flashes across its\n     bestial face... \n\n     And in that split moment Margo looks down... \n\n     A NECKLACE OF SILVER gleams around the beast's throat too!  The\n     necklace is the twin to her own!\n\n     ON MARGO... Can it be possible?  She stares at the thing... \n\n                              MARGO\n                    John's necklace!  You killed him!\n\n     Incredibly the beast shakes its head.  A noise comes from it... a sad\n     noise, like a groan.  And now Margo gets it!  She can hardly believe it.\n     Her eyes widen in astonishment.  She whispers... \n\n                              MARGO\n                    Oh Jesus.  John?\n\n     The name is a knife through the monster's heart!\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No.  It's not possible!\n\n     The last piece of the puzzle falls.  The monster is John Whittlesley!\n     Margo, still desperately frightened, tries to keep control.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    John?  If it is you... I can help.\n\n     The monster shakes its head no and releases her.  As she watches he\n     moves away, quickly limps out the door.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT\n\n     Mbwun now drags himself across the grey carpet, headed for the stairs.\n     In the darkness of the hall of Asian Peoples, Pendergast is waiting.\n     He lifts one of the S.W.A.T. team rifles which he holds in his hands.\n     He aims, is about to fire, but then Margo comes up behind him.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you\n                    were right.  It's John!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    What?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    That thing is John Whittlesley.  I\n                    should have seen it before!  The\n                    fibers are infected with a virus.\n                    You eat them, and the virus alters\n                    your DNA!  He became addicted to them\n                    in South America, followed the\n                    plants back to the states.  He\n                    probably entered the country as a\n                    man.  It would have taken several\n                    months for the change to take place.\n                    That's how he got from the boat to\n                    the museum!\n\n     Pendergast looks over and sees the monster.  His eyes show disbelief.\n     Mbwun looks back at both of them briefly, then it disappears up the\n     stairs.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I don't believe it.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    You have to!  Listen!  All viruses\n                    pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the\n                    cells of the host to make more\n                    viruses!  This one was different.  It\n                    inserted a whole array of genes into\n                    John.  Reptile genes, sixty five\n                    million years old.  Those genes\n                    remade him!  It's not his fault!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Whatever that thing is, we have to\n                    kill it!\n\n     Margo tries to stop him, but he shrugs her off.\n\n     EXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT\n\n     A helicopter hovers outside pouring a circle of light down on the\n     roof.  Ippolito watches as the drunk is pulled up through the hall in a\n     sling.  Waters approaches, holding the walkie talkie.\n\n                              WATERS\n                    We can't raise the S.W.A.T. team.  No\n                    one's answering!  What do you want to\n                    do?\n\n     Ippolito eyes are fixed on the room below them.\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    Holy shit.  Pull him up.\n\n     Lightning throws horrible shadows of the hulking dinosaur skeletons\n     all around as MBWUN LIMPS INTO THE HALL!  The men on the roof stare\n     down astonished.  Their mouths hang open at the sight!\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    Get more guns!  Now!\n\n     The men get the drunk up and abandon the sling, leaving Jonathan\n     trapped below.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT\n\n     Jonathan and Hobbes take cover behind one of the dinosaurs and hide.\n     Mbwun sees Jonathan, lifts both claws, SWINGS at the skeleton, sending\n     it crashing down!  Jonathan SCREAMS, Hobbes is caught and falls.  He\n     scrambles into a corner, whimpering, as Pendergast and Margo appear in\n     the door.  Fifteen more S.W.A.T. team members with rifles now line the\n     hole in the roof.  They all point their guns at Mbwun.\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    Get back!  We're going to shoot!\n\n     Now Margo runs forward.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No.  Wait!  Let me talk to him first!\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                        (screaming)\n                    Kill that thing!  Kill it now!\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No!\n\n     MBWUN... turns and sees Margo.  She speaks desperately.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    John... you can give up now!  Just lie\n                    down where you are!\n\n     Mbwun seems to consider for a moment, but then its eyes gleam and it\n     ROARS.  With renewed vigor it leaps to the wall and starts to WALK UP\n     IT like a GECKO, ON ALL FOURS!  ON THE ROOF... \n\n     Some of the S.W.A.T. team fall back in terror!  Now that the monster is\n     on the wall it's out of range of their fire!\n\n                              WATERS\n                    Holy shit it's coming this way!\n\n                              IPPOLITO\n                    It's headed for the roof.  Run!\n\n     Ippolito turns and takes off once more in sheer terror.  Astonished,\n     Waters tries to regain control.\n\n                              WATERS\n                    Get back here, you asshole!  We can't\n                    let it get out!\n                        (to the S.W.A.T. team)\n                    Surround the opening and kill it!\n\n     But the men are terrified, retreating like Ippolito.  Waters shouts.\n\n                              WATERS\n                    Back, everybody!  That's an order!\n\n     But the team is in chaos and losing precious time.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT\n\n     The MONSTER is now half way up the wall.  Margo is distraught, crying.\n     Her cool demeanor is cracked.  Pendergast is with her.  She shakes her\n     head.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Just like John.  He won't listen.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I have to shoot.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the\n                    eye.\n\n     Pendergast raises a HIGH POWERED RIFLE with a laser sight.  He aims the\n     red laser beam directly at Mbwun's left eye.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    He has to look here or I won't get a\n                    clear shot.  Call him, Margo.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I can't!\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    You have to.  Do it now!\n\n     Margo takes a moment, her eyes streaming.  She has no choice, she calls\n     out.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    John!  John, look at me!\n\n     The beast looks down, sees Pendergast's rifle.  There's a long, awful,\n     moment.  Suddenly it emits a sound like a wail.\n\n     ON JONATHAN... staring, stunned.\n\n     PENDERGAST... steady... \n\n     MARGO... She's crying as she raises her arm as if to say good-bye.\n\n     And the gun EXPLODES.\n\n     ON MBWUN... its head shoots back in pain, and it falls... sixty feet\n     straight down to the ground.  Silence.  Thunder rolls.\n\n     It's over.  Pendergast turns to Margo and quietly folds her in his\n     arms.\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT\n\n     There are cops and journalists, ambulances, and medivacs all over the\n     place.  Greg Kawakita, wet and bedraggled as a rat, runs up from\n     Columbus Ave.  Behind him the Mayor and D'Agosta help the rest of the\n     company to the ambulances.\n\n     Waters is on the steps of the museum, helping to organize the rescue\n     efforts as Kawakita runs up to Pendergast.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Margo Green.  Have you seen her?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    She's over here.\n\n     Greg turns to see Margo come out of the Rotunda with Frock, Jonathan\n     and Hobbes.  Her face is devastated.  He moves to her side.  She reacts\n     as she sees him, and teacher and pupil hug.\n\n     D'AGOSTA is lost in the swirl of people.  And he likes it like that.  He\n     rests against a large stone lion, pulls out a cheap cigar in\n     cellophane, unwraps it carefully and tries to light it with a wet\n     match.\n\n     He's struggling hopelessly.  Finally he tosses the useless pack of\n     matches, sighs.  But then a flame lowers right before his face.  He\n     looks up to see Pendergast holding a silver engraved lighter.  D'Agosta\n     smiles, takes a nice long hit.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Nice to see you, Lieutenant.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.\n\n     We go to a wide shot of the museum as we slowly pull back... \n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     EXT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY - SUPER TITLE: SEVERAL MONTHS LATER\n\n     Christmas decorations are up.  A light snow is falling.  There is a very\n     long line.\n\n     INT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - GIFT SHOP - DAY\n\n     All the registers are doing a booming business.  People are buying\n     Mbwun posters, t-shirts and hats.\n\n     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - DAY\n\n     School tours, old ladies, parents and children, foreign tourists with\n     cameras snake through the displays.  In the room with the Relic,\n     there's a tremendous crowd.\n\n     INT. MARGO'S LABORATORY - DAY\n\n     Margo closes her computer, looks out a window at the falling snow.  She\n     turns and walks into the back office.  Kawakita is working there alone.\n     His fly-fishing rod stands in the corner, untouched.  Margo goes to it,\n     smiles softly.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    No time for fishing anymore?\n\n     Greg looks up from his work and smiles.\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Got to finish this thesis sometime.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    How about lunch?\n\n                              KAWAKITA\n                    Not today.  Besides, I think the\n                    director of the museum is expecting\n                    you.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Okay.\n\n     Margo exits.  Greg returns to his work.\n\n     INT. HALLWAYS - MUSEUM - DAY\n\n     Margo heads down the hall to the Director's office.  She walks through\n     the new double oak doors to find DR. FROCK seated at Cuthbert's old\n     desk.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Dr. Frock?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    Look who's here, Margo.\n\n     PENDERGAST and D'AGOSTA rise out of two high-backed chairs.  Margo\n     smiles for the first time, takes Pendergast's hands.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    I'm so glad to see you.  What's the\n                    occasion?\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to\n                    see Vince and we thought we'd see\n                    the new display.\n\n     INT. HALL OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - DAY\n\n     Margo, Pendergast, and D'Agosta follow Frock past the familiar\n     dioramas.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What\n                    happened to the rest of\n                    Whittlesley's plants?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    They were sent to the Center For\n                    Disease Control in Atlanta.\n\n                              D'AGOSTA\n                    Shouldn't a drug that powerful be\n                    destroyed?\n\n                              FROCK\n                    The virus itself might have positive\n                    applications.  They'll keep the\n                    plants in secure lock up while the\n                    studies are made.\n                        (beat)\n                    Greg isn't joining us?\n\n                              MARGO\n                    He's changed.  He's always working on\n                    his thesis.  He comes in early, stays\n                    late.  I tried to get him to join us,\n                    but he never takes a break.\n\n     They pause on a NEW DIORAMA.  It's huge, filling one entire end of the\n     hall.  In the center is a life-sized representation of MBWUN standing\n     on the tepui amid the plants.  Behind is a painting of John Whittlesley\n     as he once was.  He wears the necklace with the two arrows, of silver\n     and gold.  As Margo looks, she touches her own.  Pendergast turns to\n     her, sympathy in his eyes.\n\n                              PENDERGAST\n                    We did the right thing, Margo.\n\n     Margo smiles warmly.\n\n                              MARGO\n                    Yes.  I know.\n\n     INT. MARGO'S LABS - DAY\n\n     Greg Kawakita wears gloves, high powered glasses, works in solitude in\n     the lab.  Suddenly he stands up, throws off the glasses, then he sits\n     down again.  He seems to be struggling with himself.  He glances over\n     his shoulder to make sure he's alone.  Quickly he moves to a locked\n     drawer.  He opens it with a key from his pocket and takes out a small\n     envelope, looks inside.\n\n     INSERT... the envelope is full of the PLANT FIBERS!  Greg has managed to\n     keep his own cache!\n\n     Moving quickly, with jerky motions, he lays one fiber down on a slide\n     with a shaking hand.  With an exacto knife, he cuts off a tiny sliver,\n     pops it into his mouth.  He closes his eyes in ecstasy and savors the\n     taste.  Then he cuts one more infinitesimal sliver, leaves it on the\n     slide.  He takes a deep breath, returns the envelope to the drawer.  He\n     turns the key carefully and we GO CLOSE ON HIS HAND... \n\n     On the back is A ROW OF SCALES... \n\n                                                       FADE OUT:\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelic, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Amy Holden Jones\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:43.124003"}
