Twists his legs around, out of\n     the water, and flops his body onto the deck.\n\n     Shivering.\n\n     Tries to get up.  Falls over.  His body shaking.  His lips purple.

Sorry, Beth.\n\n     She smiles.\n\n<b>                         NORMAN\n</b>               The power allows us to manifest our\n               fears, right?  What if we feared the\n               power to go away?\n\n<b>                         HARRY\n</b>               You mean forget?\n\n<b>                         NORMAN\n</b>               It would erase all our knowledge of\n               it.  All of our power.\n\n<b>                         BETH\n</b>               Would it work?\n\n<b>                         NORMAN\n</b>               Yes.  And I think we already know it\n               will.\n\n<b>                         BETH\n</b>               How's that?\n\n<b>                         NORMAN\n</b>               Down below, Harry said we would all\n               have to die.  Since there was no\n               evidence on that spacecraft that\n               anybody knew time travel through a\n               black hole was possible -- and we\n               all knew -- then we would all have\n               to die before we could tell anyone.\n               Death was the only logical\n               explanation.  But sitting here, we\n               still know.  So how is that possible?\n                    (beat)\n               Unless we make ourselves forget.\n\n<b>     INT.

However, there doesn't seem\n               to be any squid recorded on these\n               tapes.\n\n<b>                         BETH\n</b>               A squid?
