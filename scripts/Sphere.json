STREET IN GEORGETOWN -- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT\n\n     Fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps.  Apartment\n     buildings line the curb, it is very quiet.  In one building, six floors\n     up, a bedroom light is on.  WE SEE the silhouette of Norman's WIFE\n     looking out the window.\n\n                         WIFE (O.S.)\n               What kind of a crash was it?\n\n                         NORMAN (O.S.)\n               You seen my suitcase?\n\n                         WIFE (O.S.)\n               There's nothing on the news about a\n               crash.  Did he say what airline?\n\n                         NORMAN (O.S.)\n               He didn't say much at all.  Honey --\n\n                         WIFE (O.S.)\n               In the closet.  I don't understand,\n               Norman -- why would they call you?\n\n                         NORMAN (O.S.)\n               Don't be so supportive, honey.\n\n                         WIFE (O.S.)\n               Well, I can't imagine five years of\n               unemployment --\n\n                         NORMAN (O.S.)\n               Four.

Are you\n               watching the news?\n\n                         WIFE (O.S.)\n               How are you getting to the airport?\n               You need money for the bus?\n\n     A tinted-window black SEDAN travels down the street, pulls up in front\n     of the apartment building.  A U.S.  NAVY decal is on the door.\n\n                         WIFE (O.S.)\n               There's a U.S.  Navy car outside,\n               Norman.\n\n                         NORMAN (O.S.)\n               What?\n\n                         WIFE (O.S.)\n               Was it a military crash?\n\n                         NORMAN (O.S.)\n               I don't know.\n\n                         WIFE (O.S.)\n               They never used to send a Navy car.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     THE LOUD, HARD CHOPPING OF A HELICOPTER PROPELLER\n\n     EXT.

HELICOPTER -- DAY\n\n     Norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back.  He studies a\n     pamphlet in his hand: \"AIRCRASH SURVIVAL: HOW TO COPE\".  The PILOT, in\n     the cockpit, turns to him.\n\n                         PILOT\n               What kinda work you in, Dr. Johnson?\n\n     Norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               I'm in psychology.

Been\n               flying so many scientists out here\n               -- can't keep everyone straight.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Who's everyone?\n\n                         PILOT\n               Physicists, mathematicians,\n               geologists, you name it.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Geologists?  At a plane crash?\n\n                         PILOT\n               Strange, isn't it?

SHIP DECK -- DAY\n\n     The helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about.  A\n     young, female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to\n     greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter.\n\n     She looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag.\n\n                         OFFICER\n               Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.\n\n     She lugs it over her shoulder, no problem.\n\n                         OFFICER\n               No other equipment?  Scientific\n               instruments?\n\n                         NORMAN\n               No, they didn't say --\n\n                         OFFICER\n               This way, sir.\n\n     Norman follows the officer away from the helipad.\n\n     INT.  SHIP\n\n     She leads Norman down a flight of stairs.\n\n                         OFFICER\n               Captain Barnes wants to see you\n               right away, sir.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Captain who?\n\n                         OFFICER\n               Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you.\n               Been calling us every half hour to\n               see if you're arrived.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Really?\n\n     As they march down a hallway, Norman looks down at his wrinkled suit,\n     tries to smooth it out.\n\n                         OFFICER\n               By the way sir, I've read your\n               report.  I think it's brilliant.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               What report?\n\n                         OFFICER\n               You mean they haven't told you yet?\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Told me what?\n\n     She staightens up, like she might have said too much.\n\n                         OFFICER\n               This way, sir.\n\n     INT.  BARNES' OFFICE\n\n     CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES, 60s, immaculate, proud of who he is, talks on\n     the phone.\n\n                         BARNES\n               How's he look?...  Well, we can't all\n               be officers, can we?\n                    (laughs)\n               They tell me he's brilliant.\n\n     EXT.  BARNES' OFFICE\n\n     Norman stands in front of the door.  The doorplate reads: PROJECT\n     COMMANDER -- CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES.  Norman straightens his big-knotted\n     tie.  Deep breath.\n\n     INT.  BARNES' OFFICE\n\n     As the door opens, Barnes is putting down the phone, rises from his\n     desk, as Norman steps inside.\n\n                         BARNES\n               Dr. Norman Johnson.  Welcome aboard.\n\n     They shake hands.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Thank you, Colonel.\n\n                         BARNES\n               Captain.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Captain.  Right, forgive me.\n\n     Barnes looks at Norman, sizing him up.  An akward silence.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Well, thanks for the opportuninty\n               here -- my wife appreciates it.\n\n                         BARNES\n               Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You\n               weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made\n               me take you.\n\n                         NORMAN\n                    (smiling)\n               The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had\n               friends in Washington.\n\n     Norman tries to laugh as Barnes ushers him to the door...\n\n                         BARNES\n               Come with me.  The team's already\n               waiting.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               What team?\n\n     INT.  HALLWAY\n\n     Barnes leads Norman down the corridor, lined with OFFICERS and GUARDS.\n\n                         BARNES\n               What have you been told so far?\n\n                         NORMAN\n               The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers\n               unknown.  Routine stuff really.\n\n                         BARNES\n               Anything else?\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Nothing else.\n\n     A GUARD unlocks a large, steel door.\n\n                         GUARD\n               Captain Barnes.  Dr. Johnson.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Hello.\n\n     Norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway,\n     wondering how the guard knows his name.\n\n                         BARNES\n               You talk to any reporters?  Any\n               press?\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Press?  No, I haven't.\n\n     The steel door shuts loudly behind them.\n\n                         BARNES\n               Good.  Security's been our biggest\n               worry.  Now that you're here we can\n               shut this thing down tight.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               From what?  What's with all the\n               security?\n\n                         BARNES\n               Well, we don't have all the facts\n               yet.\n\n     Another GUARD opens up another large steel door...\n\n     INT.  TECH ROOM\n\n     Barnes leads Norman through the room, crammed with video monitors,\n     screens, and grids.  Officers talk into radios.  Technicians work on\n     computers.\n\n                         BARNES\n               We're moving fast considering the\n               storm.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Storm?  What storm?\n\n                         BARNES\n               A cyclone's on it's way in.  I\n               thought they would have told you on\n               the phone.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               They didn't tell me anything.\n\n     Norman tries to keep pace...\n\n                         BARNES\n               We've had divers working around the\n               clock.  Take a look at this...\n\n     ANGLE ON a large VIDEO SCREEN -- shows a diver walking on the ocean\n     floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               How deep is he?\n\n                         BARNES\n               A thousand feet.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               A thousand?

Something of the\n               military crashes in the ocean -- it\n               explains why there was nothing on\n               the news, why you've kept everything\n               a secret...  When did it crash?\n\n                         BARNES\n               As best we can estimate, it crashed\n               four hundred years ago.\n\n     A beat.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Four hundred?

We weren't talking\n               to an alien intelligence when we\n               talked to Jerry, we were talking to\n               Harry... or a part of Harry.\n\n                         BETH (O.S.)\n               What do you mean, a part of Harry?\n\n     BACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM\n\n                         NORMAN\n               When did the messages start?  The\n               animals outside start showing up?\n               After Harry came out of the sphere.\n\n                         BETH\n               You think, in the sphere --\n\n                         NORMAN\n               He acquired some sort of power.  A\n               power to manifest things.\n\n                         BETH\n               But how?\n\n                         NORMAN\n               I don't know.\n\n                         BETH\n               How can the sphere do that?\n\n                         NORMAN\n               I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the\n               fucking alien that built the thing.\n               But it can.  When Harry came out of\n               the sphere, he mumbled something\n               about page 87.  How he would never\n               read that far -- he was too scared\n               to.  Then you found the book,\n               remember in your lab.  Then in the\n               cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about\n               a giant squid... \n\n                         BETH\n               Which I told Barnes was attacking --\n\n                         NORMAN\n               It's his fear.  The squid.  He's\n               manifesting his fears.  Making them\n               real.\n\n                         BETH\n               But why is he doing it?\n\n                         NORMAN\n               He must not realize he is.  Like the\n               Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping\n               then.  He must've manifested his\n               dream.\n\n                         BETH\n               His dream?  You can't control your\n               dreams.  And you can't control your\n               fears, can you?\n\n                         NORMAN\n                    (shaking his head)\n               No.  I mean, we've always believed we\n               can think anything we want without\n               consequences.  You ever read the\n               Bible?\n                    (off her look)\n               It talks about our sinful nature,\n               you know?  I mean, we can think, and\n               believe, and desire whatever we\n               want, but there's a part of us -- a\n               shadow side, as Jung called it --\n               that can't be controlled.  It's evil.\n               It's inside us.  It's what we are.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     IN -- THE LIVING QUARTERS\n\n     It's dark.  Harry lies on his bunk, asleep.\n\n                         BETH (O.S.)\n               And that's the part of Harry that's\n               being manifested.\n\n                         NORMAN (O.S.)\n               Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part\n               of him not even he can control.\n\n     Harry opens his eyes, stares at us.\n\n     WE BEGIN TO HEAR A LOW INSISTENT BEEPING... \n\n     INT.

Checks the monitors.  Looks around\n     the console, not knowing what it is.\n\n     A FLASHING LIGHT on the Sensor Board.  Norman still doesn't know what\n     it means.\n\n     THE MONITORS go blank.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Beth --\n\n     The MONITORS flash up: \"I AM COMING.\"\n\n     Norman spins around, goes to HARRY -- lying still.  Norman grabs\n     Harry's wrist.  Checking pulse.\n\n     Norman returns to the console, slips on the headset... \n\n                         NORMAN\n               Beth?  Beth?  Can you hear me?  Get the\n               hell out of there.\n\n     THE MONITORS boot up again.

They are all\n     still.\n\n     Norman turns to looks at Harry... \n\n     CLOSE ON HARRY'S FACE -- still.\n\n     BACK ON -- NORMAN, sweating... \n\n                         NORMAN\n               And whatever it is, it's not coming\n               from Harry.\n\n     Norman looks at the monitors:\n\n     ON AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- a bright LIGHT blinds the SCREEN.  It's\n     Beth in the sub, moving along the habitat.\n\n     The Sub's CLAW ARMS carry large RED BOXES.  The lettering on the boxes\n     isn't in focus.\n\n     Norman squints at the MONITOR -- can't make it out.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Beth?  What is that?  What are you\n               doing?\n\n     The Sub's CLAW ARMS drops one of the BOXES, plumping it softly on the\n     muddy floor.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Can you hear me?  Beth?  Can you copy?\n               Get inside, there's something out\n               there.\n\n     ON ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub moves forward.  Churning up the sediment.\n     It stops again, and releases another box.\n\n     Norman BANGS on the headset.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Damn it, Beth, I know you hear me.\n\n     THE MONITORS blink: \"I AM COMING FOR YOU\"\n\n     ON NORMAN -- breathing heavy.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               What the hell?\n\n     ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub in view -- a closer view.  It releases it's\n     last box.  Norman can read the lettering now: \"CAUTION: TEVAC\n     EXPLOSIVES\"\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Beth?  C'mon.  What are you -- ?\n\n     THE MONITORS flash: \"I WILL KILL YOU\"\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Oh shit.\n\n     Norman WHIPS off his headset, bursts out of his seat, OPENS a CABINET.\n     Searching for tapes.  Another cabinet.  Then another.\n\n     A shelf labled: \"SPHERE\" -- all the tapes are gone.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               It's her.\n\n     THE MONITORS flash: \"I WILL KILL YOU\"\n\n     ON THE HEADSET -- resting on the console.

An inch or\n     two of water on the floor.\n\n     INT.  LIVING QUARTERS\n\n     CLOSE ON A METAL CASE -- labled: \"Captain Harold Barnes.\"\n\n     Norman BANGS it against the wall, trying to bust the LOCK.  BANGING.\n     BANGING.  Breaks the lock.  Digs inside the case.\n\n     Pulls out a GUN.\n\n     INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR\n\n     Norman pushing Harry and the IV stand.  Wheels him into... \n\n     BATHROOM/SINK AREA\n\n     Norman stops.  Turns off the main lights.  The room goes dark.  The\n     florescent LIGHT above the sinks stay on.\n\n     Norman wheels Harry inside, places him by a wall.  Checks the IV.\n\n     Norman goes to a STALL.  Steps inside.  Keeps the stall door open.  Can\n     still see Harry about 10 feet away.\n\n     Norman looks at the GUN.  COCKS it.  Pinches his finger.\n\n                         NORMAN\n               Ouch.\n\n     He waits.  Listening.\n\n     A FAINT HIGH-PITCHED HISSING SOUND\n\n     Norman looks over at the sinks.\n\n     A FAUCET is on.  Water HISSING faintly from it.\n\n     Norman ignores it.  Waiting in the dark.  Listening.\n\n     ON THE FAUCET -- the water running.\n\n     ON NORMAN -- looking at it.  Can't ignore it.  Tries.  But can't.\n\n     Norman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor.\n\n     OVER TO THE SINKS\n\n     The light above them on.  Norman turns the faucet off.  The water stops.\n\n     But the HISSING SOUND remains.\n\n     Norman looks at the faucet, queerly.  Turns it back on.  Then off.\n\n     The HISSING SOUND still there.  It isn't the water.\n\n     Norman looks down at his feet... \n\n     THE FLOOR -- seems to be moving.  Something swimming in the water.\n\n     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S PANTLEG -- a long, tubular SEA SNAKE slithers up\n     inside his pantleg, HISSING.  His pants BULGING as the SNAKE slowly\n     slides up past his knee.\n\n     HISSING LOUDER\n\n     As more SNAKES comes through the crack in the wall.\n\n     NORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE\n     slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt.\n\n     Another SNAKE begins WRAPPING itself around the outside of Norman,\n     sliding up around his neck.\n\n     WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COME FROM DOWN THE HALL\n\n     NORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides,\n     slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin,\n     over his face.  Their forked tongues FLICKING and HISSING.\n\n                         BETH (O.S.)\n               What time is it, Norman?\n\n     NORMAN looking in the MIRROR -- as Beth comes up behind him in her\n     jumpsuit.\n\n                         BETH\n               Do you know the time?\n\n     Norman GLARES at her in the mirror.

SNAKES writhing in her hands, twisted around her wrists.\n     Shakes them off.  Some drop in the sink.  She bends out of view -- and\n     the SNAKE inside Norman's shirt, MOVES back down the way it came.\n\n     Past his stomach, his groin.\n\n     Norman HEAVES from his chest, VOMITS on the mirror... \n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     INT.

OCEAN -- UNDERWATER\n\n     His body upside down, his hand holding onto the frame.  He grabs a PIPE\n     next to it, pulls himself hand over hand, along the pipe.\n\n     HIS FACE -- straining from the freezing chill.\n\n     MOVING along the pipe, hand over hand.  He loses grip.  His body thrusts\n     upwards.\n\n     CLOSE ON HIS RIGHT HAND -- purple, frozen, holding onto the pipe.\n     Barely gripping.\n\n     HIS FACE -- his eyes fluttering.  He blows air from his mouth, BUBBLES\n     burst from his lips.\n\n     HIS BODY slightly descending.\n\n     HIS LEFT HAND -- grips the pipe.  He continues on.\n\n     HAND OVER HAND.  Pulling himself... \n\n     UNDER THE HABITAT\n\n     He SEES the airlock in front of him.\n\n     He SCOOTS along, but slower, now.  He stops.  Can't continue.  He clasps\n     his hand to his CHEST, it's burning.  He SEES the airlock.  His eyes\n     fluttering, he's losing consciousness.  He can't do it.  And he lets go\n     of the pipe.\n\n     FLOATING UPWARDS -- is he gone?\n\n     HIS HEAD -- BANGS into the habitat floor.  His body flat underneath it.\n     Being sucked upwards against it.\n\n     He pushes forward... trying to grab the floor with his hands.  He's\n     inches from the airlock.\n\n     Plants his feet against the wall -- and pushes forward.  His body\n     SUCKED UP and away... \n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     INT.  AIRLOCK\n\n     ... His head BURSTS above the water level, BIG BREATH.  GASPING.  He\n     flails his arms over to the ladder.  Grips the ladder, but his hands\n     are like ice.  Can't hold it.  He slips.\n\n     Flailing in the water.\n\n     He HEAVES his chest over the METAL RIM.  Twists his legs around, out of\n     the water, and flops his body onto the deck.\n\n     Shivering.\n\n     Tries to get up.  Falls over.  His body shaking.  His lips purple.  His\n     eyes barely open, looking at... \n\n     HIS JUMPSUIT -- hanging on the wall.\n\n     Norman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently.  He reaches\n     out for his boots on the floor.  Can't grip them.  Inches his HEAD\n     toward his suit, tries to BITE at his suit, but his TEETH chattering.\n\n                         BETH (O.S.)\n               I know what you're doing, Norman.\n               But you can't save yourself.\n\n     He grips the wall, his hands pulling him up.  He RIPS his suit off the\n     hanger.\n\n                         BETH (O.S.)\n               It's over, Norman.

Looks around at the\n     cylinders, the walls.\n\n     Goes to the outside of a WALL.  Looking for a CRACK, a LEAK, a way in.\n\n     TO HIS LEFT -- Barnes' body, floating, hooked to the wall.\n\n     Norman goes to him.  SEES the CRACK.\n\n     Climbing inside.
