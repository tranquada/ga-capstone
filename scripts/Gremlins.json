An American businessman.1-He\n          wears a tas eful g3,y suit. He's thin, with distinguished\n          good looks and thin brown hair. He's 56 years old.\n          Rand looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people\n          and merchandise. He stops at a booth. A tiny ORIENTAL,\n          WOMAN stands behind the counter. Rand gives her a polite\n          smile.\n\n          RAND\n          Hi.

Long white\n          hair. Ragged clothes. A rotted smile. Overhearing\n          Rand, the man stops to eavesdrop.\n\n          RAND\n          (explaining to\n          Oriental woman)\n          I'm looking for a present...\n          for my son.\n          The woman nods.

He leads the\n          nervous, apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room.\n          The Oriental picks up a small, metal box.

He opens\n          the box.\n          A TINY CREATURE is inside'.\n          The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on\n          two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered\n          hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The\n          piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed.\n          A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small,\n          square teeth.\n          The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle.\n          Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything\n          like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney\n          character.\n          The Oriental claps his hands.\n          The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder.\n          The animal licks Rand's cheek.'

Amazed by the animal.\n          he Oriental takes a bit from the raw fish. Juice runs\n          own his chin.

He gives\n          them to the man.\n          The Oriental smiles and claps his hands. Mogwai jumps\n          onto Rand's shoulders. Rand pets it. Mogwai emits a cute\n          giggle.\n\n          ORIENTAL MAN\n          It never sleeps. It will eat any-\n          thing... but prefers raw meat.\n\n          (PAUSE)\n          It must always be kept indoors during\n          the day. It lives in shadow. It\n          hates bright light. Direct sunlight\n          will kill it.\n          Rand nods. He takes Mogwai from his shoulder and puts it\n          into the box. Rand puts the box under his arm. The\n          Oriental smiles\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          ORIENTAL MAN\n          Your son will enjoy his new friend.\n          Rand smiles and exits.
