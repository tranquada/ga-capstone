As the NARRATOR\n     speaks we move through galaxies, nebulae, solar systems, moving from\n     the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within\n     a maze of suns.\n\n                                   NARRATOR\n                              (over)\n                    It is the mid 22nd Century.  Mankind\n                    has explored the boundaries of his\n                    own solar system, and now he reaches\n                    out to the endless interstellar\n                    distances of the universe.  He moves\n                    away from his own small planetary\n                    system in huge hyperdrive starships:\n                    computer-driven, self-supporting,\n                    closed-system spacecraft that travel\n                    at mind-staggering post-light\n                    velocities.  Man has begun to spread\n                    among the stars.  Enormous ships\n                    embark with generations of colonists\n                    searching the depths of space for\n                    new earths, now homes, new\n                    beginnings.  Far in advance of these\n                    colony ships goes a new pioneer: the\n                    scouts, the pathfinders, a special\n                    breed of man who has dedicated his\n                    life to blazing the trail through\n                    the most distant, unexplored\n                    galaxies, opening up the farthest\n                    frontiers of space.  These are the\n                    men of the Advance Exploration\n                    Corps.  The task they face is one of\n                    unbelievable isolation and\n                    loneliness.  So far from home that\n                    Earth is no longer even a point of\n                    light in the sky, they must comb the\n                    universe for those unstable planets\n                    whose existence poses a threat to\n                    the peaceful colonists that follow.\n                    They must find these rogue planets\n                    -- and destroy them.  Among these\n                    commandos are the men of the\n                    scoutship Dark Star.\n\n     We are now moving toward a planet.  Floating in front of the planet is\n     the SCOUTSHIP DARK STAR.  As we move toward the ship, we begin to hear\n     VOICES, crackling with static.\n\n                                   DOOLITTLE\n                              (over -- radio filter)\n                    Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?\n\n                                   PINBACK\n                              (over -- great static)\n                    Mafhkin oble groop...\n\n                                   DOOLITTLE\n                              (over -- filter)\n                    Ah, what was that again, I still\n                    can't hear you?\n\n                                   PINBACK\n                              (over -- filter)\n                    I said I'm trying to reach Talby.\n                    Something's wrong with the damn\n                    intercom.

However, when it explodes in\n                    contact with an object the size of a\n                    planet, it starts a chain-reaction\n                    in the very matter of that planet,\n                    turning it into a giant reactor\n                    which destroys itself in one\n                    staggering thermal flash.\n\n                    These bombs are equipped with\n                    sophisticated thought and speech\n                    mechanisms, to allow them to make\n                    executive decisions in the event of\n                    a crisis situation.

With a sour look at\n     Pinback, Boiler picks up the notebook and begins to leaf through it.\n\n                                   DOOLITTLE\n                    Let's have some music in here,\n                    Boiler.\n\n     Boiler presses a button.

You see, I can watch things up\n                    here, Doolittle.  I love to watch\n                    things, just stare at the planets\n                    and meteors and asteroids, gas\n                    clusters...\n\n                                   DOOLITTLE\n                    You'll have plenty of time for that,\n                    you know.  Figure it this way: twenty\n                    years in space and we've only aged\n                    three, so there'll be plenty of time\n                    to stare around...\n\n                                   TALBY\n                    You know, Doollttle, if we're going\n                    into the Veil Nebula, we may\n                    actually find a strange and\n                    beautiful thing: the Phoenix\n                    Asteroids.  They should be passing\n                    through there about now...\n\n                                   DOOLITTLE\n                    Phoenix Asteroids?  Never heard of\n                    'em.\n\n                                   TALBY\n                    They are a body of asteroids that\n                    make a complete circuit of the\n                    universe once every 12.3 trillion\n                    years.  The Phoenix Asteroids... From\n                    what I've heard, Doolittle, they\n                    glow... glow with all the colors of\n                    the rainbow.  Nobody knows why.  They\n                    just glow as they drift around the\n                    universe.  Imagine all the sights\n                    they've seen in the time they've\n                    been travelling -- the birth and\n                    death of stars, things we'll never\n                    see.  The universe is alive,\n                    Doolittle.  I thought it was all\n                    empty, but it isn't.  In between the\n                    stars, it's seething with light and\n                    gasses and dust.  There are little\n                    pebbles drifting around, planets no\n                    one on Earth has ever seen... No one\n                    but the Phoenix Asteroids...\n\n     There is a BLIPPING SOUND.  It is insistent.  Talby is rudely yanked\n     from his reverie.  He looks down at a panel.  But his soft talk has\n     started Doolittle reminiscing.\n\n                                   DOOLITTLE\n                    You know what I think about, Talby?\n\n                                   TALBY\n                    I'm getting something here, on this\n                    readout...\n\n                                   DOOLITTLE\n                    It's funny, but I kind of sit\n                    around, you know, a lot of time to\n                    myself...\n\n                                   TALBY\n                    I think I'm getting a malfunction\n                    here somewhere.\n\n                                   DOOLITTLE\n                    I can't talk to the others, but with\n                    time to myself, I think about back\n                    home, back home at Malibu.  I used to\n                    surf a lot, Talby.  I used to be a\n                    great surfer.\n\n                                   TALBY\n                    Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a\n                    definite malfunction on one of the\n                    closed-circuit computer systems...\n\n                                   DOOLITTLE\n                    The waves at Malibu and Zuma were\n                    fantastic in the springs Talby.
