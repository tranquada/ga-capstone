As the NARRATOR\n     speaks we move through galaxies, nebulae, solar systems, moving from\n     the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within\n     a maze of suns.\n\n<b>                                   NARRATOR\n</b>                              (over)\n                    It is the mid 22nd Century.  Mankind\n                    has explored the boundaries of his\n                    own solar system, and now he reaches\n                    out to the endless interstellar\n                    distances of the universe.  He moves\n                    away from his own small planetary\n                    system in huge hyperdrive starships:\n                    computer-driven, self-supporting,\n                    closed-system spacecraft that travel\n                    at mind-staggering post-light\n                    velocities.  Man has begun to spread\n                    among the stars.  Enormous ships\n                    embark with generations of colonists\n                    searching the depths of space for\n                    new earths, now homes, new\n                    beginnings.  Far in advance of these\n                    colony ships goes a new pioneer: the\n                    scouts, the pathfinders, a special\n                    breed of man who has dedicated his\n                    life to blazing the trail through\n                    the most distant, unexplored\n                    galaxies, opening up the farthest\n                    frontiers of space.  These are the\n                    men of the Advance Exploration\n                    Corps.  The task they face is one of\n                    unbelievable isolation and\n                    loneliness.  So far from home that\n                    Earth is no longer even a point of\n                    light in the sky, they must comb the\n                    universe for those unstable planets\n                    whose existence poses a threat to\n                    the peaceful colonists that follow.\n                    They must find these rogue planets\n                    -- and destroy them.  Among these\n                    commandos are the men of the\n                    scoutship <u>Dark Star</u>.\n\n     We are now moving toward a planet.

It's\n                    coming right by me.\n\n     Several chunks of debris from the ship drift past Doolittle.\n\n<b>                                   TALBY\n</b>                    Doolittle, I'm catching up to the\n                    asteroids.  I'm going to be a part of\n                    them in a minute.  Doolittle, I'm\n                    going into them.\n\n     Talby drifts into the huge frost-like shapes, expanding and glowing\n     and spinning, slowly refracting all the colors of the spectrum with a\n     cold glow.\n\n<b>                                   TALBY\n</b>                              (cont'd)\n                    I'm beginning to glow.\n\n     The field of spectral shapes, with Talby in their midst, begin to\n     drift away into the distance.\n\n<b>                                   TALBY\n</b>                              (cont'd)\n                    They're taking me with them, with\n                    the Phoenix... going to circle the\n                    universe forever.  I'm with them\n                    now... be back this way again some\n                    day.  Doolittle, before it's too\n                    late, there's one last thing I\n                    want to tell you...\n\n     Talby's signal dies out as the glowing lights disappear into the\n     depths of space.\n\n     Doolittle is hanging onto a long, thin chunk of debris.\n\n<b>                                   DOOLITTLE\n</b>                    Hey, Talby!  I've grabbed a piece of\n                    the ship, and I think I've figured\n                    out a way!\n\n     He pulls the piece of metal down beneath his feet, and stands on it.\n\n     Crouching and extending his arms, Doolittle surfs down into the\n     atmosphere of the planet, banking and planing as he disappears to a\n     small dot.\n\n<b>     END TITLES AND MUSIC OVER.\n</b>\n\n\n   </pre>\n\n\n\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Dark Star</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=John Carpenter\" title=\"Scripts by John Carpenter\">John Carpenter</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Dan O'Bannon\" title=\"Scripts by Dan O'Bannon\">Dan O'Bannon</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Dark Star Script.html#comments\" title=\"Dark Star comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:03:13.357372"}
