Second Thug hides his gun. The\r\n          door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots\r\n          Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.\r\n\r\n           24.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          JEN\r\n           Place is a little dead.\r\n\r\n                          SELINA\r\n           (takes envelope, tense)\r\n           It'll liven up in a minute, trust\r\n           me.\r\n\r\n                          JEN\r\n           Everything okay?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          SELINA\r\n           Great.

Stryver glances at the window and -\r\n          SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs\r\n\r\n           25.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Second Thug's gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the\r\n          other Thugs, who drop.

Catwoman holds\r\n          Daggett by the throat, threatening him.\r\n\r\n                          CATWOMAN\r\n           Stay back!\r\n          They continue to approach.

Catwoman spots\r\n          it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman.\r\n\r\n                          BATMAN\r\n           They just don't care.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps\r\n          forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the\r\n          fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she\r\n          fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at\r\n          another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to\r\n          miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.\r\n\r\n           62.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CATWOMAN\r\n           You've got to be kidding.\r\n\r\n                          BATMAN\r\n           No guns.

As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy\r\n          hisses shut, taking bullets from above.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CATWOMAN\r\n           My mother warned me about getting\r\n           into cars with strange men -\r\n\r\n                          BATMAN\r\n           This isn't a car.\r\n          Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,\r\n          downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all\r\n          but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against\r\n          the wind...Bane.

Like being at the bottom of a gigantic\r\n          well...\r\n           Hope. Every man who has rotted here\r\n           over the centuries has looked up to\r\n           the light and imagined climbing to\r\n           freedom. So simple. So easy. And,\r\n           like shipwrecked men turning to sea\r\n           water from uncontrollable thirst,\r\n           many have died trying.

So\r\n           as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed\r\n           its people hope to poison their\r\n           souls.
