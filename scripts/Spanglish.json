BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE - MALE FORM - LATE AFTERNOON      1\n</b>\n    A shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man's\n    back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular.\n    LATIN MUSIC PLAYS... a song.... if you understood the words\n    you would hear love confronted and considered in a very\n    specific way...We are in a Mexico City suburb. The day is\n    hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the\n    first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red\n    fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes\n    beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part\n    massage. The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb\n    probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his\n    ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down --\n    and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for\n    another trip down his upper body...\n    MAIN TITLES BEGIN: Full titles, minute after minute of titles\n    with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30\n    minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and\n    rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting\n    tired. Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...The\n    unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a\n    single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand\n    complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as\n    TITLES CONTINUE.....The new hand, wearing a wedding ring,\n    goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says\n    something in Spanish...important for us because it will\n    establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we\n    understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She\n    replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty\n    laugh, that her hands are tired. We understand. The man tells\n    her to continue. She continues, the rub now desultory and\n    resentful. She stops for another rest. The man wants more and\n    grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view\n    for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular\n    anger, \"you said you would never push me around again. If you\n    do, I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own\n    back as high as you want.\" (NOTE: All Spanish dialogue will\n    be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish\n    speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.)\n    For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue.\n    Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic\n    argument in Spanish. This is no longer a massage we envy.\n    This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord\n    and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of\n    their marriage.\n\n<b>2   INT./EXT.

As mother\n    and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man\n    getting out. He nods in another direction calling our\n    attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman\n    does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her\n    father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the\n    child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is\n    disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially\n    when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks\n    from the window and sees the ominous man coming.

Looking off --the woman\n    grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money. The\n    undercover cop begins shouting orders.

Her husband makes a break for the\n    window. The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing\n    to fire a warning shot. The woman moves ever so quickly to a\n    shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her\n    daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. It is\n    an impressive charade.\n\n<b>    FULL SHOT - TAKING IN BOTH ROOMS.\n</b>\n    And just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing,\n    she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the\n    shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she learned\n    today..the daughter says she was taught a little English.\n    Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband\n    toward the front door where other police await.

It seems the mother will save her\n    child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the\n    police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her\n    father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear\n    starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly.
