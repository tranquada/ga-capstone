BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE - MALE FORM - LATE AFTERNOON      1\n\n    A shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man's\n    back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular.\n    LATIN MUSIC PLAYS... a song.... if you understood the words\n    you would hear love confronted and considered in a very\n    specific way...We are in a Mexico City suburb. The day is\n    hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the\n    first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red\n    fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes\n    beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part\n    massage. The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb\n    probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his\n    ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down --\n    and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for\n    another trip down his upper body...\n    MAIN TITLES BEGIN: Full titles, minute after minute of titles\n    with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30\n    minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and\n    rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting\n    tired. Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...The\n    unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a\n    single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand\n    complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as\n    TITLES CONTINUE.....The new hand, wearing a wedding ring,\n    goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says\n    something in Spanish...important for us because it will\n    establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we\n    understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She\n    replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty\n    laugh, that her hands are tired. We understand. The man tells\n    her to continue. She continues, the rub now desultory and\n    resentful. She stops for another rest. The man wants more and\n    grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view\n    for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular\n    anger, \"you said you would never push me around again. If you\n    do, I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own\n    back as high as you want.\" (NOTE: All Spanish dialogue will\n    be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish\n    speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.)\n    For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue.\n    Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic\n    argument in Spanish. This is no longer a massage we envy.\n    This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord\n    and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of\n    their marriage.\n\n2   INT./EXT. BEDROOM / DUSTY ROAD - OTHER ANGLE                  2\n\n    Showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school\n    bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road.\n    We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks\n    up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word,\n\n\n\n\n                                                             2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \"Cristina.\" When the man protests her stopping she indicates\n    they should both run and meet their daughter. He waves her\n    off. Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room.....\n\n3   EXT. DUSTY ROAD - THE BUS                                     3\n\n    As CRISTINA, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to\n    step down. She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly,\n    digging into her little pack to pull out an English book\n    which she displays with pride. Now she steps down from the\n    bus and, as she walks TOWARD CAMERA, narration begins. The\n    voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.\n\n                        NARRATOR\n\n              To Princeton University's Director\n              of Admissions: In considering me\n              for a scholarship you have asked\n              for, and have every reason to\n              expect, an essay from me about\n              myself. And, as a clever high\n              school graduate, I of course\n              realize the subtext of this essay\n              about who I am and why I want to\n              enter Princeton, is actually to\n              make clear to you why you should\n              have me. I have gotten tips, from\n              friends who have preceded me to\n              college, that being a Latina, with\n              my grades, list of activities and\n              relative poverty, I am as good as\n              in if I simply do the dance and\n              work in a word like\n              \"bipolarization\" every so often.\n              And while I love dances -- this\n              dance of self is one I am afraid to\n              master.\n                  (young girl looks off and\n                   lights up)\n              I prefer to write about my mother.\n\n4   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - SCHOOL GIRL'S POV - MOM                   4\n\n    A drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's. As mother\n    and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man\n    getting out. He nods in another direction calling our\n    attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman\n    does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her\n    father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the\n    child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is\n    disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially\n    when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks\n    from the window and sees the ominous man coming. The woman\n    now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so\n    she does not see what is transpiring.\n\n                        NARRATOR\n\n              For my mother, that afternoon\n              eleven years ago was a watershed\n              not because of my father's\n\n                        (MORE)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                             3.\n\n                        NARRATOR (cont'd)\n              imprisonment but because it was my\n              first day at school....\n\n5   INT. KITCHEN / HUSBAND'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                5\n\n    This room is directly across from the husband's room. The\n    woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show\n    the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches.\n    The man gives her husband some money..all the time the woman\n    is chattering to distract the girl. Looking off --the woman\n    grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money. The\n    undercover cop begins shouting orders. The woman raises her\n    voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles\n    her daughter.\n\n                        NARRATOR\n\n              There was never any pretense that\n              the gorgeous, vital, clever,\n              temperamental animal that was my\n              mother ever for a heartbeat\n              considered having any life of her\n              own. She ignored all her needs and\n              was alive only for me. It was\n              terrific.\n                  (a long beat)\n              At the time.\n\n    ON MOM.\n\n    As she watches her daughter chew a cookie. Her daughter\n    begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a\n    glow we have not yet seen. And all the while she eyes the\n    action in the next room. Her husband makes a break for the\n    window. The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing\n    to fire a warning shot. The woman moves ever so quickly to a\n    shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her\n    daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. It is\n    an impressive charade.\n\n    FULL SHOT - TAKING IN BOTH ROOMS.\n\n    And just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing,\n    she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the\n    shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she learned\n    today..the daughter says she was taught a little English.\n    Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband\n    toward the front door where other police await. Her daughter\n    starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her..brandishing\n    the Spanish/English book and asking her to say something.\n\n6   INT. / EXT. KITCHEN - ON GIRL.                                6\n\n    Standing proudly, smoothing her skirt.\n\n    CLOSE UP GIRL.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    As she clears her throat and says directly into camera.\n\n                           GIRL\n\n                 Hi.\n    The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even\n    though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the\n    back of a police car.(Note: Mexican police DO NOT duck the\n    perpetrator's head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEAT..they\n    just allow the concussion.) It seems the mother will save her\n    child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the\n    police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her\n    father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear\n    starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly. We are\n    about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of\n    will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power\n    pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in\n    Spanish.\n\n                           MOTHER\n\n                 Una l\u00e1grima...sola una sola...Haz\n                 la mejor possible.\n\n                           NARRATOR\n\n                 \"One tear..only one...so make it a\n                 good one.\" This was my mother's\n                 instruction to me.\n\n    ON CHILD.\n\n    Baffled by the edict..\n\n    ON MOTHER.\n\n    Holding up one finger. That's it..one tear..she means it.\n\n    ON CHILD..\n\n    As she complies..one great tear forming and falling..Her\n    mother's thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well with more\n    tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and\n    resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little\n    head...the eyes clear.\n\n7   INT.

She loved and\n                lived to talk. Now, as if by a\n                witch's spell, words were no longer\n                her bridge but her barrier. In a\n                very real sense she feared she had\n                left herself behind.\n\n     ON THE TWO FEMALES.\n\n     The mother sees something. Joy returns.\n\n     HER POV.\n\n     A street full of stores with SIGNS IN SPANISH..She begins\n     walking the street asking passers-by for directions in\n     Spanish and is answered..her step lightens..she beams with\n     relief. So far so very, very good.\n\n20   EXT. APT. COMPLEX - DAY - FIVE MONTHS LATER..                20\n\n     An iron gate in front..small courtyard ringed by a second\n     floor horseshoe of apartments.\n\n                          NARRATOR\n\n                We moved into a place managed by my\n                mother's aunt. My mother worked two\n                jobs in two local stores paying a\n                total of 450 dollars a week...\n\n21   INT.

APT. - KITCHEN - CLOSER SHOT..                          22\n\n     Cristina taking a newspaper from her book bag and seriously\n     pondering - then circling grocery coupons.\n\n     ANGLE ON KITCHEN AREA.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                               9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Cristina taking a snack from the refrigerator..smiling at the\n     note her mother left...lighting a burner and melting cheese\n     on a tortilla.\n\n                         NARRATOR (CONT'D)\n\n               But we were fine. We had it down.\n               If only I could have stayed six.\n     The CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY from the child to:\n\n23   EXT. APT. COMPLEX - ELEVATED SHOT - SIX YEARS LATER.       23\n\n     The courtyard is lit with colored lights and candles..a\n     wedding reception is in progress -\n\n     EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE BRIDE.\n\n     Gorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep,\n     explosive smile.\n     BACK TO SCENE... music plays and we focus on Cristina, now\n     nearing 12 years of age..dancing with her mother and some\n     other smaller children.. The mother eyes the muscular back of\n     a Great Looking Man...who turns, and quickly oozes quality\n     sex appeal. She is turned on..They talk in Spanish...him\n     saying something hushed like, \"I have been afraid to talk to\n     you. I need oxygen when I look at you.\" She indicates the six\n     children she is dancing with and offers to include him in\n     some ring around the rosey dance...He indicates the magic of\n     just the two of them...She quickly leads her little flock\n     away..\n\n     OTHER ANGLE..\n\n     A reed-thin FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY is staring at them...at\n     first the mother thinks this is adorable...the child eyeing\n     her as if he were a man..she indicates he should join the\n     rest of the children for a dance..\n\n     MOVING WITH THE BOY..\n\n     As he steps forward and it becomes clear it is Cristina he is\n     interested in... Before the mom can do anything about it, he\n     asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts.\n\n     ON CRISTINA..\n\n     Satellite virginities falling with alarming speed..the first\n     time held by a male, the first time held close, the first\n     sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male\n     eyes which utterly confuses Cristina. He begins to grind his\n     hips into his dancing partner.\n\n     ON HER MOTHER.\n\n     Not confused. It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about\n     to be run down by a car..only this time the thing to do is\n     scare the car.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     She runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming\n     his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts\n     him and throws him to the sidelines. Then pats him on the\n     head maternally and goes back to Cristina.\n\n     CRISTINA.\n\n     Somewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene.\n\n                           NARRATOR\n\n                 That quickly it was clear she could\n                 no longer work two jobs and leave\n                 me to my own at night. The\n                 following morning she did something\n                 about it. A boy I never saw again\n                 had changed our lives.\n\n24   INT. BUS - DAY                                               24\n\n     The mother and her aunt, MONICA, take their seats..the bus is\n     filled with domestics..the mother, nervous, looks over to see\n     and greet...

Grand\n     trees from either side meet each other high over the road.\n\n     ON OUR GAL..AS THEY WALK\n\n     She sees the stuff...the dream that makes you migrate. She is\n     not awed..she is jazzed. To her aunt she does the Latin\n     version of OH.....MY...GOD!!!!!!!!...At regular intervals in\n     the background, one black SUV after another has a mother\n     taking kids home from school.\n\n27   EXT.

She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN, 60, who is\ndrinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year\nold overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her\ngrandmother idly holding her hand..In the immediate area more\nrolls of sod wait to be laid.\n\nTHE TWO LATINAS.\n\nAs they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next.\nThen Deborah gestures that they should join her at the\npool..as they start out..\n\nTHEIR EXIT.\n\nBoink..three stooges retro..those French doors were not open\nafter all.

As the group arrives at the outdoor table.\n     Evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking\n     hands, nodding, indicating a seat...each simple act a test\n     which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then\n     some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under\n     her belt.

They are rolling out the\n     last huge cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully\n     manicured backyard. It is hard manual labor involving\n     physical strength. The female caterers are complaining that\n     it's too heavy but Deborah is undeterred.\n\n                         DEBORAH\n\n                   (to catering women)\n               We can do it. Come on.\n     She falls over the roll..getting filthy..but it gives and\n     they gain momentum...one of the catering women falling down,\n     one losing pace.. Deborah,however, gains the upper hand. Yet,\n     even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself.\n\n                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)\n\n                   (great exertion)\n               Why... do... I... care.. so..\n               much.. about.... CRAP?\n     And now she wins.. the cylinder of grass rolls all the way\n     out and she jumps on the seam in victory. She is dirty,\n     spent and triumphant..the components for a solid sexual\n     experience..and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half-\n     heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off.\n     She looks with mother's pride at the lawn. Then sees John.\n\n                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)\n\n               Can you believe they left without\n               finishing?\n     As she looks at her handiwork - John looks at her..A\n     grin..half laugh.. He loves the dame.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    DEBORAH (BREATHLESS) (CONT'D)\n\n          Looks great, huh?....

It covers up all your\n          dirt and makes things immediately\n          pretty..then, the miracle, if you\n          just give it time, it roots and you\n          can't tell it from the real thing.\n              (a look to her husband)\n          No reaction.

Good too.\nShe notices the French Toast.\n\n                          BERNICE\n\n             Try some.\nShe demurs. Bernice holds out one slice on a spatula,\nindicating Flor should just tear a piece off which she\ndoes...One taste and she marvels -- her mouth dropping open\nat this kid's ability to make something mundane\nspecial..Bernice laughs.\n\n                          BERNICE (CONT'D)\n\n             Thanks.\nHer mother enters on her way upstairs. She is thoughtful,\ntense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her\ncurrent demon. She greets Flor and then shakes her head,\nmaking a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to\nFlor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker.\n\n                          DEBORAH\n\n             Tough day.\nBernice prepares a plate for her mom while, in the b.g., a\nGOLDEN RETRIEVER named CHUM approaches Flor from behind with\na ball in its mouth. Flor is checking out the kitchen...\nwhat's in each drawer, etc .....Deborah is impressed by the\nself-starter display and indicates same to Bernice.\n\n                       BERNICE\n\n             I had an idea for a breakthrough in\n             French toast so I made breakfast. I\n             don't want to be teased about it..\n             No sarcasm. No tough love. Just try\n             it and if by any chance you have a\n             positive reaction...\n\n                       DEBORAH\n\n             Right..mean ol' me.

When\n             has that happened? I got up early\n             to do this. At least taste it, for\n             God's sakes!\nShe does..\n\n                       DEBORAH\n\n             Oh, it's good...oh God, it's rich --\n             Oh God, it's good.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         DEBORAH\n\n                   (sudden alarm)\n               By the way, you could do without\n               this.\n     The approval rug pulled out from under her, Bernice looks at\n     her mother. But Deborah is unaware of having hurt her\n     daughter because her attention has been diverted so that\n     Deborah AND THE CAMERA LOSE FOCUS ON BERNICE as the teenager,\n     distraught, moves from the room.\n\n                         DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D)\n\n               NO..NO! FLOR!....Never do fetch.\n     Chum is nudging Flor with the ball and Flor was about to\n     accommodate him by taking it before Deborah's warning shout\n     stopped her in mid-sentence.\n\n                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)\n\n               I mean it, NEVER!\n     ON Flor's stunned reaction to the outburst.\n\n                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)\n\n               I'm not mad.

We are fine.

There\n     is a fireplace in the bathroom. The only significance of\n     this being that these people have a fireplace in their\n     bathroom. The woman who made it all happen is putting in a\n     contact lens..She is upset. We see that she has one blue eye\n     and one brown.\n\n                         JOHN\n\n               This isn't an argument, honey.\n\n                         DEBORAH\n\n               Yes.

We're having a\n               fight. Yo, I feel anger.\n     Deborah turns from the sink revealing one brown eye and one\n     blue. She blinks, realizes one lens is not in and turns back\n     to the sink.\n\n                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)\n\n               Can I have a moment?\n     John exits into the..\n\n43   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                  43\n\n     As John awaits his wife...a beat and she enters with two blue\n     eyes. Even though she is attempting reason and self-control\n     her voice is filled with tension and goes from loud to\n     borderline yelling.\n\n                         DEBORAH\n\n               Okay..Let's get someplace here.\n\n44   INT.

She eyes him suspiciously.\n\n                    JOHN\n\n          Just for a second.\nShe walks to him...he puts an arm around her shoulder. And\ngestures back to where they were standing.

A small voice from the\n     back seat..Georgie..\n\n                         GEORGIE\n\n               I just didn't want to sing last\n               night.\n\n                          DEBORAH'S VOICE\n\n                   (hurt)\n               Yeah.

Flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a\n     divider between parent and child.

If you figured out\n               how to make coffee on that thing\n               it's all downhill.\n     The MALE SPANISH VOICE talks about imminent left turns.

But\n     then John takes rein of his emotions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                        39.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    JOHN (CONT'D)\n\n          But you know, you gotta watch out\n          for the times you think you're\n          absolutely right..But, man, Bernice\n          has finals tomorrow. She didn't\n          need this one..And just that look\n          on her face when she got the gifts--\n              (now his voice cracks; he\n               grows wet-eyed)\n          --like for a second she thought all\n          her problems with her mother had\n          been solved...\nFlor is flabbergasted..she peeks to see if he is actually\ncrying. At first her heart is touched by John but then there\nis distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the\nmacho meter can read that low. He looks at her and she faces\nfront quickly.\n\n                    NARRATOR\n\n          My mother did not understand her\n          male boss. His heart was good and\n          he was rare in not flirting with\n          her. But they were starkly\n          different. Privacy and dignity were\n          the same word to my mother.\n          Naturally, when she found herself\n          sitting next to a man who cried\n          over his child's hurt she had no\n          idea how to process the event.\nMeanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the\ncanyon. Flor takes the opportunity to bolt.\n\n                     FLOR\n\n          Gracias.\nShe opens the door and starts to get out though the car is\nstill rolling a bit...\n\n                    JOHN\n\n          What are you doing? Let me take you\n          all the way.\nReluctantly she re-enters the car..It rolls another ten feet\nto her bus stop and she gets out again.\n\n                    JOHN (CONT'D)\n\n          How weird was this ride? Sorry.\n\n                    FLOR\n\n          No es nada.\nHe doesn't quite know what that means...indicates same in a\nlittle helpless gesture..\n\n\n\n\n                                                               40.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54   EXT. BUS STOP - EARLY EVENING..                             54\n\n     As Flor is dropped off...the goodbye awkward.\n\n                         NARRATOR\n\n               The job was taxing her. She had no\n               template for confusion let alone\n               frustration.\n     While waiting for the bus, Flor suddenly turns and runs a few\n     yards...and then back..and waves off the looks from her\n     colleagues - many of whom are overweight..many of them\n     adorable. All puzzled for the moment as they watch Flor\n     unsuccessfully try to shake off her day.\n\n55   INT. FLOR'S APT. - EVENING                                  55\n\n     As Flor enters -- kisses her daughter..distraught and\n     distracted. She walks immediately to the refrigerator and\n     takes out a chocolate cake and a bottle of milk...she cuts a\n     huge slice of cake and puts it in front of her startled\n     daughter..in Spanish riding her on being too thin..the\n     daughter gestures at her mother's own slim figure.\n\n                         NARRATOR\n\n               It was so unusual for my mother to\n               ask my help that I realized\n               immediately she was losing her\n               battle to be uninvolved with the\n               Claskys.\n     Flor asks her daughter how to say something in English.\n\n                            CRISTINA\n\n               Try it on.\n     Flor asks again in Spanish...trying to find a precise\n     phrase.. The nuance important to her.\n\n                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)\n\n               Please try it on?\n     Flor knows the word \"please\"..it's not what she wants...what\n     she wants is a way to say, \"try it on\" in a manner which is\n     not a request..or order, but is, rather, friendly and caring.\n     Her daughter works on the problem.\n\n                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)\n\n               Just try it on?\n\n                         FLOR\n\n                   (thickly accented)\n               Just try it on.\n\n                         CRISTINA\n\n                   (small accent)\n               Just try it on.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             41.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         FLOR\n\n                   (improvement each time)\n               Just try it on...just try it on..\n     She's got it.\n\n                         NARRATOR\n\n               Our culture embraces fullness in a\n               woman. You, the women of the\n               admissions committee, as\n               intelligent as you are, have no\n               idea how casual and complete such\n               acceptance is back home, in the\n               land of the size 16 bikini.\n\n56   EXT. BUS STOP - NORTH VALLEY - PRE-DAWN                   56\n\n     Flor is the only one waiting. An empty bus stops and she gets\n     on.\n\n57   EXT. STREET - NEAR BUS STOP - HIGH SHOT - FIRST LIGHT     57\n\n     As we see Deborah cross Sunset Blvd., overtake and pass two\n     UCLA men running at a good clip as Flor's bus stops.\n\n     CLOSE ON FLOR..\n\n     As she strides purposefully up the street.\n\n                         NARRATOR\n\n               This is one of the cultural\n               differences between us which I wish\n               to explore academically at\n               Princeton. American women, I\n               believe, actually feel the same as\n               Hispanic women about weight.\n\n58   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - EXTREME EARLY MORNING                 58\n\n     The house asleep. Flor walks carefully up the steps.\n\n                         NARRATOR\n\n               ....a desire for the comfort of\n               fullness.\n\n59   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - FIRST LIGHT                          59\n\n     Bernie asleep on the bed...Kleenex abounds...the solid sleep\n     earned by a few hours of sobbing. She looks touchingly pretty\n     and decidedly round. Flor looks for, finds and carries out\n     the new clothes Deborah had given her daughter.\n\n                          NARRATOR\n\n               And, when that desire is suppressed\n               for style and deprivation allowed\n               to rule...\n\n\n\n\n                                                               42.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60   EXT.

Something bad happen?\n\n      ON CRISTINA..\n\n      Enormously anxious on reading her mother's mood.\n\n                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)\n\n                Cristina, tell your mother I just\n                played around with your hair..she\n                can put it back..no hurt feelings.\n\n                          CRISTINA\n\n                Not right now.\n      Flor puts an arm around her shoulder, leading her off and\n      speaking to her forcefully in Spanish.\n\n                           DEBORAH\n\n                What? --\n\n                          EVELYN\n\n                You can't just take someone\n                else's.....\n\n                          DEBORAH\n\n                Nuh-uh, Mom..don't go there..or\n                I'll go there and you know where\n                \"there\" is.\n      Evelyn stops on a dime. She leaves. Deborah crosses to\n      Bernice, who is highly concerned about Flor, and puts an arm\n      around her. A pleasant surprise..\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 68.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)\n\n                  Can you believe what Flor is making\n                  this into..Shoot me if I ever get\n                  that hard to deal with.\n      Bernice, unseen by Mom, does a long, muted, mock scream.\n\n103   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - EVENING                                  103\n\n      MUSIC IN: Action, purpose, energy.. Flor is dictating in\n      Spanish as Cristina writes it down in English on a pad.\n      Cristina enormously uncomfortable.\n\n      INSERT - THE PAD.\n\n      The pad, in effect, lends subtitles to Flor's words. Cristina\n      winces with the words she records even while punctuating\n      perfectly.\n\n                            PAD WRITING\n\n                  You cannot take my child without my\n                  permission..And, if you had asked\n                  me I would not have given\n                  permission. Is this why you did not\n                  ask? Because you knew this. You\n                  have no rights over my private\n                  life.\n\n      ON FLOR..\n\n      Reaching a decisive conclusion.\n\n                            PAD\n\n                  If you have any disagreement with\n                  this, I no longer wish to work\n                  here.\n\n      ON CRISTINA'S LOOK\n\n      This is awful news.\n\n      ON FLOR.\n\n      For a decisive nod of affirmation. She adjusts her daughter's\n      hair to the way it was, takes the note and exits.\n\n104   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY          104\n\n      Flor enters in something of a fury and holds the letter out\n      to Deborah, who hates being cornered in this manner. She\n      actually places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note.\n\n                            DEBORAH\n\n                  What's this?\n      Flor shakes the letter at her.\n\n      OTHER ANGLE..\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                69.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Showing Cristina hidden but looking on... like a stage\n      prompter in the wings.\n\n                           FLOR\n\n                For you.\n\n                           DEBORAH\n\n                From?\n      Flor with enormous emphasis stabs her finger at her own\n      chest.\n\n                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)\n\n                You are not yourself...This was\n                written in anger. You sleep on it\n                and then if you still want me to\n                have it -- fine..I don't think you\n                will once calm and rational thought\n                returns. Just sleep on it.\n      Deborah exits to a bathroom and closes the door...leaving\n      Flor in the hall with the letter..Cristina reveals herself\n      and explains the situation to her mother. The last word we\n      hear before scene's end is \"ma\u00f1ana.\"\n\n105   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING         105\n\n      Deborah surreptitiously finishing putting on her running\n      clothes and is making for the door when the alarm clock goes\n      off and John awakens.\n\n                          JOHN\n\n                She didn't even want us to know she\n                had a daughter - then, on the first\n                day, you take the kid without\n                asking. I think that's...\n\n                          DEBORAH\n\n                    (starting to lose it)\n                What!?! Insensitive? Elitist?\n                Irresponsible? Perverse? Dizzy?\n\n                          JOHN\n\n                    (slow and emphatic)\n                Dumb.\n      She looks at him...He has been atypical...Her immediate\n      emotional cocktail is panic, fury and deep, deep hurt. Her\n      words are slow...her voice ragged...\n\n                          DEBORAH\n\n                When is anyone in this damn house\n                or this damn life going to consider\n                my feelings? I just tried to make\n                a lovely kid feel welcome. There's\n                no reason to rake it over...I let\n                it go..and gave Flor the room to\n                let it go. Which I'm sure she has!\n                It's over!! So get on board.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              70.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      She opens the door and almost runs into Flor who is standing\n      immediately in her way holding the letter.\n\n                           FLOR\n\n                I slept.\n\n106   INT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - DEN - DAY                     106\n\n      Deborah stands over Cristina, who is writing in Spanish a\n      note Deborah is dictating. As John passes through the room.\n\n                          DEBORAH\n\n                I am deeply and sincerely sorry to\n                have upset you. Especially in\n                light of the deep connection, as\n                women, I believe us to have.\n\n                          EVELYN\n\n                    (sotto to John)\n                And to think I was worried about\n                Flor living here with her kid?\n\n107   EXT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - PATIO                         107\n\n      John is talking to all three kids in an effort to lift the\n      overall atmosphere. IN THE BACKGROUND we see Deborah handing\n      Flor her letter..Cristina taking sidelong glances...relieved\n      to see them shake hands (Flor engaging), hug (Flor\n      reluctant).\n\n                          JOHN\n\n                So here's the idea..I want to make\n                a serving platter for serving fish\n                using sea glass like this..\n      He holds out some sea glass.\n\n                          JOHN (CONT'D)\n\n                I used to hunt for this stuff every\n                free minute when I apprenticed in\n                Italy. This is bits of broken glass\n                that the ocean sand blasts over the\n                years..great looking, huh? So you\n                guys go hunting and I'll pay 50\n                cents for any piece, a dollar for\n                anything as big as this and five\n                dollars for any color that isn't\n                brown, clear or green.\n\n                          GEORGIE\n\n                Do we have to do this?\n\n                          BERNICE\n\n                    (to Georgie)\n                Oh, come on...\n      Georgie and Bernice start off..\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 71.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          JOHN\n\n                Come on, Cristina - go get em.\n      Her eyes widen and off she runs, intoxicated with being\n      included and having the chance to make money.\n\n108   EXT.

At one point, she comes upon a teenage couple making\n      out near a mass of pebbles, and politely asks them to roll\n      over so she can search the area.\n\n110   INT.

Great, Cristina..Why\n          don't you count it and..\n\n                    CRISTINA\n\n          I have... Many times..I didn't\n          sleep.

I mean, before the ocean\n          blasts it for 30-40 years. Somebody\n          had to throw away an old Milk of\n          Magnesia bottle. You know what Milk\n          of Magnesia is?\n\n                    CRISTINA\n\n          Unfortunately.\nHe smiles broadly. The kid's a trip.

FLOR'S ROOM - ONE A.M.                                114\n\n      Flor asleep -- Cristina awake, alert..footsteps. She hears\n      John enter. She moves slowly so as not to awaken Flor.\n\n115   INT. HALLWAY - ONE A.M.                                    115\n\n      As she enters from the back room and sees that John is\n      walking into the kitchen. Her eye goes to the hall table on\n      which there sits a fat envelope with her name on it.\n\n116   INT. CLASKY BEDROOM - ONE A.M.                             116\n\n      John enters the bedroom to find a note from Deb that she will\n      be late. He is disappointed.\n\n117   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT - ON CRISTINA                     117\n\n      Not aware of being observed..opens the envelope and takes out\n      a thick wad of cash..almost swoons..as she goes about hiding\n      it..she is jolted by her mother's whispered incredulity...\n\n                             FLOR\n\n                Cristina..\n      She turns...the wad of money in her hand..\n\n118   INT. POCKET KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT                           118\n\n      The best chef in America has just fixed himself a snack as a\n      salve to his spirits. It's a little like Dagwood Bumstead as\n      a culinary genius..This is a snack we will remember and\n      copy...John is approaching a perfect moment...and this is a\n      guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest...\n\n119   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM                            119\n\n      He carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just\n      about to take his first bite when he hears emotional Spanish\n      voices approaching.

I couldn't believe how\n                beautiful the grounds were as we\n                drove in. I just think the balance\n                of the buildings to open ground is\n                so wonderful and must have been\n                very difficult to achieve.\n      Deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression\n      Cristina is making..all are grinning...the two adults\n      suspiciously so...sharing their delight.\n\n                          ARLENE\n\n                Would you like a little tour?\n\n      MOVING CAMERA..\n\n      First showing Cristina in foreground and her POV of this Drop\n      Dead Gorgeous Rich Kids School in the background and then we\n      MOVE CLOSER ON CRISTINA.

Even if I\n                had enough sense of wonder to\n                imagine such a school existed; my\n                sense of fairness made it\n                unthinkable that any school could\n                offer this much more than my own..\n\n131   INT.

If you do not act\n                quickly you will soon cement an\n                awful fate for yourself.

Incrementally it will grow louder and be\n      recognizable as Deborah calling Flor from the master bedroom\n      window..Bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as\n      Flor ignores it...Bernice goes to embrace Cristina.\n\n                          BERNICE\n\n                My last chance to have some of you\n                rub off on me..\n                    (Cristina doesn't\n                     understand)\n                I'm sorry you're so sad but this\n                could have been so much worse.\n\n                             CRISTINA\n\n                       (from her depths)\n                How?\n      And now Deborah calling \"Flor\" is getting hard to ignore but\n      Flor manages..\n\n                          EVELYN\n\n                    (to Cristina)\n                Why don't you run upstairs and say\n                goodbye to Deborah?\n      Flor flashes a look of thanks.\n\n                          FLOR\n\n                I'll be in front.\n      Upset, Cristina runs off. She kisses Bernice..and walks\n      toward the house. As she passes under the bedroom..\n\n                          DEBORAH\n\n                Please come see me.\n      And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck. Flor glances\n      up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly\n      hears the beginning of their exchange\n\n                          DEBORAH'S VOICE\n\n                It's okay, honey..we'll see each\n                other at school..I'm going to keep\n                an eye on you..I will.\n      Flor enters the house...\n\n181   INT.

Finally, as\n      she passes the stairwell, she sees Cristina on an upper\n      landing and says, in Spanish, that Cristina should get her\n      things and meet her out front. Cristina, agitated, moves off\n      to comply...then Deborah appears in the same spot.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             125.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          DEBORAH\n\n                Please stick your head in here for\n                a minute.\n      Flor nods and starts up the stairs...\n\n182   INT.
