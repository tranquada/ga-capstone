ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY\r\n\r\n          SUPER: April 27, 1973\r\n          All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny\r\n          Friday afternoon. Cars idle in the driveway awaiting\r\n          the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children.\r\n          Two faded yellow buses stand ready.\r\n\r\n          The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL.\r\n          A swarm of children pours out the door and down the\r\n          broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward\r\n          the cars and the buses.\r\n\r\n          Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND,\r\n          nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway..\r\n          Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub-\r\n          dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the\r\n          stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a\r\n          girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old,\r\n          two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in\r\n          school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM\r\n          HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister.\r\n\r\n                         ALEX\r\n          C'mon, Robin.\r\n\r\n                         ROBIN\r\n\r\n                         (STUTTERING BADLY)\r\n          W-w-where's D-d-daddy?\r\n\r\n                         ALEX\r\n          He's got a meeting at the high\r\n          school.

Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim.\r\n          Nick says something to Kurt. She shakes her head and\r\n          pains toward Robin. Robin quickly turns away as they\r\n          look at her.. When she glances back, Ki_m is walking\r\n          towards her and Nick is bicycling away.\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n          Okay, let's go.\r\n          The sisters start to walk across the lawn.\r\n\r\n                         ROBIN\r\n          Y-you 1-1-like him?\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n          Who?\r\n\r\n                         ROBIN\r\n\r\n                         (SMILES SHYLY)\r\n          Y-you know.\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n          Nick? Oh, he's all right, I guess.\r\n          They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at\r\n          her big sister.\r\n\r\n                         ROBIN\r\n\r\n                         (FINALLY)\r\n          Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him?\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n          Robin?\r\n          Robin smiles and takes Kim's hand. They walk along the\r\n          road, kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags. Sud-\r\n          denly Kim halts.\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUING)\r\n          Oh, damn!\r\n          Robin looks up in surprise.\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUING)\r\n          Debbie was gonna lend me her new\r\n          record.

(2)\r\n          Robin watches her go, then moves off alone, breaking\r\n          into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch.\r\n          As she turns off the main road into a side street,\r\n          Robin passes a construction site. The empty skeleton\r\n          of a half-finished apartment building looms up above\r\n          the dark shade trees. Hearing VOICES, Robin stops to\r\n          investigate.\r\n\r\n                         ROBIN\r\n\r\n                         (CALLS OUT)\r\n          Alex?\r\n          The VOICES continue. Robin moves closer, peering\r\n          through the tall bushes surrounding the lot. She\r\n          sees Nick playing in.the framework with three of his\r\n          classmates. Robin recognizes JUDE CUNNINGHAM, and\r\n          KELLY LYNCH as Kim's two best friends. The fourth\r\n          child, WENDY RICHARDS, is a dark-haired girl, domin-\r\n          eering and loud. As Robin watches, Wendy jumps\r\n          up onto the floor of the building.\r\n\r\n                         WENDY\r\n          I want to play 'Murder.' Who's\r\n          the killer?\r\n\r\n                         NICK\r\n          You, Wendy!\r\n\r\n                         JUDE\r\n\r\n                         (GIGGLING)\r\n          you, Nick.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          Yes, Nick!\r\n\r\n                         WENDY\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHING)\r\n          You'll never catch me. Hide your\r\n          eyes, killer!\r\n          As Nick turns his back, hiding his eyes against an ex-\r\n          posed beam, the children scatter through the structure.\r\n          Robin watches with mounting excitement as Nick finishes\r\n          counting, and whirls around.\r\n\r\n                         NICK\r\n          The killer is coming for you!\r\n          He moves into the building, chanting \"Kill, kill.,\" in a\r\n          low monotone. As he disappears from view, Robin cau-\r\n          tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the\r\n          building.\r\n\r\n          NICK (O.S.\r\n          The killer strikes!\r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n\r\n                         1 CONTINUED; (3) I\r\n          Robin hears Jude's SQUEAL of LAUGHTER. Nick has caught\r\n          her. Immediately Jude's VOICE TAKES UP the \"kill\"\r\n          chant in unison with Nick.\r\n\r\n          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY 2\r\n\r\n          Robin climbs up onto the floor and peers into the dark,\r\n          gloomy structure. Suddenly, she hears a SHRIEK. Ter-\r\n          rified, she backs against a wall. LAUGHTER FOLLOWS im-\r\n          mediately and Robin hears Kelly's VOICE TAKING UP the\r\n          chant. As the three \"killers\" move through the vast\r\n          structure searching for Wendy, \"KILL, KILT\" ECHOES off\r\n          the walls and hardwood floors.\r\n          Robin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im-\r\n          mense unfinished lobby. Ominous shadows slash across\r\n          the floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless\r\n          CHANTING of the children.\r\n          Robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door. It slips off\r\n          its temporary hinges, crashing down to the floor. The\r\n          NOISE is like a rifle shot; suddenly, there is ABSOLUTE\r\n          SILENCE in the structure.\r\n          Petrified, Robin crouches behind a wall, waiting. The\r\n          CHANTING quickly RESUMES and she breathes a long sigh\r\n          of relief.\r\n          Robin moves through a dark corridor, hugging the walls.\r\n          Flushed with excitement, she imagines herself a \"killer\"\r\n          searching for Wendy. As she moves past an empty room,\r\n          she hears a SOFT GIGGLE. Robin stops and listens care-\r\n          fully. Once again she hears the GIGGLE, LOUDER this\r\n          time, coming from nearby.\r\n          Stepping to a doorway, she leans around the corner and\r\n          peers inside. In the darkness she can see nothing.\r\n          Gathering her courage, she quietly slips into the room.\r\n          The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly\r\n          ajar. As Robin approaches, she hears a FAINT GASP from\r\n          behind her. Whirling around, she sees Wendy crouched\r\n          behind a cardboard box in the corner.\r\n\r\n                         WENDY\r\n\r\n                         (HISSING)\r\n          You better not tell!\r\n          Before Robin can react, she hears a THUD from above.\r\n          Looking up, she sees Nick's head appear through an\r\n          opening in the ceiling. Seeing Robin, then Wendy\r\n          standing in the corner, he howls in triumph.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         NICK\r\n\r\n                         (CALLING OUT)\r\n          Here, killers, here!\r\n          Nick's head disappears from the opening and Robin hears\r\n          the POUNDING of RUNNING FEET.\r\n\r\n                         WENDY\r\n\r\n                         (MALICIOUSLY)\r\n          Now you've done it, you idiot!\r\n          The CHANTING GROWS LOUDER as the \"killers\" rush towards\r\n          the room. Trapped, Wendy looks frantically for an es-\r\n          cape but finds nothing. Turning around suddenly, she\r\n          grins at Robin, a cruel, hard expression on her face.\r\n\r\n                         WENDY\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUING; SLOWLY)\r\n          Kill, kill, kill...\r\n          Picking up the chant, Wendy begins to advance on Robin.\r\n          Terrified, Robin turns and rushes out of the room,\r\n          bowling over Nick in the doorway. Delighted that the\r\n          game is continuing with a new victim, he follows Wendy\r\n          in pursuit of Robin.\r\n          Robin flees down the long, dark corridor, \"KILL, KILL\r\n          ECHOING in her wake. As she rounds a corner, Jude ap-\r\n          pears, looming up in front of her. Robin screams and\r\n          sprints in the opposite direction. Kelly leaps out of\r\n          a doorway and grabs for her, but Robin, swinging out\r\n          blindly, escapes the \"killer.\"\r\n\r\n          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY 3\r\n\r\n          Darting into the large room, Robin collapses against a\r\n          wall, gasping for breath. As her eyes adjusts to the\r\n          darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through\r\n          a hole in the floor to the basement below. Stacked up-\r\n          right near the opening are several sheets of window\r\n          glass. Before Robin can make a move towards the lad-\r\n          der, she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in\r\n          the doorway, a vicious look on her face.\r\n\r\n                         WENDY\r\n          Killers, here!\r\n          Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away.\r\n\r\n                         ROBIN\r\n          N-n-n-no!\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          6.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          Nick, Jude and Kelly appear in the doorway, chanting\r\n          \"Kill, kill.\" Moving quickly, Robin grabs the ladder\r\n          and starts down into the basement, careful not to knock\r\n          over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening.\r\n          Peering into the pitch-black basement, Robin hesitates.\r\n          But as Wendy and her fellow \"killers\" close in on her,\r\n          Robin continues down the ladder. Wendy rushes up and\r\n          grabs the ladder.\r\n\r\n                         ROBIN\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUING)\r\n          P-p-please!\r\n          Wendy grins and shakes the ladder. The chanting is\r\n          deafening. Robin hugs the wooden slats. Wendy shakes\r\n          even harder. Robin screams. Nick moves around Wendy\r\n          to get a better look. He accidentally bumps the glass\r\n          stacked next to the opening. The sudden movement is\r\n          just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and\r\n          send it hurtling down directly at Robin.\r\n          The girl's last scream catches in her throat as the\r\n          glass slices through her neck. She is instantly\r\n          decapitated.\r\n          Horrified, Wendy watches the glass and the body crash\r\n          to the concrete basement floor. Kelly screams. Jude\r\n          sobs loudly. Nick can only stare in shock. Finally,\r\n          he manages to speak.\r\n\r\n                         NICK\r\n\r\n                         (WHISPERING HOARSELY)\r\n          We gotta get somebody quick!\r\n          Nick starts to go.

On the mantel is a small shrine to the\r\n          memory oftheir dead daughter; a framed photograph,\r\n          fresh roses, two candles and a lock of her hair in a\r\n          glass case.\r\n\r\n                         HAMMOND\r\n          Trust me.\r\n          Vivian does not move.

Though she offers\r\n          no resistance, it appears he is pulling her along.\r\n          They hurry into an elevator after an elderly CLEANING\r\n          WOMAN carrying a mop and a bucket.\r\n\r\n          15 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 15\r\n\r\n          They stand in silence. The Cleaning Woman puffs on a\r\n          cigarette, blithely ignoring the NO SMOKING sign posted\r\n          on the wall. Vivian nervously reaches into her purse\r\n          and removes a bottle of Valium. Quickly popping two\r\n          pills into her mouth, she swallows with difficulty and\r\n          snaps her purse shut. Hammond says nothing.\r\n          Just as the elevator doors slide open, the Cleaning Wo-\r\n          man touches Vivian on the shoulder, causing her to jump\r\n          in fright.\r\n\r\n                         CLEANING WOMAN\r\n          Could I have one of those?

It's locked.\r\n          He turns back. As he does so there's a sudden WHIRRING\r\n          SOUND. A row of spotlights flashes on right in front\r\n          of him, almost blinding him.

Another bank of lights flares at\r\n          him. He staggers downstage. The curtains begin to\r\n          swing open. Startled, he jumps away from them. His\r\n          foot lands on a package of photo-flood bulbs.. There's\r\n          a LOUD POP.

CLASSROOM (LAB) - DAY 52\r\n\r\n          First period biology class features MONTY WELLER, a\r\n          tall, thin Englishman in his late thirties. This stuf-\r\n          fy, dour science teacher drones on about the joys of ex-\r\n          ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps,\r\n          daydreams or passes notes.\r\n          Seated in the back near the door, Jude is furtively\r\n          opening a handwritten note. She quickly reads it.\r\n          Stifling a giggle, she looks up to see Kim and Vicki\r\n          across the aisle, eagerly awaiting her reply. Jude\r\n          tears out part of a page from her biology book and\r\n          scrawls her answer. Folding the note, she taps the boy\r\n          next to her and motions for him to pass it on.\r\n          Vicki grabs the note from the boy. Quickly scanning\r\n          it, she nods, impressed. Kim reads it and mouths the\r\n          word \"Wow\" to Jude who blushes happily.\r\n          Glancing out into the hallway, Jude notices Slick walk-\r\n          ing past. Seeing her in class, he stops and waves.\r\n          Jude frantically tries to motion him away. Their backs\r\n          to the door, Kim and Vicki watch with curiosity as Jude\r\n          gestures in their direction. Seeing her friends\r\n          watching her, Jude smiles and tries to ignore Slick.\r\n          Not to be denied, he exaggeratedly mimes Weller, nose\r\n          to his textbook, lecturing on, oblivious to his class.\r\n          Jude laughs in spite of herself. Kim and Vicki turn\r\n          around.\r\n          Glancing out the door, the two girls stare in disbelief\r\n          at the small weird curly-haired boy doing a perfect im-\r\n          itation of the eminently boring Weller.

TENNIS COURTS DAY\r\n\r\n          During the afternoon phys. ed. class, the girls play\r\n          tennis: Kim with Kelly and Vicki with Jude. Sykes\r\n          lingers nearby, watching the girls. Their instructor\r\n          is Miss HENRI-ANNE BENTON, a stocky woman in her late\r\n          thirties with teased, lacquered hair. A product of\r\n          genteel Southern womanhood, Henri-Anne stalks the\r\n          courts in her baggy Bermuda shorts, constantly blowing\r\n          a silver whistle hanging from her neck.\r\n          A very stoned, giggling Jude runs Vicki ragged, hitting\r\n          balls over the fence, straight up in the air and occa-\r\n          sionally even back over her head. Each time a ball\r\n          flies over the fence, Vicki runs to retrieve it to the\r\n          delight of Sykes.\r\n          At one point, Vicki bends over to pick up a ball under\r\n          Sykes' appreciative gaze. The shrill WHISTLE inter-\r\n          rupts her as Henri-Anne rushes over.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI-ANNE\r\n\r\n                         (SOUTHERN ACCENT)\r\n          No, no, Miss Cantrell!

Behind her, Wendy's\r\n          ANGRY WORDS are AUDIBLE.\r\n\r\n          WENDY (O.S.)\r\n          If you ever try anything like that\r\n          again, you cow!\r\n          Melanie thinks it's hilarious.\r\n\r\n                         MELANIE\r\n          (to Kim and Kelly)\r\n          You should've seen her jump...\r\n          Nadia Comenici never did better...\r\n          Wendy storms in. She's got the photo in her hand. She\r\n          waves it at Kim and Kelly.\r\n\r\n                         WENDY\r\n          What's this supposed to mean?\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          vv.\r\n\r\n                         71 CONTINUED - 71\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n\r\n                         (SARCASTIC)\r\n          I know it's not much of a picture,\r\n          Wendy, but you didn't have to go\r\n          that far...\r\n          Wendy is furious.\r\n\r\n                         WENDY\r\n          I didn't!\r\n          She turns, glares at Melanie.\r\n\r\n                         MELANIE\r\n          Don't look at me...\r\n\r\n                         WENDY\r\n          You're all... children...\r\n          She storms out. Melanie looks at Kim and Kelly,\r\n          shrugs, follows Wendy. A DOOR SLAMS in the locker\r\n          room.\r\n          Kim and Kelly look at each other, laugh, turn their\r\n          faces back to the steaming water. Neither one hears\r\n          the SOUND across the room, a HARSH RHYTHMIC HEAVY\r\n\r\n          BREATHING.\r\n          Kelly bends her head away from the water, clears her\r\n          eyes., She squints out through the steam at the big\r\n          wall mirror across the room. She sees something. She\r\n          steps back into Kim, her eyes wide with fear.\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n          Watch it...\r\n          Kelly covers her breasts with her arms, presses against\r\n          the wall, terrified.\r\n          Suddenly there's an EXPLOSION of SOUND. Kim screams,\r\n          jumps back, stares. There's a jagged hole in the cen-\r\n          ter of the mirror, huge cracks radiating from it,\r\n          spidering across its surface.\r\n          For a moment no one moves. Splinters of GLASS TRICKLE\r\n          down to the floor. There's no other sound. Kim grabs\r\n          for her towel, steps out of the shower, looks. There's\r\n          no one. She heads for the locker room door. Kelly\r\n          runs after her.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n\r\n                         KIM 1\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          61.\r\n\r\n          72 INT. LOCKER ROOM 72\r\n\r\n          Kim rushes into the room, Kelly right behind her.\r\n          There's no one. Kelly is quivering. She clutches at\r\n          Kim's arm. Kim looks at her.\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n          What did you see?\r\n          Kelly just shakes her head.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          Just... just... a shadow or.,.\r\n          Kim heads for the exit door across the room. Kelly\r\n          stays with her.\r\n\r\n          73 EXT. SCHOOL 73\r\n\r\n          Kim opens the outside door, peers down the walkway to\r\n          the tennis courts, playing fields. There's no sign of\r\n          anyone. She closes the door.\r\n\r\n          74 INT. LOCKER ROOM 74\r\n\r\n          Kim turns back.to Kelly who's started to cry.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          Someone was there! Someone was...\r\n          in there...\r\n          Kim is taking charge. She moves cautiously back to the\r\n          shower room door, opens it, looks in. She gasps.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUING)\r\n          What? What!s wrong?\r\n          Kelly's on the edge of hysteria. She runs over to Kim.\r\n          They both look.\r\n\r\n          75 KIM'S AND KELLY'S POV 75\r\n          What the girls see is the mirror. Something has\r\n          changed. A long wedge of glass has been lifted out o\r\n          it.\r\n\r\n          76 BACK TO SCENE 76\r\n          Kim shuts the door, presses against it, stares at\r\n          Kelly.\r\n\r\n          77 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 77\r\n\r\n          Kim walks quickly down a long school corridor and turns\r\n          into her father's office.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          UL.\r\n\r\n          78 INT.

Seven years bad luck...\r\n          She tries to smile. Kim just looks at her.\r\n\r\n          79 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 79\r\n\r\n          Kim turns a corner, heading for class, and almost runs\r\n          into Sykes, cleaning the floor. Sykes turns. For a\r\n          moment their eyes lock. Then Kim hurries away, almost\r\n          running. Sykes stares after her.\r\n\r\n          80 INT. HALLWAY (WELLER'S CLASSROOM) - DAY 80\r\n\r\n           Kim comes down the hallway and stops at the door.\r\n           There's a piece of paper with a hastily scrawled mes-\r\n           sage taped there. It heads: \"Detention Postponed\r\n           Until Monday -- EMERGENCY! Weller.\"\r\n\r\n           VICKI (O.S.)\r\n          Did it work?\r\n          Kim is startled, turns.

Kim stands back,\r\n          somehow less impressed.\r\n\r\n          81 INT. GYM - DAY 81\r\n\r\n          Several students are putting last-minute touches on the\r\n          decor as Kim comes in. Huge speakers are being hoisted\r\n          on pulleys to hang from the ceiling. A vast, raised\r\n          platform covers much of the gym floor, its plexiglass\r\n          surface designed to be illuminated from below. Perched\r\n          on a ladder, Weller is hanging shimmering silver strips\r\n          while Henri-Anne Benton supervises from the disco\r\n          floor.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI-ANNE\r\n          Careful, Monty...

Kim smiles as Nick joins her. She takes\r\n          his hand, clutches it. They start to walk away, talk-\r\n          ing quietly. Nick puts his arm around her.\r\n\r\n                         HENRI-ANNE\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUING)\r\n          Nick! Kim!

She carefully pulls out her\r\n          prom dress, a mid-length, off-the-shoulder gown in a\r\n          white, clinging material. Holding it up against her\r\n          body, she inspects the gown in the full-length mirror\r\n          on the closet door.

Outside, the twilight shadows\r\n          deepen.\r\n          THROUGH the VINDOM, a slight movement is SEAN among the\r\n          trees; suddenly, a dark figure becomes VISIBLE, ap-\r\n          proaching.the window. Kim does not notice the figure\r\n          as she finishes undressing. She wraps herself in a\r\n          robe and sits at her dressing table.\r\n          Putting her hair up, she does not see the shadowy\r\n          figure peering inside. When Kim stands up, the figure\r\n          slips away from the window. As she crosses the room,\r\n          the face reappears, hidden by the shadows, watching her\r\n          enter the bathroom.\r\n\r\n          93 INT.

He releases her from his grip, ges-\r\n          tures toward the car.\r\n\r\n                         HANMOND\r\n          Let's get going...\r\n          He walks around to the driver's door. Vivian stares\r\n          after him with hard cold eyes.\r\n\r\n          101 INT. PARKED CAR - POV 101\r\n\r\n          The figure in the parked car watches as Hammond starts\r\n          up the car, waits for Vivian to get in, backs out of\r\n          the driveway, and moves off down the street.\r\n\r\n          102 EXT. PARKED CAR 102\r\n\r\n          The figure climbs out of his car, gazes at the fading\r\n          taillights of the Hammond car. The figure is Nick\r\n          McBride.\r\n\r\n          103 INT.

Standing up, she pir-\r\n          ouettes and curtsies before her brother.\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n          Well?\r\n          Alex gapes, stunned by his sister's appearance.\r\n\r\n                         ALEX\r\n\r\n                         (FINALLY)\r\n          Amazing!\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n\r\n                         (SMILES)\r\n          You like?\r\n\r\n                         ALEX\r\n          You look almost like a woman!\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHS)\r\n          Thanks!\r\n          She picks up her corsage from her dressing table.\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUING)\r\n          You want to help or just leer?\r\n\r\n                         ALEX\r\n          You're my sister...

As he attaches the bright red\r\n          flower on her gown, she playfully dabs perfume on his\r\n          neck. He pulls back, pricking himself on the pin.\r\n\r\n                         ALEX\r\n          Hey!\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n          You shouldn't have pulled away...\r\n          The DOORBELL RINGS.\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUING)\r\n          It's him!\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          80,\r\n\r\n          103 CONTINUED: (2) 103.\r\n\r\n                         ALE \r\n          er's face is revealed. It is the nine-year-old Alex.\r\n          Kim cradles the killer on the ground. She turns his\r\n          head toward the light. We SEE his face full-on.\r\n\r\n                         VIVIA N\r\n          Robin!\r\n          She rushes forward, lunging for the body. Hammond\r\n          grabs her, restraining her.\r\n          Alex's dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family.\r\n          His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny.\r\n          His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs, as Robin's\r\n          had done seven years before. His makeup has been slop-\r\n          pily applied. The rouged cheeks and the smudged red\r\n          lips amplify the grotesque impersonation.\r\n          Kim strokes her brother's hair. Hammond presses his\r\n          hysterical wife to him. The onlookers slowly close in.\r\n          We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alex's face TO a photograph of\r\n          the Hammond family taken seven years earlier. We MOVE\r\n          IN CLOSE ON the twins. Alex and Robin are smiling.\r\n\r\n          FADE OUT.\r\n\r\n                         THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nProm Night\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0William Gray\u00a0\u00a0Bob Guza\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:20.934329"}
