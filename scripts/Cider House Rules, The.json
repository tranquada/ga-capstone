There's snow on the station platform. A \n               train arrives and departs.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         In other parts of the world, young \n                         men of promise leave home to make \n                         their fortunes, battle evil, or solve \n                         the problems of the world.\n\n               Behind the station, at the top of the hill, lies the St. \n               Cloud's orphanage.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         I was myself such a young man, when \n                         I came to save the orphanage in St. \n                         Cloud's... many years ago.\n\n               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING\n\n               A man and woman (COUPLE #1) make their way toward the main \n               entrance of the large brick building.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         Here in St. Cloud's, I have come to \n                         understand that promises are rarely \n                         kept, that the battle isn't so much \n                         against evil as ignorance, and that \n                         being successful can't hold a candle \n                         to being of *use*.\n\n               The couple enters the orphanage, where we hear the sound of \n               babies.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         Nor have I solved the problem I came \n                         here to solve.\n\n               INT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING\n\n               Two nurses, EDNA and ANGELA, chase CHILDREN--a morning \n               routine.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         Even in the most enlightened times, \n                         unwanted babies will manage to be \n                         born. That there will always be \n                         orphans is simple not a problem to \n                         be solved. Here is St. Cloud's, we \n                         don't regard the sordid facts of \n                         life as problems.\n\n               The camera goes up the stairs with some of the kids.\n\n               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               We enter an office where DR. LARCH shows couple #1 their \n               newly adopted son, HOMER, an infant who lies smiling in Dr. \n               Larch's arms.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         In truth, we've only had one real \n                         problem.\n\n               We close in on the infant until his face fills the screen.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         His name was Homer Wells.\n\n               Dr. Larch hands over the infant to the adopting parents.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         I named him after the Greek writer. \n                         You know Homer, of course?\n\n               Hesitant nods. (They don't look as if they read.)\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         I made his name \"Wells\" because I \n                         could tell he was very deep.\n\n               The parents look with pride at their adopted son.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         In truth, Nurse Angela named him--\n                         her father *drilled* wells, and \n                         \"Homer\" was one of her family's \n                         umpteen cats.\n\n               INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY\n\n               At the front door, Larch and the nurses wave and call good-\n               bye to Homer, they close the door.\n\n               INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT\n\n               The same door swings open; it's another night. The same couple \n               is bringing Homer back. There is concern in their faces as \n               Nurse Edna lets them in.\n\n               INT. BOY'S DIVISION, DOORWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Larch is delivering his benediction to the boys.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         \"Good night, you Princes of Maine, \n                         you Kings of New England!\"\n\n               As he turns, he is startled by Nurse Edna, waiting with couple \n               #1 and baby Homer.\n\n                                     ADOPTING MOTHER\n                         There's something wrong with him! He \n                         never makes a sound.\n\n               Larch looks quickly at Homer.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         He didn't cry enough for them, if \n                         you can believe it.\n\n                                     ADOPTING FATHER\n                         Do you think we could have a look at \n                         someone a little different?\n\n               The mother hands over the baby to Larch. Baby Homer lets out \n               a happy squeal as soon as he's in Larch's arms. The parents \n               stare in disbelief.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         Thus was Homer Wells returned. He \n                         was too happy a baby.\n\n               EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY\n\n               Angela and Edna call and wave good-bye to a two-year-old \n               Homer, leaving with COUPLE #2. Larch stands on the porch and \n               watches the family head down the hill.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         The second family has an unfortunate \n                         gift for getting sounds out of Homer.\n\n               INT. COUPLE #2'S HOME - DAY\n\n               Larch bursts into the home of the second couple and lifts a \n               crying and bruised Homer out of his bed. There is rage in \n               Larch's eyes as he looks at the couple.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         The rumor was true. They beat him. \n                         He couldn't stop crying.\n\n               EXT. HILL, ST. CLOUD'S - DAY\n\n               Larch carries Homer up the orphanage hill.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         Here is St. Cloud's, I try to \n                         consider, with each rule I make or \n                         break, that my first priority is an \n                         orphan's future.\n\n               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY\n\n               The naked belly of a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         Easier said than done.\n\n               A tiny hand comes in with a stethoscope and puts it on the \n               big belly. Young Homer's head, with the stethoscope around \n               his neck, pops up behind the belly; he closes his eyes as he \n               concentrates on listening to the sounds of the unborn child. \n               Larch stops in the doorway, catching sight of Homer. He smiles \n               faintly.\n\n               EXT. COUPLE #3'S HOME - DAY\n\n               The door opens to a THIRD COUPLE smiling at us, welcoming \n               and embracing a sixteen-year-old Homer. Behind them waits \n               the would-be STEPSISTER--an attractive girl, a little older \n               then Homer.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         I told the third family to take good \n                         care--this was a special boy.\n\n               INT. STEPSISTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Homer and the stepsister are in bed together. The parents \n               burst in on them--the father chasing Homer around and around \n               the bed, the mother beating her daughter, who covers herself \n               with a pillow.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         It was Homer who took too much good \n                         care of himself.\n\n               EXT. COUPLE #3'S HOME - NIGHT\n\n               From her window, the stepsister watches Homer leave the house \n               carrying his suitcase. Homer looks up at her as he walks to \n               the street.\n\n               EXT. ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING\n\n               It's after dawn, but still a little dark, as Homer walks to \n               the orphanage door, suitcase in hand. A HUGELY PREGNANT WOMAN \n               arrives at the same time. They stand awkwardly next to each \n               other, waiting for someone to answer the door. The woman is \n               crying. Homer reaches out and takes her hand.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Don't be frightened. Everyone is \n                         nice here.\n\n                                     PREGNANT WOMAN\n                         Do you live here?\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         I just belong here.\n\n               The woman sniffles; she nods vaguely. The door opens. Nurse \n               Edna lets the woman in and embraces Homer.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         What could I do with him? He kept \n                         coming back!\n\n               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Larch instructs an older Homer from \"Gray's Anatomy.\" Homer \n               is bored and looks out the window.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         Homer, if you're going to stay at \n                         St. Cloud's, I expect you to be of \n                         use.\n\n               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY\n\n               Homer looks adoringly at Dr. Larch as Larch examines ANOTHER \n               PREGNANT WOMAN. Larch waves Homer over; he places the boy's \n               hand on the woman's abdomen, to feel the fetus kicking.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         But, in failing to withhold love, \n                         had I created a true and everlasting \n                         orphan? I had been too successful \n                         with Homer Wells. I had managed to \n                         make the orphanage his *home*.\n\n               INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Larch closes a door quickly behind him (so that Homer doesn't \n               see the ABORTION PATIENT in the O.R.)\n\n               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY\n\n               Homer assists Larch in delivering a BABY.\n\n               EXT. INCINERATOR - DAY\n\n               Homer carries a white enamel pail to the incinerator. He \n               looks inside the pail; he stops.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         God forgive me. I have *made* an \n                         orphan by loving him too much. Homer \n                         Wells will belong to St. Cloud's, \n                         forever.\n\n               Hold on Homer's disgusted expression as he stares at the \n               contents of the pail.\n\n               END TITLE SEQUENCE. FADE OUT. We hear a song playing on an \n               old phonograph.\n\n               INT. DISPENSARY - DAY\n\n               We see the song playing on the old phonograph. Dr. Larch is \n               taking ether. He holds the bottle in one hand, the cone over \n               his mouth and nose with the other.\n\n               SUPER: ST. CLOUD'S, MAINE, MARCH 1943.\n\n               When Larch dozes off, his hand loosens its grip on the cone; \n               the cone falls off his face, and he wakes up. Then he puts \n               the cone back in place, dripping more ether from the bottle \n               to the gauze covering the cone.\n\n               Pan the dispensary, which also serves as Larch's photo gallery \n               and bedroom apartment. The ether-bed is separated from the \n               room by a hospital curtain (the kind on casters). We see the \n               recording revolving, the glass-encased cabinets of medical \n               supplies, the old photographs of St. Cloud's.\n\n               Homer enters, he stands uncomfortably, watching Larch for a \n               moment. Then he turns around and walks back into the corridor.\n\n               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n               Homer calls out as though he's just coming down the corridor.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Dr. Larch!

Curly misses, then tips over the sled of snowballs \n               as Clara and the adorable HAZEL (five or six) throw him to \n               the ground.

LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Homer is in the corridor outside the office, overhearing \n               Larch's lecture to the couple adopting Hazel.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         It is strictly for our orphans' sake \n                         that I destroy any record of their \n                         natural mothers. Of course they will, \n                         one day, want to know. But orphans, \n                         especially, should look forward to \n                         their *futures*.

DISPENSARY - MORNING\n\n               Angela is singing along with the song on the phonograph, a \n               more romantic song then before, which rouses Larch from his \n               ether. He is grumpy, but she sings the song in his ear and \n               won't give him back the ether cone; he rolls away from her, \n               but she tickles him and bites his ear, coaxing him into a \n               more playful mood.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         I was dreaming about you.

HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Homer wheels a tray with glasses of water between the beds. \n               A DISTRAUGHT PREGNANT WOMAN stops him by her bed.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Are you okay?

She shuts her eyes. Homer's eyes stare widely. \n               Dr. Larch stops in the doorway; he watches with concern.\n\n                                     DISTRAUGHT WOMAN\n                         Stay right there.

CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - DAY\n\n               Homer at the train station, staring down the empty tracks. \n               Buster is hanging around with him, kicking a rock.\n\n                                     BUSTER\n                         Do you ever think about leaving this \n                         place to go find them?\n\n               Homer makes no response. As the train approaches, Homer and \n               Buster go sit on a loading cart. They see the distraught \n               woman (no longer pregnant) from Homer's experience of a few \n               nights ago; she is leaving St. Cloud's without her baby, \n               waiting for the approaching train. Her face is a mask. The \n               DISAPPROVING STATIONMASTER gives her a hard look.\n\n                                     BUSTER\n                         I mean your parents.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         I know who you mean.

There are SOLDIERS \n               leaning out the windows. Buster turns to see Mary Agnes \n               walking past the train--she's doing her best to look grown-\n               up, sophisticated. One of the soldiers reaches out and gently \n               tugs on  her hair.

Larch paces by the \n               coffin of the 12-year-old girl.\n\n                                     BUSTER\n                         What'd she die of?\n\n                                     LARCH\n                              (inhales deeply)\n                         She died of *secrecy*, she died of \n                         *ignorance*...\n\n               Buster nods, but he's totally bewildered.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                              (to Homer)\n                         If you expect people to be responsible \n                         for their children, you have to give \n                         them the right to decide whether or \n                         not to *have* children. Wouldn't you \n                         agree?\n\n               Buster doesn't get it. Homer has heard this too many times; \n               he rolls his eyes.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         How about expecting people to be \n                         responsible enough to control \n                         themselves to begin with?\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         How about this child? You expect \n                         *her* to be responsible?\n\n               Homer looks away.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         I didn't mean her. I'm talking \n                         about... adults.\n                              (annoyed)\n                         You know who I mean!\n\n               Larch studies him.\n\n               EXT./INT. ST. CLOUD'S ROAD - TRUCK CAB - DAY\n\n               Buster is driving the old pickup truck, with the shovels and \n               a wheelbarrow in the back. Larch and Homer are in the cab, \n               they are being bounced all over the cab by Buster's wild \n               driving. Larch looks at Homer; he stares at him with a curious \n               smile.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         What?!\n\n               Larch says nothing. Homer gives him a look.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                              (smiling)\n                         It's just a marvel to me that you \n                         still have such high expectations of \n                         people.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         I'm happy I amuse you.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                              (to Homer)\n                         Try to look at it this way. What \n                         choice does Buster have? What are \n                         his options? Nobody will ever adopt \n                         him.\n                              (Buster considers \n                              this)\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Try to look at it *this* way. Buster \n                         and I are sitting right here beside \n                         you. We could have ended up in the \n                         incinerator!\n                              (Buster grins)\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         Happy to be alive, under any \n                         circumstances--is that your point?\n\n               Buster is distracted; he drives the truck into a ditch and \n               it bounces around, missing a tree by an inch. He is up on \n               the road again in a few seconds.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Happy to be alive... I guess so.\n\n               They are all distracted by a luxurious convertible that \n               overtakes them on the hill to the orphanage. The fast car is \n               driven by a handsome man in the uniform of the Army Air Corps--\n               a YOUNG OFFICER. From the passenger seat, a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG \n               WOMAN smiles at them, rendering them speechless.\n\n               EXT. ORPHANAGE DRIVEWAY - DAY\n\n               The luxurious convertible (now parked) has drawn all the \n               orphans to it. The handsome young officer (WALLY) and the \n               beautiful young woman (CANDY) stand confused by the car; \n               they are surrounded by the curious orphans, with whom they \n               are painfully self-conscious. They are overly friendly to \n               the children as they are anxious of Larch and Homer and Buster \n               (in their gravedigging attire), who are getting out of the \n               truck. Nervously, Wally gives the children chocolates.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         So many children.

Wally laughs \n               and puts his hand on Homer's shoulder.\n\n                                     WALLY\n                         Uh, look... if you're serious about \n                         wanting a job, picking apples isn't \n                         that boring.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Oh, I would love that, Wally.\n\n               EXT. CAPE KENNETH - LOBSTER POUND - AFTERNOON\n\n               The car is parked at a lobster pound. Homer sits in the car \n               watching Wally carrying Candy's bag to the door. Candy stands \n               outside the car; she shakes Homer's hand.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         I guess I'll see you around the \n                         orchards.

It's RAY, \n               Candy's father. Candy waves. \"Hi, Daddy!\" Homer glances at \n               Candy and Wally on the dock, kissing good-bye.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                              (whispering)\n                         I love you, Wally.\n\n                                     WALLY\n                         I love you, too.

Homer sits in the car, admiring the beautiful farmhouse.\n\n                                     WALLY\n                         Come on.

Model \n               airplanes are everywhere. Mrs. Worthington's voice comes \n               from the hall.\n\n                                     OLIVE (O.S.)\n                         Wally? I expected you earlier...\n\n               She appears in the doorway of Wally's room. Mrs. Worthington \n               (OLIVE) is an elegant, fiftyish New Englander, as handsome \n               as Wally, but more reserved. She is surprised to see Homer.\n\n                                     WALLY\n                         This is Homer Wells--he's the most \n                         overqualified apple picker you'll \n                         ever meet, but he's dying to learn \n                         the apple business.\n\n               Wally is taking his uniform off as he speaks, just dropping \n               it on the floor as he quickly puts on some farm clothes.\n\n                                     OLIVE\n                         How do you do, Homer Wells...\n\n               Homer has never met anyone like her.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         How do you do...\n\n               Mrs. Worthington starts picking up her son's uniform from \n               the floor. She is politely curious about Homer.\n\n                                     OLIVE\n                         Were you a friend of the bride or \n                         the groom?\n\n               Homer looks confused; he seems to have forgotten about the \n               alleged wedding. Wally puts his arm around Homer, urging him \n               into the hall.\n\n                                     WALLY\n                         Homer is everybody's friend, Mom... \n                         the bride's, the groom's, mine, \n                         Candy's, *everybody's*.\n\n               Homer is embarrassed, but Olive is obdurately well-mannered.\n\n                                     OLIVE\n                         Well, perhaps you'll come to dinner, \n                         Homer...\n\n               Wally calls to her as he pushes Homer down the hall.\n\n                                     WALLY\n                         Not tonight, Mom--he's got to meet \n                         *Mr. Rose*!\n\n               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DUSK\n\n               Homer and Wally get out of the jeep at the cider house, a \n               barnlike building with adjacent sheds and, behind it, line \n               after line of trees--the apple orchards.\n\n               Homer sees an outdoor shower where THREE BLACK MEN are \n               showering. It is a wooden stall that leaves the shower's \n               occupants visible above and below their midsections. A FOURTH \n               BLACK MAN is caught naked, running behind the cider house \n               and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You already used up the hot water!\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         You're usin' my soap, ain't you?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I ain't usin' no soap--it's too cold \n                         to bother with soap!\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         There ain't never enough hot water, \n                         soap or no soap.\n\n                                     WALLY\n                         They're migrants.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                              (no clue)\n                         Migrants?\n\n                                     WALLY\n                         Yes.

Before Wally can knock, a pretty young \n               black girl, ROSE ROSE, bumps open the screen door with her \n               hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass--almost hitting \n               Homer and Wally.\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                         That sink's backed up again, Wally. \n                         I thought you was gonna get me a \n                         plumber.\n\n                                     WALLY\n                         Rose, this is Homer--Homer, this is \n                         Mr. Rose's daughter, Rose.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Rose Rose?\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                         Pretty, ain't it?

Rose Rose goes back \n               inside the cider house as Mr. Rose shakes Homer's hand. Homer \n               introduces himself.\n\n                                     MR.

If that shed was better \n                         organized, I could put my truck in \n                         there.\n\n               Homer looks at Mr. Rose with an uncomprehending expression.\n\n                                     MR.

CIDER HOUSE - EVENING\n\n               The pickers all sit down to supper around a picnic table. \n               Homer with Mr. Rose, Rose Rose, and the other black pickers. \n               Mr. Rose takes an apple from a bowl on the table. Then he \n               pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion; he's so \n               fast, the knife seems to come out of nowhere. He begins to \n               peel the apple. Homer eyes Mr. Rose, but Mr. Rose's focus is \n               riveted to his apple and the long, perfect strand of peel \n               dangling from it.\n\n                                     MR.

Ain't that right, Muddy?\n\n               Muddy scowls at Homer, but he smiles at Mr. Rose.\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Homer unpacks his suitcase. (His bed should be nearest Muddy's \n               and Mr. Rose's.) Jack lies on his bed, smoking. Muddy, also \n               smoking, is sitting on his bed, sharpening a knife. Hero and \n               Peaches are playing cards on one of their beds. Mr. Rose is \n               finishing shaving. Rose Rose watches Homer unpack.\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                         What's that?\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         It's just my heart.\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                         What you got a picture of your heart \n                         for?\n\n               He holds up the X ray, in order to show her.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         There's a little something wrong \n                         with it. Just this part here--the \n                         right ventricle. It's slightly \n                         enlarged.\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                         So what?\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Yes, so what.

She puts it down, restlessly.\n\n                                     MR.

Rose Rose sits down next \n               to him, watching him read. Homer notices her interest.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Do you like to read?\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                              (embarrassed)\n                         I can't read. Nobody taught me.\n\n               Homer smiles politely and goes back to his book.

(Like bedtime stories at the orphanage, \n               he thinks; however, the picker's attitude is suspicious, \n               reserved.)\n\n                                     HOMER\n                              (reading)\n                         \"I looked at the stars, and considered \n                         how awful it would be for a man to \n                         turn his face to them as he froze to \n                         death, and see no help or pity in \n                         all the glittering multitude.\"\n\n               Homer looks up; there's no response.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                              (to Rose Rose)\n                         More?\n\n               Some muttering, some giggling, mostly silence. Rose Rose \n               wants more, but suddenly Jack jumps out of bed and stomps to \n               the kitchen end of the cider house, where a piece of paper \n               is tacked to the wall.

Wally stops walking; they both stop.\n\n                                     WALLY\n                              (more serious)\n                         You want to fight about it?\n\n               Homer is unfamiliar with this kind of kidding around; at \n               first he is startled, but then he laughs. Wally laughs, too. \n               They shake hands.\n\n               Mr. Rose calls out to Homer from the tractor. The pickers \n               are impatiently waiting for him on the flatbed; they're going \n               back to the orchard. Homer has to run to catch up to them. \n               He jumps on the flatbed; he sees Wally waving good-bye.\n\n               EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY\n\n               High up in a tall tree on a couple of ladders, Mr. Rose and \n               Homer are picking side by side. Mr. Rose is picking with \n               high-speed perfection, but Homer is slower and fumbling--he \n               drops an occasional apple to the ground.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         You pickin' more cider apples then \n                         anythin' else. Them drops is good \n                         only for cider. And you pickin' the \n                         stems with the apples only half the \n                         time. They good only for cider, too--\n                         if you don't pick them stems.\n                              (Homer watches him)\n                         The rule is, you wanna pick the apple \n                         *with* the stem, Homer. And see \n                         here... see that *bud* that's just \n                         above the stem? That's the bud for \n                         *next year's* apple--that's called \n                         the *spur*. You pick the spur, you \n                         pickin' two years in one--you pickin' \n                         next year's apple 'fore it have a \n                         chance to grow. You leave that on \n                         the branch, you hear?\n\n               Homer nods; he picks more carefully, with more concentration.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                              (approvingly)\n                         That's better. I can tell you got \n                         yourself some education. Them's good \n                         hands you got, Homer. Them hands you \n                         got, they know what they're doin'--\n                         ain't that right?\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         I guess so...\n\n               Homer can see over the apple mart parking lot from the top \n               of the tree. He can see the driveway of the Worthington house, \n               where Candy and Olive are saying a tearful good-bye to Wally. \n               Distracted, Homer drops another couple of apples, which Mr. \n               Rose observes with a wry smile.\n\n                                     ANGELA (O.S.)\n                         Wilbur!

But it's closed all the time \n                         now, because of the blackout.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         People watched the movies in their \n                         cars?\n\n                                     CANDY\n                              (smiling)\n                         When they watched at all. Do you \n                         like movies?\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Yes! I've only seen one, though.\n\n               Candy looks at him; he isn't joking.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         You've seen only one movie? Which \n                         one?\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         \"King Kong\". It's really good.\n\n               Candy laughs.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         I haven't seen \"King Kong\" since I \n                         was a kid!\n\n               Homer laughs a little self-consciously; around her, he feels \n               like he's *still* a kid.\n\n               INT. DINING HALL - EARLY MORNING\n\n               At one table, the children are happily eating apples; a few \n               of the kids are stuffing apples from a big bowl into their \n               pockets. At another table, Larch, Edna, and Angela sit around \n               an open packing crate of apples. Larch takes a bite from an \n               apple and spits it out. Angela takes the apple out of his \n               hand.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         That's a pie apple, Wilbur. Homer \n                         said you're not supposed to eat it!\n\n               Angela hands him another apple.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         So he's an apple expert, is he?\n\n               Angela gives him a critical look as Larch takes a bite out \n               of the new apple.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                              (sarcastically)\n                         Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior \n                         taste--and crisp, too! You know, so \n                         many apples are disappointingly mealy. \n                         I wonder of most of the apples in my \n                         life weren't meant for pies!\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         Wilbur, he picked them for us \n                         himself...\n\n                                     LARCH\n                              (incredulous)\n                         You don't find it depressing that \n                         Homer Wells is picking apples?\n\n               Both Edna and Angela glower at him.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         Or that he can't be bothered to write \n                         us a proper letter? A dissertation \n                         on apples, we don't need!\n\n                                     EDNA\n                              (annoyed)\n                         He probably doesn't make much money \n                         picking apples--he must have had to \n                         pay to send them, too.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he \n                         doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, \n                         he can pick his dinner!\n\n               Larch angrily tosses the half-eaten apple into the garbage.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         Wilbur, it's a *gift*! How can you \n                         be angry with Homer for sending us a \n                         *gift*?\n\n               Larch stares into space, depressed. Then he examines the \n               crate and finds the mailing label that says \"OCEAN VIEW \n               ORCHARDS--CAPE KENNETH, MAINE.\" He rips it off, holds it up \n               triumphantly.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         I'll show him a *gift*! I'll give \n                         him a gift he can *use*!\n\n               Larch storms out of the room.\n\n               INT. CAPE KENNETH - MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT\n\n               A newsreel from the war is playing on the screen--soldiers \n               marching, smiling, waving to the camera. Homer and Candy sit \n               together watching. Homer is completely fascinated; Candy \n               watches Homer as much as the news. Her expression changes \n               when the newsreel cuts to footage from an air raid.\n\n               EXT. CAPE KENNETH - MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT\n\n               Candy and Homer walk out of the theatre, under the marquee \n               and past the poster for \"Wuthering Heights.\"\n\n                                     CANDY\n                              (disappointed)\n                         But you looked as if you liked it.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                              (smiling)\n                         I *did* like it. All I said was, \n                         \"It's not 'King Kong'.\"\n\n               Candy makes a face, but in good fun.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         First she loved him, then she didn't, \n                         then no one else could have him...\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         She *did* love him!\n                              (teasing him)\n                         How many women have you known?\n\n               Homer is embarrassed; he ducks the question.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         And what did she die of, exactly?\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         She was torn apart! She died of a \n                         broken heart.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Oh, sure!\n\n               Homer smiles and shakes his head; Candy starts to laugh.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         What's the *medical* explanation?\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         Well, she was in a weakened \n                         condition...\n                              (laughs)\n                         I don't know! What about \"King Kong\"?! \n                         Is that medically possible?\n\n               Homer smiles; he knows she's teasing him, and he likes it.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                              (mock serious)\n                         At least King Kong knew what he \n                         *wanted*.\n\n               Candy pushes him playfully. They're both having a good time, \n               *too* good a time.\n\n               EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY\n\n               Homer is picking apples in a big tree; Rose Rose is on a \n               ladder in the tree right beside him. She's picking about \n               twice as fast as he is, and he keeps dropping his apples. In \n               another tree, Muddy is watching.\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                         What is you *doin'* with that Candy, \n                         Homer?\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                              (imitating Mr. Rose)\n                         He's makin' history, I suppose.\n\n               From the surrounding trees, the other pickers laugh.\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                         You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I \n                         hope.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         No trouble.\n\n               In adjacent trees, both Peaches and Hero are picking apples; \n               they can hear Homer and Rose Rose, too.

Larch has provided a copy for each member. The three \n               elderly gentlemen on the Board don't speak; they just nod \n               their heads to everything Dr. Holtz or Mrs. Goodhall says.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         ...and his *pathetic* resume is the \n                         best I've seen.

The two stop when they see \n               what's going on--not to mention Larch's stern expression. \n               They back out.

Homer gets soaking wet \n               as he leans in to talk to Candy, who's behind the wheel. Mr. \n               Rose calls to Homer from the doorway of the mill room.\n\n               INT. MILL ROOM - RAINY DAY\n\n               Mr. Rose is instructing Homer as they stand bottling cider \n               in their yellow slickers and rubber boots. Rose Rose is hosing \n               down the pressboards; Muddy and Hero and Peaches are operating \n               the grinder and the press. Jack is stirring the vat. In a \n               defiant, contemptuous way, Jack keeps flicking the ash of \n               his cigarette into the vat. This make everyone uncomfortable; \n               only Mr. Rose doesn't appear to notice.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         Cider don't have no taste till later \n                         in October--it's too watery now, \n                         when we're usin' just them early \n                         Macs and them Gravensteins.

Most of these \n                         apples are the drops--off the ground, \n                         right? There have to be worms.\n\n                                     MR.

They is \n                         *good* for you!\n\n               Everyone but Jack laughs. He takes a last drag on his \n               cigarette, then deliberately drops it into the vat.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         That just ain't right, Jack--your \n                         cigarette's gonna end up in nine or \n                         ten gallons of this batch of cider! \n                         That ain't right.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Them people drinkin' that cider, \n                         they don't know there's a cigarette \n                         in there!\n\n                                     MR.

You just gotta go fishin'.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You mean *swimmin'*.

Just \n                         tell me what your business is...\n\n               Jack looks for a translation from the other men, who are \n               nervous.\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         Just say you're in the *apple* \n                         business, man.

We see the men circle each \n               other: Jack takes a swipe at Mr. Rose's head--then he steps \n               back, his yellow slicker slashed open. His slicker is opened \n               up, right up the middle. His shirt underneath the slicker is \n               slashed open, too--he feels his bare chest and stomach, \n               feeling for the cut. But there's no cut--Jack's not bleeding, \n               he's not even scratched. Just his clothes have been slashed.\n\n                                     MR.

WALLY'S CAR - DRIVE-IN THEATRE - EARLY EVENING\n\n               Wally's car comes bouncing along the ditches of the closed \n               drive-in. Homer is at the wheel; Candy calls out some driving \n               instructions. The car comes to a stop next to a speakerpost. \n               Candy leans out; she grabs the speaker and hangs it on the \n               window. Homer sits back and drapes his arms out the window \n               and over the seat. He feels great.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         You're a natural.

Of course \n                         everyone wanted to sit in front, so \n                         we'd be packed in so tight you could \n                         feel the kid next to you breathing.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         At least you were never lonely.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         I didn't say that. Growing up in an \n                         orphanage, you're always lonely. \n                         You're just never alone.\n\n               Candy is moved. Homer feels exposed; he tries to change the \n               mood by making light of what he's said.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         You're not alone in the bathroom, \n                         or... or in the shower... you're \n                         never alone in wanting the last piece \n                         of meatloaaf, or even in your own \n                         bed on a cold morning.\n\n               Candy laughs.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         You don't miss it?\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         I miss things.

Homer \n               is focused on the giant screen.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         How could you not *care* about the \n                         movie?\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         You just cuddle.

He \n               leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen. \n               Candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder. Homer looks \n               afraid to breathe.\n\n               From behind, with her head on his shoulder, they look like a \n               normal couple. We track in toward the huge screen until we \n               see only the screen. There are shadows on the black screen. \n               Suddenly the movie \"King Kong\" appears.\n\n               INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT\n\n               \"King Kong\" is playing against the bare, white wall. Fuzzy \n               is very weak, but he smiles at the sight of the love-struck \n               Kong holding the screaming Fay Wray in his giant hand. Dr. \n               Larch runs the projector; he sits close beside Fuzzy. When \n               the film breaks in the predictable place, Fuzzy makes no \n               protest. Dr. Larch looks at Fuzzy, who has stopped breathing; \n               his eyes are closed.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         Fuzzy?

A jeep comes down the orchard road \n               toward them. It's Olive. Mr. Rose leads the \"Good mornin', \n               Mrs. Worthin'ton!\" greeting.

From a paper bag, \n               Candy is scattering some small, brightly colored pieces of \n               broken glass.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Aren't you worried that people will \n                         cut their feet?\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         Nobody will swim here until next \n                         summer.

The ocean makes it \n                         beautiful.\n\n               Candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for Homer to look \n               at. The ocean is a gray-green color, the glass a paler shade \n               of green.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         Give me your hand.\n\n               She rubs the smooth piece of glass against his hand, then \n               throws it toward the water. It falls short. Homer retrieves \n               it. Candy splashes him playfully. He chases her away from \n               the beach, into the pine trees. Homer locks his arms around \n               her, from behind. He can't let go. She lets him hold her, \n               then breaks his grip. She turns to face him. She is taller \n               then he is, older, obviously more experienced. She initiates \n               the kiss. They drop to the ground right there; they make \n               love by the roots of the tree, Candy guiding him.\n\n               EXT.

DINING HALL - EVENING\n\n               Supper chaos--Buster and Mary Agnes are doing their best to \n               stop a food fight while Larch and Angela and Edna are \n               completely absorbed reading Homer's letter.\n\n                                     HOMER (V.O.)\n                         Field mice girdle an apple tree. \n                         Pine mice kill the roots. I *know* \n                         what you have to do--you have to \n                         play God. Well... killing mice is as \n                         close as I want to come to playing \n                         God.\n\n               INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CAPE KENNETH\n\n               Homer and Candy are watching \"Rebecca\".\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         Do I interfere? When absolutely \n                         helpless women tell me that they \n                         simply *can't* have an abortion, \n                         that they simply *must* go through \n                         with having another--and yet another--\n                         orphan... do I interfere? *Do* I? I \n                         do not. I do not even *recommend*. I \n                         just give them what they want: an \n                         orphan or an abortion.\n                              (close on Homer)\n                         You are my work of art, Homer. \n                         Everything else has been just a job. \n                         I don't know if you've got a work of \n                         art in you, but I know what your job \n                         is. You're a doctor!\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY\n\n               The radio is playing a slow, sexy dance number. The fat ladies \n               from the apple mart are dancing as they paint the interior \n               walls of the bunk house.\n\n                                     HOMER (V.O.)\n                         I am not a doctor.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         You know everything I know, plus \n                         what you've taught yourself--you're \n                         a better doctor then I am and you \n                         know it!\n\n               Homer is finishing up painting the kitchen walls. When he \n               gets to the list of rules, tacked on the wall, he removes \n               the list and finishes painting under where the rules were.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         They're going to replace me, Homer! \n                         The Board of Trustees is looking for \n                         my *replacement*!\n\n               Two of the ladies unroll the rolled-up mattresses on the \n               bare bedsprings, as Vernon enters with an armload of blankets \n               and pillows.\n\n                                     HOMER (V.O.)\n                         I can't replace you! I'm sorry...\n\n               Homer holds up the list of rules, rereads it briefly; he \n               walks over to an unpainted beam, a support beam, and tacks \n               the rules on this beam.\n\n               EXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - MORNING\n\n               Homer reads Larch's letter, sipping coffee.\n\n                                     LARCH (V.O.)\n                         Sorry? I'm not 'sorry'! Not for \n                         anything I've done. I'm not even \n                         sorry that I love you!\n\n               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT\n\n               Larch sits on his ether-bed with a letter from Homer in his \n               hand. He looks completely deflated. Angela is standing in \n               the doorway.\n\n                                     LARCH\n                         I think we may have lot him to the \n                         world. He's not coming back.\n\n               END OF THE MONTAGE.\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE - EARLY EVENING\n\n               In the newly painted, spruced-up cider house, Homer and Candy \n               are dancing to another slow, sexy song on the radio. He is \n               untucking her blouse, feeling under her blouse--she starts \n               to unbutton his shirt. They kiss while they dance. But the \n               song changes abruptly on the radio to something fast and \n               silly.\n\n               Homer responds to the music, dancing goofily--instantly out \n               of the mood. Candy laughs, but she picks up a pillow and \n               swings it at him, hitting him. He dances away from her. She \n               throws the pillow; he ducks--the pillow lands somewhere near \n               the door. Now Homer grabs a pillow and chases her from bed \n               to bed. She shrieks--they're both laughing. They each grab a \n               pillow and stand toe to toe whacking each other, laughing \n               all the while, until he pins her arms behind her and, \n               breathing hard--and despite the stupid music that broke the \n               mood--they are passionately kissing again.\n\n               The sound of a truck is sudden and loud.\n\n               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Mr. Rose's truck has arrived. The pickers are hopping out of \n               the truck, grabbing their gear.\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY\n\n               The door opens. Hero and Peaches barge in, as Homer and Candy \n               are struggling to return the pillows to the beds.\n\n                                     HERO\n                         Who's that?\n\n                                     PEACHES\n                         It's that Homer!\n\n               Muddy is right behind them. He picks up a pillow, off the \n               floor, looking for which bed it belongs on.\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         It's that Candy, too...\n\n               Then comes Mr. Rose, slyly smiling, taking it all in--there's \n               no hiding what's going on. Homer and Candy are caught, their \n               shirts untucked and half-unbuttoned--they're still out of \n               breath. The pillows lie crazily on the beds, each one of \n               which has been stepped on.\n\n                                     MR.

She looks hardened, toughened--not happy. \n               She plops down her stuff on her bed, looking only at Candy.\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                         How is that Wally doing?\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         Oh, he's fine!

As Muddy climbs down and \n               moves his ladder to an adjacent tree, he keeps talking to \n               Homer until he disappears in the leaves.\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         You best just watch you ass, Homer! \n                         You don't wanna end up like Jack!\n\n               Homer thoughtfully continues his work.\n\n               INT.

ORCHARD - LATE AFTERNOON, ANOTHER DAY\n\n               The pickers on their ladders in the trees; nobody is talking. \n               In the late sun, the leaves have a reddish, fiery glow.\n\n               EXT. ORCHARD - ANOTHER DAY\n\n               It's much colder; the pickers are on their ladders in the \n               trees again, but they're dressed for the cold. Homer is high \n               on a ladder; he turns toward the view of the Worthington \n               house when he hears a car come to a screeching halt in the \n               driveway. Homer sees Candy get out of Wally's car; she leaves \n               the door open and runs toward the house. Parked in front of \n               Wally's car is an Army Jeep, with an ENLISTED MAN leaning \n               against it. The indifferent soldier smokes a cigarette as he \n               watches Candy run.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         No! No!\n\n               Homer descends the ladder and runs for the house, down as \n               aisle between the row of trees. The pickers watch him run.\n\n               INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Camera follows Homer into the Worthington house where, from \n               the front hall, he sees Olive and Candy (in profile) sitting \n               on the couch. We can't see who's talking, nor do we recognize \n               the voice. As Homer comes into the living room, we see MAJOR \n               WINSLOW sitting in a chair (also in profile), talking to \n               Olive and Candy.\n\n               Major Winslow is a smooth, handsome well-briefed officer in \n               the casualty branch of the Army Air Corps; he's done his \n               homework, but he's not all business. He's painfully aware of \n               the delicate nature of his report.\n\n                                     MAJOR WINSLOW\n                         When the plane was hit, the crew \n                         chief and the radioman jumped close \n                         together. The copilot jumped third. \n                         All on Captain Worthington's orders--\n                         the captain was still flying the \n                         plane. None of the men of the ground \n                         could see the sky--that's how thick \n                         the jungle was. They never saw the \n                         plane crash--they never *heard* it \n                         crash. They never saw Captain \n                         Worthington's parachute, either.\n\n                                     OLIVE\n                         Why was he missing for twenty days?\n\n                                     MAJOR WINSLOW\n                         Because the crew thought he'd gone \n                         down with the plane. They were \n                         hospitalized for almost a week in \n                         China before they were flown back to \n                         India.

Somehow he managed \n                         to avoid the Japs, but not the \n                         mosquitoes.\n\n                                     OLIVE\n                         Then it's malaria?\n\n                                     MAJOR WINSLOW\n                         It's encephalitis B.

ROSE\n                         You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle \n                         of the night, girl!\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                         I ain't your business no more, Daddy. \n                         Please let me go.\n\n               Rose Rose starts to pedal away, but Mr. Rose stops her. She \n               starts to struggle.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Hey, hey! Stop it. Maybe I can help.\n\n               They turn to see Homer.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         You just go inside, Homer. We don't \n                         need no help.\n\n                                     ROSE ROSE\n                         That's right, Homer. This ain't your \n                         business.\n\n               She tries to break free from her father and pedal away, but \n               he stops her again. They keep struggling.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Please listen to me! *Both* of you...\n\n                                     MR.

You got your own \n                         mess to deal with--ain't that right?\n\n               Homer steps between them, which makes Mr. Rose furious.\n\n                                     MR.

You \n                         don't have to go anywhere.\n\n               Rose Rose and Mr. Rose stop struggling. Suddenly Homer is in \n               charge.\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Muddy, Hero and Peaches smoke in their beds. Rose Rose opens \n               her curtain and peers out from her bed. She gets up and goes \n               toward the kitchen area in her nightshirt; she stops at an \n               unused bed, now covered with white rubber sheeting--Homer's \n               medical instruments are displayed and ready. Homer finished \n               scrubbing his hands in the sink. His surgical mask is loosely \n               tied around his neck.\n\n               Mr. Rose is looking at Homer's surgical instruments when \n               Rose Rose joins him.\n\n                                     MR.

BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Mr. Rose wears a surgical mask; he is sweating, even in the \n               cold, and his eyes look stricken as he watches Homer, who is \n               performing the abortion. Mr. Rose holds the ether cone over \n               Rose Rose's face. He drips some ether from the bottle on the \n               cone.\n\n               Cut quickly for Rose Rose's etherized face... to Mr. Rose's \n               eyes above his mask... to Homer working with his eyes trained \n               on the speculum...\n\n               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               ...to Muddy and Peaches and Hero huddled under the overhanging \n               roof in the rain.\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Mr. Rose is having a hard time breathing.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         You better get some air.\n\n               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The cider house in the rain. Mr. Rose staggers out; he stands \n               there in the rain, trying to regain his composure. He starts \n               to scream.\n\n               Another angle: huddled under the overhanging roof, Muddy and \n               Peaches and Hero are watching him.\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE - RAINY DAY\n\n               Rose Rose, curled in a fetal position, listens to the rain \n               on the roof. Candy sits on her bed beside her. She helps her \n               to sit up, to drink a glass of water; then Rose Rose lies \n               down again. Rose Rose's expression never changes while Candy \n               talks to her. Mr. Rose lies in his bed in the exact same \n               fetal position as his daughter; he too, is listening to Candy. \n               Homer is putting away his instruments.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         The bleeding should taper off \n                         tomorrow, but it can come back again. \n                         The cramps will ease up, almost \n                         entirely. The bleeding is usually \n                         much lighter in two days. As long as \n                         the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.\n\n               Muddy enters the cider house from out of the storm. He glances \n               at Candy and Rose Rose; then at Homer. Then he speaks to Mr. \n               Rose.\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' \n                         where you and Homer and Rose Rose is \n                         at.\n\n                                     MR.

Peaches is \n               standing next to the list of rules tacked to the kitchen \n               support beam.\n\n                                     PEACHES\n                         Look at that.

At least I got to see the \n                         ocean.\n\n               Candy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably, \n               unstoppably. Homer's anger keeps him impervious to her tears--\n               another \"first\" for him. He turns and looks at her with an \n               almost clinical curiosity; then he goes back to staring at \n               the blank screen.\n\n               EXT. ORCHARD - IN FRONT OF THE APPLE MART - DAWN\n\n               The rain has stopped but the grass is wet, the trees \n               glistening in the dawn light as Wally's car stops and Homer \n               gets out. The car exits the frame in one direction; Homer, \n               walking, exits the frame in another.\n\n               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAWN\n\n               As he walks toward the cider house, Homer sees Muddy and \n               Peaches and Hero waving to him from the roof.\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         Rose Rose has runned away!\n\n                                     PEACHES\n                         She took off in the night!\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         She took off on the bicycle, man.\n\n               Homer starts jogging, then running toward the cider house. \n               Muddy comes down the ladder to meet him.\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE - EARLY MORNING\n\n               Rose Rose's bed is exposed. The curtains are flung open; her \n               bed is empty. Mr. Rose is still in his bed, in the fetal \n               position we have seen before. Mr. Rose's trancelike expression \n               doesn't change as Homer and Muddy enter.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         Ain't nobody gonna find her, Homer--\n                         she's long gone.\n                              (pause)\n                         I swear, I didn't try and stop her--\n                         I just wanna touch her hand before \n                         she go. That's all I wanna do, I \n                         swear.\n                              (pause)\n                         Where'd she get that knife, Muddy? \n                         That looked like *your* knife--what \n                         I seen of it.\n\n               Muddy is scared; he looks to Homer for advice.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         If that was your knife, Muddy, I \n                         wanna thank you for givin' it to her--\n                         no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* \n                         if she don't got a good knife with \n                         her.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                              (seeing the blood)\n                         Where'd she get you?\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         She just plan misunderstand me--I \n                         was tryin' to give her my knife, I \n                         was just reachin' to touch her hand. \n                         But I understand if she misunderstand \n                         me--it's all my fault, ain't that \n                         right?\n\n               Homer takes the blanket off him; Muddy gasps. Homer tries to \n               examine Mr. Rose's wound. Mr. Rose smiles at him.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         It's too late for the doctor now, \n                         Homer--ain't that right?\n\n               Homer doesn't answer; he knows Mr. Rose is a goner.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                              (proudly)\n                         She's *good* with that knife! She's \n                         real fast. She's a lot better with \n                         that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And \n                         who do you suppose taught her?\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         *You* taught her, I suppose...\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         That's right! A girl's gotta know \n                         how to defend herself, don't she?\n\n               He winces in pain at Homer's examination.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                              (surprised)\n                         There's more than one laceration, \n                         more than one cut.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         That's 'cause I sticked my *own* \n                         knife in the wound--after she go, I \n                         sticked my *own* knife in there. I \n                         poked it all around, I just tryin' \n                         to find the same place she got me.\n\n               Homer finds Mr. Rose's knife. There's blood everywhere.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         You listen to me: you tell them police \n                         how this happen, you tell it *this* \n                         way, you hear? My daughter, she runned \n                         off--and I so sad about it that I \n                         stabbed myself. I so unhappy that \n                         she gone, I killed myself--that what \n                         you say, you hear? That the true \n                         story--ain't that right?\n\n               Homer and Muddy exchange a glance. Mr. Rose, with his blood-\n               soaked hand, suddenly grabs Homer by the throat.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy \n                         she runned away that I killed myself--\n                         that what happen here, ain't that \n                         right?\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Right?\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         That what happen--you lost you only \n                         daughter so's you killed yourself! \n                         That's what we say, all right.\n\n                                     MR. ROSE\n                         That's right. I know you understand \n                         how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' \n                         them rules, too. Ain't that right?\n\n               Mr. Rose dies. Muddy turns away. Homer closes Mr. Rose's \n               eyes.\n\n               EXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - MORNING\n\n               Muddy and Hero and Peaches are sitting close together on the \n               roof, like banished children. It is from their perspective \n               that we see the police car and the ambulance--two men carrying \n               the body out of the cider house, and a cop or two talking to \n               Homer and Olive, and Homer talking to them. We hear no \n               dialogue.\n\n               EXT. APPLE MART - DUSK\n\n               Homer and the men load crates of apple jelly onto a truck. \n               The mood is solemn; they work with tired focus. Candy drives \n               up. The men are evasive with her; they find a reason to work \n               across the mart. Candy walks to Homer, stands next to him. \n               They say nothing for a moment, until Candy breaks the silence.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         Do you think she'll be all right?\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         She knows how to take care of herself.\n\n               Candy looks away; she can't think of what to say. She shoves \n               her hands into her pockets, finds a letter there, which she \n               hands to Homer.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         This came for you a couple of days \n                         ago. Olive asked me to bring it. \n                         With everything happening, I guess \n                         she forgot.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Sure. Thanks.\n\n               Homer looks at the letter from St. Cloud's; he puts it \n               unopened in his pocket without a second thought. Candy can't \n               let things end there.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         I know you don't think much of being \n                         needed, or of me for that matter...\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         I'm sorry for what I said about Wally \n                         needing you. It was... unnecessary.\n\n                                     CANDY\n                         No, I'm the one who should be sorry. \n                         You have every right to be angry.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         No. You warned me. I didn't listen, \n                         but you warned me.\n\n               Candy looks surprised.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         You told me you weren't any good at \n                         being alone.\n                              (pause)\n                         You told Wally, too. Right?\n\n               Candy can only stare straight ahead.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                              (relenting)\n                         He's going to be fine, Wally's going \n                         to be fine. I know he is.\n\n               A tear rolls down Candy's cheek, Homer wipes it away; then \n               he stops touching her and looks off into the quiet orchards.\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The pickers lie in their beds, smoking. Homer is undressing. \n               He pulls the letter out of his pocket and sits down on his \n               bed. Homer opens the letter without enthusiasm and begins to \n               read.\n\n                                     ANGELA (V.O.)\n                         Dear Homer, I am writing to tell you \n                         about Wilbur.\n\n               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT\n\n               Music is playing on the old phonograph as an exhausted Larch \n               gives himself ether.\n\n               INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT\n\n               Edna is getting the girls ready for bed. Music continues \n               Over.\n\n               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT\n\n               Larch has twisted himself on the narrow bed so that his face \n               is unusually close to the windowsill, and when the ether \n               cone starts to fall off his face--and his slack hand trails \n               down, off the side of the bed--the cone becomes caught against \n               the windowsill.\n\n               He tries to turn his face away from the cone, but he presses \n               his face into the sill--thus holding the ether-soaked cone \n               over his mouth and nose. His hands twitch, he's trying to \n               wake up; the hand that holds the ether bottle lets the bottle \n               fall. The bottle shatters against the sill; the ether spreads, \n               running red with blood from a cut on Dr. Larch's hand or \n               finger. Music continues Over. It's a funeral.\n\n               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\n               Buster is bringing in the wood as the music plays Over. Buster \n               smells the spilled ether. He heads toward the dispensary, \n               sniffing. Camera follows him into the dispensary.\n\n               In the dispensary: Buster approaches Larch's ether-bed.\n\n                                     BUSTER\n                         Dr. Larch? Dr. Larch?\n\n               He drops the armload of wood and runs for help.\n\n               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT\n\n               Angela enters. She feels for Larch's pulse; Larch is dead. \n               Angela opens a window. She pull's Larch's body away from the \n               windowsill. Buster joins her on the bed.\n\n                                     ANGELA (V.O.)\n                         I can assure you that the overdose \n                         was entirely accidental.\n\n               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Homer finishes reading the letter; he puts it down, gets up, \n               and walks to a window. He stares into the night.\n\n                                     ANGELA (V.O.)\n                         Let us be happy for Dr. Larch. Dr. \n                         Larch has found a family.\n\n                                     THE BOYS (V.O.)\n                         Good night, Dr. Larch! Good night, \n                         Dr. Larch! Good night, Dr. Larch!\n\n               Homer wipes a tear off his cheek.\n\n               EXT. PICKERS' TRUCK - CIDER/PACKING HOUSE - MORNING\n\n               The truck is packed for the long trip south; it passes by \n               the packing house, which looks closed for the season. No one \n               else is about. Muddy is driving slowly, his arm out the open \n               window. In the back, huddled among their belongings, are \n               Peaches and Hero (on one side) and Homer (on the other). The \n               pickers are trying to draw Homer into their conversation, \n               while Homer is giving the apple farm a good-bye look. He has \n               made up his mind about something.\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         You ever see a palm tree, Homer?\n\n                                     PEACHES\n                         He ain't never been outta Maine!\n\n                                     HERO\n                         Ain't you sick of pine trees, Homer?\n\n               Homer just smiles and shakes his head.\n\n               EXT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - MORNING\n\n               As the pickers' truck drives past, Homer is on the side of \n               the truck nearest the Worthington house and driveway; he \n               sees Olive and Candy and Ray helping Wally out of the car \n               and into a wheelchair. A NURSE stands by.\n\n               Wally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officer's \n               coat or flight jacket, his face looking small in the overlarge \n               clothes. He can't move his legs at all, and his mouth is \n               drawn into a tight-lipped smile.\n\n                                     PEACHES (O.S.)\n                         Let me tell you somethin' about \n                         Florida, Homer.\n\n                                     HERO (O.S.)\n                         The Sunshine State!\n\n                                     PEACHES (O.S.)\n                         It's so nice 'n' warm down there, \n                         you can pick them grapefruits and \n                         oranges *naked*, if you want to.\n\n               Olive is dissolved in tears. Candy is sobbing; she kisses \n               Wally, without ceasing, while he haltingly touches her face, \n               her hair.\n\n               In the truck the smile is gone from Homer's face. He shakes \n               his head.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with \n                         you. But I've got to move on.\n\n                                     MUDDY\n                         Yeah, well... you could move on with \n                         *us*, man! You could move on somewhere \n                         *warm*!\n\n                                     PEACHES\n                         Homer, stayin' in Maine ain't movin' \n                         on!\n\n               This makes all the pickers laugh, but Homer just smiles and \n               shakes his head. He watches the Worthington house disappear \n               from view.\n\n               INT. MOVING TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT\n\n               A CONDUCTOR, taking tickets, comes to Homer, who is better \n               dressed than we've ever seen him; he is looking at his sober \n               reflection in the black window-glass of the night train when \n               the conductor gets his attention. When the conductor moves \n               on, Homer takes Angela's letter out of his breast pocket; he \n               skips ahead to the end.\n\n                                     ANGELA (V.O.)\n                         Dr. Larch often wondered how the \n                         world was treating you.\n\n               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - GRAVEYARD - AFTERNOON\n\n                                     ANGELA (V.O.)\n                         He talked a lot about you, hoping \n                         you would be of use, whatever you \n                         were up to.\n\n               Angela and Buster and Mary Agnes and Edna carry Larch's \n               coffin; they set it down by the raw hole. The pile of fresh \n               dirt stands out against the new snow; the hole is black \n               against the new white.\n\n                                     EDNA (O.S.)\n                         \"Oh, Lord, support us all the day \n                         long...\"\n\n               We see the wheelbarrow with the gravestone.\n\n                                     EDNA (O.S.)\n                         \"...until the shadows lengthen and \n                         the evening comes, and the busy world \n                         is hushed, and the fever of life is \n                         over, and our work is done.\"\n\n               INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT\n\n               We see the faces of the girls praying for Larch (Mary Agnes, \n               too) as Edna finishes her favorite prayer.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         \"Then, in Thy mercy grant us a safe \n                         lodging, and a holy rest, and peace \n                         at the last.\"\n\n               INT. MOVING TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT\n\n               Camera closes on Homer, sleeping to the sound of the rocking \n               train. Angela's letter lies in his lap.\n\n                                     THE GIRLS (O.S.)\n                         Amen! Amen! Amen!\n\n               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - EARLY MORNING\n\n               The train stops, blowing snow. Homer steps off the train \n               carrying a suitcase and Dr. Larch's bag. The disapproving \n               stationmaster is still disapproving. Music plays Over, \n               something triumphant.\n\n               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - THE HILL - EARLY MORNING\n\n               Homer makes his way up the hill toward the orphanage. Music \n               Over.\n\n               EXT. ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING\n\n               Edna is breaking up fights; this time, instead of fighting \n               over snowballs, the orphans are fighting over their pumpkins. \n               Suddenly Homer tops the brow of the hill and they all see \n               him. Buster is the first to catch sight of Homer; he runs \n               toward him. Mary Agnes also sees Homer; she immediately turns \n               away and runs inside. Music FADES OUT Over.\n\n               INT. LAVATORY - EARLY MORNING\n\n               Mary Agnes crashes into the bathroom and stumbles up to the \n               mirror; she starts to fix herself up with shaking hands.\n\n               INT. ORPHANAGE, FRONT HALL - EARLY MORNING\n\n               Everyone has heard the news; they come on the run. The \n               children flock around Homer, hugging him. Homer takes Angela \n               and Edna in his arms. Mary Agnes joins the group. Homer takes \n               in how changed, how attractive she is. They smile awkwardly \n               at each other.\n\n               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - EVENING\n\n               Homer's suitcase is open on the bed; we see Homer's hands as \n               he begins to unpack. Smaller hands reach in and root through \n               the clothes.\n\n                                     CURLY (O.S.)\n                         Did you bring something for me?\n\n               Curly continues his search. Homer thinks for a second; then \n               reaches into his pocket and pulls out the piece of pale-green \n               glass.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         You know what? I did.\n\n               Homer hands the piece of glass to Curly.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         It's from the ocean. It's for you.\n\n               Curly is duly impressed; he walks away to examine his new \n               treasure. Homer continues unpacking. He pulls his X ray out \n               and puts it aside.\n\n                                     BUSTER\n                         What are you doing here?\n\n               Homer turns to see Buster, Mary Agnes, Angela, and Edna in \n               the doorway.\n\n                                     MARY AGNES\n                         We made up a room for you.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         Wouldn't you be more comfortable by \n                         yourself?\n\n               Homer smiles; he nods.\n\n               Angela and Mary Agnes start to put Homer's things back in \n               his bag. Edna picks up the X ray and looks at it with a somber \n               expression.\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         Homer, do you know what this is?\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Sure. It's my heart.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                              (shakes her head)\n                         Actually, it's Fuzzy's. There's \n                         nothing wrong with your heart.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Fuzzy's?!\n\n                                     EDNA\n                         Dr. Larch wanted to keep you out of \n                         the war, Homer--that's why he did \n                         it. That's why he told you it was \n                         yours.\n\n               Homer is stunned; he puts his hand to his heart.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         I think he worried about his own \n                         heart. He said it would never stand \n                         up to Homer Wells going off to war.\n\n               Homer takes that in; he nods. Mary Agnes touches him \n               sympathetically.\n\n               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n               Homer looks at his fake diplomas; they are now framed and \n               hanging on the office wall. Homer surveys the office, as if \n               for the first time; he sits down in the desk chair, as if \n               slowly getting used to his new position.\n\n               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT\n\n               Homer reads to the boys from \"David Copperfield\". While his \n               voice is strong--positive, optimistic, certainly reassuring \n               to the boys--there is in the conclusion of the chapter \n               something that distracts him. He seems to hesitate; he misses \n               a line or two, and perhaps he purposely skips one or two \n               others. (Possibly Homer's eyes wander ahead, to the title of \n               the next chapter: \"I Make Another Beginning.\")\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         \"Thus I began my new life, in a new \n                         name, and with everything new about \n                         me... I felt... like one in a dream... \n                         The remembrance of that life is \n                         fraught with so much... want of \n                         hope...

Let's mot \n                         give the story away.\n\n               Homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar \n               semi-darkness. Seconds, later, the closed door to the hall \n               is flung open, flooding the room with light from the hall, \n               and Homer, dressed in his long white laboratory coat and \n               looking every inch the doctor, delivers his best imitation \n               of Larch's popular blessing.\n\n                                     HOMER\n                         Good night, you Princes of Maine! \n                         You Kings of New England!\n\n               On Copperfield and Steerforth and Curly as the door to the \n               hall is closed and semi-darkness prevails in the room again. \n               Copperfield, smiling, shuts his eyes. After a second, the \n               wide-eyed Steerforth shuts his eyes, too. Then Curly.\n\n               The last to close his eyes is Buster.\n\n                                                             FADE TO BLACK:\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCider House Rules, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0John Irving\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:31.668452"}
