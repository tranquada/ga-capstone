A HUGELY PREGNANT WOMAN \n               arrives at the same time. They stand awkwardly next to each \n               other, waiting for someone to answer the door.

He said it would never stand \n                         up to Homer Wells going off to war.\n\n               Homer takes that in; he nods. Mary Agnes touches him \n               sympathetically.\n\n<b>               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Homer looks at his fake diplomas; they are now framed and \n               hanging on the office wall. Homer surveys the office, as if \n               for the first time; he sits down in the desk chair, as if \n               slowly getting used to his new position.\n\n<b>               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Homer reads to the boys from \"David Copperfield\". While his \n               voice is strong--positive, optimistic, certainly reassuring \n               to the boys--there is in the conclusion of the chapter \n               something that distracts him. He seems to hesitate; he misses \n               a line or two, and perhaps he purposely skips one or two \n               others. (Possibly Homer's eyes wander ahead, to the title of \n               the next chapter: \"I Make Another Beginning.\")\n\n<b>                                     HOMER\n</b>                         \"Thus I began my new life, in a new \n                         name, and with everything new about \n                         me... I felt... like one in a dream... \n                         The remembrance of that life is \n                         fraught with so much... want of \n                         hope...

Let's mot \n                         give the story away.\n\n               Homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar \n               semi-darkness. Seconds, later, the closed door to the hall \n               is flung open, flooding the room with light from the hall, \n               and Homer, dressed in his long white laboratory coat and \n               looking every inch the doctor, delivers his best imitation \n               of Larch's popular blessing.\n\n<b>                                     HOMER\n</b>                         Good night, you Princes of Maine! \n                         You Kings of New England!\n\n               On Copperfield and Steerforth and Curly as the door to the \n               hall is closed and semi-darkness prevails in the room again. \n               Copperfield, smiling, shuts his eyes. After a second, the \n               wide-eyed Steerforth shuts his eyes, too. Then Curly.\n\n               The last to close his eyes is Buster.\n\n<b>                                                             FADE TO BLACK:\n</b>\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b>\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Cider-House-Rules,-The.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Cider House Rules, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=John Irving\" title=\"Scripts by John Irving\">John Irving</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Cider House Rules, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Cider House Rules, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:02:08.179304"}
