The lone bagpiper stops and an officer on TRUMPET\nbegins playing \"Taps.\" The coffin is slowly lowered.\n\n\n<b>FULL SCREEN - TV MONITOR\n</b>\nFinally: the film that Storm shot that night seven years\nago on the wharf. Spliced with the audiotape -- with\nsubtitles including each speaker's name to make every\nword and identity clear. We see:\n\nThe two Shadow Men step from the station wagon. The\n\"pushed\" film clearly reveals them to be Trent and Holland.\nWe see them conspire with Calabrese and Vitale.\n\n<b>                           CALABRESE (V.O.)\n</b>            Murder is a serious business, my\n            friend.

The nightly news is being broadcast:\nwhat we see on this monitor is simultaneously going out\nover the air.\n\nAs the SHOT WIDENS and TRAVERSES, we begin to see the\nactual news set -- including Esposito who got his well-\ndeserved scoop -- and other anchorpeople, crewmen, etc.\n\n<b>                          CALABRESE (V.O.)\n</b>           All I'm counseling is a little\n           patience.

The TV\nmonitor passes OUT OF FRAME, SOUND goes DOWN, we're MOVING\nPAST the news set and its occupants (who are readying to\ngo back on-camera as soon as the wharf tape ends) and on\n<b>UP TOWARD --\n</b>\n\n<b>LIGHTS ABOVE NEWS SET\n</b>\nwhich now FILL the FRAME -- bright and blinding. The\nscreen starts to bleach out ... it goes white and\n\n\n<b>MATCH CUT - SUN (MARINA DEL REY)\n</b>\nabove a perfect peaceful sea. A small powerboat (the\nkind that you rent from the dock) moves INTO FRAME. Storm\nsteers it, standing up. Andy and Sonny in the back cockpit\nseat.\n\n\n<b>IN ANDY'S LAP - PORTABLE TV\n</b>\nShe switches a channel: up comes the same footage we just\nsaw on the news set.\n\n\n<b>ANDY\n</b>\nIt takes a beat before she realizes what it is.

He sits (letting the boat drift\nwherever it wants to) and tugs Andy down beside him.\n\nThen he reaches across to his son, pulls the boy to him\nwith a playful headlock.\n\nFor a moment both Andy and Sonny are held in suspension,\nwondering what Storm will do or say.\n\nFinally:\n\n<b>                          STORM\n</b>                  (to Sonny)\n           Knock, knock.\n\nFor a beat, the boy is taken aback.
