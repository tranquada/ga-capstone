COMMERCIAL PIER - NIGHT\n\nThe limousine  slowly moves   up beside a stand-alone shack\nnear the edge  of the wharf.    The shack is an open shelter\nwith a broad  overhang, and   various kinds of equipment\nstored inside  it. A single    bulb illuminates it.

Calabrese,\nby contrast, is clearly older, more circumspect.\n\n                          CALABRESE\n           Slowly ... slowly.

The\nblow is so devastating it knocks Mikey's feet out from\nunder him so that he topples face-forward into Storm's\narms, out cold. Storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to\nthe ground.\n\nStorm shakes a sore hand and notices it's cut. Kneeling\ndown to the outstretched heap, he finds the cause of his\ninjury -- one of Mikey's teeth wiggles freely in his\nfingers.

Somebody hand me a cue.\n\nThere is a brief moment of hesitation and a look of\ndisbelief between the boys and then, BOOM! Ford tries to\nhand Storm a pool cue as if Storm's head is a baseball\nand the cue is a bat. This doesn't work very well, as\nStorm enters and simultaneously grabs Ford's cue, using\nhis momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the\npool table. We hear Ford's SKULL CRACK and he goes down.\n\nAlmost instantly another pool cue in Jones's hands slashes\ntoward Storm's head. This time Storm has his own tool --\nand takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect\nwith his head.\n\nHe again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as\nsoon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the back\nof Jones's skull with so much force we hear the NECK SNAP\nat the same time the cue splinters in half! Storm is\nleft with the jagged tip of the skinny end.\n\nDunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch\nat the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher\nknife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table.\nStorm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's\nmidsection.

He's swinging like\nmaniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the\nAIR.\n\nBut he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the poker\naway from him.\n\nThey are like two vicious cats whirling.

Instantly a figure leaps out. Storm\ngently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen\neye to eye.\n\n\nSTORM AND TRENT\n\nStorm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then\nviolently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning his\nchest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-off\nshotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight\ninto Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through the\nteeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up his\nmind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head.\n\nStorm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through\nthe house, shotgun still in his mouth.\n\n                         STORM\n          You know, Trent, I want to kill you\n          so bad I can barely contain myself.\n          But I keep thinking that death is\n          far too merciful a fate for you,\n          and that a nice petite white-bread\n          boy like you in a federal\n          penitentiary ...\n                 (pause)\n          -- let me put it this way -- I doubt\n          whether you could remain anal\n          retentive for very long.

About this time in their journey\nthrough the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's\nmangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared\nbefore, you should see him now.\n\nStorm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to\npick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last\nchance.\n\nTrent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth\nimpression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes\nflying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps\ninside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent\nand flips him backwards head-first into the fire.\n\nTrent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron\narrows of the fireplace.
