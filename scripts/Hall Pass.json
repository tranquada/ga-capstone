It basically states that\r\n          if you're constantly told you can't\r\n          do something, you want to do it\r\n          more than ever.

Horrible!\r\n\r\n                         ED\r\n\r\n                         (CALLING OUT)\r\n          I'm very disappointed, gentlemen!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          32.\r\n\r\n          INT. MINI-VAN - DAY\r\n\r\n          No one speaks. Grace drives and Maggie sits beside her,\r\n          humiliation etched across their faces. Finally:\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          Uh, anyone thinking chocolate chip\r\n          cookie dough in a waffle cone?\r\n          Grace YANKS the mini-van to the side of the road and GLARES\r\n\r\n          BACK AT HIM.\r\n\r\n                         GRACE\r\n          Large-mouth vaginas?!\r\n          As the guys cower, we\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. RICK & MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rick looks small and weak sitting on the couch while Maggie\r\n          stands across from him rubbing her temples. It looks like\r\n          the Norman Rockwell painting where the mom reprimands her\r\n          little boy for sneaking a frog into the house.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          You know what really troubles me?\r\n          The thing that you're all so\r\n          obsessed with is meaningless to\r\n          you. It's really just about numbers\r\n          with you guys.\r\n          Rick looks up, confused.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Rick, you can't even tel me the\r\n          month you lost your virginity. I\r\n          can tell you the exact day and hour\r\n          that I lost mine.\r\n          Rick seems a little embarrassed by this.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Well, virginity is different for\r\n          guys.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          The point is, obviously I like sex,\r\n          too--it means something to me--but\r\n          I don't walk around gawking at\r\n          every guy I see.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          All right, so I occasionally notice\r\n          other women. I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          Occasionally?\r\n          Rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come\r\n          clean.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          33.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Okay, you want the truth? You\r\n          really want me to pull back the\r\n          curtain here? From the moment I\r\n          leave the house in the morning 'til\r\n          the moment I get home, I pretty\r\n          much notice every woman in my path.\r\n          Maggie turns to face him.\r\n\r\n                         RICK (CONT'D)\r\n          But it's not how you think it is,\r\n          Mags. It's like... it's like a\r\n          curse. I don't want to notice, but\r\n          I can't help it. It's always been\r\n          like that. I figured that when I\r\n          c jot married that would be it, but\r\n          it wasn't--the thing,doesn't give\r\n          two shits about marriage.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n\r\n                         (HURT)\r\n          So what are you saying--you're not\r\n          happy with our sex life?\r\n          Rick reaches up and takes her hand.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          No. Of course I'm happy, honey--our\r\n          sex life is great--not that I\r\n          wouldn't mind a little more, but--\r\n          look, one thing has nothing to do\r\n          with the other. I think about sex a\r\n          lot--all guys do--that's just the\r\n          way it is.\r\n          Maggie sits down beside him, clearly at the end of her rope.\r\n          No one speaks for a few moments. Then:\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          I'm giving you a hall pass.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          A what?\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          One week off from marriage.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          You mean, like a trial separation?\r\n          You are seriously overreacting.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          It's not a separation, it's a hall\r\n          pass. You can do whatever you want.\r\n          Get it out of your system.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Wait a minute--are you for real?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          34.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          It's not a yes or no offer, and\r\n          it's not a debate. You're getting a\r\n          hall pass.\r\n          As Maggie heads upstairs, we PUSH IN on a confused Rick.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S KITCHEN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Maggie is washing out a pan at the sink when Rick ENTERS\r\n          dressed for work. We hear the O.S. SOUNDS of The Wiggles\r\n          coming from a TV in another room.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          'Morning.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          (not facing him)\r\n          There's a couple hard-boiled eggs\r\n          in a bowl there for you.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          I'm gonna have to take them to go,\r\n          hon, I've got a showing in fifteen\r\n          minutes.\r\n          Rick puts the eggs in his pocket, then approaches Maggie and\r\n          kisses her on the cheek.\r\n\r\n                         RICK (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey, about this hall pass\r\n          business.. .1 don't want it and I\r\n          don't need it.

VICTORIAN HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\n          This is a big shiny place. All fixed-up. Fred pulls up in\r\n          his mini-van and gets out.

As Fred\r\n          continues to POUND HIMSELF TO THE MUSIC, Officer #2 climbs\r\n          out of the cruiser. He takes out his flashlight and SHINES\r\n          IT ON FRED'S O.S. LAP.

Would it be the\r\n          girl he checked out on the way into\r\n          the party? Or would it be Missy\r\n          Frankenfield--because I noticed him\r\n          gawking at her? Or how about one of\r\n          the waitresses, or maybe somebody\r\n          he saw at work that day? Then when\r\n          he came into the room, I did\r\n          something I'd never done before: I\r\n          pretended to be asleep.\r\n\r\n                         GRACE\r\n          You're kidding me?

Suddenly there's a LOUD TAP on the\r\n          window and Rick looks over to see Flats (who we met at Rick's\r\n          poker night) standing outside with a shit-eating grin. Rick\r\n          rolls down the window.\r\n\r\n                         FLATS\r\n          Hey, Rick.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n\r\n                         (STARTLED)\r\n          Oh...hey, Flats.

How's\r\n          that hall pass thing going?\r\n          Rick makes a Scooby Doo sound, alarmed.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Who told you about that--was it Hog-\r\n          head?\r\n\r\n                         FLATS\r\n          No. Some old lady was yakking about\r\n          it down at the post office.\r\n          Rick REACTS to this.\r\n\r\n                         FLATS (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (BIG SMILE)\r\n          So what's the deal--you getting\r\n          laid?\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n\r\n                         (DEFENSIVE)\r\n          What? No.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          75.\r\n\r\n                         RICK (CONT'D)\r\n          I don't know where you're getting\r\n          your information, Flats, but a hall\r\n          pass isn't just about getting laid,\r\n          it's about getting a week off from\r\n          marriage to do as you please--\r\n          whether that be fishing, or\r\n          watching TV, whatever it is that\r\n          relaxes you.\r\n\r\n                         FLATS\r\n\r\n                         (DUBIOUS)\r\n          Oh, I didn't know that.\r\n          Just then Rick NOTICES Leigh (dressed in work-out clothes)\r\n          walking down the sidewalk toward the gym.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Uh, Flatsy, I gotta run. I'm late\r\n          for my work-out appointment.\r\n          When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym\r\n          shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt. He hesitates, then\r\n          grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS\r\n          WAIST. Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh.\r\n\r\n                         RICK (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey, girl!\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n\r\n                         (SMILING)\r\n          All right! You decided to go for\r\n          it.\r\n          As Rick follows Leigh into the gym, a smiling Flats CALLS\r\n\r\n                         OUT:\r\n\r\n                         FLATS\r\n          Hey, Rick! Good luck with the\r\n          fishing!\r\n          As Flats begins to LAUGH, a sheepish Rick scurries into the\r\n          building.\r\n\r\n          INT. FITNESS FIRM HEALTH CLUB - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Rick and Leigh stand at the front desk. A young, buff dude,\r\n          CLYDE, looks up from folding towels.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          Clyde, this is my friend, uh...\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Rick.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          He's looking to join.\r\n\r\n                         CLYDE\r\n          Great. I'll get you signed up.\r\n          Leigh pats Rick's hand.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          See ya.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          76.\r\n          She turns to leave.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          So, uh, are you gonna grab a\r\n          brewski after your work-out?\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          Nah.\r\n          Rick looks disappointed.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm gonna grab two.\r\n          Leigh flashes him a smile and as she walks away, she gives\r\n          him the peace sign. He returns it.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Peace it!\r\n          As soon as he hears himself, Rick cringes.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          CLOSE ON RICK'S FACE - he's wearing the headphones and has\r\n          worked up a PRETTY GOOD SWEAT.\r\n          PULL BACK to reveal that he's SITTING ON THE TOILET.\r\n\r\n          INT. HEALTH CLUB - MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          We hear a FLUSH. Rick shuffles out of a stall and moves to a\r\n          sink. While he washes his hands, a young, NAKED, METROSEXUAL-\r\n          TYPE whips his leg into the sink beside him. Rick slowly\r\n          turns to look.\r\n          RICK'S POV - as the Metrosexual talks to ANOTHER NAKED MAN,\r\n          he fills his hand with SHAVING CREAM and the hand DISAPPEARS\r\n          BETWEEN HIS OWN LEGS. The guys continue their conversation,\r\n          unfazed. Then the Metrosexual starts to SHAVE HIS BALLS.\r\n          As Rick dries his hands, he can't contain himself.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          What's that about--you swimming the\r\n          English Channel?\r\n          The Metrosexual shoots Rick an annoyed look.\r\n\r\n                         METROSEXUAL\r\n          Nah, Just not into looking like the\r\n          knuckle-dragging guy on the\r\n          evolution-of-man chart.\r\n          Off Rick looking self-consciously down at his fur-covered\r\n          body, we go...\r\n\r\n          INT. HOT TUB ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          Rick ENTERS the empty hot tub room, takes off his towel, and\r\n          eases into the STEAMING WATER. He hits a button and the jets\r\n          kick on FULL BLAST, turning the hot tub into a BUBBLY\r\n\r\n          CAULDRON.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          77.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Oh...yes.\r\n          He bunches up his towel and puts it behind his head, then\r\n          settles in and CLOSES HIS EYES.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          SAME SCENE - LATER\r\n          Rick is in a DEEP SLEEP. His mouth is wide open but his head\r\n          is BARELY ABOVE WATER as he SNORES LOUDLY. He dips beneath\r\n          the surface and as he begins to CHOKE and COUGH, he wakes up.\r\n          Rick takes a moment to get his bearings, then STRUGGLES to\r\n          get out of the hot tub. But his MUSCLES HAVE TURNED TO JELLY.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n\r\n                         (WEAKLY)\r\n          Little help...\r\n          When none comes, a life-and-death STRUGGLE ensues as the\r\n          flabby, middle-aged dad tries to climb to safety.\r\n\r\n                         RICK (CONT'D)\r\n          Help ...me...\r\n          Just as Rick starts to go under, the two young naked\r\n          metrosexuals hear his MOANS and come to his rescue. They\r\n          jump in the hot tub and heave him ashore. As Rick GASPS for\r\n          air, one of the metrosexuals kneels down and lifts Rick's\r\n          head onto his NAKED LAP.\r\n\r\n                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #1\r\n          Are you having chest pains, sir?\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n\r\n                         (WINDED)\r\n          No, no, I think I was...in the hot\r\n          tub too long. I can't feel my body.\r\n\r\n                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #2\r\n          How long were you in there?\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          What time is it?\r\n\r\n                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #2\r\n          Seven-thirty.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          About three hours.\r\n          That's when Rick realizes that his head is RESTING ON THE\r\n          GUY'S COCK. He tries to roll off him, but Metrosexual #1\r\n\r\n          HOLDS HIM TIGHT.\r\n\r\n                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #1\r\n          Try not to move, sir.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          I'm okay, just help me up.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          78.\r\n\r\n                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #1\r\n\r\n                         (TO METROSEXUAL #2)\r\n          All right, give him a hand.\r\n          Metrosexual #2 straddles Rick's chest and leans down to pull\r\n          him up. As Rick starts to rise, HIS FACE COMES PERILOUSLY\r\n          CLOSE TO THE SECOND MAN'S O.S. DANGLING COCK and Rick has to\r\n\r\n          TURN HIS HEAD TO AVOID CONTACT.\r\n          They finally get Rick to his feet. As the naked men help him\r\n          across the room, we\r\n          ANGLE ON - two TANNED, HAIRLESS METROSEXUAL ASSES flanking\r\n          Rick's HIRSUTE BUTT.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Okay, thanks, guys. I can take it\r\n          from here.\r\n          The metrosexuals release Rick and he gets about two steps\r\n          before his LEGS GIVE OUT and he TUMBLES DOWN A SMALL FLIGHT\r\n\r\n          OF STEPS.\r\n\r\n          SMASH CUT TO:\r\n          Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER:\r\n\r\n                         DAY 6\r\n\r\n          INT.

So what's this big emergency?\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. By 'emergency' I\r\n          just meant that there's some\r\n          important stuff I want to talk to\r\n          you about. You know, one on one, me\r\n          and you--without all the husbands\r\n          and wives and hoopla. So how are\r\n          you?\r\n\r\n                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD\r\n          I'm... good.\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          No, I mean how-are-you. Inside.\r\n          What's happenin' in there? There\r\n          must be all sorts of emotions\r\n          churning up with the divorce and\r\n          everything.\r\n          She gives him a long look.\r\n\r\n                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD\r\n          Maybe we should go somewhere else--\r\n          this doesn't seem like the best\r\n          place to spill one's guts.\r\n          Just then, Coakley swoops in and pulls Fred aside.\r\n\r\n                         COAKLEY\r\n\r\n                         (UNDER BREATH)\r\n          What part of 'go ugly early' didn't\r\n          you understand? You've got a better\r\n          chance of winning husband-of-the-\r\n          year than tagging that chiquita.\r\n          Fred flinches at this.\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          But...I know her.

She's not insane, she's\r\n          just making really poor decisions\r\n          right now.\r\n          (hands him his car keys)\r\n          Here, give Rick the keys to my mini-\r\n          van.

I had a little chest\r\n          cramp during the last song, but I\r\n          worked through it.\r\n          She smiles at this.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          Come on, let's sit this one out. I\r\n          need a breather.\r\n          They move to the bar and Rick starts DRYING HIMSELF with a\r\n          stack of cocktail napkins.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH (CONT'D)\r\n          So what's up with the ring?\r\n          He looks at his finger, then back at her.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Um...have you ever heard of a hall\r\n          pass?\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT.

She hears MUSIC\r\n          coming from inside and hesitates a BEAT before walking\r\n          nervously onto the porch and KNOCKING. A moment later Gerry\r\n          appears in the doorway.\r\n\r\n                         GERRY\r\n          There she is! Come on in, I'm\r\n          mixing up some margaronis.

Gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned.\r\n\r\n                         GERRY (CONT'D)\r\n          Is everything okay?\r\n\r\n                         GRACE\r\n          Yeah, yeah, everything's fine,\r\n          but...\r\n          (holds up gift box)\r\n          .I can't accept this.\r\n\r\n                         GERRY\r\n          Why not?\r\n          Grace does a double-take.\r\n\r\n                         GRACE\r\n          Gerry, I'm a married woman.\r\n          Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt. She hands him the\r\n          box and he reluctantly accepts it.\r\n\r\n                         GERRY\r\n          Um... I'm sorry if I made you\r\n          uncomfortable, Grace. It's just\r\n          that...I really like you.\r\n\r\n                         GRACE\r\n          I like you, too, Gerry, and you\r\n          didn't make me uncomfortable.\r\n          She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's\r\n          some serious eye-contact, and then BAM!\r\n          They DIVE AT EACH OTHER and start SUCKING FACE LIKE THERE'S\r\n          NO TOMORROW. As they continue to MAUL EACH OTHER, they\r\n          STUMBLE INTO THE HOUSE, and we\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          INT.

We're here with them.\r\n          He nods toward RICK LEARY and WILLY BOSHANE, both early 40's\r\n          and paunchy.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          What are you talking about?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          104.\r\n\r\n                         BAKER\r\n          When Leary and Boshane heard about\r\n          your guy's hall pass, they\r\n          convinced their wives to give them\r\n          one, too.\r\n          A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having none\r\n          of it. He turns to Baker, livid.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          You weren't supposed to tell anyone\r\n          about the hall pass!\r\n\r\n                         LEARY\r\n          They didn't say anything. Our wives\r\n          heard about it at the pool.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          No! At the pool?!\r\n          Rick rubs his face, distressed.\r\n\r\n                         BOSHANE\r\n          Yep. And then about three days ago--\r\n          after some hard-core negotiating--\r\n          we managed to push the bill\r\n          through.\r\n          The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Really? So...how's it going?\r\n\r\n                         BOSHANE\r\n          Solid. Very solid.\r\n\r\n                         LEARY\r\n          We're building mucho momentumo.\r\n          Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION.\r\n\r\n                         LEARY (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (ANNOYED)\r\n          Hey, Baker, a hall pass ain't just\r\n          about sex, you know.\r\n\r\n                         BOSHANE\r\n          That's right. It's about going\r\n          bowling and, uh, staying up late,\r\n          and being able to do what you want\r\n          to do when you want to do it.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Haven't gotten laid yet, huh?\r\n\r\n                         BOSHANE\r\n\r\n                         (DISPIRITED)\r\n          It's a lot tougher than we thought\r\n          it would be.\r\n          Just then Gary comes around a corner.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          105.\r\n\r\n                         GARY\r\n          Hey, dudes, there's like ten very\r\n          bangable chicks out on the back\r\n          deck--let's go!\r\n          Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER.\r\n\r\n                         LEARY\r\n          To freedom!\r\n          The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck.\r\n          A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and\r\n          pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he\r\n          OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITH\r\n\r\n          LEIGH.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          Hey, where are you going?\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          What are you doing...? I thought\r\n          you'd left.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          No. I told you, I just had to talk\r\n          him off the ledge. I calmed him\r\n          down and sent him on his way.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Oh. Uh, great.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          So where's that game room? I\r\n          thought we were gonna play some\r\n          games.\r\n          She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go...\r\n\r\n          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rick and Leigh walk down the hall to the game room. He opens\r\n          the door and flips on the light.\r\n          THEIR POV - there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a\r\n          bar, and a bed.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          I'll be right back--I just have to\r\n          use the bathroom.\r\n          Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears\r\n          into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it.\r\n          Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the\r\n          hallway and pushes open a door.\r\n\r\n          COAKLEY (O.S.)\r\n          Hey.\r\n          REVERSE ANGLE reveals Coakley SITTING ALL ALONE in a small\r\n          study off the hall. He has a bowl of Cap'n Crunch on his lap\r\n          and is watching a re-run of The Andy Griffith Show.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          106.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Hey. How come you're not downstairs\r\n          partying?\r\n          Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile.\r\n\r\n                         COAKLEY\r\n          All partied out, pal.\r\n          Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at the\r\n\r\n          TV.\r\n\r\n                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Man, that Barney Fife still kills\r\n          me.\r\n          He looks back to Rick.\r\n\r\n                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey, I was thinking about this hall-\r\n          pass business. It's really ironic,\r\n          isn't it?\r\n          Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          How's that?\r\n\r\n                         COAKLEY\r\n          Well think about it. There's two\r\n          kinds of guys who cheat on their\r\n          wives: The guy who does it behind\r\n          her back, and a guy like you who\r\n          has his wife's permission.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Well it's not really cheating if I\r\n          have permission.\r\n\r\n                         COAKLEY\r\n          Yeah, whatever. The point is, if\r\n          you asked a hundred people who the\r\n          better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em\r\n          would pick you, because you're\r\n          being honest--there's no deceit\r\n          involved.\r\n          Rick is growing uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          But the funny thing is, the other\r\n          guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he\r\n          has to live with all that guilt and\r\n          anxiety, while his wife's running\r\n          around happy as a clam because she\r\n          doesn't know anything. And you, the\r\n          good guy, you've got no guilt at\r\n          all because you just laid it all on\r\n          your wife's shoulders.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Well I didn't really think of it\r\n\r\n                         LIKE--\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          107.\r\n\r\n                         COAKLEY\r\n          It's like she's your guilt Sherpa!\r\n          Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates.\r\n\r\n                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Funny, huh?\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n\r\n                         (WEAKLY)\r\n          Yeah.\r\n\r\n                         COAKLEY\r\n          And that, my friend, is why you are\r\n          a genius.\r\n          As Rick lets this all sink in, we\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Paige's Aunt Meg is sitting on the couch. Her legs are\r\n          crossed revealing a lot of skin. Fred hands her a glass of\r\n          wine and sits beside her.\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          Cheers.\r\n          They CLINK glasses.\r\n\r\n                         AUNT MEG\r\n          Rick, I hope you don't mind me\r\n          tracking you down--Paige told me\r\n          where you were staying.\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          Please. Not at all.\r\n\r\n                         AUNT MEG\r\n          You've been very sweet to her.\r\n          Fred waves her off.\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          Hey, she's a good kid. I do what I\r\n          can for the kids.\r\n          Aunt Meg moves in a little closer, squints at him sweetly.\r\n\r\n                         AUNT MEG\r\n          She told me everything. And I have\r\n          to say, I was very impressed.\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          Hm?\r\n\r\n                         AUNT MEG\r\n          I know she tried to hook-up with\r\n          you--twice in fact--and that you\r\n          set her straight both times.\r\n          Fred hadn't heard this from Rick and is a little confused.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          108.\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          Uh...hook-up?\r\n\r\n                         AUNT MEG\r\n\r\n                         (SMILES)\r\n          Rick, enough with the chivalry.\r\n          Paige wanted to sleep with you and\r\n          you didn't take advantage of her.\r\n          I'm just saying that's very cool.\r\n          He shrugs modestly.\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          Well... she's a kid and kids get\r\n          crushes. I remember in tenth grade\r\n          I had the biggest crush on my\r\n          French teacher--thank God Mr.\r\n          LeClaire was professional enough to\r\n          only date seniors.\r\n          Meg GIGGLES.\r\n\r\n                         AUNT MEG\r\n          I'm serious, it takes a certain\r\n          kind of guy to say no to a\r\n          beautiful young girl like that--\r\n          especially since you have your\r\n          wi e's permission now.\r\n          Meg shoots him a knowing smile and puts her glass down.\r\n\r\n          AUNT MEG (CONT'D)\r\n          I like that, Rick. You have morals.\r\n          She leans in and KISSES HIS NECK. Fred glances down at her\r\n          breasts.\r\n\r\n                         FRED\r\n          Hey, all you have in this world is\r\n          your word.\r\n          As Aunt Meg CLIMBS ON TOP OF FRED, we\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - GAME ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rick ENTERS to find Leigh playing a pinball machine. Leigh\r\n          turns and smiles at Rick.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Leigh, I gotta split.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n\r\n                         (NERVOUS)\r\n          Yeah, I kind of hit a wall.\r\n          She can hardly believe her ears.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          109.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          Really? Are you feeling okay?\r\n          You're not mad because I went\r\n          outside with my friend, are you?\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          No, no, no. Look, I shouldn't be\r\n          doing this. I have.. .you know,\r\n          commitments.\r\n          Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her\r\n          DRESS FALLS TO THE FLOOR. Suddenly she's NAKED before him\r\n          and she's PERFECT.\r\n\r\n                         RICK (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (WEAKLY)\r\n          Um, you dropped something.\r\n          For a moment nobody moves. We can almost hear Rick's heart\r\n          beat. Then Leigh STEPS CLOSER to him and Rick instinctively\r\n          leans back.\r\n\r\n                         LEIGH\r\n          Relax. Don't think so much. You're\r\n          gonna have your wife for the rest\r\n          of your life, but tonight. . .you\r\n          have me.\r\n          Leigh smiles. And it's the kind of smile you only get two or\r\n          three times in your life, if you're lucky, and probably never\r\n          from a woman this beautiful.\r\n          She reaches down and UNBUCKLES HIS PANTS, then she PULLS OFF\r\n          HIS SHIRT.
