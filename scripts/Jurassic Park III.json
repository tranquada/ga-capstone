PACIFIC OCEAN \u0096 DAY\t1\n\n\tA speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the\n\tlooming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.\n\n\n2 \tEXT. BOAT - DAY \t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\n\n\tIllegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps\n\tAmericans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --\n\talready wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two-\n\tperson PARASAIL HARNESS.\n\n\n3 \tEXT. BOAT - DAY \t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\n\n\tBen and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over\n\tthe back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tYou make sure to get us as close as you can,\n\t\tokay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a \n\t\tlittle extra. \n\n\t\t\t\tENRIQUE\n\t\tDon't worry. I take you close. But not too \n\t\tclose.\n\t\t\t(rubbing Eric's head)\n\t\tYou don't want them to eat you.\n\n\tEnrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND\n\tWINCH bolted to the deck.\n\n\t\t\t\tENRIQUE (CONT'D)\n\t\tReady, amigos?\n\n\tBen and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the\n\tcamcorder to the record the action.\n\n\tEnrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the\n\tspeedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the \n\trolling ocean.\n\n\tStrapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing\n\twater, intently watching for Enrique's signal.\n\n\tAs the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.\n\n\tBen grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and\n\tEric braces themselves.\n\n\tEnrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls\n\tthe winch, Ben yanks the cord and - \n\n\tWOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,\n\thoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the\n\tparasail is stitched \"DINO-SOAR.\"\n\n\tTHE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.\n\n\tBEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.\n\n\tENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain \n\theight, he LOCKS OFF the reel.\n\n\tHigh overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet\n\tsplendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.\n\n\tDown below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.\n\n\tEric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the\n\tcamera.\n\n\tThen, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,\n\twhich now dangles from his neck.\n\n\t\t\t\tERIC\n\t\tWhat was that?\n\n\tA second tug...and now the faintest of screams.\n\n\tBen and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared\n\tinto the low bank of FOG.\n\n\tBy the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR\n\tIS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.\n\n\tAs Ben considers the driverless boat...\n\n\t\t\t\tERIC (CONT'D)\n\t\tBen!\n\n\tBen glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something \n\tbelow.

SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY \t\t\t\t\t4\n\n\tTWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied\n\tby a child's ferocious sounds.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHILD (O.S.)\n\n\t\tRRRRROW! GRRRRRR!\n\n\tWINDER TO REVEAL -\n\n\tCHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his\n\tfavorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and\n\twatches with great delight.\n\n\tELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a\n\tpicture of the perfect family.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tOh, actually, Charlie, those two are\n\t\therbivores. They wouldn't be interested in\n\t\tfighting each other. But these...\n\t\t\t(picking up two other dinosaurs)\n\t\tSee, these are carnivores. And this one here\n\t\t-- see its claws -- this one here uses its\n\t\tclaws to gouge at the throat of its opponent\u0085\n\n\tAs Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his\n\town, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\t\t(interrupting)\n\t\tUh, Alan?\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tHmm?\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tHe's three. Why don't you wait till he's a\n\t\tlittle older?\n\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tOh, right.\n\t\t\t(back to Charlie)\n\t\tHappy dinosaurs.\n\n\tHe bounces them along the sandbox edge.\n\n\tThen, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door\n\tSLAMMING is heard.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tThat must be Mark.\n\t\t\t(calling out)\n\t\tMark, we\u0092re back here!\n\n\tEllie and Grant turn to see --\n\nMARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,\n\tbalance demeanor.\n\n\tHe and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (CONT'D)\n\t\tGood day?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARK\n\t\tKeeping the world safe.\n\t\t\t(re: baby)\n\t\tHere, let me take her.\n\n\tEllie hands off the baby.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tMark, this is Alan Grant.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARK\n\t\tNice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about\n\t\tyou.\n\n\tThe two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant\n\twho is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to\n\this father, showing his dinosaur.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tDaddy, this is a herbabore.\n\n\tGrant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.\n\n\n5 \tINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \t\t\t\t\t5\n\n\tWINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing \nthe bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tWhat's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my\n\t\tname Alan? Say my name.\n\n\t\tThe bird doesn't respond.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT (CONT'D)\n\t\tHe used to know me.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tSorry, Alan it's been six years.\n\n\tGrant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.\n\tThe three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The\n\tThe children have been out to bed.\n\n\tAn awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --\n\n\t\t\t\tMARK\n\t\tMore coffee?\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\t\t(relived)\n\t\tYes. Great.\n\n\tMark stands and collects their cups.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (CONT'D)\n\t\tSo, Mark's working at the State Department\n\t\tnow.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tReally? \n(To Mark)\nWhat do you do there?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARK\n\t\t\t(with mock bravado)\n\t\tI could tell you about it, but than I'd have to\n\t\tkill you.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tIndeed.\n\n\tMark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another\n\tuncomfortable silence.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\tSo what are you working on now?\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\n\tWe have a new site in Montana. At least until\n\tthe money runs out.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tAnything good?\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tRaptors, mostly.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tMy favorite.\n\n\tGrant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he\n\tcan talk to about this.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tYou remember the sounds they made?\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tI try not to.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tWe've done cranial scans, and raptors\n\t\tactually had a quite sophisticated\n\t\tresonating chamber. I have a theory that\n\t\ttheir ability to vocalize is the key to their\n\t\tsocial intelligence. The way they can work\n\t\ttogether as a team.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tYou think they could talk to each other?\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tTo a degree we never imagined.\n\n\tAnd from the cage in the corner of the room...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tBullshit!\n\n\tBoth look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tYou taught him that.\n\n\n6 \tEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT \t\t\t\t\t6\n\n\tEllie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the\n\tdriveway.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tGood luck with the fund raising.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tIt was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,\n\t\tyou could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils\n\t\tare out. Everyone wants to see a real live\n\t\tdinosaur.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tTimes change Alan. But you're the still the\n\t\tbest. I mean that.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tThe last of my breed.\n\n\tA long moment passes between them as both consider where\n\tthey've ended up.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT (CONT'D)\n\t\tI'd better get going.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tLet me know if I can help, Alan. You\u0092re bad\n\t\tabout asking for help, but please ask me.\n\t\tAnything, anytime.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\t\t(deep down knowing he never\n\t\t\t will)\n\t\tOkay. Goodbye, Ellie.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\tGoodbye, Alan.\n\n\tNot sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with\n\ta friendly hug. They keep it short.\n\n\tGrant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.\n\n\tHe's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls\n\tit down.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE (CONT'D)\n\t\tWhen I met you, I thought that one day\n\t\tmillions of years ago, all the dinosaurs\n\t\tbecame extinct. Wiped out. But you told me\n\t\totherwise. When conditions changed,\n\t\tdinosaurs changed. They became other things.\n\t\tThey evolved.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tA well-accepted theory.\n\n\t\t\t\tELLIE\n\t\t\t(simply)\n\t\tAlan don't be afraid to evolve.\n\n\tGrant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.\n\tA forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.\n\n\tEllie watches as he drives off.\n\n\n7 \tINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \t\t\t\t\t\t7\n\n\tThe last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public\n\tlecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and\n\tSTUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with\n\tcostumes.\n\n\tGrant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some\n\tATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This\n\twasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.\n\n\tA new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tIt's through the painstaking study of the\n\t\tInterior chamber in multiple specimens that\n\t\twe can determine this exciting correlation\n\t\tbetween the larynx and the upper plate. That\n\t\tlets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that\n\t\tthe raptor might have been capable of bird-\n\t\tlike vocalizations. Which as you can\n\t\timagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.\n\n\tHe's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the\n\tSYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of\n\tAPPLAUSE.\n\n\t\t\t\tSYMPOSTIUM LEADER\n\t\tThank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does\n\t\tanyone have a question?\n\n\tNearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tDoes anyone have a question that doesn't \n\t\trelate to Jurassic Park?\n\n\tQuite a few hands go down.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT (cont'd)\n\t\tOr the incident in San Diego, which I'll\n\t\tremind you, I did not witness.\n\n\tNow most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few\n\tremaining...\n\n\t\t\t\tMALE STUDENT\n\t\tYour theory on raptors is good and all, but\n\t\tisn't all this conjecture kind of moot?\n\n\tThe STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.\n\n\t\t\t\tMALE STUDENT (CONT'D)\n\t\tI mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and\n\t\teveryone decides how to handle the second\n\t\tisland, scientist will just go in and look\n\t\tfor themselves.\n\n\t\t\t\tTOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER\n\t\tIsn't paleontology itself in danger of\n\t\textinction?\n\n\tRecognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is\n\tabout to step in. But Grant will take this himself.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tNo, and let me be perfectly clear on this\n\t\tpoint. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.\n\t\tWhat's left of them is fossilized in stone\n\t\tthe actual scientists spend years to\n\t\tundercover.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   (MORE)\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT (CONT'D)\n\t\twhat John Hammond and InGen created are\n\t\ttheme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing\n\t\tless.\n\n\t\tThe class clearly disagrees with his assessment.\n\n\t\t\t\tANOTHER STUDENT\n\t\tYou're saying you wouldn't want to study\n\t\tthem if you had the chance?\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tNo force on this earth or in heaven could get me on\n\t\tthat island.\n\n\n8 \tINT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY \t\t\t\t\t8\n\n\tLooking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we\n\tsee someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the\n\tglass.\n\n\n9 \tEXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY \t\t\t\t\t9\n\n\tNASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is\n\tpainting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he\n\ttosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly\n\taway from the plane.\n\n\tWe now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It\n\tlooks absurdly like some angry beast.\n\n\tWe are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft\n\tgraveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.\n\n\tWe hear a phone RINGING...\n\n\n10 \tINT.

I'll lock it down as\n\t\tsoon as you drop me the payment.\n\n\tWith the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the\n\tcraft...\n\n\n11 \tEXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY \t\t\t\t\t       11\n\n\tUdesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.\n\n\tCooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He\n\tfinishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's\n\taimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.\n\n\t\t\t\tUDESKY\n\t\tThat's right, two of the very best I could\n\t\tfind. No, I haven't worked with them\n\t\tpersonally, but they come with the highest\n\t\trecommendations.\n\n\tThen --\n\n\tCooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets\n\tinto the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.\n\n\tNash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tUDESKY (CONT'D)\n\t\tYou've got nothing to worry about, sir. This\n\t\tis going to be a piece of cake.\n\n\tPieces of the demolished craft come raining down.\n\n\n12 \tEXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY \t12\n\n\tCLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a\n\tdinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his\n\tsweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an\n\tassociate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.\n\n\tLooking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one\n\tof a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one\n\tmost smitten with her supervisor.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHERYL\n\t\tBilly? I don't think I'm doing this right.\n\n\tHe scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tYou need to go slowly. See, just take it little\n\t\tat a time.\n\n\tShe's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHERYL\n\t\tI can never tell what's bone and what's rock.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tTechnically, it's all rock. The calcium in the\n\t\tbones is replaced during fossilization. But\n\t\tyou can feel the difference. See? Rough,\n\t\tsmooth. Rough, smooth.\n\n\tHe runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing\n\ther. After a pause, she runs her finger along his\n\tstubbly chin...\n\n\t\t\t\tCHERYL\n\t\tRough.\n\n\t...and along his lips.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHERYL (cont'd)\n\t\tSmooth.\n\n\tBilly may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending\n\tit either. It's then that a\n\n\tSHADOW\n\n\tfalls across them.

Profitable?\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tWe'll be broke in four weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tThree weeks. I had to rent some equipment.\n\n\tThe cross into one of the tents, which only has two \"walls\". On\n\ta dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a\n\tstrange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps\n\tback and forth across a tray of fine sand.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tYou rented an automated litter box.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tIt's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan\n\t\tdata from the raptor skull, than the computer\n\t\tbreaks it into thousands of slices which this\n\t\tthing prints, one layer on top of the other.\n\t\tIt's the future of paleontology.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tNot if it can't dig.\n\n\tThe arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping\n\tthrough holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of \n\ta person's fist.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\tI give you a raptor's resonating chamber.\n\n\tGrant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the\n\tresult. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the\n\tremaining sand.\n\n\tBilly puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.\n\tThe resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an \n\tnon-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he\n\tuses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and\n\tvariations.\n\n\tIn the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.\n\n\tBilly looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of \t\n\ta Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the \t\t\n\ttent. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLY (cont'd) \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t(falsely casual) \t\t\t\t\t\n\t\tOh, I forgot to tell you.

Close behind, the raptor\n\tBURSTS into the room, ROARS.\n\n\tAs the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the\n\topen cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.\n\n\tGrant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can\n\tswing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS\n\tinto it, driving the door into the cage.\n\n\tThey are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a\n\tsmall triangle space by the advancing door. The angry\n\tRaptor is now inches away through the cage door.\n\n\tThen, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top\n\tof their triangular enclose is wide open.\n\n\tThe eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the\n\ttail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n\t\tPush!\n\n\tThey push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor\n\tright through the opening of the cage.\n\n\tNow the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door\n\tgoing right to the ceiling.\n\n\tAmanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,\n\ttemporarily trapping the dinosaur.\n\n\tThe raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but\n\tthe cage door seems to be holding.\n\n\tAs everyone rushes back to the door.\n\n\tThe raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.\n\n\tAs the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening\n\tto the beast's simple melodic cry.

To the group's dismay, they\n\tsoon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both\n\tdistant and near.\n\n\tGrant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his\n\ttheory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse\n\ttime.\n\n\tResponding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly\n\tflees across the open space.

Much to\n\this dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.\n\n\tIndeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors\n\tonly want them.\n\n\tIn the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.\n\n\tUp ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his\n\tcamera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's\n\talready back on his feet and running.\n\n\tAmanda and Paul keep close to each other.

This\n\ttime, Paul catchers her.\n\n\tBilly climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.\n\n\tUdesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds\n\thimself\n\n\tHEADED OFF\n\n\tby a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds\n\n\tTHERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.\n\n\tHe picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously\n\tapproach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio\n\tstops, peering at him.\n\n\tUdesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,\n\tanother raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his\n\tmuscles.

It's not easy, but you can move\n\tfrom branch to branch, tree to tree.\n\n\tON THE FLOOR\n\n\tUnable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.\n\tThe effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the\n\traptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.\n\n\tRather, they're \"talking\" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to\n\tfind him self still alive.\n\n\tSuddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's\n\tdelicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky\n\tCRIES OUT, louder this time.\n\n\tIN THE TREES\n\n\tHearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now\n\tfinally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely\n\tmoving but still MOANING.\n\n\tThe raptors are gone.\n\n\tIn the lead, Amanda starts to climb down.

Up in the branches, the survivors are\n\thorrified and sickened.\n\n\tThen, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY.

ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY\t\t\t\t69B\n\n\tClimbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing\n\tpack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally\n\treaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.\n\n\tLOOKING DOWN\n\n\tThe entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the\n\tcenter, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the\n\tcry, the other raptors CALL BACK.\n\n\tAs terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their\n\tcommunication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,\n\ta structure. They're clearly talking about something.\n\n\tUnder his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tWhat does that mean? What are you saying?\n\n\tOf course they can't answer. They just keep using the same\n\t\"phrase.\"\n\n\tReady to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --\n\the's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered\n\twith a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's\n\tthe source. It's oozing out the bottom.\n\n\tHe unzips the bag to find\n\n\tA BROKEN RAPTOR EGG\n\n\tinside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces\n\tof the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.\n\n\tThis is what the raptors where chasing.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT (CONT'D)\n\t\tGod damn you, Billy.\n\n\tEver the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of\n\tdanger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.\n\tThey suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT (CONT'D)\n\t\tIt means, \"Give us the egg,\" doesn't it? \"We\n\t\twant the egg.\"\n\n\tHe gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are\n\tinterested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means\n\tplacated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant\n\tdead.\n\n\tThey begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each\n\tother\u0092s backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.\n\n\tGrant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.\n\tAnd than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's\n\ton is starting to give in.\n\n\tHe looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be\n\ttheir next meal. And then,\n\n\tA SMALL CANISTER\n\n\tlands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick\n\tcloud of oily fog. It's the first of\n\n\tFIVE CANISTERS\n\n\tthat land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just\n\tsmoke though something far more caustic.\n\n\tAs it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest\n\tto the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.\n\tThere may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they\n\tseem panicked, disoriented.\n\n\tPack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take\n\toff running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet\n\tblindly.\n\n\tThis may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.\n\tUp in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor\n\tHe squints to see through the fog, where he spots\n\n\tA HUMAN SHAPE\n\n\tat the edge of the smoke\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tCome on!

Now well accustomed to fleeing on\n\tcommand, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding\n\tlike a jungle gym.\n\n\tAll the while, they're trying to spot Paul.\n\n\tGrant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as\n\tSpinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of\n\tthe crane.

So instead it\n\tRAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but\n\tAmanda catches him.\n\n\tAbout to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last\n\thope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he\n\tdecides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.\n\n\tHe blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On\n\tthe third try, he's able to approximate the \"egg\" cry he heard\n\tthe raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.\n\n\tSpinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be\n\tcoming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.\n\n\tWe can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane\n\twill tip.\n\n\tBut not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant\n\tstops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.\n\n\tHe keeps blowing.\n\n\tThe crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears\n\tfrom the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply\n\tbats away.\n\n\tBut then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are\n\tdozens gathering, circling.\n\n\tGrant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with\n\thorrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter\n\twhich side wins.\n\n\tLooking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly\n\tthe raptors attack.\n\n\tSpinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they\n\tjust keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with\n\ttheir razor-sharp claws.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT\n\t\tJump! Swim for the far shore!\n\n\tAll three drop from the crane arm into the water.\n\n\tMeanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking\n\toff many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their\n\thooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.\n\n\tSpinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally\n\tcollapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.\n\tThen one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors\n\tswimming away.\n\n\tBut a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to\n\tbite. It catches Grant's shoulder.\n\n\tGrant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes\n\tto bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.\n\tAs it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.\n\n\tThe entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the\n\tcreature\u0092s wings.\n\n\n110F\tINT.

The fibers break and fray, but\n\tthe pteranodon keeps coming closer.\n\n\tPaul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight\n\tin the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a\n\tlittle.\n\n\tGrant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when\n\tthe pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand.
