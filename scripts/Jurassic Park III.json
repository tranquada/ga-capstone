Ben lifts the\n\tcamcorder to the record the action.\n\n\tEnrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the\n\tspeedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the \n\trolling ocean.\n\n\tStrapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing\n\twater, intently watching for Enrique's signal.\n\n\tAs the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.\n\n\tBen grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and\n\tEric braces themselves.\n\n\tEnrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls\n\tthe winch, Ben yanks the cord and - \n\n\tWOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,\n\thoisting Ben and Eric aloft.

The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.\n\n\tDown below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.\n\n\tEric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the\n\tcamera.\n\n\tThen, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,\n\twhich now dangles from his neck.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tERIC\n</b>\t\tWhat was that?\n\n\tA second tug...and now the faintest of screams.\n\n\tBen and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared\n\tinto the low bank of FOG.\n\n\tBy the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR\n\tIS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE.

Starts the ENGINE.\n\n\tHe's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls\n\tit down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tWhen I met you, I thought that one day\n\t\tmillions of years ago, all the dinosaurs\n\t\tbecame extinct. Wiped out.

They became other things.\n\t\tThey evolved.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGRANT\n</b>\t\tA well-accepted theory.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tELLIE\n</b>\t\t\t(simply)\n\t\tAlan don't be afraid to evolve.\n\n\tGrant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.\n\tA forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.\n\n\tEllie watches as he drives off.\n\n\n<b>7 \tINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \t\t\t\t\t\t7\n</b>\n\tThe last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public\n\tlecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and\n\tSTUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with\n\tcostumes.\n\n\tGrant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some\n\tATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This\n\twasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.\n\n\tA new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGRANT\n</b>\t\tIt's through the painstaking study of the\n\t\tInterior chamber in multiple specimens that\n\t\twe can determine this exciting correlation\n\t\tbetween the larynx and the upper plate. That\n\t\tlets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that\n\t\tthe raptor might have been capable of bird-\n\t\tlike vocalizations. Which as you can\n\t\timagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.\n\n\tHe's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the\n\tSYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of\n<b>\tAPPLAUSE.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tSYMPOSTIUM LEADER\n</b>\t\tThank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does\n\t\tanyone have a question?\n\n\tNearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGRANT\n</b>\t\tDoes anyone have a question that doesn't \n\t\trelate to Jurassic Park?\n\n\tQuite a few hands go down.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRANT (cont'd)\n\t\tOr the incident in San Diego, which I'll\n\t\tremind you, I did not witness.\n\n\tNow most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few\n\tremaining...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMALE STUDENT\n</b>\t\tYour theory on raptors is good and all, but\n\t\tisn't all this conjecture kind of moot?\n\n\tThe STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMALE STUDENT (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tI mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and\n\t\teveryone decides how to handle the second\n\t\tisland, scientist will just go in and look\n\t\tfor themselves.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER\n</b>\t\tIsn't paleontology itself in danger of\n\t\textinction?\n\n\tRecognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is\n\tabout to step in. But Grant will take this himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGRANT\n</b>\t\tNo, and let me be perfectly clear on this\n\t\tpoint. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.\n\t\tWhat's left of them is fossilized in stone\n\t\tthe actual scientists spend years to\n\t\tundercover.\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   (MORE)\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tGRANT (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\twhat John Hammond and InGen created are\n\t\ttheme park monsters.

He\n\tfinishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's\n\taimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tUDESKY\n</b>\t\tThat's right, two of the very best I could\n\t\tfind. No, I haven't worked with them\n\t\tpersonally, but they come with the highest\n\t\trecommendations.\n\n\tThen --\n\n\tCooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft.

PECK LAKE, MT - DAY \t12\n</b>\n\tCLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a\n\tdinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his\n\tsweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an\n\tassociate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.\n\n\tLooking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State.

Amanda is knocked over\n\twith surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\tGood thing I've been swimming, huh?\n\n\tAmanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCROSSFADE TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>108-109\tOMIT\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t108-109\n</b>\n\n<b>110\tEXT. BEACH - DAY\t\t\t\t\t\t\t110\n</b>\n\tThe foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing\n\teach direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they\n\tdon't seem to notice.\n\n\tTrying to keep his boy's spirit up...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\tYou remember when we went fishing last\n\t\tsummer?

And the truck driver threatened\n\t\tto knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I\n\t\twas the governor and he believed me?\n\n\tEric really smiles, remembering the day.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tERIC\n</b>\t\tYeah.\n\n\tAmanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the\n\tincident.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\tThat was a fun day.\n\n\tTo Paul, after some consideration....\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n</b>\t\tWe should try fishing again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\tYou mean it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAMANDA\n</b>\t\tI do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?\n\t\tThings might turn out differently.\n\n\tHer hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips\n\ttouching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.\n\n\tSensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down\n\tthe beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks\n\tconspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tERIC\n</b>\t\tThe lady you called, how do you know she can\n\t\thelp us?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGRANT\n</b>\t\tShe's the one person I could always count on.\n\t\tAnd she's saved me more times than she\n\t\trealizes.

It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the\n\timpact.\n\n\tAnd it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar\n\tboat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasn\u0092t seen it yet, so\n\tGrant stops him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGRANT (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tEric, do you know what happened to the boat?\n\t\tthat brought you here?

Grant forges on,\n\tapproaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll\n\tfind, but he needs to look.\n\n\tAlmost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the\n\tocean, where he sees\n\n<b>\tTWO LIGHTS.\n</b>\n\tHe doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure\n\tthey're real. They are. And they're coming closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tERIC\n</b>\t\t\t(excited)\n\t\tMom!

Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,\n\tmaking as much motion as possible.

But\n\tthe cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are\n\tthree gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their\n\tspacing with his fingers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tERIC\n</b>\t\t\t(yelling over)\n\t\tDr. Grant!

But\n\tthe noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGRANT (CONT'D)\n</b><b>\t\tNO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!\n</b>\n\tAt the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it\n\tlooks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but\n\tsomething more is happening.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tA PTERANODON\n</b>\n\tflies up out of the trees, the first of twenty.

THE BEACH - DAWN\t\t\t\t\t   110E\n</b>\n\tGrant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the\n\twater. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of\n\tthe first chopper and starting to go after the second.\n\n\tBuffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the\n\tchopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to\n\tbite. It catches Grant's shoulder.\n\n\tGrant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes\n\tto bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.\n\tAs it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.\n\n\tThe entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the\n\tcreature\u0092s wings.\n\n\n<b>110F\tINT.

It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the\n\tpteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.\n\n\tAs Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.\n\tThe pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer\n\tand closer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGRANT\n</b>\t\t\t(shouting over the noise)\n\t\tWe have to cut it! Find something sharp!\n\n\tEveryone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.\n\n\tFinally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.\n\n\tGrant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but\n\tthe pteranodon keeps coming closer.\n\n\tPaul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight\n\tin the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a\n\tlittle.\n\n\tGrant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when\n\tthe pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's\n\tnowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.\n\n\tAnd idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,\n\tpulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites\n\tthrough the line.\n\n\n<b>110G\tEXT.
