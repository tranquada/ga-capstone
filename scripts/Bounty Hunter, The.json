Ouch.\n<b>          \n</b>          The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE\n          REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS\n          DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working\n          their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and\n          Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid\n          Milo.
