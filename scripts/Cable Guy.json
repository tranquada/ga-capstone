The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint \nimage of a television program. Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly \nimage.\n\nThe camera pulls back very slowly. We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch \ntelevision.\n\nThe camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote\ncontrol. The hand changes channels frantically.\n\nThe camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN BARTOWSKY, thirty\nyears old, sitting on his couch. He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception.\nUnfortunately for him \u0096 his cable is not hooked up.\n\n<b>STEVE\n</b>(looks at watch)\nJesus, where's the cable guy already?\n\n<b>END OF CREDIT SEQUENCE\n</b>\n<b>1A\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nIt is a stylish old apartment. There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor. Steven has just \nmoved in. The phone rings.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(into the phone)\nHello.\n\n<b>2\tNEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nWe see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough \nlooking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television \nset.\n\nON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic \non the screen says \"Sam Sweet Trial Update.\"\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>How's the move going?\n\n<b>3\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nSteven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Horrible. The cable guy is missing in\naction. Apparently he's going to be here\nsometime between eight AM and my death.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>You haven't called Robin have you?\nPlease tell me you didn't call her.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(sarcastically)\nNo, I'm giving her space.\n(beat)\nI can't believe she's doing this.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>You never should have asked her to marry\nyou. You're the mad smotherer.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>All she had to do was say no. She didn't\nhave to kick me out. I feel like Felix\nUnger.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>You forced her to evaluate the\nrelationship. If you didn't propose she\nwould never have realized how unhappy she\nwas.\n\n<b>STEVE\n</b>I don't want to talk about it.\nSo what time are you going to come by?\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>I can't. I'm working double shifts the\nrest of the week.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>It's my first night here. Don't do this\nto me.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>The other camera guy pulled out his back.\nBesides, I spent the last two weeks with\nyou on my couch. Isn't that enough?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Fine, fine.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy\nfifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie\nchannels for free. Even the dirty ones.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff.\nWhat if he says no? I'll feel like an\nidiot.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>None of them say no, believe me. I'll\ntalk to you later.\n\nSteven hangs up, and waits.\n\n<b>DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>4\tINT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER\n</b>\nSteven continues unpacking. He is very neat. He opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his \nex-girlfriend. He looks at one sadly, considering whether or not to put it on display. He puts it \nback in the box.\n\n<b>4A\tEXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n</b>\nEstablishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties. A moving truck \npulls into a gated side garage.\n\n<b>5\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER\n</b>\nMovers deliver a small breakfast table and chairs. Steven directs them as to where to put them.\n\n<b>CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 3:52 P.M.\n</b>\n<b>6\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER\n</b>\nSteven puts a few feet of tin foil on his antenna to help the reception. He changes channels. Still \nnothing. He pulls it off frustrated.\n\n<b>7\tINT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER\n</b>\nMany of the boxes are gone. Steven lies on the couch, staring at the ceiling, fidgeting. He is unable \nto fill his day without cable.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Where the hell is he?\n\n<b>8\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER\n</b>\nSteven paces back and forth across the room. He stares at his watch frequently.\n\n<b>CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 5:12 P.M.\n</b>\n<b>9\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER\n</b>\nSteven slowly eats a sandwich in his empty kitchen. He looks at the clock. It says five-thirty. He \npicks up the phone and dials. A machine picks up.\n\n<b>ROBIN (VO)\n</b>Hi, this is Robin. Leave a message. If\nyou are trying to reach Steven he can now\nbe reached at 555-3837.\n\nSteven hangs up.\n\n<b>10\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SUNSET\n</b>\nSteven does sit ups. He looks at the clock.\n\n<b>CLOSE UP OF THE CLOCK - 6:48 P.M.\n</b>\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(to himself)\nForget it. Idiots.\n\nHe gets up, and walks into the bathroom.\n\n<b>11\tINT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nSteven gets undressed. He turns on the shower, adjusts the heat, then gets in. He tries to lose his \ntension by letting the hot water engulf him. He takes some shampoo, and lathers up his hair.\n\n<b>THE DOORBELL RINGS\n</b><b>STEVEN\n</b>(annoyed)\nOh great.\n\n<b>THE DOORBELL RINGS SEVERAL TIMES\n</b>\nSteven jumps out of the shower, soaking wet, throws on a bathrobe and runs to the door.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Don't leave! I'm here! I'm here!\n\n<b>12\tINT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nSteven runs to the door.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY (OS)\n</b>Hello! Cable Guy!\n\nSteven reaches the door, and looks through the peep-hole.\n\n<b>P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE\n</b>\nThe CABLE GUY is walking away.\n\n<b>INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\nSteven opens the door and yells to the Cable Guy.\n\n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Hey, wait!\n\nThe Cable Guy turns back.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Well, look who decided to show up. I was\njust gonna go collect my retirement\npension.\n\nThe Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he \nspeaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>You were supposed to be here four hours\nago.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Was I? So I'm the tardy one. Good to\nknow.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath\nplace, but now it's closed.\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>\n(turns to leave)\nMaybe I shouldn't have come at all \u0096 jerk\noff!\n(turns back smiling)\nI'm just joking. Let's do this.\n(looks around)\nOh, the old McNair place. I never thought\nthey'd get the floors clean after what\nhappened here.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>What happened?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(long beat)\nThey had a lot of cats.\n\nThey walk into Steven's living room.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a\ncomment card.\n\nHe pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Please mail it in when I am done.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>These go to your boss?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>No, they go to me. I'm a\nperfectioniss\u0085 perfectioniss\u0085\n(he strains to lose his lisp)\nperfectioniss\u0085t.\nNow let's take a look at what we're\ndealing with.\n\nThe Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me\nbaby. Tell me where you like it. That's\nit baby.\n\nHe zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Here's your sweet spot.\n\nHe pulls out his drill, and begins drilling.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>So your lady kicked you out.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>What?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>In preparing your service I noticed you\nwere previously wired across town at 1268\nand a half Chestnut. Last week the\nbilling was transferred to one Robin\nHarris. Smells like heartbreak to me.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I really don't want to talk about it with\nyou. Could you please just install my\ncable? I'm going to get dressed.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>No sweat.\n\nSteven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I\ncan access the floorboards. Don't be\nspooked if you hear someone crawling\nunderneath you.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Okay, whatever.\n\nSteven walks toward his bedroom.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be\nchannel surfing in no time.\n\nThe Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke.\n\n<b>13\tINT. - STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER\n</b>\n<b>CLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION\n</b>\nRIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio.\n\n<b>RIKKI KLIEMAN\n</b>(to camera)\nSo ends day fifty-four of the trial of\nformer child star Sam Sweet who has been\naccused of shooting his twin brother,\nStan, in cold blood. The twins were\nstars of the hit sitcom \"Double Trouble\"\nwhich aired from nineteen seventy-seven\ntill nineteen eighty-four.\n\nA video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at \nvarious ages. Included is the cast photo of \"Double Trouble.\" Pictured in the photo are eight-year-\nold Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad.\n\nWe see a brief clip from \"Double Trouble,\" starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of \nSam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.\n\n<b>RIKKI KLIEMAN\n</b>(to camera)\nLife wasn't so sweet after the cancellation\nof their program. Hollywood chewed them\nup and spit them out. A frustrated Sam\nturned to petty larceny, while his more\nimpressionable brother, Stan, fell in\nwith a fringe cult called \"The\nBrotherhood of Friends.\" Reduced to\ntabloid fodder a fury was growing inside\nof Sam. A burning need to be recognized\nas an individual, not a person famous for\nhaving an identical twin. A need that\ntook the form of four shotgun blasts on\nthe night of November fourteenth. And so\ntoday his attorneys continue the unusual\ndefense of \"Twin Envy.\"\n\n<b>ANGLE ON\n</b>\nSteven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>How's it going?\n\nThe Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say \"quiet.\" His eyes never leave the TV.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I\nhope they fry this bastard.\n\nSteven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the \nroom impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs \nblocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation \nimpossible.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(looks around)\nWhat happened?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(jumps to his feet)\nThe arrangement of your major appliances\nand your furniture was causing some noisy\npics and hum bars in your reception. I\nmoved a few things. Cleared it right up.\nIs that cool?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(non-confrontational)\nI\u0085 guess so.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>You programmed?\n(off of Steven's look)\nThen let me slave your remotes.\n\nHe picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at \neach other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Ooh, maybe we should leave these two\nalone.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>So after this I'll only need one remote\nfor everything?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>You know you're pretty good at this. You\ncould be a cable guy yourself.\n(he finishes)\nNow let me check your levels.\n\nWith amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he \nclicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving \nkids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>All right. That about does it. I just\nhave some paperwork for you to fill out.\nSign here.\n\nSteven does.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>That gave me power of attorney over you.\n(beat)\nJoking.\n\nSteven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too \nlong. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want \nto leave.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I'm about finished here.\n(beat)\nOkay. I feel good about this.\n\nCable Guy walks to the door.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>One thing.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(turns back immediately)\nYeah!\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I\u0085 uh\u0085 I have this friend and he said\nhe gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he\ngot free movie channels. Have you ever\nheard of anything like that?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(deadly serious)\nYou mean illegal cable?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Uh\u0085 yes.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Who told you that? I want his name.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Forget it.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>You're offering me a bribe? What you\nhave just done is illegal, and in this\nstate if convicted, you could be fined\nfive-thousand dollars or spend six months\nin a correctional facility.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Please\u0085 that was dumb. I was just\nmaking conversation \u0096\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(laughs)\nI'm just jerking your chain. Wake up\nlittle snoozy. I'll juice you up. All\nit is is a push of a button.\n\nHe puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Oh, great. How much?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Don't worry about it. I couldn't charge\nyou. Your girl just booted you.\nConsider it one guy doing another guy a\nsolid.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>That is so nice.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Hey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be\nsurprised how many customers treat you\nlike shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or\nsomething.\n(hands him a card)\nHere is my personal beeper number. It's\njust for my preferred customers. Never\ncall the company, they'll just put you on\nhold.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Thanks. Really.\n(holds up comment card - jokes)\nYou're gonna get some good marks here.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Maybe some day I'll take you out to the\nsatellite and show you how all this stuff\nworks. It's really incredible.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Sure. We should do that one day.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>How 'bout tomorrow?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Tomorrow? Tomorrow's not good.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>What are you going to do, sit home and\nstew about your ex?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>No.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(insulted)\nOh, okay. I guess I crossed the line.\nSorry.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(guilty)\nYou didn't cross the line.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>No? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty.\nOn the flip side.\n\nThe Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider. Steven cannot believe he just got roped into \nthat.\n\n(End Revision - Pink)\n\n<b>14\tINT. CITYWIDE LAND DEVELOPERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nSteven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers. His boss, HAL DANIELS, looks \nimpressed.\n\nSteven pulls a sheet off of an architect's model of a condominium complex.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>\u0085There are twenty-four classrooms; each\ncan be converted into a 1400 square foot\nhome. The facility has two tennis courts,\nan Olympic size pool and full gym, with a\nstage if the residents decide they want\nto perform \"Oklahoma.\"\n\nEveryone laughs. Steven is very good at his job.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>The kitsch appeal of living in an old\nschoolhouse should be very attractive to\nyoung, upwardly mobile home buyers. And\nmost important, the structure is\navailable in foreclosure. If we put down\na cash bid, we're going to steal this\nthing.\n\nThere is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm \naround him. They speak as the meeting breaks up.\n\n<b>MR. DANIELS\n</b>Great work Steve-o. So you're feeling\ngood?\n\n<b>STEVE\n</b>Yeah.\n\n<b>MR. DANIELS\n</b>Did I hear something about you having\nsome troubles at home?\n\n<b>STEVE\n</b>Robin and I have been having a difficult\ntime. I moved out, but I really think\nit's only temporary.\n\n<b>MR. DANIELS\n</b>Gotcha. I love this project, but it's a\nbig mother. Know what I mean? If it\nfails, corporate's going to have my ass.\nI've got confidence in you, but you hear\nwhere I'm coming from, bro?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Absolutely. Now I've got more time than\never. It's a good thing.\n(laughs)\nI know I can pull this thing off.\n\n<b>MR. DANIELS\n</b>(playfully)\nThen what are you doing talking to me?\nYou've got a lot of work to do. Get to\nit!\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Thank you. I will.\n\nHal goes down the stairs to his office. Steven watches him disappear, then turns to his secretary, \n<b>JOAN.\n</b>\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I'll be right back.\n\n<b>14A\tINT. SASSY MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY\n</b>\nSteven walks through the halls looking for Robin's office.\n\n<b>15\tOMITTED\n</b>\n<b>16\tINT. ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY\n</b>\nROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at \"Sassy Magazine.\" \nHer office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are \npapers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has \nwritten.\n\nSteven peeks his head in her door.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Hello.\n\nRobin's face drops.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Steven, what are you doing here?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I was just in the area. Thought I'd pop\nby. How's work? How'd the big teen crush\narticle come out?\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>They liked it.\n(beat)\nI thought we agreed we weren't going to\nsee each other for a month.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I know, it's just Daniels accepted my\nproposal to renovate the old schoolhouse.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>That's wonderful, congratulations.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I know I'm breaking the rules, but come\nhave dinner with me tonight to celebrate.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>I don't think we should.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Come on, this is the biggest day of my\ncareer.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Don't put me in this position.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>What position? I want to share this with\nyou.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>(feeling pressured)\nI love you, but I need to take some time\non my own to see how I feel. You agreed\nto this. I mean\u0085 this is exactly why we\nbroke up, because you never listen to me.\n\n<b>STEVE\n</b>What? Now we're broken up? What\nhappened to 'trial separation?'\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>I can't get into this now. If you haven't\nnoticed, I'm at work.\n\n<b>STEVE\n</b>Sorry to disturb you.\n\nHe turns to leave.\n\n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>(sincerely)\nSteven. Congratulations.

STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SIX-THIRTY P.M.\n</b>\nSteven is watching television. He looks lonely and depressed. He clicks around in a daze, never \nstopping for more than a second.\n\nHe hears a horn honking outside.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY (OS)\n</b>Steven!!!! Stev-ey!!!! Let's go!!!!\n\nON THE TV - A commercial for Medieval Times Restaurant.\n\nSteven walks over to the window and sees The Cable Guy standing in front of his van, leaning in \nhis window honking the horn.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Steven!!!!\n(waves)\nHey buddy!!! Come on down!!!\n\nSteven waves and then steps back from the window. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at the \ntelevision.\n\nON THE TV - The local news.\n\n<b>REPORTER\n</b>Coming up next a special report,\n\"Loneliness, America's Silent Killer.\"\n\nSteven looks back out the window and sees the Cable Guy smiling and waving for him to come \ndown.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(begins walking to the door)\nWhat the hell.\n\n<b>18\tEXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK\n</b>\nSteven walks from his apartment to the customized van. On the side of the white van it says, \"The \nCable Company - Get Wired Today.\"\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>How's it going?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Howdy partner. Climb aboard.\n\nSteven gets in.\n\n<b>19\tINT. VAN - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nThe van drives onto the main boulevard.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Thanks for coming out. You know most\npeople think cable is just a simple co-ax\nthat comes out of the wall. They never\ntake the time to understand how it works.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Where exactly are we goin?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>We're going to take a ride on the\ninformation superhighway.\n\n<b>20\tEXT. CITY - DUSK\n</b>\nBirds eye P.O.V., shot follows the Cable Guy's van as it drives through the city.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>\u0085It all started in Lansford,\nPennsylvania where Panther Valley\nTelevision, with the assistance of Jerrod\nElectronics, created the first cable\ntelevision system.\n\nThe van drives up into the hills, finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain, \noverlooking the entire city.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I went to Lansford once. It's the Cable\nGuy's Mecca. It was very emotional.\n\n<b>21\tEXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK\n</b>\nSteven and the Cable Guy get out of the van, and walk down a trail.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I come here to think sometimes. To clear\nmy head.\n\nThey turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a \none-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's \ncontrols are located.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>There she is. Right now she's sending\nentertainment and information to millions\nof satisfied citizens.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>That's pretty impressive.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>See, I knew the moment I met you that\nyou would appreciate this.\n\nThe Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(with wonder)\nThe future is now. Soon every American\nhome will integrate their television,\nphone, and computer. You'll be able to\nvisit the Louvre on one channel, and\nwatch female mud wrestling on\nanother. You can do your shopping at\nhome, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend\nin Vietnam. There's no end to the\npossibilities.\n(waves to Steven)\nCome on up! What are you waiting for?!\n\n<b>22\tINT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that\nthere are billions of bits of information\nsurging through me.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I\nguess I've always taken it for granted.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>When I was a kid my mom worked nights.\nNever met dad. But the old TV was always\nthere for me.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I know what you mean. My dad was there,\nbut he might as well have been gone. My\nmom is a stewardess. She was always out\nof town.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(moved)\nThat's tough. You must have a lot of\nabandonment issues. Reality isn't \"Father\nKnows Best,\" it's a kick in the face on\nSaturday night. But what doesn't kill us\nmakes us stronger, right?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(tentative)\nYou know my brother's a speech therapist.\n\nThe Cable Guy sits up. He looks angry.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>So?\n\nThere is a long silence. Steven doesn't know how to react.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Never mind.\n\nThe Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(beat)\nSo, you're pretty love struck about your\nlady, huh?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and\nshe asked me to move out.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I hate that.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>She said she felt pressured. Can you\nbelieve that?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I\ndon't think you listen to her. I think\nyou try to tell her what she wants to\nhear. She wants you to thirst for\nknowledge about who she is. All the\ncomplicated splendor that is woman.

Women are suckers for\n\"Sleepless in Seattle.\" It's on HBO this\nmonth. That's your bait right there.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Robin loves that movie.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>They all do. Next time you talk to her\ntell her you're cooking yourself dinner,\nand watching it by yourself. Sound like\nyou're happier than a pig in shit.\nShe'll come running. Betcha. Then just\nplay it cool.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Maybe I will.\n\nSteven gets out of the car.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Thanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say\nthis, but I don't know your name.

But my\nfriends call me Chip.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I'll see ya' Chip.\n\nBefore he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Let's just remember right now.

COFFEEHOUSE - NEXT DAY\n</b>\nSteven and Robin are talking. Robin does not look happy to see him.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I don't listen to you. I pretend to\nunderstand but I'm really just saying\nwhat I think you want to hear. So from\nnow on I'm going to try my best to listen\nmore because I do love you and am\ninterested in learning about every detail\nabout the complicated splendor that is\nyou.\n\nRobin looks at him, somewhat shocked.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Oh.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I want us to get back together, but I can\nsee why taking this time might be good\nfor us. So, I'm not mad.\n\nAfter a long beat, Robin smiles.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Sometimes time apart is healthy.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>You're right. Well, that's what I came\nhere to say. Look, I've got to get back\nto the office.\n\nHe starts getting up.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>So, are you doing anything tomorrow?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I'm just going to cook myself dinner and\nwatch a movie. \"Sleepless in Seattle\" is\non cable.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Really?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>If you're around you should drop by and\ncheck out the new apartment.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Okay, maybe I will.\n\nHe exits the room. As he does we see a television broadcasting the Sweet case.\n\nON MTV - Sam Sweet sits behind the defendant's table. TABITHA SOREN is giving the news \nupdate.\n\n<b>TABITHA SOREN\n</b>Today in the Sam Sweet case the\nprosecution played the 911 call that Sam\nSweet made the night he murdered his\nbrother. Keep in mind, he confessed one\nmonth later.\n\nThe courtroom listens to a 911 phone call. The transcription is seen on the screen.\n\n<b>SAM SWEET V ON THE TAPE\n</b>(crying and babbling)\nHello, please send help. My twin brother\nhas been shot.\n\n<b>911 OPERATOR\n</b>Slow down sir. What happened?\n\n<b>SAM SWEET\n</b>Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun\nfour times. I mean I think it was a\nshotgun. Who would do such a thing?! I\nthink it was an Asian gang or something.\nThey were speaking some other language.\n\nSam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear.\n\n<b>TABITHA SOREN\n</b>Hmm. Who indeed? Coming up next, a rare\ninterview with Michael Jackson's zoo-\nkeeper.\n\n<b>25\tINT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY\n</b>\nSteven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends. It is a competitive, \nbut friendly game. Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Here, here, here.\n\nA player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>(to himself)\nShit! My fault! My fault!\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Not your fault. I'm in the zone. There\nis no stopping me today.\n\nPlay begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who \ncatches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The \nball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it \nhits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the \nCable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Hey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I\nwas just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd\nrun the court for a couple of innings.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>(gestures to injured player)\nGreat. We need another man.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>This is\u0085 Chip Douglas\u0085 my cable guy.\n\nRick smiles in recognition.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>We met about a week ago during a routine\ninstallation, but I feel like I've known\nhim my whole life.\n\nSteven can't believe this is happening.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>Oh really. That's sweet. All right Chip\nDouglas, you're on shirts. Let's play.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>No, I want to be on Steven's team. I'm\nskins.\n\nThe Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt. Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he \nis rippled with muscles. The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is \nscary.\n\n<b>JEFF\n</b>I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just\nplay.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up.\n\nThe Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone \nstares at him until he finishes.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Let's get it on!\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Are you any good?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Feed me under the boards and you'll find\nout.\n\nPlay begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as \nhumanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. \nHe couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot \nwhich goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(doing the traveling hand signal)\nTraveling! That's traveling!\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>Yeah, whatever you say Chip.\n\nEveryone runs down the court, ignoring him.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>All right, so we're playing that type of\ngame. Prison rules. I get it.\n\nSteven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss \ncrosses all over the court.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm\nopen!\n\nSteven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the \nprocess. The ball goes in.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(does the foul hand signal)\nAnd one! That's definitely a foul!\n(to Jeff)\nYou want to mug me, my wallet is in my\nother pants.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(to Cable Guy)\nWhat are you doing?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Don't play from fear Steven. We can take\nthese guys.\n\n<b>MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V.\n</b>\na. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it \ndown.\nb. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including \nRick.\nc. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. \nThe Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders \nwith Rick.\nd. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down \nhard.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Take it to the hole!\n\nSteven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs \nhis own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the \nground. The ball does not go in.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Hey, are you okay?\n\nHe pulls Steven up.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Yeah. I'm fine.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Let's switch. I'll cover Rick.\n\nThe cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare.\n\nSteven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to \nthe basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>(enraged)\nWhat the hell was that? That's it. I've\nhad enough.\n\nEveryone begins to exit the court.\n\n<b>JEFF\n</b>Thanks for bringing your \"friend\".\n\nThe Cable Guy runs up to Rick.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Good game.\n(slaps Rick on the butt)\nYou were tough out there. Your play\nbrought me up to a higher level. I mean\nthat.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>(dismissive)\nYeah.\n\nHe shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>What are you doing?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>It was payback time. I was protecting\nyou.\n\n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>You ruined the game.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I don't appreciate your tone Steven.\nThat's not the way friends speak to each\nother.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>What are you talking about? I don't even\nknow you!\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Well let's fix that. Let me buy you a\nHeineken?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>No, I'm going home.\n\nSteven turns to leave.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Well, uh, I guess we'll talk later. I've\ngot to go shower up and do some stuff.\nI'll call you if I get a chance. Or you\ncall me\u0085 or something.\n\nThe Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the \ncable guy extends his palm out low by his knee.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>And down low.\n\nSteven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven \ngives him a low five just so he can leave.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(pulls his hand away so Steven misses it)\nToo slow. Have a good one.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(as he walks away)\nYeah, have a good one.\n\n<b>26\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT NIGHT\n</b>\nSteven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of \nwine. He opens the oven, and checks on dinner. It is almost ready. Then he checks his message \nmachine as he prepares the meal. He begins chopping an onion.\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\n<b>MESSAGE VOICE\n</b>You have eleven messages.\n\n<b>STEVEN'S MOTHER\n</b><b>(ON THE MACHINE)\n</b>Steven, it's mom. Give me a call.

Okay later.\n(beep tone)\nSorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to\nit, thought it might have been you. All\nright, bye.\n\nSteven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the \nrest of the calls.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(fast forwards)\n\u0085We're having ourselves quite a little\ngame of phone tag here. You're it!\n(fast forwards)\n\u0085I was just blow drying my hair and I\nthought I heard the phone ringing.\n(fast forwards)\n\u0085you're a tough man to reach.\n(fast forwards)\nI guess you're too busy to call your\nfriends.\n\n(Revision Ends - Blue)\n\nSteven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then \u0096\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b><b>(ON THE MACHINE)\n</b>(long beat - then quiet and distant)\nShit.\n\nThe doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed \ncasually, but looks beautiful.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Hey, good to see you.\n\nThere is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Come on in. What do you think of the\nplace?\n\nShe looks at the odd placement of furniture.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>You made some interesting choices laying\nout the room.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(embarrassed)\nThat's actually where the movers put the\nfurniture.

Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven. Steven turns on the television. The \nscreen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the \nsignal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>It's alright. We can watch it another\nnight.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>No, no. We really should see it now.\nNow's a good time.\n\nHe plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Wait, wait. I know what to do.\n\nHe walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials \nit, then presses the number in.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll\njust page him. We'll have this fixed in\nno time.\n\n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)\n\nSteven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone. The moment he is finished dialing \u0096\n\n<b>THERE IS A KNOCK - THE CAMERA WHIP PANS TO THE DOOR\n</b>\nSteven walks to the door and opens it. Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and \ndisturbed, different than we've ever seen him before. Steven is startled.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>That was\u0085 fast.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Is there a problem with your service?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Yeah\u0085 my cable went out.\n\nSteven pushes him out into the hall.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Really?\n\nThe Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>So you called me. Interesting how you\ncall when you need something. Is that how\nyou treat people?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I've been really busy. You've got to get\nmy cable going, Robin is here. This is\nreally important.\n\nHe peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back \nout.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>But calling me back isn't?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Why should I help you?

You're too good to me.\n\nThe Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(loud-normally)\nAll set.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>So what's with the cut cord?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(nonchalantly)\nThat's for effect.

Steven walks back inside.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Who was that?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Nobody.\n\nSteven sits down next to Robin. Robin moves next to him. Steven looks very happy.\n\n<b>28\tON THE TV\n</b>\nA scene from the film \"Sleepless in Seattle.\"\n\nThe camera pulls out and reveals the Cable Guy watching the film in the back of his van \u0096 alone. \nWe cannot see much of the inside of the van because the only light is that of the television, but we \ncan tell that he lives there.\n\n<b>29\t(SCENE 29 OMITTED)\n</b>\n<b>30\tEXT.

Open sesame.\n\nSteven opens his eyes.\n\nThe camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which \nsays \"MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT.\"\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Medieval Times?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I know what you're thinking. Don't\nworry, I'm buying.\n\n<b>31\tINT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER\n</b>\nThe Cable Guy and Steven are walking to their table. All the seating overlooks a large, circular \narena, the kind a rodeo is held in. The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed \ndecor. All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc.\n\n(Revision Ends - Pink)\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Funny. I never thought I would ever\ncome here.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I love this place.

Ow, that hurts.\n\nHe grabs his crotch and squeezes, as if it's the only way he can control himself.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>There oughta be a law.

They both put theirs on.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Thanks for the help.\n\nThe Cable Guy sees something. His eyes widen.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Steven, don't turn around, but there is a\nwoman eyeing you like you are a piece of\nmeat and she hasn't eaten in a week.\n\nSteven acts like he isn't interested, but he is.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Really?

Just turn like\nyou are looking for the waitress.\n\nSteven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She \nis in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life. Steven turns back to the \ncable Guy, annoyed.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Ha-ha. I'm just messing with your mind.\nBut you fell for it man. You are one\nhorny Indian Chief.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(not laughing)\nYou got me.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>So what did you want to rap about?\n\nThe trumpets go off, the lights go down and the show begins.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Hold that thought.

The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to \nthe center of the pit.\n\nThe Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven \nmirrors him, not sure of what to do.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Just take it easy.\n\nThe Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. \nThe sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and \npokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his \nshield.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(enraged)\nWhat are you doing?!\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(matter of fact)\nI'm trying to kill you.\n\nThe Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled \nwall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Hey, watch it!\n\nThe Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the \nground.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>This is just like when Spock had to fight\nKirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forced\nto do battle.\n\nSteven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him. He swings at the Cable Guy with his \nsword, just missing him. The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>That's the spirit. Let's give 'em a good\nshow.\n\nSteven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the \nCable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on \nthe ground.\n\nBy the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>So that's how it's gonna be, huh? All\nright. If you want to play rought, Daddy\ncan play rough.\n\nThe Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, \nsending him to the ground.\n\nThe Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy \nsilver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar \nweapon, and then begin to circle each other.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Chip, this isn't funny! Will you stop\nit!\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>The name is Spock. If we don't battle to\nthe death, they'll kill us both. Good-bye\nJim.\n\nHe swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the \"Star Trek \nBattle Music\" as they fight.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>This isn't 'Star Trek!'\n\n<b>MUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC\n</b>\nThey bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes \nSteven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The \nCable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing \nand roll in a vicious battle.\n\nThen the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part \nof Steven's protection.\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(looking down)\nJesus.\n\nThe Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of \npounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting \nstick.\n\nThe show's host runs up to Steven.\n\n<b>HOST\n</b>Quickly, muster a top your steed.\n(Steven doesn't move - the host drops character)\nGet on the god damn horse! I don't think\nhe's kidding!\n\nLeft with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse \nsending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy.\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Don't do this!\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Jim, we have no choice!\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Oh my god.\n\nThey run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one \nanother Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick.\nThe Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, \nthrows off his helmet.\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(concerned)\nAre you okay?\n\nThe Cable Guy sits up and smile at him.\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Well done good sir. You are the victor,\nbut we shall meet again.\n\nThe two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the \narena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms \nin triumph, and smiles.\n<b>DISSOLVE TO LATER:\n</b><b>35\tINT.

But that\nreminds me. Proper hair care is a must.\n\nThe Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Looking good, now let's dry you off.\n\nHe runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer. It turns on. The Cable \nGuy puts his face right up next to the air.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Now suck it. Suck the air!\n\nRay hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut \nexperiencing heavy G-Force.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>from this angle you look just like Neil\nArmstrong experiencing G-Force. I\nbelieve you have the \"right stuff.\"\n\nThe Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Don't worry about the tip.

He mentioned that you\nguys have had some problems.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Well, it's a little complicated.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>It always is. You know I asked a woman to\nmarry me once.

Steven \nlistens intently as a SALES MANAGER speaks to the group.\n\n<b>SALES MANAGER\n</b>The response to our initial offering has\nbeen remarkable. A local investment\ngroup has decided to buy the entire\ncomplex and turn them into rentals. In\nretrospect I must admit we made one big\nmistake.\n\nEveryone hangs on his every word.\n\n<b>SALES MANAGER\n</b>We should have asked for more money.\n\nThe entire room laughs.

She waves for him to come to her. He waves her off.\n\n<b>JOAN\n</b>(more urgently-quietly)\nI really need to speak with you.\n\nSome people are beginning to notice this exchange.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(curtly)\nIt can wait.\n\nRight then two POLICE OFFICERS storm into the room.

Steven groans, then leans over in pain.\n\n<b>POLICE OFFICER\n</b>Please follow my instructions. Hands\non the table.\n\nSteven puts his hands on the table. The Officer kicks his legs apart, then frisks him in front of \neveryone. It is pure humiliation.\n\n<b>POLICE OFFICER\n</b>Hands behind your back.\n\nThe other Officer cuffs him, then turns him around.\n\n<b>POLICE OFFICER #2\n</b>You have the right to remain silent.\nAnything you say may be used against you\nin a court of law. You have the right to\nan attorney. If you cannot afford an\nattorney one will be provided for you.\nDo you understand?\n\n<b>STEVE\n</b>This is all a mistake. I didn't accept\nany stolen goods.\n\nJust then it hits him. He hears the Cable Guy's voice in his head.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY (V.O.)\n</b>(with echo)\n\u0085you're getting THX quality sound that\nwould make George Lucas cream in his\npants \u0096 cream in his pants.\n\nHe pushes him toward the door. Steven looks at everyone's horrified faces as he is taken away. He \ntries to break the tension with a joke.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Hey, relax. I'm the one who's going to\njail.\n\nNobody laughs. He exits.\n\n<b>59\tEXT. OFFICE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nSteven is walked to a police car, and put inside.\n\nWe slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop. He is looking under the hood of his car. \nApparently it has broken down. The man turns and we see that it is the Cable Guy covertly \nwatching Steven's humiliation. As the policeman pushes Steven into the car he looks at the Cable \nguy and touches his nose. The Cable Guy touches his nose.\n\n<b>60\tINT. POLICE STATION - LATER\n</b>\nSteven is chained to a bench. He is speaking to his father EARL, a stout man of sixty, and his \n<b>LAWYER.\n</b>\n<b>EARL\n</b>I can't believe you did this.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I didn't do anything.

What did you hear?\n\nThe man turns around. It is not Steven's lawyer, it is the\nCable Guy dressed in an expensive suit.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Hello Steven.

What's your real name?!\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>So many questions.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Why are you doing this to me?\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I didn't do this to you, you did this to\nyou.

He turns to the guard at the door.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(warmly)\nLouis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on\nPay Per View? I told you it's more fun\nwhen it's Free Per View.\n\nThey both laugh.

As he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his \nface. He never acknowledges it.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>You know, I don't think you're right for\nRobin.

Then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face \ninto the space in the floor. The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad \nman. He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole. Steven falls back. He hears \nthe Cable Guy scuttle away.\n\nSteven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the \naftermath of the Cable Guy's exit. He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him, \nthen through the side walls, and away into the distance. When it clears he discovers a small \nmakeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace.\n\nThere are a few photos pasted to the floorboards. One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing \nnext to his mother. Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the \nCable Guy's brother. The only other photo is of Jerry Springer. Steven sees a small television \nmonitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him. He looks at a \ncellular phone. Every speed dial on the back of the phone says \"Steven\" next to it.\n\nSteven gets up, and runs out of his front door.\n\n<b>108A\tEXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n</b>\nIt is raining lightly outside. Steven is in his car. He pulls away quickly.\n\n<b>109\tINT. RICK'S NEWSROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nRick sits at his desk.

HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nRick walks through the school looking for Steven.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>Steven? Steven?\n\nIn the distance he sees Steven standing in the shadows.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Hey Rick. I'm really excited to hear\nwhat you found out about this nut.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>I hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply\ntroubled. Only child. His mother was\narrested for prostitution, and phone\nsolicitation. Apparently she was some\nphone sex pioneer.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>No way.\n\n<b>RICK\n</b>And get this, he was discharged from the\nMarines. He got mad at his Sergeant so\nhe sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two\nusing a Radio Shack computer. And that's\nnot the half of it.\n\nAs Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, \nbut the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of \nSteven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp).\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Really? Tell me more.\n\nRick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I'm very interested in learning\neverything I can about that wacked out\ncable installer.\n\nHe turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy.\n\nThe camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not \nsee Rick yelp, and fall.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>It sounds like he might hurt somebody.\n\n<b>110A\tINT. STEVEN'S CAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nSteven is driving in his car. His cellular phone rings. He picks it up.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(panicked)\nHello.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY (VO)\n</b>(talks like a game show host)\nNosey friends for two hundred.

He's a friend of mine.\nWhere is he?\n\n<b>DOCTOR\n</b>Room 205.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Can I see him?\n\n<b>DOCTOR\n</b>Yes. But he can't speak. He's in shock.\n\n<b>113\tINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nSteven enters the room. The camera pulls back to reveal Rick laying in full traction, face down, his \nrear end heavily bandaged. He is unconscious.\n\nSteven tentatively walks over to Rick's rear end. He pulls back a small portion of the bandage and \nsees that his butt is covered with staples. The staples form the shape of a television with an \nantenna. Inside the TV is the word \"RING.\"\n\n<b>STEVE\n</b>(perplexed)\nRing?\n\nThe phone rings. Steven jumps, then picks up the phone.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Hello.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY (VO)\n</b>Poor Rick. Seems he had a little\naccident with the business end of a\nstaple gun.\n\n(Revision Ends - Blue)\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>You're not going to get away with this.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>The question is, are you going to get\naway with it?

We're going to take a\nromantic stroll on the information\nsuperhighway.\n\nSteven drops the phone, and runs out of the room.\n\n<b>116B\tINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nSteven runs down the hall to the elevator. Before he reaches it the doors open, and the two \npolicemen who arrested him at work walk out. Steven quickly turns left, but the policemen see \nhim, and make chase.\n\n<b>OFFICER\n</b>Hey, hold it!\n\n<b>116C\tEXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT\n</b>\nSteven runs out of the hospital. The two policemen run after him, about twenty feet behind. \nSteven jumps in his car, and takes off. The police follow in their car.\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\n<b>116D\tEXT.

He gives her the same tour he gave Steven earlier in the \nfilm.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>...it all started in Lansford,\nPennsylvania where Panther Valley\nTelevision, with the assistance of Jerrod\nElectronics, created the first cable\ntelevision system.\n\n<b>116F\tEXT.

Soon every American\nhome will integrate their television,\nphone, and computer. You'll be able to\nvisit the Louvre on one channel, and\nwatch female mud wrestling on another.\nYou can do your shopping at home, or play\na game of Mortal Kombat with a friend in\nVietnam.\n\n<b>117\tEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe chase continues.\n\nSteven slams on the gas, until he is driving one-hundred miles-per-hour. He weaves in and out of \ntraffic, running stop lights, and avoiding obstacles. The police cars disappear behind him. On a \ndime, Steven turns left onto a residential street and shuts off his lights. A moment later all of the \npolice cars pass by. Steven pulls out and heads the other way.\n\n<b>117A\tEXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>This is really fascinating, but I really\nthink we ought to go now.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I knew you'd appreciate it.

DIRT ROAD - NIGHT\n</b>\nSteven drives his car up the muddy dirt road. It gets stuck in the mud. He gets out of the car, and \nbegins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He hears the sounds \nof horse hooves coming closer, and closer. The  he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight \ntoward the fence. The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times. When he reaches it he \nsmashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through. The horse rears back on its hind legs.\n\nThe horse runs full speed directly at Steven. At the last possible moment the horse jumps over \nSteven. When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(chuckles)\nIchabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed\nit all last month.\n\nThe Cable Guy rides toward him again.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(like the Vegas announcer)\nLet's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!!\n\n(Revision Ends - Blue)\n\nThis time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him. They both slam into a puddle \nof mud. The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Where's Robin?!\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>This isn't about Robin, this is about you\nand me.\n\nSteven charges directly at the Cable Guy.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Where's Robin?!!!\n\nSteven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him. They are both covered in mud like \nwarriors from the rain forest. Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Tell me!\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(nonchalantly)\nI'm sorry, I didn't catch the question?\n\nSteven brings down the rock. At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head. The rock slams \ninto the ground.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Steven you've changed.\n(beat - then impressed)\nI like it.\n\nThe Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him.\n\nThey wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of \nhis belt and turns it on.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I think it's time to make you cable ready.\n\nHe slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large \nbranch and bats the Cable Guy off him.\n\nThe Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion \nwhich mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Last time we fought I let you win! Best\ntwo out of three!\n\nMUSIC UP: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(crazed)\nYou treat me like the TV! You use me, but\nyou can't live without me!\n\nThe Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>You can't shut me off with your remote\ncontrol!!!! I'm not like Robin and Rick\nand Mommy and Daddy and brother and\nsister and cousin --\n\nSteven smashes him in the head with the branch.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I got the point.\n\nThe Cable Guy goes down. He appears to be unconscious.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>(in the distance)\nSteven.\n\nHe looks to the dish, but cannot see her.\n\n<b>123\tEXT. SATELLITE DISH - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\nSteven climbs over the edge into the dish. Below him he sees that the bottom of the dish is filled \nwith several feet of rain water.\n\nThree wires go from the points on the edge of the dish, and meet at a point at the center of the \nsatellite, thirty feet above the floor of the dish. ROBIN is hanging by her bound hands from the \ncenter of where those wires meet.\n\nSteven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Help me Steven!\n\nIn the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing through an entry hatch at \nthe top of the dish. Robin's eyes fill with terror.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Steven! Look out!\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(mimics her)\nYeah Steven. Look out!\n\nThe Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box. He slides down the dish, knocking \nSteven down. The two tumble down the slope of the dish, and tumble all the way down into the \nwater.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(sweetly, like a girl)\nI've missed you.\n\nThe Cable Guy immediately punches Steven, sending him back into the water. The Cable Guy \ndives on top of him. A moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up, then grabs his collar and \nspeaks right into his face.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(dramatically)\n\"Dry land is not a myth, I've seen it.\"\nKevin Costner from Waterworld. I don't\nknow what the fuss was about, the movie\nruled, I saw it six times.\n\nHe pulls Steven under the water, and tries to hold him there. He pulls him up after a few moments.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Isn't it weird that we'vve wound up in\nthis position?\n\nHe pushes him under the water again. After a moment he pulls him back up. Steven gasps for air.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Who would have thunk it?\n\nEnraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have \nknocked his jaw out of alignment.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(without any lisp)\nYou're gonna have to do better than that\nSteven.\n(realizing his lisp is gone)\nSteven. Hey, my lisp is gone.\n\nSteven hits him again, this time on the other side of the face.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(lisping again)\nYou stupid son of a bitch.\n\nThe Cable Guy falls unconscious.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>Steven!\n\nSteven runs to her.\n\n<b>124\tEXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER\n</b>\nHe runs to the side of the dish. He realizes he must climb up to release her. He climbs onto the \nWIRE and begins tightrope walking toward her. He walks very slowly, almost losing his balance \nseveral times.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Hang on.\n\nCLOSE ON: The opposite wire. The Cable Guy's muddy hands slam onto it. He pulls himself up.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(laughs maniacally)\nI know what your saying. Who does this\nguy think he is, Jason?\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Stay away from her!\n\nSuddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony\nCurtis. He was just on \"Life-styles of\nthe Rich and Famous.\" He still looks\nterrific.\n\nSteven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's \nlanding makes Steven lose his balance. He falls over, but catches ont the wire. He is left hanging \nthere.\n\nThe Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>And the race is on.\n\nHe does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed.\n\nSteven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and \njoins him.\n\nThe Cable Guy begins to lose his balance.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(knows he's about to fall)\nThis is such an anti-climactic way to end\nthis.\n\nThe Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below. The Cable Guy has surely met his \ndemise.\n\n<b>125\tEXT. SATELLITTE DISH - LATER\n</b>\nSteven and Robin are sitting in the dish, a few feet from where the water begins. They are \nexhausted from their ordeal. They hold each other close.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I love\nyou.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>I love you too. You're right. We\nshouldn't get married. I've got a lot of\nproblems to work out which have\nabsolutely nothing to do with you.\n\n<b>ROBIN\n</b>We'll work them out together.\n\nThey kiss. Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater. He looks frightening. Then he starts \ncoughing uncontrollably. He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(between coughs)\nWhat just happened? Where am I?\n(remembers)\nOh yeah, I was trying to kill you.\n\nHe leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock. He squeezes until Steven passes out. The he lays \nhim on the ground.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(to Robin)\nIt's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it\non Sly Stallone in \"Rocky Three.\" He\nshould wake up in thirty seconds, so\nlet's get going.\n\nHe holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish.\n\nSteven slowly wakes up. He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the \nrdio antenna. He quickly gets up to follow them.\n\n<b>126 EXT. ANTENNA - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna. Steven follows them up from a distance.\n\nThe Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna. The Cable Guy holds Robin \nwith one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand. Steven climbs onto the \nplatform.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Easy.\n\nHe walks with Robin to the edge of the platform. There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish \nbelow. A police helicopter hovers in the air around them.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>It didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm\njust trying to show you the kind of\nthings that can happen when you mistreat\npeople.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Don't do anything stupid.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>You know this is just like that secen in\nthat Clint Eastwood movie \"Dirty Harry\" --\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>(snaps)\nNo! This is not like anything! This is\nnot a movie! We're real people! You're\nhurting us! This is reality!\n\nThe Cable Guy's eyes turn sad. This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch. Dazed, he lets go of \nRobin. She runs to Steven's arms.\n\nFrom below we hear the sound of sirens. A pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna. \nThe Cable Guy's expression changes. He begins to look like a scared little boy.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>If this is reality...\n(he climbs onto the guard railing)\n...I am outta here.\n\nThe Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Nooo!\n\nSteven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other \nhand.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>You're not going anywhere.\n\nThe Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish. Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto \nthe platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>Don't do this. You just need help. We all\nget lonely.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>Yeah, but I get really lonely.\n(beat)\nI mean, look at me.\n\n<b>STEVEN\n</b>You're gonna be fine. Just come on up.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>(a long beat)\nSteven, I think I sat too close to the\ntelevision. Mommy was right.\n\nSteven can't hold onto his forearm any longer. The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto \nhis hand at the last possible second.\n\n<b>CABLE GUY\n</b>It's too late for me, but there's a lot\nof little Cable Boys out there who still\nhave a chance. Say good-bye to the baby-\nsitter.\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\nThe Cable Guy stops holding onto Steven's hand. He begins falling toward the dish below.\n\n<b>126A\tEXT.
