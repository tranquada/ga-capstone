The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint \nimage of a television program. Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly \nimage.\n\nThe camera pulls back very slowly. We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch \ntelevision.\n\nThe camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote\ncontrol. The hand changes channels frantically.\n\nThe camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN BARTOWSKY, thirty\nyears old, sitting on his couch. He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception.\nUnfortunately for him \u0096 his cable is not hooked up.\n\nSTEVE\n(looks at watch)\nJesus, where's the cable guy already?\n\nEND OF CREDIT SEQUENCE\n\n1A\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\nIt is a stylish old apartment. There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor. Steven has just \nmoved in. The phone rings.\n\nSTEVEN\n(into the phone)\nHello.\n\n2\tNEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nWe see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough \nlooking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television \nset.\n\nON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic \non the screen says \"Sam Sweet Trial Update.\"\n\nRICK\nHow's the move going?\n\n3\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\nSteven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations.\n\nSTEVEN\nHorrible. The cable guy is missing in\naction. Apparently he's going to be here\nsometime between eight AM and my death.\n\nRICK\nYou haven't called Robin have you?\nPlease tell me you didn't call her.\n\nSTEVEN\n(sarcastically)\nNo, I'm giving her space.\n(beat)\nI can't believe she's doing this.\n\nRICK\nYou never should have asked her to marry\nyou. You're the mad smotherer.\n\nSTEVEN\nAll she had to do was say no. She didn't\nhave to kick me out. I feel like Felix\nUnger.\n\nRICK\nYou forced her to evaluate the\nrelationship. If you didn't propose she\nwould never have realized how unhappy she\nwas.\n\nSTEVE\nI don't want to talk about it.\nSo what time are you going to come by?\n\nRICK\nI can't. I'm working double shifts the\nrest of the week.\n\nSTEVEN\nIt's my first night here. Don't do this\nto me.\n\nRICK\nThe other camera guy pulled out his back.\nBesides, I spent the last two weeks with\nyou on my couch. Isn't that enough?\n\nSTEVEN\nFine, fine.\n\nRICK\nOne piece of advice. Slip the cable guy\nfifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie\nchannels for free. Even the dirty ones.\n\nSTEVEN\nI couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff.\nWhat if he says no? I'll feel like an\nidiot.\n\nRICK\nNone of them say no, believe me. I'll\ntalk to you later.\n\nSteven hangs up, and waits.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n4\tINT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\nSteven continues unpacking. He is very neat. He opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his \nex-girlfriend. He looks at one sadly, considering whether or not to put it on display. He puts it \nback in the box.\n\n4A\tEXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\nEstablishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties. A moving truck \npulls into a gated side garage.\n\n5\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER\n\nMovers deliver a small breakfast table and chairs. Steven directs them as to where to put them.\n\nCLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 3:52 P.M.\n\n6\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER\n\nSteven puts a few feet of tin foil on his antenna to help the reception. He changes channels. Still \nnothing. He pulls it off frustrated.\n\n7\tINT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\nMany of the boxes are gone. Steven lies on the couch, staring at the ceiling, fidgeting. He is unable \nto fill his day without cable.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhere the hell is he?\n\n8\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER\n\nSteven paces back and forth across the room. He stares at his watch frequently.\n\nCLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 5:12 P.M.\n\n9\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER\n\nSteven slowly eats a sandwich in his empty kitchen. He looks at the clock. It says five-thirty. He \npicks up the phone and dials. A machine picks up.\n\nROBIN (VO)\nHi, this is Robin. Leave a message. If\nyou are trying to reach Steven he can now\nbe reached at 555-3837.\n\nSteven hangs up.\n\n10\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SUNSET\n\nSteven does sit ups. He looks at the clock.\n\nCLOSE UP OF THE CLOCK - 6:48 P.M.\n\nSTEVEN\n(to himself)\nForget it. Idiots.\n\nHe gets up, and walks into the bathroom.\n\n11\tINT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\nSteven gets undressed. He turns on the shower, adjusts the heat, then gets in. He tries to lose his \ntension by letting the hot water engulf him. He takes some shampoo, and lathers up his hair.\n\nTHE DOORBELL RINGS\nSTEVEN\n(annoyed)\nOh great.\n\nTHE DOORBELL RINGS SEVERAL TIMES\n\nSteven jumps out of the shower, soaking wet, throws on a bathrobe and runs to the door.\n\nSTEVEN\nDon't leave! I'm here! I'm here!\n\n12\tINT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nSteven runs to the door.\n\nCABLE GUY (OS)\nHello! Cable Guy!\n\nSteven reaches the door, and looks through the peep-hole.\n\nP.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE\n\nThe CABLE GUY is walking away.\n\nINT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY\n\nSteven opens the door and yells to the Cable Guy.\n\n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)\n\nSTEVEN\nHey, wait!\n\nThe Cable Guy turns back.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWell, look who decided to show up. I was\njust gonna go collect my retirement\npension.\n\nThe Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he \nspeaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality.\n\nSTEVEN\nYou were supposed to be here four hours\nago.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWas I? So I'm the tardy one. Good to\nknow.\n\nSTEVEN\nYes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath\nplace, but now it's closed.\nCABLE GUY\n\n(turns to leave)\nMaybe I shouldn't have come at all \u0096 jerk\noff!\n(turns back smiling)\nI'm just joking. Let's do this.\n(looks around)\nOh, the old McNair place. I never thought\nthey'd get the floors clean after what\nhappened here.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat happened?\n\nCABLE GUY\n(long beat)\nThey had a lot of cats.\n\nThey walk into Steven's living room.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a\ncomment card.\n\nHe pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him.\n\nCABLE GUY\nPlease mail it in when I am done.\n\nSTEVEN\nThese go to your boss?\n\nCABLE GUY\nNo, they go to me. I'm a\nperfectioniss\u0085 perfectioniss\u0085\n(he strains to lose his lisp)\nperfectioniss\u0085t.\nNow let's take a look at what we're\ndealing with.\n\nThe Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space.\n\nCABLE GUY\nCome on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me\nbaby. Tell me where you like it. That's\nit baby.\n\nHe zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHere's your sweet spot.\n\nHe pulls out his drill, and begins drilling.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSo your lady kicked you out.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat?\n\nCABLE GUY\nIn preparing your service I noticed you\nwere previously wired across town at 1268\nand a half Chestnut. Last week the\nbilling was transferred to one Robin\nHarris. Smells like heartbreak to me.\n\nSTEVEN\nI really don't want to talk about it with\nyou. Could you please just install my\ncable? I'm going to get dressed.\n\nCABLE GUY\nNo sweat.\n\nSteven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I\ncan access the floorboards. Don't be\nspooked if you hear someone crawling\nunderneath you.\n\nSTEVEN\nOkay, whatever.\n\nSteven walks toward his bedroom.\n\nCABLE GUY\nPut on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be\nchannel surfing in no time.\n\nThe Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke.\n\n13\tINT. - STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\nCLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION\n\nRIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio.\n\nRIKKI KLIEMAN\n(to camera)\nSo ends day fifty-four of the trial of\nformer child star Sam Sweet who has been\naccused of shooting his twin brother,\nStan, in cold blood. The twins were\nstars of the hit sitcom \"Double Trouble\"\nwhich aired from nineteen seventy-seven\ntill nineteen eighty-four.\n\nA video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at \nvarious ages. Included is the cast photo of \"Double Trouble.\" Pictured in the photo are eight-year-\nold Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad.\n\nWe see a brief clip from \"Double Trouble,\" starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of \nSam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.\n\nRIKKI KLIEMAN\n(to camera)\nLife wasn't so sweet after the cancellation\nof their program. Hollywood chewed them\nup and spit them out. A frustrated Sam\nturned to petty larceny, while his more\nimpressionable brother, Stan, fell in\nwith a fringe cult called \"The\nBrotherhood of Friends.\" Reduced to\ntabloid fodder a fury was growing inside\nof Sam. A burning need to be recognized\nas an individual, not a person famous for\nhaving an identical twin. A need that\ntook the form of four shotgun blasts on\nthe night of November fourteenth. And so\ntoday his attorneys continue the unusual\ndefense of \"Twin Envy.\"\n\nANGLE ON\n\nSteven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.\n\nSTEVEN\nHow's it going?\n\nThe Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say \"quiet.\" His eyes never leave the TV.\n\nCABLE GUY\nGuilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I\nhope they fry this bastard.\n\nSteven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the \nroom impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs \nblocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation \nimpossible.\n\nSTEVEN\n(looks around)\nWhat happened?\n\nCABLE GUY\n(jumps to his feet)\nThe arrangement of your major appliances\nand your furniture was causing some noisy\npics and hum bars in your reception. I\nmoved a few things. Cleared it right up.\nIs that cool?\n\nSTEVEN\n(non-confrontational)\nI\u0085 guess so.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou programmed?\n(off of Steven's look)\nThen let me slave your remotes.\n\nHe picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at \neach other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.\n\nCABLE GUY\nOoh, maybe we should leave these two\nalone.\n\nSTEVEN\nSo after this I'll only need one remote\nfor everything?\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou know you're pretty good at this. You\ncould be a cable guy yourself.\n(he finishes)\nNow let me check your levels.\n\nWith amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he \nclicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving \nkids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.\n\nCABLE GUY\nAll right. That about does it. I just\nhave some paperwork for you to fill out.\nSign here.\n\nSteven does.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThat gave me power of attorney over you.\n(beat)\nJoking.\n\nSteven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too \nlong. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want \nto leave.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI'm about finished here.\n(beat)\nOkay. I feel good about this.\n\nCable Guy walks to the door.\n\nSTEVEN\nOne thing.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(turns back immediately)\nYeah!\n\nSTEVEN\nI\u0085 uh\u0085 I have this friend and he said\nhe gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he\ngot free movie channels. Have you ever\nheard of anything like that?\n\nCABLE GUY\n(deadly serious)\nYou mean illegal cable?\n\nSTEVEN\nUh\u0085 yes.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWho told you that? I want his name.\n\nSTEVEN\nForget it.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou're offering me a bribe? What you\nhave just done is illegal, and in this\nstate if convicted, you could be fined\nfive-thousand dollars or spend six months\nin a correctional facility.\n\nSTEVEN\nPlease\u0085 that was dumb. I was just\nmaking conversation \u0096\n\nCABLE GUY\n(laughs)\nI'm just jerking your chain. Wake up\nlittle snoozy. I'll juice you up. All\nit is is a push of a button.\n\nHe puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door.\n\nSTEVEN\nOh, great. How much?\n\nCABLE GUY\nDon't worry about it. I couldn't charge\nyou. Your girl just booted you.\nConsider it one guy doing another guy a\nsolid.\n\nSTEVEN\nThat is so nice.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be\nsurprised how many customers treat you\nlike shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or\nsomething.\n(hands him a card)\nHere is my personal beeper number. It's\njust for my preferred customers. Never\ncall the company, they'll just put you on\nhold.\n\nSTEVEN\nThanks. Really.\n(holds up comment card - jokes)\nYou're gonna get some good marks here.\n\nCABLE GUY\nMaybe some day I'll take you out to the\nsatellite and show you how all this stuff\nworks. It's really incredible.\n\nSTEVEN\nSure. We should do that one day.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHow 'bout tomorrow?\n\nSTEVEN\nTomorrow? Tomorrow's not good.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWhat are you going to do, sit home and\nstew about your ex?\n\nSTEVEN\nNo.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(insulted)\nOh, okay. I guess I crossed the line.\nSorry.\n\nSTEVEN\n(guilty)\nYou didn't cross the line.\n\nCABLE GUY\nNo? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty.\nOn the flip side.\n\nThe Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider. Steven cannot believe he just got roped into \nthat.\n\n(End Revision - Pink)\n\n14\tINT. CITYWIDE LAND DEVELOPERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\nSteven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers. His boss, HAL DANIELS, looks \nimpressed.\n\nSteven pulls a sheet off of an architect's model of a condominium complex.\n\nSTEVEN\n\u0085There are twenty-four classrooms; each\ncan be converted into a 1400 square foot\nhome. The facility has two tennis courts,\nan Olympic size pool and full gym, with a\nstage if the residents decide they want\nto perform \"Oklahoma.\"\n\nEveryone laughs. Steven is very good at his job.\n\nSTEVEN\nThe kitsch appeal of living in an old\nschoolhouse should be very attractive to\nyoung, upwardly mobile home buyers. And\nmost important, the structure is\navailable in foreclosure. If we put down\na cash bid, we're going to steal this\nthing.\n\nThere is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm \naround him. They speak as the meeting breaks up.\n\nMR. DANIELS\nGreat work Steve-o. So you're feeling\ngood?\n\nSTEVE\nYeah.\n\nMR. DANIELS\nDid I hear something about you having\nsome troubles at home?\n\nSTEVE\nRobin and I have been having a difficult\ntime. I moved out, but I really think\nit's only temporary.\n\nMR. DANIELS\nGotcha. I love this project, but it's a\nbig mother. Know what I mean? If it\nfails, corporate's going to have my ass.\nI've got confidence in you, but you hear\nwhere I'm coming from, bro?\n\nSTEVEN\nAbsolutely. Now I've got more time than\never. It's a good thing.\n(laughs)\nI know I can pull this thing off.\n\nMR. DANIELS\n(playfully)\nThen what are you doing talking to me?\nYou've got a lot of work to do. Get to\nit!\n\nSTEVEN\nThank you. I will.\n\nHal goes down the stairs to his office. Steven watches him disappear, then turns to his secretary, \nJOAN.\n\nSTEVEN\nI'll be right back.\n\n14A\tINT. SASSY MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY\n\nSteven walks through the halls looking for Robin's office.\n\n15\tOMITTED\n\n16\tINT. ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY\n\nROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at \"Sassy Magazine.\" \nHer office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are \npapers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has \nwritten.\n\nSteven peeks his head in her door.\n\nSTEVEN\nHello.\n\nRobin's face drops.\n\nROBIN\nSteven, what are you doing here?\n\nSTEVEN\nI was just in the area. Thought I'd pop\nby. How's work? How'd the big teen crush\narticle come out?\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\nROBIN\nThey liked it.\n(beat)\nI thought we agreed we weren't going to\nsee each other for a month.\n\nSTEVEN\nI know, it's just Daniels accepted my\nproposal to renovate the old schoolhouse.\n\nROBIN\nThat's wonderful, congratulations.\n\nSTEVEN\nI know I'm breaking the rules, but come\nhave dinner with me tonight to celebrate.\n\nROBIN\nI don't think we should.\n\nSTEVEN\nCome on, this is the biggest day of my\ncareer.\n\nROBIN\nDon't put me in this position.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat position? I want to share this with\nyou.\n\nROBIN\n(feeling pressured)\nI love you, but I need to take some time\non my own to see how I feel. You agreed\nto this. I mean\u0085 this is exactly why we\nbroke up, because you never listen to me.\n\nSTEVE\nWhat? Now we're broken up? What\nhappened to 'trial separation?'\n\nROBIN\nI can't get into this now. If you haven't\nnoticed, I'm at work.\n\nSTEVE\nSorry to disturb you.\n\nHe turns to leave.\n\n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)\n\nROBIN\n(sincerely)\nSteven. Congratulations. I know how\nmuch this means to you. You deserve it.\n\nSTEVEN\nThanks.\n\nHe leaves.\n\n17\tOMITTED\n\n17A\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SIX-THIRTY P.M.\n\nSteven is watching television. He looks lonely and depressed. He clicks around in a daze, never \nstopping for more than a second.\n\nHe hears a horn honking outside.\n\nCABLE GUY (OS)\nSteven!!!! Stev-ey!!!! Let's go!!!!\n\nON THE TV - A commercial for Medieval Times Restaurant.\n\nSteven walks over to the window and sees The Cable Guy standing in front of his van, leaning in \nhis window honking the horn.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSteven!!!!\n(waves)\nHey buddy!!! Come on down!!!\n\nSteven waves and then steps back from the window. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at the \ntelevision.\n\nON THE TV - The local news.\n\nREPORTER\nComing up next a special report,\n\"Loneliness, America's Silent Killer.\"\n\nSteven looks back out the window and sees the Cable Guy smiling and waving for him to come \ndown.\n\nSTEVEN\n(begins walking to the door)\nWhat the hell.\n\n18\tEXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK\n\nSteven walks from his apartment to the customized van. On the side of the white van it says, \"The \nCable Company - Get Wired Today.\"\n\nSTEVEN\nHow's it going?\n\nCABLE GUY\nHowdy partner. Climb aboard.\n\nSteven gets in.\n\n19\tINT. VAN - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe van drives onto the main boulevard.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThanks for coming out. You know most\npeople think cable is just a simple co-ax\nthat comes out of the wall. They never\ntake the time to understand how it works.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhere exactly are we goin?\n\nCABLE GUY\nWe're going to take a ride on the\ninformation superhighway.\n\n20\tEXT. CITY - DUSK\n\nBirds eye P.O.V., shot follows the Cable Guy's van as it drives through the city.\n\nCABLE GUY\n\u0085It all started in Lansford,\nPennsylvania where Panther Valley\nTelevision, with the assistance of Jerrod\nElectronics, created the first cable\ntelevision system.\n\nThe van drives up into the hills, finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain, \noverlooking the entire city.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI went to Lansford once. It's the Cable\nGuy's Mecca. It was very emotional.\n\n21\tEXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK\n\nSteven and the Cable Guy get out of the van, and walk down a trail.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI come here to think sometimes. To clear\nmy head.\n\nThey turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a \none-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's \ncontrols are located.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThere she is. Right now she's sending\nentertainment and information to millions\nof satisfied citizens.\n\nSTEVEN\nThat's pretty impressive.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSee, I knew the moment I met you that\nyou would appreciate this.\n\nThe Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(with wonder)\nThe future is now. Soon every American\nhome will integrate their television,\nphone, and computer. You'll be able to\nvisit the Louvre on one channel, and\nwatch female mud wrestling on\nanother. You can do your shopping at\nhome, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend\nin Vietnam. There's no end to the\npossibilities.\n(waves to Steven)\nCome on up! What are you waiting for?!\n\n22\tINT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT\n\nThe Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSometimes I'll sit here and imagine that\nthere are billions of bits of information\nsurging through me.\n\nSTEVEN\nI've watched a lot of TV in my life. I\nguess I've always taken it for granted.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWhen I was a kid my mom worked nights.\nNever met dad. But the old TV was always\nthere for me.\n\nSTEVEN\nI know what you mean. My dad was there,\nbut he might as well have been gone. My\nmom is a stewardess. She was always out\nof town.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(moved)\nThat's tough. You must have a lot of\nabandonment issues. Reality isn't \"Father\nKnows Best,\" it's a kick in the face on\nSaturday night. But what doesn't kill us\nmakes us stronger, right?\n\nSTEVEN\n(tentative)\nYou know my brother's a speech therapist.\n\nThe Cable Guy sits up. He looks angry.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSo?\n\nThere is a long silence. Steven doesn't know how to react.\n\nSTEVEN\nNever mind.\n\nThe Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(beat)\nSo, you're pretty love struck about your\nlady, huh?\n\nSTEVEN\nI miss her. I asked her to marry me, and\nshe asked me to move out.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI hate that.\n\nSTEVEN\nShe said she felt pressured. Can you\nbelieve that?\n\nCABLE GUY\nWomen are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I\ndon't think you listen to her. I think\nyou try to tell her what she wants to\nhear. She wants you to thirst for\nknowledge about who she is. All the\ncomplicated splendor that is woman. When\nyour love is truly giving, it will come\nback to you ten-fold.\n\nSTEVEN\nYou're right. That is remarkably\ninsightful.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYeah, it was Jerry Springer's final\nthought on Friday's show.\n\n23\tEXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER\n\nThe van pulls up in front of Steven's apartment building.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou know what? Women are suckers for\n\"Sleepless in Seattle.\" It's on HBO this\nmonth. That's your bait right there.\n\nSTEVEN\nRobin loves that movie.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThey all do. Next time you talk to her\ntell her you're cooking yourself dinner,\nand watching it by yourself. Sound like\nyou're happier than a pig in shit.\nShe'll come running. Betcha. Then just\nplay it cool.\n\nSTEVEN\nMaybe I will.\n\nSteven gets out of the car.\n\nSTEVEN\nThanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say\nthis, but I don't know your name. What\nis it?\n\nCABLE GUY\n(touched)\nYou really want to know my name? You do?\nReally? It's Ernie Douglas. But my\nfriends call me Chip.\n\nSTEVEN\nI'll see ya' Chip.\n\nBefore he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes.\n\nCABLE GUY\nLet's just remember right now. You know\nsome people walk through their entire\nlives and never find a true friend.\n(long pause)\nI guess we're the lucky ones.\n\n(End Revised - Pink)\n\nSTEVEN'S P.O.V. - The Cable Guy is in slow motion. He blinks once.\n\nSTEVEN\nUh\u0085 good-bye.\n\nCABLE GUY\nLater buddy. I'll catch ya' on the\nflip side.\n\nSteven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable.\n\n24\tINT. COFFEEHOUSE - NEXT DAY\n\nSteven and Robin are talking. Robin does not look happy to see him.\n\nSTEVEN\nI don't listen to you. I pretend to\nunderstand but I'm really just saying\nwhat I think you want to hear. So from\nnow on I'm going to try my best to listen\nmore because I do love you and am\ninterested in learning about every detail\nabout the complicated splendor that is\nyou.\n\nRobin looks at him, somewhat shocked.\n\nROBIN\nOh.\n\nSTEVEN\nI want us to get back together, but I can\nsee why taking this time might be good\nfor us. So, I'm not mad.\n\nAfter a long beat, Robin smiles.\n\nROBIN\nSometimes time apart is healthy.\n\nSTEVEN\nYou're right. Well, that's what I came\nhere to say. Look, I've got to get back\nto the office.\n\nHe starts getting up.\n\nROBIN\nSo, are you doing anything tomorrow?\n\nSTEVEN\nI'm just going to cook myself dinner and\nwatch a movie. \"Sleepless in Seattle\" is\non cable.\n\nROBIN\nReally?\n\nSTEVEN\nIf you're around you should drop by and\ncheck out the new apartment.\n\nROBIN\nOkay, maybe I will.\n\nHe exits the room. As he does we see a television broadcasting the Sweet case.\n\nON MTV - Sam Sweet sits behind the defendant's table. TABITHA SOREN is giving the news \nupdate.\n\nTABITHA SOREN\nToday in the Sam Sweet case the\nprosecution played the 911 call that Sam\nSweet made the night he murdered his\nbrother. Keep in mind, he confessed one\nmonth later.\n\nThe courtroom listens to a 911 phone call. The transcription is seen on the screen.\n\nSAM SWEET V ON THE TAPE\n(crying and babbling)\nHello, please send help. My twin brother\nhas been shot.\n\n911 OPERATOR\nSlow down sir. What happened?\n\nSAM SWEET\nOh my god, they shot him with a shot gun\nfour times. I mean I think it was a\nshotgun. Who would do such a thing?! I\nthink it was an Asian gang or something.\nThey were speaking some other language.\n\nSam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear.\n\nTABITHA SOREN\nHmm. Who indeed? Coming up next, a rare\ninterview with Michael Jackson's zoo-\nkeeper.\n\n25\tINT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY\n\nSteven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends. It is a competitive, \nbut friendly game. Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts.\n\nSTEVEN\nHere, here, here.\n\nA player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up.\n\nRICK\n(to himself)\nShit! My fault! My fault!\n\nSTEVEN\nNot your fault. I'm in the zone. There\nis no stopping me today.\n\nPlay begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who \ncatches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The \nball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it \nhits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the \nCable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I\nwas just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd\nrun the court for a couple of innings.\n\nRICK\n(gestures to injured player)\nGreat. We need another man.\n\nSTEVEN\nThis is\u0085 Chip Douglas\u0085 my cable guy.\n\nRick smiles in recognition.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWe met about a week ago during a routine\ninstallation, but I feel like I've known\nhim my whole life.\n\nSteven can't believe this is happening.\n\nRICK\nOh really. That's sweet. All right Chip\nDouglas, you're on shirts. Let's play.\n\nCABLE GUY\nNo, I want to be on Steven's team. I'm\nskins.\n\nThe Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt. Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he \nis rippled with muscles. The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is \nscary.\n\nJEFF\nI don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just\nplay.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWait a sec'. I've got to warm up.\n\nThe Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone \nstares at him until he finishes.\n\nCABLE GUY\nLet's get it on!\n\nSTEVEN\nAre you any good?\n\nCABLE GUY\nFeed me under the boards and you'll find\nout.\n\nPlay begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as \nhumanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. \nHe couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot \nwhich goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(doing the traveling hand signal)\nTraveling! That's traveling!\n\nRICK\nYeah, whatever you say Chip.\n\nEveryone runs down the court, ignoring him.\n\nCABLE GUY\nAll right, so we're playing that type of\ngame. Prison rules. I get it.\n\nSteven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss \ncrosses all over the court.\n\nCABLE GUY\nFeed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm\nopen!\n\nSteven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the \nprocess. The ball goes in.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(does the foul hand signal)\nAnd one! That's definitely a foul!\n(to Jeff)\nYou want to mug me, my wallet is in my\nother pants.\n\nSTEVEN\n(to Cable Guy)\nWhat are you doing?\n\nCABLE GUY\nDon't play from fear Steven. We can take\nthese guys.\n\nMUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V.\n\na. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it \ndown.\nb. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including \nRick.\nc. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. \nThe Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders \nwith Rick.\nd. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down \nhard.\n\nCABLE GUY\nTake it to the hole!\n\nSteven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs \nhis own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the \nground. The ball does not go in.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHey, are you okay?\n\nHe pulls Steven up.\n\nSTEVEN\nYeah. I'm fine.\n\nCABLE GUY\nLet's switch. I'll cover Rick.\n\nThe cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare.\n\nSteven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to \nthe basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball.\n\nRICK\n(enraged)\nWhat the hell was that? That's it. I've\nhad enough.\n\nEveryone begins to exit the court.\n\nJEFF\nThanks for bringing your \"friend\".\n\nThe Cable Guy runs up to Rick.\n\nCABLE GUY\nGood game.\n(slaps Rick on the butt)\nYou were tough out there. Your play\nbrought me up to a higher level. I mean\nthat.\n\nRICK\n(dismissive)\nYeah.\n\nHe shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat are you doing?\n\nCABLE GUY\nIt was payback time. I was protecting\nyou.\n\n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)\n\nSTEVEN\nYou ruined the game.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI don't appreciate your tone Steven.\nThat's not the way friends speak to each\nother.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat are you talking about? I don't even\nknow you!\n\nCABLE GUY\nWell let's fix that. Let me buy you a\nHeineken?\n\nSTEVEN\nNo, I'm going home.\n\nSteven turns to leave.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWell, uh, I guess we'll talk later. I've\ngot to go shower up and do some stuff.\nI'll call you if I get a chance. Or you\ncall me\u0085 or something.\n\nThe Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the \ncable guy extends his palm out low by his knee.\n\nCABLE GUY\nAnd down low.\n\nSteven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven \ngives him a low five just so he can leave.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(pulls his hand away so Steven misses it)\nToo slow. Have a good one.\n\nSTEVEN\n(as he walks away)\nYeah, have a good one.\n\n26\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT NIGHT\n\nSteven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of \nwine. He opens the oven, and checks on dinner. It is almost ready. Then he checks his message \nmachine as he prepares the meal. He begins chopping an onion.\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\nMESSAGE VOICE\nYou have eleven messages.\n\nSTEVEN'S MOTHER\n(ON THE MACHINE)\nSteven, it's mom. Give me a call. I'm\nstill your mother.\n\nSTEVEN'S FATHER\n(ON THE MACHINE)\nI'm getting on. Steven call your mother.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(ON THE MACHINE)\nHey Steven. Just checking in. Give me a\nring. I'm at 555-4329.\n(beep)\nWhat's up Steven? I'm at a pay phone. If\nyou're there pick up. Pick up. Pick up.\nOkay, I'll be home later. I'll talk to\nyou then.\n\nSteven stops chopping.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(ON THE MACHINE)\n(beep)\nOkay I'm home now. Give me a buzz when\nyou get in. I'll be here pretty much all\nnight. Bye.\n(beep tone)\nHey Steven. Quick question, give me a\ncall when you get a chance.\n(beep tone)\nI was just taking a whiz, thought you\nmight have called. Okay later.\n(beep tone)\nSorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to\nit, thought it might have been you. All\nright, bye.\n\nSteven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the \nrest of the calls.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(fast forwards)\n\u0085We're having ourselves quite a little\ngame of phone tag here. You're it!\n(fast forwards)\n\u0085I was just blow drying my hair and I\nthought I heard the phone ringing.\n(fast forwards)\n\u0085you're a tough man to reach.\n(fast forwards)\nI guess you're too busy to call your\nfriends.\n\n(Revision Ends - Blue)\n\nSteven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then \u0096\n\nCABLE GUY\n(ON THE MACHINE)\n(long beat - then quiet and distant)\nShit.\n\nThe doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed \ncasually, but looks beautiful.\n\nSTEVEN\nHey, good to see you.\n\nThere is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello.\n\nSTEVEN\nCome on in. What do you think of the\nplace?\n\nShe looks at the odd placement of furniture.\n\nROBIN\nYou made some interesting choices laying\nout the room.\n\nSTEVEN\n(embarrassed)\nThat's actually where the movers put the\nfurniture. I'm gonna change it, very \nsoon.\n\nROBIN\nNo, I like it.\n\n27\tINT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\nThe food is all eaten. Steven and Robin are sitting on the couch having an awkward conversation.\n\nROBIN\nSo how's work?\n\nSTEVEN\nWork's good.\n\nROBIN\nHow's Hal?\n\nSTEVEN\nDon't get me started. That guy has no\nvision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo.\nHe's just worthless.\n\nROBIN\nIt's just great that you're getting to do\nit. It's a real step up.\n\nSTEVEN\nI know. Now if only someone at corporate\nsmartened up enough to dump Hal, then I\ncould really get some stuff done.\n\nROBIN\nIt's nice to see you doing so well.\n\nSTEVEN\nWell, it's nice just to see you.\n(looks at his watch)\nHey, it should be starting.\n\nThey sit on the couch. Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven. Steven turns on the television. The \nscreen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the \nsignal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume.\n\nSTEVEN\nDamn cable is out. Son of a bitch.\n\nROBIN\nIt's alright. We can watch it another\nnight.\n\nSTEVEN\nNo, no. We really should see it now.\nNow's a good time.\n\nHe plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't.\n\nSTEVEN\nWait, wait. I know what to do.\n\nHe walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials \nit, then presses the number in.\n\nSTEVEN\nThe Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll\njust page him. We'll have this fixed in\nno time.\n\n(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)\n\nSteven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone. The moment he is finished dialing \u0096\n\nTHERE IS A KNOCK - THE CAMERA WHIP PANS TO THE DOOR\n\nSteven walks to the door and opens it. Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and \ndisturbed, different than we've ever seen him before. Steven is startled.\n\nSTEVEN\nThat was\u0085 fast.\n\nCABLE GUY\nIs there a problem with your service?\n\nSTEVEN\nYeah\u0085 my cable went out.\n\nSteven pushes him out into the hall.\n\nCABLE GUY\nReally?\n\nThe Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSo you called me. Interesting how you\ncall when you need something. Is that how\nyou treat people?\n\nSTEVEN\nI've been really busy. You've got to get\nmy cable going, Robin is here. This is\nreally important.\n\nHe peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back \nout.\n\nCABLE GUY\nBut calling me back isn't?\n\nSTEVEN\nI'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWhy should I help you? I gave you free\ncable. What have you ever done for me?\n\nSTEVEN\nAnything you want. Name it \u0096 quickly.\n\nCABLE GUY\nTomorrow night, we hang out.\n\nSTEVEN\nFine, whatever you want.\n\nCABLE GUY\nGod bless you. You're too good to me.\n\nThe Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(loud-normally)\nAll set.\n\nSTEVEN\nSo what's with the cut cord?\n\nCABLE GUY\n(nonchalantly)\nThat's for effect. See ya' tomorrow\nSteven.\n(conspiratorially)\nShe's pretty. And don't kiss her. Don't\neven touch her. Fight the urge at all\ncosts. It will pay off later with\u0085\n\nHe makes a motion which implies sex.\n\nCABLE GUY\nEnjoy the flick.\n\nThe Cable Guy walks away. Steven walks back inside.\n\nROBIN\nWho was that?\n\nSTEVEN\nNobody.\n\nSteven sits down next to Robin. Robin moves next to him. Steven looks very happy.\n\n28\tON THE TV\n\nA scene from the film \"Sleepless in Seattle.\"\n\nThe camera pulls out and reveals the Cable Guy watching the film in the back of his van \u0096 alone. \nWe cannot see much of the inside of the van because the only light is that of the television, but we \ncan tell that he lives there.\n\n29\t(SCENE 29 OMITTED)\n\n30\tEXT. PARKING LOT - DUSK\n\nThe Cable Guy and Steven walk across a parking lot. Steven has his eyes closed.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSorry about yesterday. I was in kind of\na weird mood. How'd things go with you?\nKeep 'em closed.\n\nSTEVEN\nPretty well. We'll see. Look, about the\nother night. I didn't appreciate you --\n\nCABLE GUY\nDon't peek. I want this to be a\nsurprise.\n\nSTEVEN\nI really don't need to be surprised.\nWhere are we going?\n\nCABLE GUY\nOnly the best restaurant in town.\n\nThey walk around a corner.\n\nCABLE GUY\nOkay, here we are. Open sesame.\n\nSteven opens his eyes.\n\nThe camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which \nsays \"MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT.\"\n\nSTEVEN\nMedieval Times?\n\nCABLE GUY\nI know what you're thinking. Don't\nworry, I'm buying.\n\n31\tINT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER\n\nThe Cable Guy and Steven are walking to their table. All the seating overlooks a large, circular \narena, the kind a rodeo is held in. The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed \ndecor. All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc.\n\n(Revision Ends - Pink)\n\nSTEVEN\nFunny. I never thought I would ever\ncome here.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI love this place. I come here twice a\nweek.\n\nA Hispanic woman with a large butt walks by. The Cable Guy is transfixed.\n\nCABLE GUY\nOh man, that's my look. I love big\nbutts. Ow, that hurts.\n\nHe grabs his crotch and squeezes, as if it's the only way he can control himself.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThere oughta be a law. Man she is hot.\nIt's just not fair.\n\nSTEVEN\n(gestures to him squeezing his crotch)\nPlease don't.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou know what I need right now? Pooooon\ntang. And I'm not talking about the\nplace in Vietnam.\n\nSTEVEN\nGood to know.\n\nThey sit down. The WAITRESS walks over. She is dressed in peroid clothes, but is not \nenthusiastic about her job.\n\nWAITRESS\n(flatly)\nWelcome to Medieval Times. My name is\nMelinda. I'll be your serving wench.\nMay I get you something from the bar\nkeep?\n\nCABLE GUY\n(too into it)\nDost thou have a mug of ale for me\nand me mate? He has been pitched in\nbattle for a fortnight an has a King's\nthirst for the beer thust thou might have\nfor thust.\n\nWAITRESS\n(uninspired)\nI'll be right back my lord.\n\nThe Cable Guy puts something together.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThere you go.\n\nHe hands Steven a paper crown. They both put theirs on.\n\nSTEVEN\nThanks for the help.\n\nThe Cable Guy sees something. His eyes widen.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSteven, don't turn around, but there is a\nwoman eyeing you like you are a piece of\nmeat and she hasn't eaten in a week.\n\nSteven acts like he isn't interested, but he is.\n\nSTEVEN\nReally? What does she look like?\n\nCABLE GUY\nShoe's a hottie. I wish she was checking\nme out. Man -- she is on fire! Total\nrobo-babe.\n\nSTEVEN\nAre you serious?\n\nCABLE GUY\nDon't look.\n\nSTEVEN\nI've got to look.\n\nCABLE GUY\nOkay, but play it cool. Just turn like\nyou are looking for the waitress.\n\nSteven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She \nis in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life. Steven turns back to the \ncable Guy, annoyed.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHa-ha. I'm just messing with your mind.\nBut you fell for it man. You are one\nhorny Indian Chief.\n\nSTEVEN\n(not laughing)\nYou got me.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSo what did you want to rap about?\n\nThe trumpets go off, the lights go down and the show begins.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHold that thought. Show's on.\n\nThe Cable Guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above the arena.\n\n32\tON THE STAGE - A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE ALAN RICKMAN IN \"ROBIN \nHOOD\" SPEAKS TO THE CROWD\n\nHOST\nWelcome to a magnificent journey into the\npast. This is Medieval Times!\n\nThe entire crowd, filled completely with white trash tourists, applauds.\n\nHOST\nAre you prepapred for a night of feasting\nand sport the likes of which ye will\nnever forget?!\n\nThe audience applauds.\n\nHOST\nI charge you to stand up on your feet and\ncheer for your section's knight!\n\nON THE STANDS - Each section of the crowd is painted a color that corresponds with a knight. \nThe Cable Guy stands up and cheers like he is at a wrestling match. Steven remains seated.\n\nCABLE GUY\nLet the games begin! The Red Knight\nrules! Blue Knight! You're going down!\nGoing down!\n\nAn embarrassed Steven applauds politely. The Cable Guy sits down.\n\n33\tINT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER\n\nON THE FLOOR - In the center of the room two Knights are fighting with swords while on \nhorseback.\n\nON STEVEN AND THE CABLE GUY - They are eating whole chickens with their bare hands \nwhile watching the show.\n\nSTEVEN\n(to the Watiress)\nCould I get a knife and fork?\n\nWAITRESS\nThere were no utensils in Medieval Times,\nso there are no utensils at 'Medieval\nTimes.' Do you want a refill on that\nPepsi?\n\nSTEVEN\nThere were no utensils, but there was\nPepsi?\n\nWAITRESS\nLook, I have a lot of tables to get to.\n\nThe waitress exits.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(stands up - yells to the competitors)\nSpill his blood! Take his kead! Show no\nmercy!\n\nThe two knights fight with swords. After a few moments of battle the Red Knight wins.\n\nThe crowd erupts. The Cable Guy goes crazy.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(to Steven)\nCome on, get into it, we won!\n\nReleuctantly, Steven stands up and applauds.\n\nSTEVEN\n(halfheartedly)\nWay to go Red Knight. Good job of\nkilling. Good work.\n\nSteven and the Cable Guy sit down.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSo, what were you saying before?\n\nSTEVEN\n(tentatively)\nHow do I put this? I've really enjoyed\nhanging out with you, but...\n\nCABLE GUY\nThat's why I became a cable guy. To make\nfriends like you. Every time I walk up to\na new door, that door is a possibility\nfor friendship. When I walked in your\napartment I knew there was something\nthere. I just knew it.\n\nSTEVEN\n(sotto)\nOh lord.\n(tries to get back on track)\nI want you to know --\n\nThe lights change. Trumpets play a fanfare. The host walks out onto the stage, interrupting \nSteven.\n\nHOST\nWe have reached the climax of our\ncompetition good people! Now, two noble\nmen from our audience will battle to the\ndeath to resolve a grievance. Will a\nMaster...\n(looks at his clipboard)\nSteven M. Bartowsky and Lord Ernie\nDouglas make you way to the fighting\npit!\n\nA spotlight shines on them. Steven is shocked.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat's going on?\n\nCABLE GUY\nWe're going to do battle. It'll be fun.\n\nSTEVEN\nIs this a normal part of the show?\n\nCABLE GUY\nNo, but I give all the Knights free\ncable. They said it would be cool if we\njust went at it for a little while.\n\nTwo PIMPLY FACED SERFS from the show come and lead them away.\n\nSTEVEN\nIs this safe?\n\nCABLE GUY\nThat's what the armor's for.\n\n34\tINT. FIGHTING PIT - LATER\n\nSteven and the Cable Guy are being dressed in armor by the two serfs. The Cable Guy could not \nbe happier. Steven is freaked out.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat are we supposed to do? We've got to\nbe careful we don't hurt each other.\n\nThe Cable Guy doesn't answer him. He has his game face on.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI cannot listen to any of your\ninstructions for you are my sworn enemy,\nand are about to meet your demise.\n\nBefore Steven can answer him the trumpets blare.\n\nHOST\nLet the battle begin. Come now people,\nlet me hear your voices!\n\nThe crowd cheers. Music plays. The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to \nthe center of the pit.\n\nThe Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven \nmirrors him, not sure of what to do.\n\nSTEVEN\nJust take it easy.\n\nThe Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. \nThe sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and \npokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his \nshield.\n\nSTEVEN\n(enraged)\nWhat are you doing?!\n\nCABLE GUY\n(matter of fact)\nI'm trying to kill you.\n\nThe Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled \nwall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield.\n\nSTEVEN\nHey, watch it!\n\nThe Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the \nground.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThis is just like when Spock had to fight\nKirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forced\nto do battle.\n\nSteven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him. He swings at the Cable Guy with his \nsword, just missing him. The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThat's the spirit. Let's give 'em a good\nshow.\n\nSteven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the \nCable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on \nthe ground.\n\nBy the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSo that's how it's gonna be, huh? All\nright. If you want to play rought, Daddy\ncan play rough.\n\nThe Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, \nsending him to the ground.\n\nThe Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy \nsilver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar \nweapon, and then begin to circle each other.\n\nSTEVEN\nChip, this isn't funny! Will you stop\nit!\n\nCABLE GUY\nThe name is Spock. If we don't battle to\nthe death, they'll kill us both. Good-bye\nJim.\n\nHe swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the \"Star Trek \nBattle Music\" as they fight.\n\nSTEVEN\nThis isn't 'Star Trek!'\n\nMUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC\n\nThey bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes \nSteven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The \nCable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing \nand roll in a vicious battle.\n\nThen the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part \nof Steven's protection.\nSTEVEN\n(looking down)\nJesus.\n\nThe Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of \npounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting \nstick.\n\nThe show's host runs up to Steven.\n\nHOST\nQuickly, muster a top your steed.\n(Steven doesn't move - the host drops character)\nGet on the god damn horse! I don't think\nhe's kidding!\n\nLeft with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse \nsending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy.\nSTEVEN\nDon't do this!\nCABLE GUY\nJim, we have no choice!\nSTEVEN\nOh my god.\n\nThey run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one \nanother Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick.\nThe Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, \nthrows off his helmet.\nSTEVEN\n(concerned)\nAre you okay?\n\nThe Cable Guy sits up and smile at him.\nCABLE GUY\nWell done good sir. You are the victor,\nbut we shall meet again.\n\nThe two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the \narena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms \nin triumph, and smiles.\nDISSOLVE TO LATER:\n35\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\nThey are walking up the stairs.\nCABLE GUY\nYou've got a real warrior's instinct.\nSTEVEN\nI've got to admit there's a real feeling\nof power holding that jousting stick.\nCABLE GUY\nIf Robin saw you tonight, she would be\nbegging you to take her back.

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nSteven turns on the lights.\nCABLE GUY\nWhat do you think?\n\nSteven's entire stereo system and TV have been replaced with a sixty-five inch television, laser disc \nplayer, karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system. All top of the line.\nSTEVEN\nWhat is this?\nCABLE GUY\nI took the liberty of updating your in\nhome entertainment system.

Steven drops the staple \ngun in the pouch. The Cable Guy never touches it.\n36A\tINT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY\nSteven dials the phone. On his computer screen a graphic reads \"HELLO STEVEN - HAVE A \nWONDERFUL DAY.\"\nSTEVEN\n(into the phone)\nRobin, it's Steven again. I'm still\ntrying to reach you. Okay, I'm at work.\nCall me.\n\nHe hangs up. He is getting frustrated. The door opens. Hal Daniels sticks his head in, but does not \nenter.\nMR. DANIELS\nHow's it going?\nSTEVEN\nGood.\nMR.

Have fun.\nROBIN\nI will.\nSTEVEN\nFine. Bye.\n\nSteven hangs up the phone. The Cable Guy appears, and hands him a beer.\nCABLE GUY\nThis is just a sign that you need to live\na little. She's having fun, and you\nshould too.\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\nSTEVEN\nYou're probably right.\nCABLE GUY\nDamn right I'm right.\nSTEVEN\nOh, I got you a little something.\n\nHe hands a box to the Cable Guy.\nCABLE GUY\nI thought you said we were even.

The box says, \"Lose Your Lisp in Thirty Days.\" The Cable Guy is so moved he \ncannot speak.\nSTEVEN\nMy brother said it might help with your\nlisp.\n\nThe Cable Guy looks Steven in the eye for a long beat, then hugs him hard.\nCABLE GUY\nWords cannot express\u0085\n(he is too moved to finish his sentence)\nSTEVEN\nIt's no big deal.\nCABLE GUY\nYes it is.\n\nHe stares at Steven until it makes him uncomfortable.\nCABLE GUY\nNow I'm on a mission.

This woman is all over\nyou like a lamp-shade.\nSTEVEN\nShut up.\n\nHe turns and sees a stunning woman standing in the middle of a group of male and female misfits. \nWhen he looks at her, she smiles. He quickly turns back.\nCABLE GUY\nDid it just get hotter in here?\n(grabs his crotch)\nOh, that hurts.\nSTEVEN\nWho'd she come with?\nCABLE GUY\nI don't know, but she looks pretty\navailable to me.

This girl\nis really into me.\nRICK\nYou're whacked man. That guy is bad\nnews.\nSTEVEN\nYou don't even know him. You're just mad\n'cause he kicked your ass in basketball.\nRICK\nI can't even deal. I'm outta here.\n\nON THE CABLE GUY - At the karaoke area. He speaks into the microphone.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHello everyone. First of all I'd like to\nthank Steven for being such a terific\nhost.\n\nSteven smiles, and does a half wave to everyone as they applaud.\n\nCABLE GUY\nDon't forget to kick in some spinach for\nthe beer.

That was just what I\nneeded.\n\n(Revision Ends - Blue)\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou look like a new man.\n\nSTEVEN\nI feel like a new man. I was getting so\nused to being rejected.

Don't tell me you didn't\nknow.\n\nSTEVEN\nI can't believe this.\n\nHe sits in a chair, and leans over in pain.\n\nCABLE GUY\nShe's clean I assure you. I tried her out\nlast week to make sure she was top\nquality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not\na drip. She's the best, ask any of my\nfriends.\n\nSteven cringes.\n\nSTEVE\nYou've got to be kidding? Please tell me\nshe's a friend of yours. You're just\nplaying with my mind again, right?\n\nCABLE GUY\nI wish I had friends like that.\n\nSTEVEN\nGet out of my house!\n\nCABLE GUY\nDon't be ashamed of yourself. I know she\nwas a working girl, but she kind of liked\nyou. You might have been able to\nget a freebie.\n\nSTEVEN\nOut, now! I don't ever want to see you\nagain.\n(to himself)\nRobin is never going to forgive me.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI'll tell you how to handle that. Don't\ntell her. You want to get her back, I'll\nhelp you get her back.\n\nSTEVEN\nI don't want your help. I want you to\nleave.\n(gestures to the TV)\nAnd take that stuff out of here.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(calmly)\nWhatever. I can take a hint. I'll see\nya'.\n\nThe Cable Guy exits.\n\n42\tOMITTED\n\n43\tEXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\nP.O.V. Shot - Robin and a date enter the restaurant.\n\nWe move to reveal the Cable Guy driving up in his van. He watches them from across the street.

The HOSTESS walks over to him.\n\nHOSTESS\nMay I help you?\n\nCABLE GUY\nNo, I'm meeting someone here.\n\nHe looks around the restaurant, then spots Robin and a handsome, chiseled man at a table. They \nare on a date. The Cable Guy looks angry. He walks to the restroom.\n\n45\tINT. RESTROOM - NIGHT\n\nAn OLDER BATHROOM ATTENDANT stands in front of the sinks. On the counter sits a \nvariety of toiletries. A MAN washes his hands. The bathroom attendant hands him some paper \ntowels. The man puts a tip in the basket, and exits.\n\nBATHROOM ATTENDANT\nMost appreciated.\n\nThe Cable Guy walks over to the bathroom attendant. He dramatically whips out a twenty dollar \nbill, and puts it in front of the bathroom attendant's nose.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou've been working hard. Take a break.\n\n46\tINT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER\n\nRobin is talking to her date RAY. He is handsome, and somewhat goofy. They have empty salad \nplates in front of them.\n\nRAY\nMy brother and I wanna start our own sun\nblock company. But the twist is, it's\nonly for skiing. SkiBlock. Or SunSki.\nWe haven't decided yet. Maybe BlockSki.\nDo you think that sounds good?\n\nROBIN\nBlockSki? That sounds right.\n\nRAY\nSo, Gail told me you're just coming off a\nrelationship.\n\nROBIN\nWell, not really. We're kind of in a\nholding pattern. He wants more of a\ncommitment, but I don't think I'm ready.\nI just want to have a good time for a\nwhile.\n\nRAY\nThen we got to get you on a Skidoo!\n\nROBIN\nSkidoo?\n\nRAY\nHigh powered snow mobile. It'll blow\nyour mind. It flies over powder like\nit's glass.\n\nTheir waitress passes by.\n\nRAY\n(impatiently)\nHey, how are you doing on that chicken?\nHave the eggs hatched yet? Thanks.\n\nRobin is mortified by his behavior.\n\nRAY\nSo, how's your work going?\n\nROBIN\nIt's been crazy. They just hired a \u0096\n\nRAY\nHold that thought. I have to use the rest\nroom. Be right back.\n\nHe leaves. Robin looks relieved to have a break.\n\n47\tINT. RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\nRay enters the restroom. The Cable Guy is now wearing the bathroom attendant's blue shirt white \npants and a thin fake moustache. A DISTINGUISHED MAN walks over and washes his hands.\n\nMAN\n(to Cable guy)\nTowel please.\n\nCABLE GUY\nMy pleasure.\n\nThe man puts out his hand to take the paper towel, but the Cable Guy doesn't hand it to him, he \ngrabs the man's hands and surrounds them with several paper towels, and begins drying them \nfuriously. When he's done, he takes a beat and wipes them over and over, just to make sure they're \ndry. The man is aghast.\n\nCABLE GUY\nEnjoy your meal\n\nThe man exits. Ray walks toward the stalls.\n\nCABLE GUY\nGood evening sir. Pleasant night, isn't\nit?\n\nRAY\n(curt)\nYeah.\n\nCABLE GUY\nBut I guess the weather's always pleasant\nin here. The winters are remarkably mild.\n\nHe laughs at his own joke. Ray walks into the handicapped stall.\n\nCABLE GUY (OS)\nIf you need anything, just let me know.\nAnything at all.\n\nRAY\n(getting annoyed)\nI think I can handle it.\n\nRay unzips his fly, and prepares to pee standing up. Suddenly, as if out of thin air, the Cable Guy \nis standing right behind him. He speaks into Ray's ear, startling him.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI'm here to serve you.\n\nRAY\nJesus! Get out of here!\n\nCABLE GUY\nMost people never bother to take\nadvantage of all my services, for\ninstance \u0096\n\nThe Cable Guy grabs the back of Ray's shirt, kicks his feet out from under him, and slams his face \ninto the toilet bowl, sloshing it around. Ray struggles, but the Cable Guy is too strong.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI can help you wash up. Cleanliness is\nso very important.\n\nHe pulls his face out.\nCABLE GUY\nThen once you're done I have a variety of\nskin care products which can make you\nlook years younger.\n\nThe Cable Guy kicks the door open, and pulls Ray toward the counter. He grabs a bottle of lotion.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThis lotion is superb at removing liver\nspots.\n\nHe slaps it onto Ray's face.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThis one is an excellent moisturizer.\n\nThe Cable Guy pours some after cologne into his hands, and rubs his hands together as if he's \nabout to put it on Ray's face.\n\nCABLE GUY\nAnd one can never underestimate the\neffects of a good cologne.\n\nThe Cable Guy rears back and slaps Ray across the face.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(sniffs)\nMm\u0085 High Karate. And now a touch of\npowder.\n\nHe takes a large powder puff, and smashes it into Ray's face temporarily blinding him.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(grabs a tweezer)\nOoh, I almost forget, it's oh so very\nimportant to be properly tweezed.\n\nThe Cable Guy plucks several hairs out from between Ray's eyebrows.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou're on a big date, you'll need fresh\nbreath.\n\nHe takes a clear jar of combs, and pours the blue fluid and the combs into Ray's mouth.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWhoops, that's not mouth wash. But that\nreminds me. Proper hair care is a must.\n\nThe Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part.\n\nCABLE GUY\nLooking good, now let's dry you off.\n\nHe runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer. It turns on. The Cable \nGuy puts his face right up next to the air.\n\nCABLE GUY\nNow suck it. Suck the air!\n\nRay hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut \nexperiencing heavy G-Force.\n\nCABLE GUY\nfrom this angle you look just like Neil\nArmstrong experiencing G-Force. I\nbelieve you have the \"right stuff.\"\n\nThe Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket.\n\nCABLE GUY\nDon't worry about the tip. But I've got\none for you.\n(whispers into his ear)\nStay away from Robin. She's taken.\n\nHe tosses him out the door.\n\n47A\tINT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe door opens, and Ray falls to the floor.\n\n47B\tINT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS\n\nRobin sits alone at her table. She looks at her watch.

That man is devoted to you.\nYou know I'm probably crossing a boundary\ntelling you this, but he's really crazy\nabout you.\n\nROBIN\nDid he say that?\n\nCABLE GUY\nOnly every five minutes. Quite frankly,\nI'm sick of hearing it. No, I'm just\nkidding with you.\n(looks her deeply in the eyes)\nHe's a good man. He mentioned that you\nguys have had some problems.\n\nROBIN\nWell, it's a little complicated.\n\nCABLE GUY\nIt always is. You know I asked a woman to\nmarry me once.

I can't\nbelieve this.\n\nSTEVEN\nThis is the first time she asked to get\nback together.\n\nRICK\nYou do this every time. You only call me\nafter a girl breaks your heart. \"Oh Rick\ncan I stay on your couch? Let's talk all\nnight about how mean girls are.\" Then as\nsoon as a relationship starts again\nit's bye-bye Rick. I don't know why I\nfall for it anymore.\n\n55\tOMITTED\n\n56\tEXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nIt is raining. Rick pulls up, and drops Steven off.\n\nSTEVEN\nCan't you get someone else\nto go?\n\n(Revision Ends - Blue)\n\nRICK\nMaybe I'll take MY cable guy.\n\nSteven gets out of the car. Rick drives off. Steven walks up the steps to his apartment. The Cable \nGuy appears from behind a corner.\n\nCABLE GUY\nPretty smooth work. I set 'em up, you\nknock 'em down.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat?\n\nCABLE GUY\nRobin. I got her back for you. I juiced\nher up.\n\nSTEVEN\nHow do you know we're back together?\n\nCABLE GUY\nFree cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.\n\nSTEVEN\nI don't want you messing around with my\nlife. You've caused enough trouble as it\nis.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI know. I felt bad about the other night,\nso I wanted to make it up to you. So\nwhat are you doing? Do you want to catch\na bite?\n\nSteve looks the Cable Guy in the eye.\n\nSTEVEN\n(sincerely yet curt)\nLook, I appreciate you helping me out\nwith Robin. But you have to understand,\nI'm going to have to work extra hard to\nnot screw this relationship up again.\nYou're a great guy, but I just don't have\nany room in my life for a new friend. Do\nyou understand?\n\nCABLE GUY\nI appreciate your honesty. You're a real\nstraight shooter.\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\nSTEVEN\nSo, you're okay?\n\nCABLE GUY\nHey, I'm a big boy. It's no big deal.\nWhatever.\n\nSTEVEN\nAll right\u0085 well, take care.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHave a good one.\n\nThe Cable Guy walks away. Steven stands there feeling a little guilty about what he just did. \nMUSIC UP.\n\n57\tINT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nON THE TV - Conan O'Brien is doing a monologue joke about Sam Sweet.\n\nSteven and Robin are kissing. Outside it is raining. There is occasional lightning and thunder. In \nthe middle of kissing, lightning flashes. Steven looks up and sees a flash of the Cable Guy staring \ndown at them, his faced pressed against the skylight. In the next flash he is gone. Was it real? \nSteven looks scared.\n\nROBIN\nAre you alright?\n\nSTEVEN\nI'm fine.\n\nThey go back to kissing.\n\n57A\tEXT. TELEPHONE POLE/INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nThe Cable Guy and Robin are speaking on the phone. As the conversation continues we slowly \npull back and reveal that the Cable Guy is standing on the top of a telephone pole, dressed as a \nphone company employee. He speaks into a repairman's phone which is illegally hooked into the \ntelephone pole.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHey, it's Chip Douglas.\n\nROBIN\nChip Douglas?\n\nCABLE GUY\nYour cable guy.\n\n(Revision Ends - Blue)\n\nROBIN\n(surprised to hear from him)\nOh, hi. What's up?\n\nCABLE GUY\nI feel kind of weird calling you. It's\njust\u0085 I'm worried about Steven.\n\nROBIN\nWhat is it?\n\nCABLE GUY\nSomething isn't right. He hasn't been\nhimself lately. Have you noticed\nanything?\n\nROBIN\nNo, things are actually going really\nwell.\n\nCABLE GUY\nGood.\n\nROBIN\nShould I be worried?\n\nCABLE GUY\nNope. I'm probably just being a nervous\nnellie. Let's just keep our eyes open.\n\nROBIN\n(nervous)\nI will. Good-bye.\n\nShe hangs up, then dials Steven's number.\n\nROBIN\nSteven Bartowsky please.\n\n57B\tINT. STEVEN'S SECRETARY'S DESK - CONTINUOUS\n\nHis secretary, JOAN, answers the phone.\n\nJOAN\nSorry Robin. He's in a meeting.\n\n58\tINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\nA dozen of the top employees of the company Steven works for are having a meeting. Steven \nlistens intently as a SALES MANAGER speaks to the group.\n\nSALES MANAGER\nThe response to our initial offering has\nbeen remarkable. A local investment\ngroup has decided to buy the entire\ncomplex and turn them into rentals. In\nretrospect I must admit we made one big\nmistake.\n\nEveryone hangs on his every word.\n\nSALES MANAGER\nWe should have asked for more money.\n\nThe entire room laughs. Mr. Daniels stands up.\n\nMR. DANIELS\nI just want to put this out there,\nStevey. You did it bro. You laid your\ncajones, and mine, out on the table, and\nyou slam dunked it. Way to go.\n(nervously jokes)\nNow watch, they'll kick you upstairs\nahead of me. All right, in other\nbusiness\u0085\n\nAs Mr. Daniels speaks, Joan tries to get Steven's attention from a crack in the door.\n\nJOAN\n(quietly)\nPssst. Steven.\n\nSteven turns and sees her. She waves for him to come to her. He waves her off.\n\nJOAN\n(more urgently-quietly)\nI really need to speak with you.\n\nSome people are beginning to notice this exchange.\n\nSTEVEN\n(curtly)\nIt can wait.\n\nRight then two POLICE OFFICERS storm into the room. Joan stands behind them looking \nconcerned.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER\nIs there a Steven Bartowsky here?\n\nSTEVEN\nUh\u0085 I'm Steven Bartowsky. What's going\non?\n\nPOLICE OFFICER\nYou are under arrest.\n\nMR. DANIELS\nOn what charge?\n\nPOLICE OFFICER\nReceipt of stolen merchandise.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat? I never \u0096\n\nPOLICE OFFICER\nPlease put our hands on the table.\n\nSteven moves a sudden move toward the Police Officer. The Officer jabs him in the ribs with his \nclub. Steven groans, then leans over in pain.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER\nPlease follow my instructions. Hands\non the table.\n\nSteven puts his hands on the table. The Officer kicks his legs apart, then frisks him in front of \neveryone. It is pure humiliation.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER\nHands behind your back.\n\nThe other Officer cuffs him, then turns him around.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER #2\nYou have the right to remain silent.\nAnything you say may be used against you\nin a court of law. You have the right to\nan attorney. If you cannot afford an\nattorney one will be provided for you.\nDo you understand?\n\nSTEVE\nThis is all a mistake. I didn't accept\nany stolen goods.\n\nJust then it hits him. He hears the Cable Guy's voice in his head.\n\nCABLE GUY (V.O.)\n(with echo)\n\u0085you're getting THX quality sound that\nwould make George Lucas cream in his\npants \u0096 cream in his pants.\n\nHe pushes him toward the door. Steven looks at everyone's horrified faces as he is taken away. He \ntries to break the tension with a joke.\n\nSTEVEN\nHey, relax. I'm the one who's going to\njail.\n\nNobody laughs. He exits.\n\n59\tEXT. OFFICE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER\n\nSteven is walked to a police car, and put inside.\n\nWe slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop. He is looking under the hood of his car. \nApparently it has broken down. The man turns and we see that it is the Cable Guy covertly \nwatching Steven's humiliation. As the policeman pushes Steven into the car he looks at the Cable \nguy and touches his nose. The Cable Guy touches his nose.\n\n60\tINT. POLICE STATION - LATER\n\nSteven is chained to a bench. He is speaking to his father EARL, a stout man of sixty, and his \nLAWYER.\n\nEARL\nI can't believe you did this.\n\nSTEVEN\nI didn't do anything. My cable guy gave\nme all that stuff as a present.\n\nEARL\nA stereo system and a big screen TV as a\npresent? You expect me to believe that?\nYou know you're killing your mother with\nthis.\n\nSTEVEN\nI swear it's true.\n\nEARL\nWhy would you accept such extravagant\ngifts?\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\nSTEVEN\nI don't know. I shouldn't have.\n\nEARL\nWhat is really going on here Steven? Are\nyou on something?\n\nSTEVEN\nI'm fine! I didn't do anything! Please\ncall my cable guy, his name is Ernie\nDouglas.\n\nLAWYER\nSteven, the police looked into it, nobody\nnamed Ernie Douglas works for 'The Cable\nCompany.'\n\nEARL\nYou want to tell us the truth now\n\nSTEVEN\n(falling apart)\nThat's got to be a mistake. Oh, this\nis not happening.\n\nEARL\nYes it is, and it's killing your mother.\nDid you deliberately want to ruin our\nfortieth anniversary party on Monday,\nSteven?\n\nSTEVEN\nYeah, Dad, I did. It's all a big plan.\n(to the lawyer)\nWhen can you get me out of here?\n\nLAWYER\nUnfortunately it's too late to get a bail\nhearing today. You're going to have to\nspend the weekend in county lock up.\n\nSTEVEN\nThe entire weekend?\n\n61\tOMITTED\n\n(Revision Ends - Blue)\n\n62\tINT. PRISON - LATER\n\nSteven is now wearing prison blues. He holds a pillow and a set of sheets as he walks down the \nlong corridor to his cell. Lining each side are cells filled with angry prisoners who throw things at \nSteven, and taunt him as he walks by. It is a nightmare.\n\nPRISONER #1\nNew meat! Look at the pretty boy!\n\nPRISONER #2\nNobody touches him, he's mine! You touch\nhim, you're dead!\n\nPRISONER #3\nIs baby scared? Don't cry baby!\n\nThey all laugh and scream at him until he reaches his cell. A guard opens the door. Steven enters \nhis cell. He turns and inside is an angry looking prisoner. The door is locked behind him.\n\nANGRY PRISONER\nOoh, looks like I won the lottery.\n\n63\tOMITTED\n\n64\tINT. VISITORS ROOM - MORNING\n\nA guard walks Steven in. His lawyer sits on the other side of the glass with his back to Steven. \nSteven sits down and picks up the phone, excited to hear any news.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat did you hear? What did you hear?\n\nThe man turns around. It is not Steven's lawyer, it is the\nCable Guy dressed in an expensive suit.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHello Steven. I came as soon as I heard.\n\nSteven's head sinks.\n\nSTEVEN\nWho are you?! What's your real name?!\n\nCABLE GUY\nSo many questions.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhy are you doing this to me?\n\nCABLE GUY\nI didn't do this to you, you did this to\nyou. You need to learn who your friends\nare.\n\nSTEVEN\nYou set me up.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI taught you a lesson. I can be your best\nfriend, or your worst enemy. I hope\nyou'll choose the latter\u0085 I mean, the\nformer. You know what I mean.\n\nSTEVEN\nI'll never be your friend. You need help.\n\nThe Cable Guy absorbs the blow, then goes on the offensive.\n\nCABLE GUY\nRight now I think you're the one who\nneeds help. I'm here to give you comfort.\n\nThe Cable Guy huts his hand up to the glass.\n\nCABLE GUY\nCome on, touch it.\n\nSteven just stares at him.\n\nCABLE GUY\nCome on. You need human contact. Touch\nit.\n\nSTEVEN\nI will not touch it.\n\nThe Cable Guy stands up, and begins unbuttoning his shirt.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhat are you doing? Stop it.\n\nSteven looks around frantically.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI know how you're feeling right now.\n\nThe Cable Guy pushes his naked breast against the glass. Other prisoners are beginning to stare.\n\nSTEVEN\n(smacking the glass)\nStop it! Stop it!\n\nCABLE GUY\nI'm here for you.\n\nSTEVEN\n(smacks the glass three times)\nGet off there! Are you trying to get me\nkilled?\n\nThe Cable Guy begins to laugh.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(as he buttons his shirt)\nI was just messing with your mind. That\nwas from 'Midnight Express.' Awesome\nfilm. Oliver Stone won the Academy Award\nfor the screenplay.\n\nSTEVEN\nGuard! Guard!\n\nCABLE GUY\nDon't you worry about Robin, I'll make\nsure she's well taken care of.\n\nSTEVEN\nYou go near her, I'll kill you.\n\nSteven lunges at the glass. Steven's guard pulls Steven out of the room toward the exit.\n\nSTEVEN\nHey, this is the guy who framed me!\n\nThe Cable Guy walks to his door. He turns to the guard at the door.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(warmly)\nLouis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on\nPay Per View? I told you it's more fun\nwhen it's Free Per View.\n\nThey both laugh. The door closes behind them.\n\n65\tEXT. OUTDOOR CAF\u00c9 - DAY\n\nThe Cable Guy is sitting at a table wearing a Walkman.

Believe me.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI know we don't know each other very\nwell, but we do have one thing in common, \nour concern for Steven.\n\nROBIN\nWell, you were right. Something's\nhappening with him and he won't even\nacknowledge it.\n\nCABLE GUY\nIf he refuses to admit he has a problem,\nwe may have to let him hit bottom. He's\ngonna need some tough love.\n\nROBIN\n(tentatively)\nYou know his lawyer said that nobody\nnamed Ernie Douglas works for the Cable\nCompany.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(chuckles)\nDid he do a name search? 'Cause I work\nunder a pseudonym so the customers won't\nharass me at home. Kind of like a\nstripper. My real name is Larry, Larry\nTate.\n\nROBIN\nAnd he's saying he received all the\nstereo equipment from you.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(I know, and I'm not mad. He's been\ncornered, so he's telling some wives\ntales. He doesn't mean to hurt me.\n\nROBIN\nI just feel like I triggered this with\nhim. It's not that I don't want to get\nmarried, it's just I felt like he wanted\nto get married just to get married. I\ndon't deal well with pressure.\n\nCABLE GUY\nHey, welcome to the human race. We're\nnot perfect. We all think we have to\nlook like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as\nwitty as 'Seinfeld.' Give yourself a\nbreak.\n\nROBIN\nGod I could go for turkey and mashed\npotatoes now.\n\nCABLE GUY\nComfort food.

He\nwon't leave me alone.\n\nROBIN\nSounds familiar.\n\nSTEVEN\nYou know he was the one who beat up your\ndate at that restaurant. That's right.\nAnd he gave you the free cable. It wasn't\nme.\n\nROBIN\nBut you took the credit for it?\n\nSTEVEN\nThat's what he wanted. He was\nmanipulating me. It feels so good to be\nhonest about this. We're finally\ncommunicating.

How?\n\nSTEVEN\nWith a photograph.\n\nROBIN\nOf what?\n\nSTEVEN\nMe with a... prostitute.\n\nROBIN\nWhat?!\n\nSTEVEN\nHe set it up.

I invited\nyou. You were out on a date.\n\nROBIN\nAnd you were with a prostitute.\n\nSTEVEN\nShe seduced me. That's what they do.\nThey're professionals. And I didn't even\nknow she was a prostitute.\n\nROBIN\nSo that makes it better?\n\nSTEVEN\nThat's not the point. The point is this\nguy has been setting me up. He's\nresponsible.\n\nROBIN\nHe didn't have sex with a whore. You\ndid.\n\nSTEVEN\nRobin you don't --\n\nROBIN\nI don't want to hear it. Breaking up was\nthe best thing we ever did. You have\nsome serious problems, and it's not my\nresponsibility to help you.

It is black and white surveillance video, digitized to the \ncomputer format. The video is of Robin and Steven talking. It is the conversation they had before \nthey watched \"Sleepless in Seattle.\"\n\nSTEVEN\nWork's good.\n\nROBIN\nHow's Hal?\n\nSTEVEN\nDon't get me started. That guy has no\nvision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo.\nHe's just worthless.\n\nROBIN\nIt's just great that you're getting to do\nit. It's a real step up.\n\nSTEVEN\nI know. Now if only someone at corporate\nsmartened up enough to dump Hal, then I\ncould really get some stuff done.\n\nThe sccene starts again. It is on a loop. Steven is aghast.

Where are\nyou?!!!\n\nSuddenly they all stop simultaneously, and then the only sound is a miniacle laugh echoing through \nthe garage.\n\nSteven runs to his car, and gets in. He drives up the ramp in a panic. From out of nowhere the \nCable Guy steps into the beam of his headlights. He cannot stop in time. The Cable Guy is thrown \ninto the air, then lands on the back of the roof of the car. Before he falls off he grabs on to the bar \nof the luggage rack.\n\nSteven looks through his rear view window and sees the Cable Guy staring at him.\n\nAs Steven continues to drive the Cable Guy climbs on to the roof of the car, then jumps on the \nhood, and stares at Steven through the windshield. Steven swerves around, almost losing control \nof the car.\n\nSTEVEN\nLeave me alone! I have no job, no\ngirlfriend, no family anymore! It's\nover! You won!\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\nCABLE GUY\n(menacingly)\nOh no. It's not over. It's just gettin'\nstarted.\n\nHe turns a corner very sharply throwing the Cable Guy off his car.

STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nQuick cuts of Steven bolting doors, and locking windows.\n\nRICK (VO)\nHe was fired for beating up a customer\nwho yelled at him for being late.

STEVEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nSteven is watching television. He struggles to stay awake.\n\nON THE TV - Court TV. The prosecutor in the Sam Sweet trial is speaking.\n\nPROSECUTOR (ON TV)\nDon't let your memories of these cute\ntwins distract you from the fact that\nthis funny star of a situation comedy\nkilled his own brother in cold blood,\nthen called the police and said he was\nkilled by an Asian gang. There was no\nlaugh-track on that night.\n\nThe prosecutor's words turn into gibberish as Steven's eyes go heavy and he falls asleep.\n\n99\tON STEVEN - HE IS ASLEEP\tHE SLOWLY WAKES UP.\n\nThe gibberish turns into clearly spoken words, only this time the voice sounds more familiar.\n\nON THE TV - We see the Sam Sweet trial. A prosecutor makes a passionate final summation. We \nreveal that it is the Cable Guy.\n\nCABLE GUY\nThis man killed his own brother. Some\npeople don't even have a brother...\n\nThe camera pushes in on the Cable Guy's face. He looks to camera.\n\nCABLE GUY\n...do they Steven? Are you listening to\nme? Don't shut it off. Don't shut it --\n\nON STEVEN - He shuts off the TV, and walks out of the room.\n\n100\tINT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe entire apartment appears much larger. Steven walks down the hallway. He looks into the \nliving room and sees Rick.\n\nRICK\nWhy do you keep icing me man?\n\n100A\tINT. ELONGATED BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nHe opens up a door and sees an elongated version of his bathroom. The shower is steaming. The \ntwo eight year old Sweet twins stand in front of it looking very spooky. He quickly closes the \ndoor.\n\n100B\tINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\nHe continues down the hallway and opens the door to the dining room, but when he opens it he \nsees Robin's bedroom.\n\n100C\tINT.

THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE\n\nThe Cable Guy begins to run full speed at the door. As he does he gets bigger and bigger, and \nmore distorted as he come closer to the peephole. BANG! He hits the door. Then disappears from \nframe. A moment later he stumbles back into frame, then walks to the far end of the hall, and runs \nagain to the door even faster. BANG! He staggers back into position again. He runs toward the \ndoor.\n\n102\tINT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\nSteven runs away from the front door. The door smashes open, and the Cable Guy runs after him.\n\nSteven runs away down the hallway. The hallway appears to be a mile long. He tries to run fast \nbut appears to move in almost slow motion. Every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the \nCable Guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him, grunting like a wolf. He looks \nback another time and the Cable Guy is gone.\n\nHe keeps running, and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller, till he can barely fit through. \nHe becomes trapped at the end of the hall. Arms come out of the window behind him and grab \nhim. Fifty Cable Guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI just want to hang out. No big deal.\n\nSteven breaks free of the hands and runs into his living room.\n\n103\tOMITTED\n\n104\tINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nSteven runs in. The television is on. He sits on the edge of the couch not sure what to do.\n\nHe puts his head down. When he looks up, he sees the Cable Guy's face on the television set. The \nCable Guy's face stretches out from the television, getting larger and larger.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSteven, you're just like me. We're cut\nfrom the same cloth. We're one and the\nsame!\n\nThen it opens its mouth, and swallows Steven pulling him into the television.\n\n105\tINT.

It'll just be a sec.\n\nHe clicks over. Steven just sits there, waiting. Waiting some more. Then the Cable Guy clicks \nback.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSorry about that. Where was I? Oh yeah.\nYou're going to feel my wrath.\n\n107\tINT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nSTEVEN\n(pleading)\nDon't do this. There must be some way\nfor us to work this out.\n\n108\tINT.

Where are you?\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\nCABLE GUY\nI'm close. So very close.\n\nThe camera rotates and reveals that the Cable Guy is actually lying down. Then the camera rises \nup and reveals that the Cable Guy is lying in the floorboards right underneath Steven. A single \nbeam of light shines across his face. As he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his \nface. He never acknowledges it.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou know, I don't think you're right for\nRobin. She needs someone who can be\nsensitive to her needs. Someone who\nunderstands her soul.\n\nSTEVEN\nYou stay away from her.\n\nCABLE GUY\nAren't we the control freak. Looks like\nyou're starting to sweat.\n\nSTEVEN\nI got the camera. You can't see me.\n\nSteven begins to pick his face.\n\nCABLE GUY\nOh yeah? Then why are you picking your\nface?\n\nSteven throws the phone. When it lands we see the speaker phone light is on. He begins looking \nfor the camera. He smashes his TV.\n\nJUMP CUTS - Steven tearing through everything in his apartment.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou're getting closer.\n\nSteven overturns a CD rack.\n\nCABLE GUY\nPity, such a nice CD rack. You know\nsometimes the answer is right under your\nnose.\n\nSteven lloks at the floorboards, then runs out of the room, and returns a moment later with an ax. \nHe starts chopping at the floorboards, tearing the out.\n\nHe looks down into the hole, he sees nothing. Then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face \ninto the space in the floor. The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad \nman. He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole. Steven falls back. He hears \nthe Cable Guy scuttle away.\n\nSteven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the \naftermath of the Cable Guy's exit. He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him, \nthen through the side walls, and away into the distance. When it clears he discovers a small \nmakeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace.\n\nThere are a few photos pasted to the floorboards. One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing \nnext to his mother. Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the \nCable Guy's brother. The only other photo is of Jerry Springer. Steven sees a small television \nmonitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him. He looks at a \ncellular phone. Every speed dial on the back of the phone says \"Steven\" next to it.\n\nSteven gets up, and runs out of his front door.\n\n108A\tEXT.

ROBIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nSteven's car screeches to a stop. He runs up to Robin's door and starts knocking. Her FEMALE \nNEIGHBOOR opens her door.\n\nSTEVEN\nBe home! Be home!\n\nFEMALE NEIGHBOOR\nGo away! I remember you. You're her\nobsessive boyfriend. She said you might\ncome here. I'm calling the police.\n\nShe closers her door. He runs off.\n\n109A\tEXT.

Steven?\n\nIn the distance he sees Steven standing in the shadows.\n\nSTEVEN\nHey Rick. I'm really excited to hear\nwhat you found out about this nut.\n\nRICK\nI hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply\ntroubled. Only child. His mother was\narrested for prostitution, and phone\nsolicitation. Apparently she was some\nphone sex pioneer.\n\nSTEVEN\nNo way.\n\nRICK\nAnd get this, he was discharged from the\nMarines. He got mad at his Sergeant so\nhe sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two\nusing a Radio Shack computer. And that's\nnot the half of it.\n\nAs Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, \nbut the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of \nSteven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp).\n\nCABLE GUY\nReally? Tell me more.\n\nRick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI'm very interested in learning\neverything I can about that wacked out\ncable installer.\n\nHe turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy.\n\nThe camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not \nsee Rick yelp, and fall.\n\nCABLE GUY\nIt sounds like he might hurt somebody.\n\n110A\tINT. STEVEN'S CAR - NIGHT\n\nSteven is driving in his car. His cellular phone rings.

HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\nSteven enters the room. The camera pulls back to reveal Rick laying in full traction, face down, his \nrear end heavily bandaged. He is unconscious.\n\nSteven tentatively walks over to Rick's rear end. He pulls back a small portion of the bandage and \nsees that his butt is covered with staples. The staples form the shape of a television with an \nantenna. Inside the TV is the word \"RING.\"\n\nSTEVE\n(perplexed)\nRing?\n\nThe phone rings. Steven jumps, then picks up the phone.\n\nSTEVEN\nHello.\n\nCABLE GUY (VO)\nPoor Rick.

Steven pulls out and heads the other way.\n\n117A\tEXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT\n\nROBIN\nThis is really fascinating, but I really\nthink we ought to go now.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI knew you'd appreciate it. I took\nSteven here once, and he didn't give a\nrats ass about my interests.\n\nROBIN\nI'm worried about Steven.\n\nCABLE GUY\nMaybe Steven should be worried about you.\n(beat)\nSo, where was I?\n\n118\tOMITTED (NOW PART OF SCENE 109AB)\n\n119\tOMITTED\n\n120\tOMITTED\n\n121\tOMITTED\n\n122\tEXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT\n\nSteven drives his car up the muddy dirt road. It gets stuck in the mud. He gets out of the car, and \nbegins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He hears the sounds \nof horse hooves coming closer, and closer. The  he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight \ntoward the fence. The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times. When he reaches it he \nsmashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through. The horse rears back on its hind legs.\n\nThe horse runs full speed directly at Steven. At the last possible moment the horse jumps over \nSteven. When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(chuckles)\nIchabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed\nit all last month.\n\nThe Cable Guy rides toward him again.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(like the Vegas announcer)\nLet's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!!\n\n(Revision Ends - Blue)\n\nThis time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him. They both slam into a puddle \nof mud. The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhere's Robin?!\n\nCABLE GUY\nThis isn't about Robin, this is about you\nand me.\n\nSteven charges directly at the Cable Guy.\n\nSTEVEN\nWhere's Robin?!!!\n\nSteven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him. They are both covered in mud like \nwarriors from the rain forest. Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head.\n\nSTEVEN\nTell me!\n\nCABLE GUY\n(nonchalantly)\nI'm sorry, I didn't catch the question?\n\nSteven brings down the rock. At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head. The rock slams \ninto the ground.\n\nCABLE GUY\nSteven you've changed.\n(beat - then impressed)\nI like it.\n\nThe Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him.\n\nThey wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of \nhis belt and turns it on.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI think it's time to make you cable ready.\n\nHe slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large \nbranch and bats the Cable Guy off him.\n\nThe Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion \nwhich mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight.\n\nCABLE GUY\nLast time we fought I let you win! Best\ntwo out of three!\n\nMUSIC UP: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(crazed)\nYou treat me like the TV! You use me, but\nyou can't live without me!\n\nThe Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou can't shut me off with your remote\ncontrol!!!! I'm not like Robin and Rick\nand Mommy and Daddy and brother and\nsister and cousin --\n\nSteven smashes him in the head with the branch.\n\nSTEVEN\nI got the point.\n\nThe Cable Guy goes down. He appears to be unconscious.\n\nROBIN\n(in the distance)\nSteven.\n\nHe looks to the dish, but cannot see her.\n\n123\tEXT. SATELLITE DISH - MOMENTS LATER\n\nSteven climbs over the edge into the dish. Below him he sees that the bottom of the dish is filled \nwith several feet of rain water.\n\nThree wires go from the points on the edge of the dish, and meet at a point at the center of the \nsatellite, thirty feet above the floor of the dish. ROBIN is hanging by her bound hands from the \ncenter of where those wires meet.\n\nSteven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish.\n\nROBIN\nHelp me Steven!\n\nIn the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing through an entry hatch at \nthe top of the dish. Robin's eyes fill with terror.\n\nROBIN\nSteven! Look out!\n\nCABLE GUY\n(mimics her)\nYeah Steven. Look out!\n\nThe Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box. He slides down the dish, knocking \nSteven down. The two tumble down the slope of the dish, and tumble all the way down into the \nwater.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(sweetly, like a girl)\nI've missed you.\n\nThe Cable Guy immediately punches Steven, sending him back into the water. The Cable Guy \ndives on top of him. A moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up, then grabs his collar and \nspeaks right into his face.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(dramatically)\n\"Dry land is not a myth, I've seen it.\"\nKevin Costner from Waterworld. I don't\nknow what the fuss was about, the movie\nruled, I saw it six times.\n\nHe pulls Steven under the water, and tries to hold him there. He pulls him up after a few moments.\n\nCABLE GUY\nIsn't it weird that we'vve wound up in\nthis position?\n\nHe pushes him under the water again. After a moment he pulls him back up. Steven gasps for air.\n\nCABLE GUY\nWho would have thunk it?\n\nEnraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have \nknocked his jaw out of alignment.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(without any lisp)\nYou're gonna have to do better than that\nSteven.\n(realizing his lisp is gone)\nSteven. Hey, my lisp is gone.\n\nSteven hits him again, this time on the other side of the face.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(lisping again)\nYou stupid son of a bitch.\n\nThe Cable Guy falls unconscious.\n\nROBIN\nSteven!\n\nSteven runs to her.\n\n124\tEXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER\n\nHe runs to the side of the dish. He realizes he must climb up to release her. He climbs onto the \nWIRE and begins tightrope walking toward her. He walks very slowly, almost losing his balance \nseveral times.\n\nSTEVEN\nHang on.\n\nCLOSE ON: The opposite wire. The Cable Guy's muddy hands slam onto it. He pulls himself up.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(laughs maniacally)\nI know what your saying. Who does this\nguy think he is, Jason?\n\nSTEVEN\nStay away from her!\n\nSuddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire.\n\nCABLE GUY\nI saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony\nCurtis. He was just on \"Life-styles of\nthe Rich and Famous.\" He still looks\nterrific.\n\nSteven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's \nlanding makes Steven lose his balance. He falls over, but catches ont the wire. He is left hanging \nthere.\n\nThe Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin.\n\nCABLE GUY\nAnd the race is on.\n\nHe does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed.\n\nSteven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and \njoins him.\n\nThe Cable Guy begins to lose his balance.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(knows he's about to fall)\nThis is such an anti-climactic way to end\nthis.\n\nThe Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below. The Cable Guy has surely met his \ndemise.\n\n125\tEXT. SATELLITTE DISH - LATER\n\nSteven and Robin are sitting in the dish, a few feet from where the water begins. They are \nexhausted from their ordeal. They hold each other close.\n\nROBIN\nI'm sorry I didn't believe you. I love\nyou.\n\nSTEVEN\nI love you too. You're right. We\nshouldn't get married. I've got a lot of\nproblems to work out which have\nabsolutely nothing to do with you.\n\nROBIN\nWe'll work them out together.\n\nThey kiss. Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater. He looks frightening. Then he starts \ncoughing uncontrollably. He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(between coughs)\nWhat just happened? Where am I?\n(remembers)\nOh yeah, I was trying to kill you.\n\nHe leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock. He squeezes until Steven passes out. The he lays \nhim on the ground.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(to Robin)\nIt's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it\non Sly Stallone in \"Rocky Three.\" He\nshould wake up in thirty seconds, so\nlet's get going.\n\nHe holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish.\n\nSteven slowly wakes up. He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the \nrdio antenna. He quickly gets up to follow them.\n\n126 EXT. ANTENNA - NIGHT\n\nThe Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna. Steven follows them up from a distance.\n\nThe Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna. The Cable Guy holds Robin \nwith one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand. Steven climbs onto the \nplatform.\n\nSTEVEN\nEasy.\n\nHe walks with Robin to the edge of the platform. There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish \nbelow. A police helicopter hovers in the air around them.\n\nCABLE GUY\nIt didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm\njust trying to show you the kind of\nthings that can happen when you mistreat\npeople.\n\nSTEVEN\nDon't do anything stupid.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYou know this is just like that secen in\nthat Clint Eastwood movie \"Dirty Harry\" --\n\nSTEVEN\n(snaps)\nNo! This is not like anything! This is\nnot a movie! We're real people! You're\nhurting us! This is reality!\n\nThe Cable Guy's eyes turn sad. This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch. Dazed, he lets go of \nRobin. She runs to Steven's arms.\n\nFrom below we hear the sound of sirens. A pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna. \nThe Cable Guy's expression changes. He begins to look like a scared little boy.\n\nCABLE GUY\nIf this is reality...\n(he climbs onto the guard railing)\n...I am outta here.\n\nThe Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna.\n\nSTEVEN\nNooo!\n\nSteven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other \nhand.\n\nSTEVEN\nYou're not going anywhere.\n\nThe Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish. Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto \nthe platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved.\n\nSTEVEN\nDon't do this. You just need help. We all\nget lonely.\n\nCABLE GUY\nYeah, but I get really lonely.\n(beat)\nI mean, look at me.\n\nSTEVEN\nYou're gonna be fine. Just come on up.\n\nCABLE GUY\n(a long beat)\nSteven, I think I sat too close to the\ntelevision. Mommy was right.\n\nSteven can't hold onto his forearm any longer. The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto \nhis hand at the last possible second.\n\nCABLE GUY\nIt's too late for me, but there's a lot\nof little Cable Boys out there who still\nhave a chance. Say good-bye to the baby-\nsitter.\n\n(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)\n\nThe Cable Guy stops holding onto Steven's hand. He begins falling toward the dish below.\n\n126A\tEXT. ANTENNA - NIGHT\n\nLONG WIDE SHOT of the entire antenna.\n\nThe Cable Guy falls backward toward the satellite.\n\n127\tINT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT\n\nA nuclear family is watching court TV.\n\nOn the TV - A REPORTER speaks to the camera from the courthouse.\n\nREPORTER\nThis is the moment America has been\nwaiting for. We've just been told the\njury is ready to render their decision.\n\n128\tEXT. ANTENNA - CINTINUOUS\n\nThe Cable Guy sails through the air. As he falls he looks almost peaceful.

The needle of the antenna sticks through his mid-section. A red light \nblinks at the tip of the needle. Then, the Cable Guy's eyes open.\n\nCABLE GUY\nDamn, that hurt like a mother. What the\nhell was I thinking?\n(looks at the needle)\nOh man, that stings.\n\nSteven and Robin look relieved.\n\nCABLE GUY\nA little help here!\n\n132\tOMITTED\n\n133\tOMITTED\n\n134\tINT. COUCH POTATO APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nA pasty white couch potato stares at the white noise, not sure what to do. He turns and picks up a \nbook. As music crescendos he begins to read.\n\n135\tEXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER\n\nThe Cable Guy is being taken away on a stretcher toward an emergency helicopter. Steven and \nRobin are covered in police blankets. Steven calls to a paramedic.\n\nSTEVEN\nIs he going to be all right?\n\nPARAMEDIC\nI don't know. It's in God's hands.\n\nThe paramedics put the Cable Guy on the helicopter.
