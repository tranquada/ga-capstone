Her eyes are closed in\n               sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.\n\n               Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are\n               male, and they float into position on either side of the\n               female.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,\n               and like the female their eyes are closed.\n\n               The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,\n               which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,\n               into the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.\n\n               The male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp\n               into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes\n               open.\n\n               The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young\n               boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.\n\n               As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a\n               sudden and unnerving exchange begins ...\n\n<b>                                     FEMALE\n</b>                              (frightened woman)\n<b>                         JOHNNY, PLEASE\n</b><b>                                     \n</b><b>\t\t                     MALE RIGHT\n</b>                              (mocking man)\n                         \"Johnny, please.

No!\n\n               All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but\n               we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a\n               man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream,\n               the whimpering cries of their son.\n\n               And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three\n               faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state.\n               Their eyes slowly close.  They do not move.\n\n               So that when they do move again, it is startling.  In abrupt\n               unison, the EYES flash open.  Three pairs of eyes stare\n               straight at us, accusing.\n\n               Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one.\n\n<b>                                     ALL THREE\n</b>                         Murderer!\n\n               The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and\n               the dark reaches forth, and takes them.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT. SUBURBIA  DAY\n</b>\n               Morning in America.  Just look at it.  America in the\n               midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into\n               the sun drenched distance.  White house upon white house.\n               Emerald lawns, glistening with dew.\n\n               In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome,\n               long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships.\n\n               Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on\n               trikes.  Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,\n               watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go\n               back into their houses.\n\n               Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,\n               boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes.  It\n               is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are\n               safe.\n\n<b>               INT. A HOUSE\n</b>\n               A family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone\n               fireplace, a console TV, a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger,\n               a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of\n               children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf.\n\n<b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</b><b>                                                                         3.\n</b>\n\n               A young mother, CAROL, her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a\n               picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly\n               at the scene outside.\n\n<b>               CAROL'S POV - A LITTLE GIRL\n</b>\n               A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk.  The ball\n               gets away from her, and rolls into the street.\n\n               At the same moment, a two-toned CHEVY, lush and huge, rounds\n               the corner.\n\n               The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.\n\n<b>               THE FAMILY ROOM\n</b>\n               Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry\n               out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door.  She\n               watches.  And smiles a little.\n\n<b>               OUTSIDE\n</b>\n               The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.\n\n<b>               INSIDE THE CHEVY\n</b>\n               The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white\n               shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of\n               the car.\n\n               Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel.\n               Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in\n               front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him.\n\n               Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road\n               in front of him, going for her ball.\n\n               CAROL Watches, her smile in place.\n\n<b>\t       OUTSIDE \n</b>\n\t       The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears \n\t       down on her.\n\n<b>               INSIDE THE CHEVY\n</b>\n               An alarm suddenly CHIRPS.  The car automatically brakes to a\n               halt.  The man looks around the edge of his paper to see\n               what is happening.\n\n<b>               THE STREET\n</b>\n               The car has stopped, inches from the girl.\n\n               The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.\n               She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.\n\n<b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</b><b>                                                                         4.\n</b>\n\n               The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on\n               its own, starts up again.  The car rounds a corner, and\n               disappears.\n\n<b>               INSIDE THE HOUSE\n</b>\n               Carol turns away from the window.  She startles when she\n               sees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her.  He is in his\n               pajamas.  How long has he been there, watching her?\n\n<b>                                     JOHNNY\n</b>                              (gruff)\n                         Why'd you let me sleep so long?\n\n<b>                                     CAROL\n</b>                         It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --\n                              (beat)\n                         Why are you staring at me like that?\n\n               He takes a step toward her.  He stands there, his thick black\n               hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw,\n               considering her.\n\n<b>                                     JOHNNY\n</b>                         I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so\n                         long.\n\n               He takes another step toward her.  She doesn't move a muscle.\n               A little BOY suddenly enters the room.  Johnny turns, looks\n               at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife.  Then,\n               without a word, he begins to walk out of the room.  On his\n               way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which\n               sits beside a sewing machine.  It is not the sewing that has\n               caught his attention, but a large pair of garment SCISSORS\n               which lie across a fold of colored cloth.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\n               Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching.  He walks down\n               his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.\n               Carol stands in the doorway, watching him.\n\n               A SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above.  The air fills\n               with the piercing WHINE of an engine.  Johnny looks up,\n               alarmed.\n\n               In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban\n               trees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.\n\n               The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone\n               freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable\n               drama.\n\n               Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK\n               TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they\n               seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat\n               Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to\n               process them.\n\n<b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</b><b>                                                                         5.\n</b>\n\n               Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.\n               More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses.  Their\n               uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light.  Their\n               left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some\n               sort of complicated glove.\n\n<b>               CLOSE\n</b>\n<b>               ON - A GLOVE\n</b>\n               The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger\n               ending in an open barrel.\n\n               Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not\n               America in the 1950's.  It is the neo-past, the retro world\n               of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is\n               intermeshed with hypertechnology.\n\n               And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he\n               makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering\n               behind him.  He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out\n               of the way.\n\n               Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a\n               backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a\n               handle grip and an ovoid screen.  It is a holographic scanner.\n\n               He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an\n               IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.\n\n               The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver\n               a dozen times.\n\n               In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three\n               dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning\n               like living beings -- has been created.  An overwhelming\n               police deterrent presence has been established.\n\n<b>               INSIDE THE HOUSE\n</b>\n               The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,\n               too.  It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and\n               which are scanned holographs.  The juxtaposition of the\n               futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.\n\n<b>               INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET\n</b>\n               Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his\n               wife's dresses.\n\n<b>               UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\n</b>\n               Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands\n               out in front of them, palm out.  When the first officer points\n               his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove\n               BEEPS softly.\n\n<b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</b><b>                                                                         6.\n</b>\n\n               The officer looks at his PALM.  A red thermal IMAGE appears\n               on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching\n               man.  The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second\n               officer.\n\n<b>               THE BEDROOM\n</b>\n               The room is packed with police -- how many are real?\n\n<b>               THE CLOSET\n</b>\n               Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat.  He calls\n               out through the door.\n\n<b>                                     JOHNNY\n</b>                         I didn't do anything!\n\n<b>               OUTSIDE THE CLOSET\n</b>\n               Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points\n               his index barrel at the closet door.

In the\n               sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles,\n               holographic billboards, hovercrafts, skim-jet transports.\n               On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to\n               flash: \"I LIKE MIKE!\"\n\n<b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</b><b>                                                                        12.\n</b>\n\n               Then a picture of the smiling President appears.

When Page looks\n               up they try to cover, but are not quick enough.

The helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces\n               seem to flow and shift, like oil on water.\n\n               A network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of\n               light, rise Medusa-like from each helmet, then centralize\n               into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe\n               computer.\n\n               The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas.\n               They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces.\n               Their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes\n               from murders only they can see.

She floats in a glowing nutritive bath.\n               Like her brothers, she <u>seems</u> to be eternally young, or\n               eternally old.\n\n               The technicians lift her from her bath.  She is dried, dressed\n               in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair.\n               Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side\n               of her.\n\n               Not once are their helmets removed.  What they feed into the\n               mainframe is too valuable.  It must be gathered twenty-four\n               unrelenting hours a day.\n\n<b>               INT.

There is a JUDGE, 55,\n               and stern.  There are a few people in the public seats.\n\n               The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson.  She\n               wears a black robe, and addresses the Director of Precrime,\n               Anderson, who sits in the witness stand.\n\n<b>                                     LISA\n</b>                         Director Anderson, do you swear that\n                         the disc you now present to the court\n                         is the only and authentic disc of\n                         the future murder of Carol Palmer by\n                         her husband, John Palmer?\n\n               It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of\n               times.

The judge reaches out and Anderson hands\n               him the disc.  The judge inserts it into a special video\n               machine on his desk.  Anderson steps down, his ritual part\n               in this trial completed.\n\n               A huge MONITOR comes to life behind the judge.

The SPIDER waits for him to settle, then CLICKS\n               toward him again.\n\n               Anderson moves around the room, avoiding the Spider.  He is\n               dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard.  The Spider\n               comes faster.

The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare\n               at him, terrified.\n\n               Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit\n               doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street.\n\n               He rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into\n               his bag for a glove.  He pulls the weapon onto his right\n               hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament.\n\n               Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the\n               street.  He looks up.  He is surrounded by skyscrapers and\n               buildings -- he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban\n               canyon.\n\n               People freeze against the sides of buildings, run into\n               doorways where they can.

Anderson doesn't have a moment.\n\n               He spreads his feet and fires a massive SONIC BLAST down at\n               the sidewalk.  The effect on the underground water main is\n               immediate.\n\n               A GEYSER of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up\n               from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen\n               feet into the air right alongside the building.\n\n               The stunned police officers try to take aim, but Anderson's\n               bouncing at the top of the geyser.  And they can't fire,\n               anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement\n               from every window in the building.\n\n               All this in a time span of seconds.  The world spins crazily\n               for ANDERSON, but he manages to grip hold of a metal support\n               beam holding the building's sign, one story up.\n\n               The police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of\n               water from the water main break obscures his moves.\n\n               He pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along\n               it toward a second story window.  The office building gawkers\n               lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to\n               sparkling dust and leaps inside.\n\n<b>               INT.

Anderson,\n               dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting\n               through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way.\n\n               He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field,\n               jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever\n               he must to get to his goal.\n\n               And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the\n               avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime\n               ambushed him.\n\n               He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream\n               of traffic.  It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers.\n\n               Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of\n               the bus.  It is a bone-jarring landing.  He loses\n               consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof,\n               and slides off it onto the pavement.\n\n<b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</b><b>                                                                        72.\n</b>\n\n               He lies there, trying to rouse himself.

He drops to the stairs,\n               and instantly slips up them.\n\n               He surprises a helmeted OFFICER, just around the bend.  He\n               slams HIM against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds\n               the laser knife against his throat.\n\n               The OFFICER 1s clearly terrified.

He looks at her, then beyond her to\n               the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in\n               their chairs.\n\n               Her helmet is off.  She is young, but her close-cropped hair\n               is silver white.

A thick, yellow fluid\n               begins to flow toward the Precog's jugular vein.\n\n<b>                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n</b>                         You're killing him, partner.\n\n               And what choice, finally, does Anderson have?

And stands there between Anderson\n               and the doomed Precog.\n\n               The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precog's jugular.\n\n               Anderson shoots Witwer, once in the heart.  Witwer is thrown\n               back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock.\n\n               Anderson drags himself to the Precog, and rips the yellow IV\n               out of the main line.  The yellow drips onto the floor,\n               mingling with Witwer's red.\n\n               Anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him.  Witwer\n               whispers something, and Anderson leans close to hear him.\n\n<b>                                     WITWER\n</b>                         Now do you believe?\n\n               Anderson pulls away from Witwer, and lets him take his last\n               breaths alone.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</b><b>                                                                       112.\n</b>\n\n<b>               DARKNESS\n</b>\n               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,\n               beautifully proportioned FACE.\n\n               It is Rose's face.
