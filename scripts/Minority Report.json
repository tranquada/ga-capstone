Her eyes are closed in\n               sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.\n\n               Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are\n               male, and they float into position on either side of the\n               female.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,\n               and like the female their eyes are closed.\n\n               The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,\n               which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,\n               into the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.\n\n               The male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp\n               into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes\n               open.\n\n               The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young\n               boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.\n\n               As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a\n               sudden and unnerving exchange begins ...\n\n                                     FEMALE\n                              (frightened woman)\n                         JOHNNY, PLEASE\n                                     \n\t\t                     MALE RIGHT\n                              (mocking man)\n                         \"Johnny, please.

No!\n\n               All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but\n               we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a\n               man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream,\n               the whimpering cries of their son.\n\n               And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three\n               faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state.\n               Their eyes slowly close.  They do not move.\n\n               So that when they do move again, it is startling.  In abrupt\n               unison, the EYES flash open.  Three pairs of eyes stare\n               straight at us, accusing.\n\n               Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one.\n\n                                     ALL THREE\n                         Murderer!\n\n               The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and\n               the dark reaches forth, and takes them.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. SUBURBIA  DAY\n\n               Morning in America.  Just look at it.  America in the\n               midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into\n               the sun drenched distance.  White house upon white house.\n               Emerald lawns, glistening with dew.\n\n               In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome,\n               long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships.\n\n               Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on\n               trikes.  Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,\n               watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go\n               back into their houses.\n\n               Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,\n               boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes.  It\n               is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are\n               safe.\n\n               INT. A HOUSE\n\n               A family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone\n               fireplace, a console TV, a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger,\n               a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of\n               children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                         3.\n\n\n               A young mother, CAROL, her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a\n               picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly\n               at the scene outside.\n\n               CAROL'S POV - A LITTLE GIRL\n\n               A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk.  The ball\n               gets away from her, and rolls into the street.\n\n               At the same moment, a two-toned CHEVY, lush and huge, rounds\n               the corner.\n\n               The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.\n\n               THE FAMILY ROOM\n\n               Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry\n               out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door.  She\n               watches.  And smiles a little.\n\n               OUTSIDE\n\n               The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.\n\n               INSIDE THE CHEVY\n\n               The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white\n               shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of\n               the car.\n\n               Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel.\n               Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in\n               front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him.\n\n               Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road\n               in front of him, going for her ball.\n\n               CAROL Watches, her smile in place.\n\n\t       OUTSIDE \n\n\t       The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears \n\t       down on her.\n\n               INSIDE THE CHEVY\n\n               An alarm suddenly CHIRPS.  The car automatically brakes to a\n               halt.  The man looks around the edge of his paper to see\n               what is happening.\n\n               THE STREET\n\n               The car has stopped, inches from the girl.\n\n               The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.\n               She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                         4.\n\n\n               The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on\n               its own, starts up again.  The car rounds a corner, and\n               disappears.\n\n               INSIDE THE HOUSE\n\n               Carol turns away from the window.  She startles when she\n               sees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her.  He is in his\n               pajamas.  How long has he been there, watching her?\n\n                                     JOHNNY\n                              (gruff)\n                         Why'd you let me sleep so long?\n\n                                     CAROL\n                         It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --\n                              (beat)\n                         Why are you staring at me like that?\n\n               He takes a step toward her.  He stands there, his thick black\n               hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw,\n               considering her.\n\n                                     JOHNNY\n                         I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so\n                         long.\n\n               He takes another step toward her.  She doesn't move a muscle.\n               A little BOY suddenly enters the room.  Johnny turns, looks\n               at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife.  Then,\n               without a word, he begins to walk out of the room.  On his\n               way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which\n               sits beside a sewing machine.  It is not the sewing that has\n               caught his attention, but a large pair of garment SCISSORS\n               which lie across a fold of colored cloth.\n\n               EXT. THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching.  He walks down\n               his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.\n               Carol stands in the doorway, watching him.\n\n               A SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above.  The air fills\n               with the piercing WHINE of an engine.  Johnny looks up,\n               alarmed.\n\n               In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban\n               trees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.\n\n               The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone\n               freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable\n               drama.\n\n               Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK\n               TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they\n               seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat\n               Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to\n               process them.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                         5.\n\n\n               Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.\n               More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses.  Their\n               uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light.  Their\n               left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some\n               sort of complicated glove.\n\n               CLOSE\n\n               ON - A GLOVE\n\n               The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger\n               ending in an open barrel.\n\n               Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not\n               America in the 1950's.  It is the neo-past, the retro world\n               of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is\n               intermeshed with hypertechnology.\n\n               And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he\n               makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering\n               behind him.  He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out\n               of the way.\n\n               Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a\n               backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a\n               handle grip and an ovoid screen.  It is a holographic scanner.\n\n               He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an\n               IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.\n\n               The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver\n               a dozen times.\n\n               In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three\n               dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning\n               like living beings -- has been created.  An overwhelming\n               police deterrent presence has been established.\n\n               INSIDE THE HOUSE\n\n               The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,\n               too.  It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and\n               which are scanned holographs.  The juxtaposition of the\n               futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.\n\n               INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET\n\n               Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his\n               wife's dresses.\n\n               UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\n\n               Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands\n               out in front of them, palm out.  When the first officer points\n               his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove\n               BEEPS softly.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                         6.\n\n\n               The officer looks at his PALM.  A red thermal IMAGE appears\n               on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching\n               man.  The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second\n               officer.\n\n               THE BEDROOM\n\n               The room is packed with police -- how many are real?\n\n               THE CLOSET\n\n               Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat.  He calls\n               out through the door.\n\n                                     JOHNNY\n                         I didn't do anything!\n\n               OUTSIDE THE CLOSET\n\n               Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points\n               his index barrel at the closet door.  The effect is deeply\n               accusatory.\n\n               An OFFICER speaks, his VOICE electronically manipulated to\n               be as menacing as possible.\n\n                                     OFFICER 1\n                         Come out of the closet on your hands\n                         and knees.\n\n               Nothing happens.  Two officers aim their barrels at the\n               perimeter of the door.  In repeated, small SONIC BLASTS, the\n               closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing Johnny among\n               the dresses.\n\n               Johnny starts to rise, and BAM, a section of floorboards is\n               blasted away beneath his feet.\n\n                                     OFFICER 1\n                         Hands and knees!\n\n               Johnny trips among the splintered floorboards, and drops.\n               He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches.

THE HOUSE -- LATER\n\n               In the background, Johnny is guided into a Precrime police\n               vehicle as the neighbors look on.  Carol and her son stand\n               in the doorway, stunned.\n\n               TWO OFFICERS remove their helmets.  The first man is tall,\n               sandy-haired, good eyes, deeply blue; This is PAUL ANDERSON,\n               late thirties, Director of the Precrime Division, Washington\n               D.C.\n\n               The second man is ED WITWER, Anderson's second in command,\n               late thirties, big like Anderson, good face, strong in the\n               shoulders, short brown hair.\n\n               The two men are deeply comfortable together.  They can speak,\n               or not.  It doesn't matter -- they still communicate.  Two\n               good cops, good together.\n\n               They walk side-by-side around the house, dematerializing the\n               holographic decoy cops.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Thought we might a had a runner.\n\n               Anderson seems tired, takes a moment to answer.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Yeah, a runner.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         A little chase -- that'd been good.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Fifty cops on the scene takes the\n                         chase out of them.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                              (smiles)\n                         But only eight of us were real.\n\n               Witwer dematerializes the last decoy.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         We ever get a runner, I'd be too old\n                         to give chase.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                         8.\n\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         You'd chase.

SAME SCENE -- LATER\n\n               The children play on their trikes.  The wives talk among\n               themselves.  The birds sing, the dogs bark.\n\n               The little girl bounces her red ball again.  She stops a.\n               minute, when two pieces of newspaper blow past her,\n               unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape.\n\n               INT. A BEDROOM - SUBURBAN VIRGINIA (OUTSIDE WASHINGTON)  DAY\n\n               Decorated in a 1950's style.  Anderson lies in bed beside\n               his wife, LISA, a pretty, green-eyed brunette.  It is early\n               morning, they are both awake.  Her hand caresses his chest.\n               Maybe they will make love.\n\n               Lisa's hand stops suddenly on the center of Anderson's chest.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         Jesus, Paul.

And they\n                         go to jail.  And lives are saved.\n                         Thousands of lives.\n                              (beat)\n                         And that's a cop's dream.\n\n               Anderson is silent for a time.  He sighs, then smiles, and\n               turns to his wife, takes her in his arms.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         No.  You're a cop's dream.\n\n               INT. THE BATHROOM -- LATER\n\n               Anderson steps out of the shower, and begins to towel himself\n               dry- He glances out a casement window.  He tilts his head,\n               curious, then wipes at the steam on the window.\n\n               ANDERSON'S POV  LISA\n\n               Lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown, talking on a\n               cell phone.  She hangs up, moves quickly back into the house.\n\n               ANDERSON \n\n               Cocks his head, then goes back to toweling off.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN -- LATER\n\n               Checkered linoleum floor.  Appliances out of the 1950's.\n\n               Except there are little differences.  When Lisa puts a skillet\n               of eggs on the stove, the heating element is not an electric\n               coil, or gas but a shimmering field of light.\n\n               Lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket.\n               Anderson wears a gray suit, thin blue tie, white shirt,\n               wingtipped shoes.  He doesn't look up from the newspaper as\n               he speaks.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Who called?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        10.\n\n\n               Lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs.  She touches\n               her long brown hair.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         No one.  I called about my hair.\n                         Getting it done this afternoon.\n\n               Anderson looks like he's about to say something else, when\n               suddenly someone RAPS on the back screen door.  Anderson and\n               Lisa both turn and smile.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Come on in, neighbor.  Want some\n                         coffee?\n\n               OUTSIDE THE DOOR\n\n               FRANK D'IGNAZIO, 65, white-haired, robust, hesitates before\n               coming in.  A thin METALLIC ARM with a red laser light arches\n               quickly down from above the doorway, shines into each of his\n               EYES, scanning the irises.  The arm lifts out of view, the\n               screen door UNLATCHES.\n\n               Frank enters the kitchen, carrying a basket of tomatoes.\n\n                                     FRANK D'IGNAZIO\n                         Brought these for your supper.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         Oh, Frank.

I gotta get rid of\n                         these things.  One plant, and I'm\n                         invaded by tomatoes.  When I was a\n                         kid ...\n\n               Anderson laughs, claps his friend and neighbor on the back,\n               teases him.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Before all this genetically engineered\n                         crap ...\n\n               Frank gives him an ornery look, then a smile.\n\n                                     FRANK D'IGNAZIO\n                         Yeah well, it's true.  It used to be\n                         a challenge to grow things.  An art.\n                         Now you put one plant in the ground\n                         -- then jump the hell out of the\n                         way.\n\n               Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Coffee?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        11.\n\n\n                                     FRANK D'IGNAZIO\n                         Nah, thanks.  Can't stay.  You guys\n                         are rushing off to work anyway.\n\n               Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         You and Ellie come for supper then.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         We'll barbecue.\n\n               Frank nods and pushes on the screen door.\n\n                                     FRANK D'IGNAZIO\n                         You betcha.  We'll bring some more\n                         tomatoes -- a new batch will have\n                         grown by then.\n\n               They all laugh, Frank exits, Anderson goes back to his paper.\n\n               EXT. DRIVEWAY -- LATER\n\n               Anderson waves to Lisa.  Her big Studebaker drives off down\n               the tree-lined street and away.\n\n               Anderson approaches his Chevy.  He doesn't take out a key to\n               unlock it.  There is no lock.  He slides in behind the wheel.\n               Doesn't take out a key for the ignition -- there is no\n               ignition.\n\n               A thin METALLIC ARM arches down from the sun visor, scans\n               Anderson's EYES, identifying him.  A seat harness wraps around\n               him, and the car STARTS.\n\n               Anderson picks up a folder marked \"Precrime\" and begins to\n               read through the papers.  The Chevy backs out of the driveway\n               and takes him to work.\n\n               EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - ALEXANDRIA, VA -- LATER\n\n               A vast spread of corporate and government buildings -- the\n               spillover from Washington D.C. across the Potomac River into\n               Virginia.\n\n               Beyond the white of Washington is \"The Sprawl\" -- the massive\n               unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts\n               of the Capitol.  It is impenetrable and uninviting, especially\n               to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs.\n\n               Anderson's Chevy moves in a sea of fifties-type cars.\n               Occasionally, an ultramodern vehicle zips past them.  In the\n               sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles,\n               holographic billboards, hovercrafts, skim-jet transports.\n               On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to\n               flash: \"I LIKE MIKE!\"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        12.\n\n\n               Then a picture of the smiling President appears.  Then the\n               words: \"RE-ELECT PRESIDENT MIKE BILLINGS FOR ANOTHER FOUR\n               YEARS!  KEEP THE PAST IN OUR FUTURE!\"\n\n               INSIDE ANDERSON'S CHEVY\n\n               Through his windshield, Anderson glances at a holographic\n               road sign.\n\n               THE ROAD SIGN reads: \"FBI Headquarters 1 mile.

PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS\n\n               Anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair.\n               He abruptly rises and begins to pace.  The room is large,\n               but he paces like a lion confined in a cage.\n\n               He punches an intercom.  A female VOICE responds.\n\n                                     INTERCOM VOICE\n                         Yes, Director Anderson?\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Where's Ennis Page?  Why hasn't he\n                         delivered this morning's Precog discs?\n\n               Ed Witwer opens the door to the office., and casually walks\n               in.\n\n                                     INTERCOM VOICE\n                         I'll find him, sir.\n\n               Ed shakes his head, smiles.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Bullying the staff again, Director\n                         Anderson?\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Screw you.\n\n               Anderson turns away and stares out a large window.

He carries a\n               black BRIEFCASE marked:\n\n               \"Zone 218 - Washington/Alexandria, VA.\" The case is cuffed\n               to his wrist.\n\n                                     PAGE\n                         Sorry I'm late, sir.

Anderson moves quickly to\n               Page.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         What was I thinking.\n\n               Anderson leans over the BRIEFCASE.  A small panel recedes, a\n               red laser scanner clicks on, scans Anderson's eyes, BEEPS\n               affirmatively, then clicks off.  The cuff on Page's wrist\n               falls open.\n\n               Now Page puts the case on Anderson's desk.  Page hesitates.\n               Anderson and Witwer know just what he's going to do.  Page\n               reaches down, unable to resist straightening a pile of papers\n               strewn on Anderson's desk.\n\n               Anderson and Witwer exchange knowing smiles.  When Page looks\n               up they try to cover, but are not quick enough.  He frowns\n               tightly, and heads for the door.\n\n               Anderson calls after him.\n\n\t\t\t             ANDERSON \n                         Thanks, Ennis.  \n\n               Witwer turns to leave, too.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Now that's a guy who really cares.\n\n               Witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office.\n\n               Anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk, and opens\n               the briefcase.  Four small bright DISCS sit in rows.  He\n               removes one, places it in a VIDEO MONITOR that lifts into\n               view from the center of his desk.  He sits back, weary, and\n               watches.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        14.\n\n\n               VIDEO SCREEN\n\n               A young black woman stands in a hallway.  She stares at a\n               door, gun in hand.  She opens the door, enters a bedroom.\n\n               She glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping.  She\n               lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form.\n\n               ANDERSON pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new\n               disc.\n\n               VIDEO SCREEN\n\n               A white woman stands at a stove, cooking.  A man comes up\n               behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands.\n               He raises the necktie toward her neck\n\n               ANDERSON\n\n               He's not watching the screen.  He is out of his chair now, \n               looking out the window.\n\n               INT. PRECRIME MAIN LOBBY\n\n               A tour of Precrime is in progress, like the public relations\n               tours run by present-day FBI.  The TOUR GUIDE, a pretty,\n               smartly uniformed woman in her twenties, leads a group of\n               adults and children, all with glowing nametags, through the\n               building.\n\n                                     TOUR GUIDE\n                         Welcome to the main headquarters of\n                         Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches\n                         are scattered throughout the United\n                         States.\n\n               The group follows the guide slowly through the lobby.\n\n                                     TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)\n                         Precrime was established in 2030,\n                         with the harnessing of the remarkable\n                         talents of the Precognitive mutants.\n\n               She points cheerfully to a stubby little man, MR.

A lot of people\n                         assume there are Precogs in every\n                         branch office.\n                                     (MORE)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        15.\n\n\n                                     TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)\n                         But there are only three Precogs,\n                         right here in this building.  And\n                         the information they give us, we\n                         send out to all the other branches.\n                              (beat)\n                         And what is that information -what\n                         do the Precogs do?\n\n               An eager boy, TIMMY has the answer to that one.\n\n                                     TIMMY\n                         They protect us.\n\n               The guide tousles his hair.\n\n                                     TOUR GUIDE\n                              (chipper voice)\n                         That's right, Timmy.  Because of the\n                         Precogs, you're going to grow up\n                         murderfree.  Isn't that something?\n\n                                     MR.

It's an infallible\n                         system.

And right\n                         next door is the Judicial Center,\n                         where we prosecute the\n                         future murderers.\n\n                                     TIMMY\n                         Can we see the Precogs?\n\n                                     TOUR GUIDE\n                         No, I'm sorry.  That part of the\n                         building is not open to the public.\n                              (beat)\n                         Now, if you'll just step this way\n                         ...\n\n               She waves the group on toward an elevator.\n\n               INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER\n\n               The chamber is an elaborate, hypertech hospital, constructed\n               for the maintenance of three beings -- the Precogs.  They\n               are triplets -- two of the Precogs are male, one is female.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        16.\n\n\n               Technicians swarm all over them like worker bees.  The bodies\n               of the Precogs are being tended to: exercised, cleansed,\n               groomed.\n\n               The head of each Precog is encased in a complex, ornate HELMET\n               that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright\n               metallics.  The helmets pulse slightly, and the surfaces\n               seem to flow and shift, like oil on water.\n\n               A network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of\n               light, rise Medusa-like from each helmet, then centralize\n               into a single strand, and connect to a massive mainframe\n               computer.\n\n               The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation, or in comas.\n               They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces.\n               Their faces are in constant motion, the lips mouthing scenes\n               from murders only they can see.  Life for a Precog is an\n               endless cycle of death.\n\n               CLOSE ON - THE FEMALE PRECOG\n\n               we recognize her fragile and perfect FACE from the opening\n               scene of the movie.  She floats in a glowing nutritive bath.\n               Like her brothers, she seems to be eternally young, or\n               eternally old.\n\n               The technicians lift her from her bath.  She is dried, dressed\n               in a robe, then guided into an over-sized, throne like chair.\n               Her brothers are guided into their thrones, on either side\n               of her.\n\n               Not once are their helmets removed.  What they feed into the\n               mainframe is too valuable.  It must be gathered twenty-four\n               unrelenting hours a day.\n\n               INT. A ROOM\n\n               Ennis Page sits in a room just off the Precog Chamber.  He\n               can see them through a large window.  He works a large\n               computer console, the gathering point for the information\n               the Precogs constantly feed the computer.\n\n               Perhaps every ten seconds, a small DISC is released by the\n               computer, and mechanically gathered, sorted, and placed -under\n               Page's watchful eye -- into a black case.\n\n               ANDERSON is in the room standing quietly behind Page.  As\n               Director, Anderson is authorized to come and go, but from\n               his fussy movements, it's obvious Page sees anyone else in\n               the room as an intruder in his special domain.\n\n               Anderson turns and looks through the window at the Precogs.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         What would they think about if we\n                         unhooked them?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        17.\n\n\n               Page looks up from his work.\n\n                                     PAGE\n                         They don't think, sir.  They just\n                         see.\n\n               Anderson is silent.\n\n                                     PAGE (CONT'D)\n                         They're not even alive, really.\n\n               Anderson contemplates the scene, nods to Page's words, then\n               turns and walks out of the room, as Page looks on.\n\n               INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER\n\n\n\n               The female Precog sits in her chair.  Her eyes are open.\n               She faces the window that looks into Page's main frame room.\n               In the window we see Anderson leaving the room.\n\n               The female Precog's eyes drift closed.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT.COURTROOM - JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY\n\n               A trial is in progress.  The defendant is Johnny Palmer.  He\n               sits, ashen, at a table, his DEFENSE ATTORNEY beside him.\n\n               There are no jurors in the Juror BOX.  There is a JUDGE, 55,\n               and stern.  There are a few people in the public seats.\n\n               The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson.  She\n               wears a black robe, and addresses the Director of Precrime,\n               Anderson, who sits in the witness stand.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         Director Anderson, do you swear that\n                         the disc you now present to the court\n                         is the only and authentic disc of\n                         the future murder of Carol Palmer by\n                         her husband, John Palmer?\n\n               It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of\n               times.

He does not\n               turn around to watch -- he has his own monitor.\n\n               Johnny Palmer watches, eyes wide.

The fifties interior is drab: a\n               Formica table, bad curtains, a frayed Lazy Boy positioned in\n               front of a TV.\n\n               Ed Witwer is already on the scene.  He stands a few feet\n               from the BODY of a man, gunshot wound to the head, a handgun\n               on the floor nearby.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                              (to Anderson)\n                         Looks like the old days.\n\n               Anderson nods to his former partner.

Why do\n                         you insist on coming to these things?\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Keeps the system honest.

Inside the case is a large metallic APPARATUS: the\n               \"Coroner.\"\n\n               It comes to auto-life, and begins to unfold itself - It rises\n               crab-like, and steps out of its case.\n\n               Except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move.  His projected\n               image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his\n               back.  He is the interface, the way the humans communicate\n               with the crab apparatus.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Hi DOC.\n\n                                     HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR\n                         Hello, Director Anderson.\n\n               The coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down\n               on the floor.

The crab inches close\n               to probe the face.  Disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids,\n               and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment\n               the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive.\n\n               Then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs At last, it\n               comes to a standstill.  The holographic Doctor closes his\n               eyes as if in thought.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Can you imagine if this was a\n                         homicide?

It is not a place that\n               warms Anderson's heart.\n\n               Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting\n               and examining protoplasmic tissue masses.  Other technicians\n               peer through massive microscopes.

An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes, and\n               the door opens with an electronic hiss.\n\n               Anderson looks around the lab.  Technicians lower mesh\n               cylinders into some sort of chemical VAT.  Another technician\n               turns a dial, and an electric charge courses through the\n               roiling liquid.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         What's happening here?\n\n                                     DR.

Dr. Resfield waits\n               for more questions.  But it is clear from Anderson's\n               expression he has already learned enough.\n\n               INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- DAY\n\n               Anderson sits in his office reviewing Precog discs for\n               premurders in the local Washington area. We stay on him as he\n               watches the monitor.  He pops the disc, jots down some notes,\n               slides in the next disc.\n\n               Anderson's mouth slowly opens.  He leans close to the monitor,\n               his face ashen.\n\n               EXT. FRANK D'IGNAZIO'S BACKYARD -- LATER\n\n               Frank is on his hands and knees, working his vegetable garden.\n               He whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich\n               soil.\n\n               He sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate.  He\n               lifts his straw hat in greeting, gives a smile.  It's\n               ANDERSON.\n\n                                     FRANK D'IGNAZIO\n                         What are you doing, playing hooky?\n\n               Anderson tries to smile.  But it won't come.  He looks around\n               the abundant garden.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         It's great out here, Frank..

Frank follows his gaze.  A Precrime HOVERCRAFT\n               glides into position overhead.\n\n               Frank stares, then lowers his eyes to the ground.  He takes\n               a long sad breath.\n\n                                     FRANK D'IGNAZIO (CONT'D)\n                         Ah shit, neighbor.\n                              (beat)\n                         Goddamn Precogs don't miss a beat,\n                         do they?\n                              (beat)\n                         Can we do this inside?

Do the Precogs\n                         see everything?\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         No.\n\n                                     FRANK D'IGRAZIO\n                         Then they won't have seen this.\n\n               Frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own\n               head.  On Anderson's anguished FACE, at the SOUND of the gun\n               going off.\n\n               EXT. FRONT YARD -- LATER\n\n               Anderson stands with his old partner, Witwer, on Frank's\n               front porch.  Behind them, through an open door, we see Lisa\n               comforting Ellie D'Ignazio in the living room.\n\n               Anderson is deeply shaken.  Witwer tries to talk him through\n               it.\n\n                                     WITWER \n\t\t\t\t(GENTLY)\n                         We had to bring him in.\n\n               Anderson doesn't respond.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         He was a future murderer.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                              (angrily)\n                         You blame him?  The guy killed his\n                         daughter!\n\n               Witwer lets the implication of his words sink in.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         Yeah.  I know.  I know.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        29.\n\n\n               Anderson turns and watches as they wheel Frank's draped body\n               into the back of an ambulance.  Anderson's bitterness erupts.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         I hate the Precogs, Ed. I believe in\n                         them absolutely and I hate them\n                         absolutely.  Jesus.\n\n               Witwer listens to him.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         And that goddamn lab trying to grow\n                         more of them.  Put a Precog in every\n                         home, you know?  So we can have more\n                         Franks - people shooting themselves --\n                         over who knows what?\n\n               Witwer kneads Anderson's shoulder, talks to him in soothing\n               tones like you'd calm an agitated horse.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Precrime did the job it was supposed\n                         to do.\n\n               The two men can hear Ellie sobbing inside the house.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         You know it.  And you believe in it.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (BEAT)\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         It's not easy.  It beats us down.\n                         Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates\n                         you right now.\n\n               Anderson turns to Witwer.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         That's why I got into this business\n                         -- to be hated.\n\n               Anderson almost manages a small smile.  Witwer puts his arm\n               around him.  Walks him away from the scene.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         They hated us when we were regular\n                         cops.  Now we're Precrime, and they\n                         still hate US.  It's one of the little\n                         perks of law enforcement nobody knows\n                         about.\n\n               Their quiet laughter is tinged with sadness.  Anderson looks\n               into his partner's good, open face.  Then they both look\n               away, their understanding of each other complete.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        30.\n\n\n               INT. ANDERSON'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT\n\n               Anderson stares out the window at Frank's house, illuminated\n               by the moon.  It's a mournful sight.\n\n               Lisa rises on an elbow and watches him from the bed.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS-ALEXANDRIA-DAY - ONE WEEK LATER\n\n               Ennis Page, in the mainframe room just off the Precog Chamber,\n               picks up a black BRIEFCASE marked: \"Zone 218 Washington /\n               Alexandria, VA.\" He approaches the door, and his eyes are\n               scanned.  The door opens with a HISS.\n\n               We follow Page as he walks through doors and corridors until\n               he reaches a long hallway leading to the Director's office.\n               Anderson's secretary, Angela, looks up on Page's approach.\n               She nods.  He nods.\n\n               He walks around her desk.  His eyes are scanned, and the\n               door to Anderson's office opens.\n\n               ANDERSON looks up, wearily.\n\n               INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE -- LATER\n\n               Anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor, almost\n               absently.  As we have seen him do before, he swivels his\n               chair away from the monitor, and stares at Washington D.C.\n               across the Potomac.  Hovercrafts and transports skim through\n               the sky above the Washington Monument.\n\n               The camera stays on Anderson's back as the sound from the\n               Precog disc begins.  He hears his own voice speaking in\n               strained, agitated tones.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (O.S.)\n                         Let's not do this, Ed.\n\n               Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and\n               horror at the monitor.\n\n               THE MONITOR\n\n               shows Anderson and Witwer in a room, a few feet apart pointing\n               guns directly at each other.  Their eyes intense and panicked.\n               Who murders whom?\n\n               Ed's eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red\n               seconds tumble away.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Oh, Ed ...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        31.\n\n\n               Witwer lowers his gun.  He stands unresisting before\n\n               Anderson.\n\n               Witwer sees his own death in Anderson's wild eyes, has always\n               seen it.\n\n               Anderson FIRES his weapon, puts a bullet straight into\n               Witwer's heart, throwing him back against a wall.  Witwer\n               slumps, dying, beneath the huge digital clock, which reads:\n\n               5:20 AM.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               Anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank.  His hand\n               goes to his mouth.  His body begins to shake.  He hugs\n               himself, but he can't stop the shaking.\n\n               The DISC pops out of the side of the monitor.  It is a small\n               SOUND, but it has Anderson up and out of his chair as if it\n               were a gunshot, He reaches for the disc but cannot touch it.\n               His legs suddenly weaken, and he drops to one knee beside\n               his desk, like a man in need of prayer.\n\n               There is a single thought that screams through his brain.\n               It is an almost visible thing, filling the room, blackly.\n               Anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         I kill you.\n                              (beat)\n                         Oh god, I kill you.\n\n               As Anderson pulls himself up, and tries to reach again for\n               the disc ...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. THE PRECOG CHAMBER\n\n               In an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie,\n               the three FACES of the Precogs hover in the misty darkness.\n               Their closed eyes open in SUDDEN UNISON.  They speak as one.\n\n                                     ALL THREE\n                         Murderer!\n\n               After a long moment, the eyes close again, and the Precogs\n               fade into the mists ...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. ANDERSON'S OFFICE\n\n               Anderson looks up sharply at the SOUND of a knock on his\n               door.  Every normal sound seems grotesquely AMPLIFIED, the\n               traffic outside, his own breathing.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        32.\n\n\n               His senses are on overload.\n\n               The door begins to open.  A stockinged leg is the first thing\n               Anderson sees.  His secretary, ANGELA.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         Sir?\n\n               She hesitates before fully entering the room, Anderson grabs\n               at the incriminating disc.  He sees his EYES reflected in\n               its alloy surface.  He pushes the disc deep into his pants\n               pocket.\n\n               Somehow he finds his voice.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Come in.  Angela.\n\n               She looks at him, uncertain.  Then she places a small stack\n               of papers on his desk.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         Need you to sign these.  And your\n                         eleven o'clock starts in five minutes.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         My ... eleven.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                              (beat)\n                         Budget coordination with the FBI.\n                              (beat)\n                         You okay, sir?\n\n               Anderson runs his hand through his hair, can't think fast\n               enough.  He sees her glance at the black Precog disc case.\n               He shuts it, awkwardly, and it auto-locks.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Have Page take this.\n\n               Angela steps back, disturbed.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         But sir, the procedure\n\n                                     ANDERSON (SNAPS)\n                         I make procedure.

Or maybe\n               just home.\n\n               Angela looks relieved at the explanation.\n\n                                     ANGELA\n                         Yes sir.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        33.\n\n\n               He moves past her.  His FINGERS fidget against the hidden\n               disc in his pocket.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         I'll speak to Witwer, put him in\n                         charge for the rest of the day.\n\n               He hesitates at the door, turns to look at his office, and\n               at his view of Washington.  Then he is gone.\n\n               INT. OUTSIDE WITWER'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Anderson looks in the door Of Witwer's empty office.  He\n               takes a step inside.\n\n               Witwer's booming voice sounds from behind him, startling\n               him.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Breaking and entering.  That'll get\n                         you five to ten, hard.\n\n               Witwer immediately scans his old partner's ashen face.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         What's wrong?\n\n               Anderson can hardly bear to meet his friend's eyes.  He\n               REACHES into his pocket, as if to lift the disc into the\n               light.

PRECRIME UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- LATER\n\n               Anderson, sweating now, leans against a thick cement pillar\n               and pulls out a cell phone.  He hits a button.\n\n               INTERCUT BETWEEN ANDERSON / LISA AT THE JUDICIAL CENTER\n\n               Lisa sits in a meeting.  Her phone CHIRPS softly.  She glances\n               at the display, then rises to take it.  She goes to a corner\n               of the room.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         Paul?\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Listen to me.\n\n               Lisa presses her phone close to her ear.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         I can hardly hear you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        35.\n\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         I'm underground.

They are sleek and menacing, the black shells\n               lumpy with dangerous gadgetry.  In the distance, a POLICE\n               OFFICER, holding an armful of equipment, opens the back of\n               one of them.\n\n               He looks up at Anderson's approach.  He puts his equipment\n               down, and salutes.\n\n                                     POLICE OFFICER\n                         Hello, sir.\n\n               Anderson nods, moves close.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         What's your name, officer?\n\n                                     POLICE OFFICER\n                         Bob, uh, Robert Smythe.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         These the new Python transports?\n\n               The young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride,\n               is about to speak, when Anderson touches a palm-sized Nova\n               stun gun to the base of his neck.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                              (sincerely)\n                         Sorry, Officer Smythe.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        36.\n\n\n               The officer buckles.  Anderson catches him, rolls him gently\n               into the back of the transport.\n\n               Then Anderson quickly reaches into the transport, and begins\n               stuffing equipment into a duffel bag: a helmet and black\n               uniform, the weapon-glove, a folded rifle, a holographic\n               scanner, and other equipment whose function we can only guess\n               at.\n\n               Anderson looks up at a sound, echoey FOOTSTEPS.  They\n               approach, then fade away.\n\n               Anderson places the officer's hands and legs together, then\n               aims a nozzled cylinder at them.  He shoots a spray of blue\n               BindFoam chemical restraint, sticking the man to the floor\n               of the transport in an adhesive glob.\n\n               Then he leaves the scene, running.\n\n               INT. ANDERSON'S CHEVY\n\n               Anderson grips the wheel of his Chevy, driving down 1-95.\n               The fact that he can't control his car -- that the steering\n               wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his\n               direction is guided by satellite -- is maddening now.\n\n               From inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn\n               and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his\n               steering wheel.\n\n               Anderson slams it with his fist.  Through his windshield\n               Anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a\n               passing red and black Ford.  His mother sits in the\n               passenger's seat, blithely reading.  The boy mimics Anderson,\n               gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs.\n\n               Anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance,\n               at the \"Sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to Washington\n               D.C. You can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in\n               there.\n\n               EXT. POTOMAC PARK\n\n               Anderson stands on an embankment.  He holds the Precog disc\n               in his hand, ready to throw it into the river.\n\n               He stands like that ... and then slowly lets his hand drop.\n               He doesn't do it.\n\n               INT. ANDERSON'S HOME - SUBURBS -- LATER\n\n               Lisa enters the house, in a rush.  Every shade is drawn.\n               Paul Anderson sits in an overstuffed chair, absolutely\n               motionless, like a man who has died suddenly.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Don't move.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        37.\n\n\n               Lisa doesn't get it.  She continues toward him.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         Stop!

She is\n               suddenly suffocating.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         It's a hundred degrees in here.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         I turned the furnace all the way up.\n                         Your hair dryer.

It's\n                         impossible.\n\n               She shakes her head in disbelief.  Anderson speaks, choking\n               on the words.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         It's not true.\n\n               Anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair.\n               We see the bright DISC cupped in the palm.  He seems about\n               to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet.  He keeps staring at\n               her intently.  Something is holding him back.\n\n                                     LISA (CONT'D)\n                         You're upset.

They\n                         emit a single disc.  \"The immutable\n                         evidence of the infallible system.\"\n\n               The room is terribly hot, his words -- she begins to sway\n               unsteadily.\n\n               Anderson focuses on her.  Her face.  Her hair ...\n\n                                     LISA\n                         We'll figure this out.

And Anderson looks at Lisa's hair\n               ... and finally understands.\n\n               Slowly, and very carefully, Anderson slides the DISC back\n               into his pocket.  He rises from his chair.

Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it,\n               engines WHINING.  Black Python transports are all over the\n               street out in front, and more keep coming.\n\n               And everywhere on foot, there are Precrime police.

Anderson presses his lips together.\n               The Python turns on, and a generated voice greets him.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Paul Anderson 0256 clear.\n\n               Anderson grips the steering wheel.

THE SPRAWL  NIGHT\n\n               The unzoned city is full of 1950's iconography, but it all\n               feels different than it did in the suburbs.  Where the burbs\n               were Ike, the city is Joseph McCarthy.\n\n               The fat Ramblers and Studebakers have a little grime on them.\n               The women's dresses are tighter and more urgent, the men's\n               suits have some shine at the elbows.  You look over your\n               shoulder here, move faster, and smile a lot less.\n\n               And some streets you don't go on at all.  Anderson's Python\n               moves down one of them.  He stops under a blackened suspension\n               bridge, gets out.  He's still in uniform.

He shakes his head at his\n               sloppiness.  Goes back and shuts the door.

He was a holographic decoy.\n\n               What is actually there on the train seat is Anderson's cell\n               phone.  Rigged to its mouthpiece is a tiny digital voice\n               recorder.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. 20TH STREET SUBWAY\n\n               Anderson trots up the stairs and safely out onto the streets\n               of The Sprawl.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        51.\n\n\n               EXT. STREET - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT\n\n\n\n               Every city has its underbelly.  If you lifted the fat dark\n               underbelly of The Sprawl this is where you'd end up.\n\n               The streets here feel like alleys, clotted and tight.  There\n               are streetlights, bright ones -- but the light dies at its\n               source, never makes it through the sour air down to the\n               ground.\n\n               The retro fifties look comes apart here.  The people that\n               you see -- and you only catch quick glimpses of them, they\n               move like rats -- wear black mostly, tight fitting\n               tech-fibers.\n\n               ANDERSON'S caught one of the rats, a thin bald guy in black.\n               Anderson has him pinned up against a wall.  They're having\n               some kind of exchange -- which consists of the guy answering\n               none of Anderson's questions, and Anderson pressing him harder\n               against the wall.\n\n               Finally, the guy does something odd.  He lifts a finger and\n               pulls down Anderson's right lower eyelid.  Anderson lets\n               him.  Then the guy does the same on the left.  Has a long\n               look.  And then nods.  Anderson releases him, and they go\n               off together.\n\n               EXT. AN APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER\n\n               An oppressive brick thing on a side street.  The facade is\n               crumbling.  Nothing good happens in a building like this..\n\n               The guy leads Anderson to the building, then scurries off\n               into the night.\n\n               INT. ROOM -- LATER\n\n               A stained overstuffed chair in the corner, a dreary little\n               kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink.\n\n               But jarringly, in the center of all this, is a make-shift\n               hypertech medical setup: a gleaming operating table, an array\n               of lasers, scalpels and surgical equipment, an anesthesia\n               console.\n\n               Anderson sits in a chair facing DOC.  DOC is a big man with\n               delicate fingers.  He sneezes, then blows his nose hard into\n               a handkerchief.\n\n                                     DOC\n                         Got a cold.\n\n               Anderson looks at him uneasily.  It's not just DOC -- it's\n               the whole setup, the needles and scalpels, the medical thing,\n               which Anderson truly does not care for.  Doc sneezes again,\n               then looks up at his patient.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        52.\n\n\n                                     DOC (CONT'D)\n                         Don't worry.  I could cut open your\n                         chest, sew a dead cat in there, and\n                         you'd never get an infection.  Not\n                         with the spectrum antibios I'll be\n                         shooting into you.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc.\n\n               Doc chuckles.  Then he waits, expectantly.\n\n               Anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card.  A preset cash\n               card.  DOC slides it into small console, watches the numbers\n               flash up.  He frowns, sighs.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         It's all I could safely move\n\n               He waits.  Doc's not thrilled, but finally, he nods.\n\n                                     DOC\n                         Yeah.  All right.\n\n               Time to got down to business.  Doc walks over to a large\n               medical cabinet and opens the door.  It's full of EYES, and\n               parts of eyes -- 611 !  A cryo-jars.\n\n               Anderson tightens.\n\n                                     DOC (CONT'D)\n                         You understand what I told you then.\n                         I can't just give you new irises.\n                         The Scanners will read the scar\n                         tissue.

I get it, DOC.\n\n               Anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the\n               operating table.  He lies down.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         Do me quick before I run out of here.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        53.\n\n\n               Anderson lies there, blinking up at the ceiling.  He listens\n               to Doc preparing instrument trays.  It's a bad sound.\n\n               EXT. THE SPRAWL -- DAY\n\n               The suspension bridge where we saw Anderson vaporize the\n               Python transport.  Witwer stands watching as a Precrime\n               techno-unit sifts through the white ashes.\n\n               Witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the\n               Potomac.  It's a pose a track dog might hold, nose up, testing\n               the air for a scent.\n\n               INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY\n\n               We can't see anything at first, because Anderson can't see\n               anything either.  He's in a deep post-surgical haze.  DOC'S\n               voice comes to him.  It's warped and ugly.\n\n                                     DOC'S VOICE\n                         Don't take the bandages off for twenty\n                         four hours.  You'll go blind if you\n                         do.\n\n               Anderson makes an affirmative grunt. Now we see his\n               surroundings, even though Anderson still can't.  He lies in\n               a grungy bed, his head and eyes swathed in white dressings.\n               Doc stands over him.\n\n                                     DOC\n                         You're in a room.

Don't scratch.\n\n               Anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages.\n               Doc forces them away.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        54.\n\n\n                                     DOC (CONT'D)\n                         I'm giving you a bonus, might come\n                         in handy.  Feel this.\n\n               Doc takes an air-syringe out of his pocket and touches it to\n               Anderson's hand.\n\n                                     DOC (CONT'D)\n                         It's a temporary paralytic enzyme.\n                         Someone spots you, you duck into an\n                         alley, shoot this under your chin.\n\n               Doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of Anderson's\n               chin.  Anderson jumps.\n\n                                     DOC (CONT'D)\n                         The enzyme turns your facial muscles\n                         to mush.

I'll put it in your bag.\n\n               Finally, Doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places\n               it on a dresser beside Anderson's bed.\n\n                                     DOC (CONT'D)\n                         I'm setting up a timer.

THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT\n\n               The Precrime presence mounts on the streets.  A couple of\n               units move past the boarding house, but they don't stop.\n\n               INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- DAY\n\n               Anderson sits in a chair, his dressings like a blindfold.\n               He looks like a hostage.  He is sweating.  Keeps reaching\n               for his dressings to scratch, then forces himself not to.\n\n               He speaks to someone we don't yet see.  The guy DOC said\n               would come.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach.\n                                     (MORE)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        55.\n\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         Guess I should eat.  \n\t\t\t\t(Beat) \n\t\t\t You gonna help feed me?\n\n               Now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent\n               to help Anderson.  It's the rat guy, the thin bald man\n               Anderson had roughed up the day before.  The guy has a bowl\n               of hot soup in his hands.  He stares contemptuously at\n               Anderson.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         So how do we do this, pal?\n\n               The rat guy doesn't say a word.  He simply tips the hot soup\n               and it splatters down into Anderson's lap.  Anderson cries\n               out in pain and surprise.  The guy walks out of the room.\n\n               CLOSE ON- THE TIMER\n\n               Twenty hours gone by.  Four more to go.\n\n               EXT. THE SPRAWL\n\n               Precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch,\n               looking for leads, looking for anything.\n\n               INT. THE BOARDING ROOM\n\n               The TIMER shows one hour to go.  Anderson sits in a chair,\n               squirming miserably.  His dressings are wet with sweat, and\n               frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked\n               at them.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                              (to himself)\n                         Fuck.\n\n               He is this close to ripping the dressings off\n\n               EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               A Precrime transport stops.  Two officers get out.  One of\n               them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk, and\n               does a read on the boarding house.  The other does a read on\n               a pawn shop and bar next door..\n\n               The OFFICER 1 doing Anderson's boarding house, calls to the\n               other officer.\n\n                                     OFFICER 1\n                         Got 27 warm bodies in this place.\n                         What should it take, three or four\n                         Spiders?\n\n                                     OFFICER 2\n                         Do four.

He removes four round BALLS.  They are silver, as\n               big as billiard balls.\n\n               He goes up to the boarding house, gets IdentiScanned, and\n               the front door opens.  He rolls the balls down a dark hallway.\n\n               Then he goes back out to the transport, and leans against\n               it, bored.  He holds up an electronic clipboard and waits\n               for the data to come in.\n\n               INT. THE BUILDING\n\n               The BALLS roll about eight feet, then suddenly come to\n               autolife as they spin.  They open like flowers -- flowers\n               with legs.\n\n               CLOSE ON : A BALL\n\n               A fist-sized Spider takes shape.  On its head is an IdentiScan\n               lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna.\n\n               INT. A ROOM\n\n               An OLD WOMAN sits at a card table eating a bowl of something\n               unidentifiable.  She looks up with annoyance as she sees a\n               spider scuttling across the floor toward her.  It makes a\n               CLICKING sound on the floor as it comes.  She's poor, living\n               in The Sprawl -- she knows the drill.  She continues to eat\n               as the SPIDER crawls up the leg of the card table.  She barely\n               watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand.\n\n                                     OLD WOMAN\n                         It's nice to have a little company\n\n               She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her\n               am and inches up, then moves across her shoulder.  It grips\n               her cheek lightly, as the IdentiScan antenna reads her eyes.\n\n               Then it leaps off her and onto the floor and CLICKS away\n               across the linoleum.\n\n               EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE\n\n               The Precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column\n               with his laser pen, and waits for the next one.\n\n               INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM\n\n               Anderson sits in his chair.  He cocks his head, listening.\n               His body tenses.  Something feels wrong.\n\n               The TIMER shows ten minutes to go.  Blindfolded for a day\n               and a night, Anderson has no idea how much time he has left.\n               Three seconds, four hours?\n\n               A flattened SPIDER squeezes under his door.  Anderson tenses\n               as it CLICKS across the floor toward him.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        57.\n\n\n               He knows that sound.\n\n               Anderson stumbles up and out of his chair.  He starts to\n               grab at his dressings, remembers Doc's warning, and stops\n               himself.  The SPIDER waits for him to settle, then CLICKS\n               toward him again.\n\n               Anderson moves around the room, avoiding the Spider.  He is\n               dripping with sweat, starting to breathe hard.  The Spider\n               comes faster.  Anderson crashes into a table, brings it down.\n               Falls across the bed.\n\n               EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE\n\n               The Officer 1 squints at his clipboard.  One of the Spiders\n               is taking too long.  He adjusts his thermal scanner, and\n               sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room.\n\n               The other Officer 2 finishes reading the pawn shop and the\n               barroom, then wanders over to Officer 1. They both watch the\n               screen.\n\n                                     OFFICER 1\n                         Stinking drunk.\n\n                                     OFFICER 2\n                              (beat)\n                         Or a guy who doesn't want to get\n                         read.\n\n               INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM\n\n               Anderson forces himself to sit still, because he knows the\n               consequences.  The Spider advances, starts up his leg.\n\n               The TIMER has not buzzed.  Anderson can't touch his dressings.\n               The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face.  It\n               WHIRS and HUMS trying to adjust its antenna against the\n               dressings.\n\n               EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE\n\n               The officers eye the thermal scanner, as they reach for their\n               mirrored helmets, getting ready to go in.\n\n               INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM\n\n               The Spider crawls all over Anderson's head, trying to get\n               past the dressings for a read.\n\n               Anderson has no choice.  None.  He starts to lift at his\n               dressing.  The Spider senses his cooperation, freezes in\n               place.\n\n               Anderson wants to scream.  He unwraps his head, tugs the eye\n               pads away from his eyes.  He rips them off.  The Spider sits\n               on his shoulder, waiting.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        58.\n\n\n               Anderson's eyes are tightly closed.  He opens them\n\n               ANDERSON'S POV - BLINDING LIGHT\n\n               Light brighter than a magnesium burn, brighter than a nuclear\n               flashpoint.  Light to buckle the knees and push the brain\n               beyond endurance.\n\n               And though all this the faraway sound of a BUZZER going off.\n               The TIMER has finally sounded.  Anderson's open eyes are\n               streaming with tears, but he has survived the moment.\n\n               ANDERSON'S POV - THE ROOM\n\n               It comes into slow focus The Spider, all business, reads his\n               eyes.  Then, as if nothing unusual has occurred, it jumps\n               off his shoulder, and crosses the floor.  It flattens, scoots\n               under the door, and is gone.\n\n               EXT. THE BOARDING HOUSE\n\n               The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read.  They\n               pull off their helmets.\n\n                                     OFFICER 1\n                         Let's eat.\n\n               They start putting their equipment back into the transport.\n\n               INT. ANDERSON'S ROOM\n\n               Anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror.  His new eyes\n               are tender and bloodshot.  And they are not blue, like the\n               ones he was born with, but a deep brown.  Anderson is exactly\n               the same, and utterly different.\n\n               He grabs his duffel bag, and gets the hell out of there.\n\n               INT.

But the other thing I\n                         know is -- the Precogs are never\n                         wrong.\n\n               The words are leading them no place good.  They stop talking,\n               and just sit there.\n\n               INT. THE SPRAWL\n\n               Anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with\n               several people waiting for the N0.6 Turbo Tram.\n\n               The double decker Tram comes.  People get off, then the line\n               starts to move forward as people get on.\n\n               Anderson fidgets.  He's last in line.  Each person gets\n               IdentiScanned as he boards.  Anderson's putting his new eyes\n               to the test.  If the scan goes wrong, he's positioned himself\n               to run.\n\n               The woman ahead of him, gets scanned, pays her fare.\n               Anderson's turn.  Anderson goes up the steps, and a red beam\n               reads his eyes.\n\n               The Tram DRIVER glances at a monitor beside his steering\n               wheel, then nods at him.\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington.  Plenty\n                         of seats in the back.\n\n               Anderson nods, moves casually to the back.  But his jaw\n               muscles are flexing hard, working off the tension.\n\n               INT. A WEALTHY HOME - SUBBURIAN WASHINGTON -- NIGHT\n\n               Senator Malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he\n               finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den.  He\n               wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos\n               adorning the cherry wood walls.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        60.\n\n\n               He's feeling cozy and safe, the way rich people can afford\n               to.  No IdentiScan Spiders would ever be sent under his doors.\n               No intrusions of any sort, nothing that a coiffed secretary\n               or a loyal wife wouldn't announce before hand.\n\n               Which is why he doesn't immediately understand the small\n               SOUND at ear level, coming from just behind him.  It's a\n               metallic CLICK-CLICK.  He turns amiably.  His eyes instantly\n               widen, and his knees buckle when he sees he's looking into\n               the barrel of ANDERSON'S cocked gun.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Time to upgrade your alarm system,\n                         Senator.\n\n               Senator Malcolm tries to regain his composure.  His fear\n               embarrasses him.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         Your work-up of Witwer.

He slides\n               the barrel tip back and forth across the Senator's sweaty\n               skin.  It makes a greasy red mark.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         I could've come to anyone on the\n                         panel.  But I picked you.\n                              (beat)\n                         Of all the shits on that panel, I\n                         like you least of all.  So if this\n                         gun goes off, I'll feel bad, but\n                         not, you know, devastated.\n\n               You can almost see a thought dawning on Senator Malcolm.\n\n               And then, shockingly he spits in Anderson's face, and turns\n               and walks to the other side of the den.  His tone is mocking.\n\n                                     SENATOR MALCOLM\n                         What the fuck was I worried about?\n                         You can't kill me.  The Precogs\n                         would've seen it.\n\n               Anderson realizes this, too, lowers his gun.  The Senator is\n               even laughing now.  For a moment Anderson does nothing, then\n               he moves toward the Senator again.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        61.\n\n\n               The Senator stands his ground smugly.\n\n                                     SENATOR MALCOLM (CONT'D)\n                         Witwer's clean.

KITCHEN - THE SUBURBS -- DAY\n\n               A mother places a carton of milk on a table in front of her\n               teenage son.  He pours it into his cereal bowl, then puts\n               the carton down in front of him.\n\n               There's a flexible Vid-Screen on the side of the carton,\n               about the size of a playing card.  AS the sleepy kid watches,\n               the disposable Vid-Screen sparkles to life.\n\n               Nothing unusual, they always do that.  For advertisements,\n               lost kids, or in this case crime bulletins.\n\n               A good one.

A LIVING ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY\n\n               A big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch, a bowl of popcorn\n               perched on his belly.  He stares at a TV monitor that's the\n               size of a twin bed.\n\n               TV\n\n               Anderson's face fills the monitor.  The TV image is so big\n               that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence.\n               It's like God coming to pay a visit -- even if you want to\n               avoid Him you can't.\n\n               The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that.  He surfs\n               through a zillion channels, but Anderson's visage is\n               omnipresent.\n\n               EXT. THE SKY - THE SPRAWL -- DAY\n\n               Anderson's face fills the skies, too.  Witwer and Precrime\n               have pulled out all the stops.\n\n               Advertising dirigibles float by with Anderson's image on it.\n               Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air.  There\n               are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the\n               weather, a special type of cloud.\n\n               People on the streets look up, briefly interested, then go\n               about their business.\n\n               EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL\n\n               One person who is paying deep attention to all this is\n               Anderson himself.  He stands on a street corner, wearing\n               dark glasses and a fedora, staring at a public video kiosk.\n\n               VIDEO KIOSK\n\n               The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a\n               Precrime SPOKESWOMAN.\n\n                                     SPOKESWOMAN\n                         The United States Supreme Court has\n                         issued a special injunction allowing\n                         the unprecedented public viewing of\n                         former Precrime Director Paul\n                         Anderson's future murder of Edward\n                         Witwer, the current Director.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        64.\n\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         His mouth slowly opens.  He steps\n                         back against a wall and slides his\n                         hand into his pants pocket.  He looks\n                         at the Precog DISC in his cupped\n                         hand, then quickly puts it away.\n\n               He stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather\n               around excitedly.\n\n               CROWDS OF PEOPLE look into the sky, in store windows, at\n               other video kiosks.

Witwer slumps, dying.  The video stops.\n               And then begins to play all over again, right from the start,\n               the 1-800-PRECRIME number scrolling along the bottom of it.\n               \"Call now!

BAR - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT\n\n               Ennis Page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so\n               full of cigarette smoke it doesn't seem capable of supporting\n               life.  But it supports the kind of life Page is interested\n               in.\n\n               An emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool\n               beside Page.  He gives one shake of his head, and she slides\n               away again.  His eyes cut to a group of females.  He waits\n               for the next approach.\n\n               CLOSE ON: PAGE\n\n               as a HAND reaches over his shoulder and places a Precog disc\n               on the bar in front of him.

Sits next to\n               him.  Page stares at him, scared.

The young guy drops the receiver and stumbles back\n               onto the sidewalk.  Anderson grabs the hanging receiver.\n\n                                     YOUNG GUY\n                         Hey!

She flattens herself\n               against a wall.  She stays like that for a long moment,\n               pulling the sound of her husband's voice, his words, deep\n               inside of herself.\n\n               And then she gets a look, as one of those words registers\n               profoundly.\n\n                                     LISA\n                              (whispers to herself)\n                         Frank hated gardenias.\n\n               EXT. EAST END CEMETERY - ARLINGTON -- LATER\n\n               A public cemetery along the Potomac.  There's not much land\n               left for new graves.  A funeral is taking place.  A lot of\n               mourners in dark 1950's suits and dresses.  The service is\n               nearing its end.\n\n               Frank D'Ignazio's newly dug grave is nearby.  Lisa stands\n               there, looking at the temporary marker, and the flowers and\n               wreaths piled up against it.\n\n               Two rows over, they are lowering the casket into the ground.\n\n               High in the sky, a PRECRIME HOVERCRAFT, everpresent in Lisa's\n               life, floats in the low clouds with a barely audible WHINE.\n\n               Lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers.\n               Her hand drifts near a white GARDENIA WREATH.  There is a\n               small envelope tucked beneath a blossom.  She takes it.\n\n               Then she rises and begins to walk back to her car.\n\n               The funeral is over, and the mass of mourners, many wearing\n               dark glasses, fan out toward a long line of cars.\n\n               One of the MOURNERS brushes past Lisa.  She looks up and he\n               tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over\n               them at her.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        69.\n\n\n               It's Anderson.  Isn't it?  She looks into his eyes.  And\n               it's jarring, the blue eyes gone, that they're brown now.\n               But it's him, he's there, and she wants to reach out for\n               him.  Knows she can't.\n\n               He's already moving on.  He's risked everything for a look.\n               He slips into the black sea of mourners, she goes to her car\n               -neither of them ever breaking stride.\n\n               The Precrime craft hovers, unaware\n\n               INT. LISA'S CAR\n\n               Lisa opens the envelope as her car drives her down the\n               Alexandria-Washington ConnectWay.\n\n               A Precog DISC falls into her hand.  Her mouth opens -- she's\n               never held one before.\n\n               And there is a NOTE with it It READS:\n\n               \"The Precogs generated duplicate discs.

A CONVENIENCE STORE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY\n\n               Anderson has to eat bad food quickly, and on the run.  He\n               gathers up a wrapped sandwich, a bag of donuts, something to\n               drink.\n\n               He waits in line.  He doesn't like to be in a line, waiting.\n               The woman ahead of him argues about change.  He presses his\n               lips together.\n\n               And then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera\n               DOME attached to the ceiling.  It gives him a fish eye\n               reflected VIEW of what's happening behind him.\n\n               Precrime police are happening behind him.  He doesn't stop\n               to ponder, as two Python transports zoom up outside the store.\n\n               Anderson vaults the counter, knocking the customer and the\n               clerk to the floor.\n\n               INT. BACK ROOM\n\n               Anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can.  He hears the\n               mechanically altered COMMANDS of a Precrime officer calling\n               from the store.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Paul Anderson.

Chunks of brick\n               fly off the walls on both sides.  But he is full of\n               adrenaline, and there is no stopping him.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        70.\n\n\n               INT.

Precrime transports are heading straight at the\n               tram, going the wrong way on a one way avenue.\n\n               They've even taken radio control of the P.A. system on the\n               tram.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Paul Anderson.

The passengers turn in unison like cattle, and stare\n               at him, terrified.\n\n               Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit\n               doors, smashing them open, and tumbles out onto the street.\n\n               He rolls, and is up on his feet in a second, reaching into\n               his bag for a glove.  He pulls the weapon onto his right\n               hand, as he whirls around sizing up his predicament.\n\n               Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the\n               street.  He looks up.  He is surrounded by skyscrapers and\n               buildings -- he is walled in, at the bottom of an urban\n               canyon.\n\n               People freeze against the sides of buildings, run into\n               doorways where they can.  Passengers in trans and taxis or\n               cars stay there, pressed against their windows watching.\n\n               Nothing moves, except the Python transports, closing in.\n               The lead officer speaks, with that menacing electronically\n               altered VOICE.\n\n                                     VOICE (CONT'D)\n                         Lower your weapon, or we will\n                         neutralize your threat potential.\n\n               The Precrime police are out of the transports now, advancing\n               at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men.\n\n               Anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building\n               closest to him.\n\n               ANDERSON'S POV - A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT\n\n               The large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        71.\n\n\n               Anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward\n               it, his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement.\n\n                                     VOICE (CONT'D)\n                         Do not move!\n\n               Anderson is up on the sidewalk now, two feet out from the\n               building, right beside the high pressure hydrant.\n\n               He stops, looks up, looks down, looks at the police advancing.\n               It is a moment for prayer.  Anderson doesn't have a moment.\n\n               He spreads his feet and fires a massive SONIC BLAST down at\n               the sidewalk.  The effect on the underground water main is\n               immediate.\n\n               A GEYSER of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up\n               from the sidewalk, lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen\n               feet into the air right alongside the building.\n\n               The stunned police officers try to take aim, but Anderson's\n               bouncing at the top of the geyser.  And they can't fire,\n               anyway, because officers workers stare at the excitement\n               from every window in the building.\n\n               All this in a time span of seconds.  The world spins crazily\n               for ANDERSON, but he manages to grip hold of a metal support\n               beam holding the building's sign, one story up.\n\n               The police try to see what he's doing, but the torrent of\n               water from the water main break obscures his moves.\n\n               He pulls himself onto a ledge, steadies himself, slides along\n               it toward a second story window.  The office building gawkers\n               lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to\n               sparkling dust and leaps inside.\n\n               INT. OFFICE BUILDING\n\n               The building covers almost an entire city block.  Anderson,\n               dripping wet, runs from one end of it to another, blasting\n               through doors, shoving terrified workers out of the way.\n\n               He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field,\n               jumping obstacles, slamming through, over, and around whatever\n               he must to get to his goal.\n\n               And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the\n               avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime\n               ambushed him.\n\n               He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream\n               of traffic.  It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers.\n\n               Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of\n               the bus.  It is a bone-jarring landing.  He loses\n               consciousness for a second, rolls the length of the roof,\n               and slides off it onto the pavement.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        72.\n\n\n               He lies there, trying to rouse himself.  Traffic brakes to a\n               stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in\n               the road.  No one wants to touch him.  A single car horn\n               SOUNDS, and then a chorus of them.\n\n               Anderson rouses, struggles to his feet, and takes off in a\n               limping run.\n\n               INT. SUBWAY STATION  LATER\n\n               Anderson, out of breath and in pain, leans against a post at\n               the far end of the passenger platform.  There are tracks on\n               either side of him, one marked \"Uptown\" and the other\n               \"Downtown. \"\n\n               He feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that\n               the Downtown train is coming in.  And on his left, too, the\n               Uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view.\n\n               Which MagLev train will lead him to safety?  Which one won't\n               they pinpoint?  He runs up to a teenage KID who has his arm\n               around his girlfriend.  They step back, startled.  He's got\n               a flat top hair cut, she wears a pleated skirt and saddle\n               shoes.\n\n               The trains pull in.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Pick one for me!\n\n                                     KID\n                         What?\n\n               THEY TRY TO WALK AWAY\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Point to the train I should take.\n                         Please.\n\n                                     KID\n                         I don't know.\n\n               The girl lifts a nervous finger and points.  The Uptown.  He\n               runs to board it, as they run in the opposite direction to\n               the Downtown.\n\n               INT. SUBWAY CAR\n\n               He sits at the back of the half empty train watching the\n               dark rush by.  A train chosen arbitrarily -- it's impossible\n               they could find him.\n\n               A station Stop.  He starts to get off, is actually on the\n               platform, then steps back onto the train.\n\n               The rushing dark again.  When the MagLev eases to a halt at\n               the next station he gets off this time.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        73.\n\n\n               INT. STATION\n\n               He walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people.\n               He eases back and lets them go up first.\n\n               THE STAIRS\n\n               Precrime officers crouch around the bend, silently snatching\n               people out of the way as they come into view.  They wait\n               -but Anderson does not come.  And he does not come.\n\n               On signal, the Precrime officers rush down the stairs.\n\n               DOORWAY ABOVE THE STAIRS\n\n               ANDERSON hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling,\n               adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive BindFoam.\n\n               ANDERSON'S POV - THE OFFICERS\n\n               as they run below him down the stairs.  They go out of sight,\n               he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for\n               him.\n\n               The strain of hanging by one arm is killing him.  He reaches\n               up.  With a laser knife, and cuts away at his coat sleeve,\n               releasing himself from the glob.  He drops to the stairs,\n               and instantly slips up them.\n\n               He surprises a helmeted OFFICER, just around the bend.  He\n               slams HIM against the wall, yanks off his helmet, and holds\n               the laser knife against his throat.\n\n               The OFFICER 1s clearly terrified.  He speaks hoarsely through\n               Anderson's choking grip.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         Don't kill me!  Jesus.  Please.\n\n               Anderson looks at the panicked officer.  Anderson closes his\n               eyes trying to put it together.  He opens them.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         But the Precogs would've predicted\n                         me killing you.  You'd know whether\n                         I do or not.\n\n               The officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy.\n               Anderson suddenly gets it.  He tightens his grip on the man.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (CONT'D)\n                         They shut down the system.  Haven't\n                         they?  They've shut down the Precogs.\n\n               The officer nods.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        74.\n\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         They're off homicides.  They're\n                         redirecting them to help us locate\n                         you.\n\n               Which is how they knew where he'd be every time.\n\n               Anderson chops quickly at the base of the man's skull,\n               knocking him out.  And then he runs, because what else can\n               he do?\n\n               INT. JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY\n\n               Lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door, labeled:\n               COURTROOM 17.  She holds a briefcase in one hand.  Down the\n               hall, other courtrooms are in use, but not this one.  She\n               enters the dark and vacant Courtroom 17.\n\n               INT. COURTROOM 17\n\n               Lisa sits at the judge's bench in the empty courtroom.  The\n               lights are dim.\n\n               She takes a small, battery-powered tv out of her briefcase.\n               She turns it on.\n\n               TV\n\n               The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and\n               over in a continuous loop.  Flashing at the bottom is the\n               hotline number: \"1-800-PRECRIME.\" Then- \"Call Now!

The tv\n               plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the\n               judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc.\n\n               She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from\n               one version to the other.  They seem absolutely identical.\n               When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again.\n\n               Lisa stares, watching her husband murder his best friend,\n               endlessly.\n\n               EXT. A GAS STATION - ALEXANDRIA -- DAY\n\n               A gas station right out of the fifties.  An attendant in a\n               uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield\n               of a sky blue Rambler.\n\n               In the background, Anderson walks toward a men's room.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        75.\n\n\n               INT. THE MEN'S ROOM\n\n               Anderson looks at himself in the mirror.  He reaches out and\n               touches one reflected eye, which is a deep brown.  It is\n               still startling to him, the color of his eyes.\n\n               Then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air\n               syringe Doc gave to him.  He looks at it nervously.  It is\n               filled with 5 cc's of an opaque green liquid.\n\n               He touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin.\n               He closes his eyes.  Then he screws up his courage, and hits\n               the plunger.  The liquid is pneumatically delivered with a\n               searing HISS.\n\n               Anderson screams out in agony, slams back against the wall\n               of the bathroom.  His hands reach up for his face -- which\n               looks like it's boiling from within.\n\n               ANDERSON'S FACE\n\n               The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker.  The muscle tone\n               around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old\n               man's.  That is the effect -- like he is aging fifty years.\n               His forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop.  Healthy\n               pink is replaced by bloodless gray.\n\n               AND MOTHER OF GOD DOES IT HURT\n\n               EXT. THE MEN'S ROOM\n\n               The ATTENDANT knocks nervously on the door\n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                         You all right in there?\n\n               When the door opens, an unhealthy looking old guy with a\n               fedora hat pulled low comes slowly out of the bathroom.\n               Anderson nods, and walks past the attendant, who watches\n               after him uncertainly as he wanders off.\n\n               INT. PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER\n\n               The perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around\n               the headquarters.  There may be a massive campaign to find\n               Anderson, but the Precrime public relations machine continues\n               to run without interruption.\n\n               There are ten people in the group, and the physically\n               transformed Anderson is among them.  They all wear glowing\n               nametags.  Anderson's reads, \"Mr. Symington.\" He keeps his\n               hands in his pockets, and his head low.\n\n               We have heard the tour guide's spiel before\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        76.\n\n\n                                     TOUR GUIDE\n                         Welcome to the main headquarters of\n                         Precrime.

He\n               whispers to her, embarrassed.  She gives him a professional\n               smile, and points in the distance past the elevators.\n\n               Anderson nods, and heads off.  She calls after him.\n\n                                     TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)\n                         We'll wait right here for you, sir!\n\n\t       INT.

His eyes keep flicking to the\n               digital clock on the wall.  Then they cut back to the men\n               and machines that are telling him nothing.  Witwer does not\n               look well at all, When a TECHNICIAN leans close to his\n               computer monitor,Witwer almost leaps across the room to get\n               to him.

The silence is broken\n               by the SOUND of something rolling across the floor.  Somebody\n               speaks, probably the guard.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Shit.\n\n               An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts.\n               And leaping through the light is ANDERSON.  The temporarily\n               blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees.\n               Anderson stun guns them quickly.\n\n               The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor.\n               We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features\n               are returning to normal.\n\n               He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs.  It is the\n               equipment he is after.\n\n               Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in\n               horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the\n               Precog helmets to the mainframe.\n\n               Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing\n               it out and knocking Page unconscious.  Then he reaches into\n               the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of\n               blasts.\n\n               Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a\n               PRESENCE behind him.  Perhaps it is because the movement is\n               so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection.\n\n               A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes\n               hold of his hand.\n\n               Anderson whirls around, weapon out.  And there before him,\n               is the FEMALE Precog.  He looks at her, then beyond her to\n               the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in\n               their chairs.\n\n               Her helmet is off.  She is young, but her close-cropped hair\n               is silver white.  And when she speaks, her voice is like the\n               wind whispering through time.\n\n                                     FEMALE\n                         Save us, Anderson.\n\n               Anderson can feel the seconds ticking away, his carefully\n               planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         I have to get out of here.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        80.\n\n\n               She grips his hand.\n\n                                     FEMALE\n                         Save us.\n\n               It is beyond pitiful, this frail little woman, pleading.\n               And her eyes, she won't let him go.  She is beginning to\n               weaken, to sway on her feet.\n\n               A sudden realization floods over Anderson.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         You let me get here, didn't you?\n                         You stopped giving them information,\n                         so they couldn't track me.\n\n               The Precog female is fading fast.  She tries to reach out\n               for him and her legs give way.\n\n                                     FEMALE\n                         Save -- \n  \t       And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls?  \n\t       What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the \n\t       fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom.\n\n               INT. TUDICIAL CENTER\n\n               Lisa has been staring at the judge's monitor and the tv screen\n               for over an hour.  The two versions of Anderson murdering\n               Witwer play over and over.\n\n                                     LISA\n                              (wearily, to herself)\n                         Help me, Paul.\n\n               She hits freeze-frame on the judge's monitor, at a moment\n               during his confrontation with Witwer when Anderson's FACE\n               fills the screen.\n\n               Lisa looks with deep urgency into her husband's eyes.\n\n               And it is his EYES, finally, that tell her everything.  Lisa's\n               hand rises to her open mouth.\n\n                                     LISA (CONT'D)\n                         They're blue.\n\n               She keeps the image on freeze-frame, and turns and looks at\n               the tv, which shows Precrime's disc over and over, the 1-800\n               number scrolling along the bottom.\n\n               When the same close-up of Anderson flashes onto the tv screen,\n               she leans close to it and squints.\n\n               Anderson stares right back at her.  And for the first time,\n               Lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical.  His\n               eyes...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        81.\n\n\n                                     LISA (CONT'D)\n                         And now they're brown.\n\n               For the first time in days she allows herself a small smile.\n\n               INT. PRECOG CHAMBER\n\n               Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters.  Witwer\n               walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber.  EMT teams\n               work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson\n               has left in his wake.\n\n               Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs, the\n               brothers.  Their eyes are closed and they are limp.  Their\n               lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other.\n\n               Lieutenant Glaser is with him, but when Witwer speaks it is\n               almost to himself.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Why didn't the Precogs know he was\n                         coming to do this?\n\n               The Lieutenant has no reply.  Witwer runs both hands through\n               his hair.  It has begun to wear him down, the ticking of the\n               clock ...\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         The next time he shows up it'll be\n                         to kill me.\n\n                                     LIEUTENANT GLASER\n                         We won't let that happen, sir.\n\n               Witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him, then gives the\n               Lieutenant a withering look.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         You won't, huh?\n\n               When the Lieutenant tries to speak to him, Witwer walks away\n               and goes over to the technicians working on the Precogs.  He\n               stares at the Precogs.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                              (to a technician)\n                         When can we get these things\n                         operational?\n\n                                     TECHNICIAN\n                         They're a hive mind, sir.  It takes\n                         three for their predictive abilities\n                         to be fully operational.\n\n               Which Witwer does not want to hear.  Witwer leans very close\n               to the technician.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        82.\n\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         These two are all I have to find the\n                         man who is about to murder me.  Hook\n                         them up, and flood them with whatever\n                         kind of fucking chemicals you have\n                         to.  They are a machine, and I need\n                         that machine at my disposal.\n\n               The Precogs's lips stop for a microsecond, and then begin\n               their silent movements again.\n\n               INT. ENNIS PAGE'S HOUSE - ALEXANDRIA -- NIGHT\n\n               Ennis Page is a man unglued.  He sits on a tidy little sofa,\n               in a tidy 1950's style living room.  But his movements have\n               become untidy.  He puts a very tiny pill on his tongue.\n\n               When he drinks from a glass of water, it dribbles down his\n               chin onto his shirt.  Not like Ennis, at all.\n\n               When his doorbell RINGS, he slowly looks up, then looks down\n               at the floor again.  He doesn't answer it.  It RINGS some\n               more.\n\n               And then Lisa is standing there before him\n\n                                     LISA\n                         Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis.

What does it matter that the\n                         first disc is a fake ... if the second\n                         one's real?\n\n               Witwer's hands close tight on the discs.  Lisa stands there,\n               motionless.  Then she turns, and leaves his office, abruptly.\n               He watches her go.\n\n               INT. ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY\n\n               Rose sits in a chair near the window.  She is chewing lightly\n               on a cracker.  Her face shows wonder -- at the cracker's\n               texture and taste.  She holds it up and admires its shape.\n\n               Anderson's mood is less wondrous\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Rose.  Listen to me.  I'm going to\n                         leave you here.  I have to keep\n                         moving.\n\n               ROSE'S SMILE ABRUPTLY VANISHES\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         No.  You must save my brothers.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         It's impossible.  There's no time.\n                         I've done what I can do!\n\n               Rose waits for him to finish.  She looks out the window at\n               the street scene.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Come here, Anderson.\n\n\t       He does, reluctantly.\n\n                                     ROSE (CONT'D)\n                         Do you see that boy in the blue hat\n                         walking with his mother?\n                              (beat)\n                         In sixty seconds he will walk beneath\n                         those workers installing a window on\n                         the tenth floor of that building.\n\n               ANDERSON'S POV - THE BOY AND THE WORKERS\n\n               Two men struggle to lift a large window in place.  Way below\n               the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk\n               holding his mother's hand.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        91.\n\n\n                                     ROSE (CONT'D)\n                         They'll drop the window, killing\n                         him.  It is impossible to save him.\n\n               Anderson turns to her, shocked And then he runs for the door,\n               hurls it open, and disappears down the hall.\n\n               Rose listens to his FOOTSTEPS crashing down the stairs\n\n               EXT. THE STREET.\n\n               Even as Anderson rushes out of the boarding house, the WORKERS\n               have lost their grip on the window.\n\n               The little BOY in the blue hat and his MOTHER walk unwittingly\n               toward disaster.  They do not appear to hear the MEN'S cries.\n\n               The WINDOW falls end over end above the boy's head.  The\n               sunlight sparks off of the glass, so that from a distance it\n               looks like a star falling from the sky.\n\n               A WOMAN across the street sees what is happening, and cries\n               out.\n\n               But what Anderson does is run.  He runs faster and harder\n               than humanly possible.  He does not care if he is recognized\n               or hit by a passing taxi.  He is going to get to that boy.\n               He has to get to that boy ...\n\n               ANDERSON rams the BOY from behind just as the corner of the\n               window frame kisses the boy's blue hat.  He knocks the boy\n               to safety as glass and metal SMASH into the sidewalk.\n\n               The mother does not even have time to scream.  She is on the\n               ground, stunned, But Anderson has saved the boy.\n\n               He rolls away, and gets to his feet.  Before anyone can put\n               together what has happened, Anderson has ducked into an alley,\n               and is gone.\n\n               INT. THE ROOM - LATER\n\n               Anderson enters the room again, out of breath, some small\n               cuts on his face and hands.  He stands across the room staring\n               at Rose.\n\n               Rose considers him.  When she speaks her voice is near and\n               distant at the same time.  For Anderson, it is as if the\n               words are coming from a place inside his own head.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         It was impossible to save that boy\n                         -- but you did, Anderson.  It's in\n                         you.  It's what you are.\n\n               Anderson sits on the floor and leans back wearily against a\n               wall.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        92.\n\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         You knew it wasn't impossible.  That\n                         I'd get there.\n\n               Rose reveals nothing.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         You are a man who saves others.\n                              (beat)\n                         Save my brothers.\n\n               Anderson almost laughs.  Her persistence is unbelievable\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         I'm in a lot of trouble right now.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         My brothers are in more trouble.\n                         They've moved them to ... an awful\n                         place.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Rose.  Ed Witwer -he's in the most\n                         trouble of all.  Who saves him?\n\n               Rose suddenly grimaces in pain, and grips the side of her\n               head.  She curls into a fetal position.\n\n               Anderson goes to her, touches her thin shoulder.  Her eyes\n               roll into the back of her head.\n\n               Whose pain is she feeling?  Her own?  Someone else's?\n               Anderson doesn't want to think about it.\n\n               INT. PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB -CHEVY CHASE, MD -- NIGHT\n\n               Because Anderson has destroyed the Precog Chamber, the two\n               Precog brothers have been brought here.\n\n               The room is makeshift, uncomfortable ... a place for\n               experiments.  The brothers are strapped into chairs.  They\n               are helmeted.\n\n               But unlike before, large bore needles have been placed in\n               their jugular veins.  Connected to the needles are long twists\n               of IV tubing.  There are several IVs running at high drip\n               rates.\n\n               Witwer has his back to all this.  He stands with Dr. Resfield,\n               watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge\n               mainframe.\n\n               Dr. Resfield, a man not given to squeamishness looks back at\n               the Precogs, uneasy.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        93.\n\n\n                                     DR.

Witwer \n               is somewhere beyond the influence and reach of words.\n\n               INT. BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- MORNING\n\n               Anderson tries to get Rose to drink some water.  Her skin is\n               translucent, unhealthy, glistening with sweat.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Rose.  Try to drink.\n\n               She pushes the cup away.  She closes her eyes, as if even\n               the dim light of the room causes her pain.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         Your wife.

JUDICIAL CENTER  ALEXANDRIA\n\n               Lisa moves quickly down the steps of the white marble\n               building.  She takes a deep breath, then heads down Jefferson\n               Boulevard toward the city.\n\n               A sleek black TRANSPORT with two Precrime officers in it\n               follows her from a discreet distance.\n\n               In the sky above, the ubiquitous Precrime hovercraft\n\n               INT. CITY STREET  ALEXANDRIA\n\n               Lisa walks down the street.  She hugs herself, barely aware\n               of her surroundings.  She passes by stores, restaurants,\n               payphones, video kiosks ... oblivious.  People push past\n               her.\n\n               On a street corner, as she waits at a red light, the payphone\n               beside her begins to RING.  If she hears it, she gives no\n               indication.  A KID reaches for it, listens, hangs up.\n\n               She walks on.  Stores.  Restaurants.  An art gallery.  As\n               she comes abreast of another PAYPHONE, it suddenly starts to\n               ring.  This time Lisa glances at it.  But again, walks on.\n\n               The TRANSPORT weaves through traffic, nearby She walks past\n               the K.L. Lawrence Graphics Museum.  And another restaurant.\n               And a PAYPHONE.  And this time, finally, when it, too, RINGS,\n               she turns and looks hard at it.\n\n               A man begins to walk over to it.  Lisa almost knocks him out\n               of the way to get to it.  She grabs at the receiver.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         Hello?

THE SUBWAY CAR\n\n               The blond transport officer with the red tie sits at the far\n               end of Lisa's car, watching her.\n\n               At the next stop Lisa gets off.  He follows, not too far\n               behind.\n\n               INT. SUBWAY STATION\n\n               Lisa starts up the stairs.  She looks at her watch, then\n               makes herself pause a few moments, to keep within Anderson's\n               time frame.  She starts up again.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (V.O.)\n                         As you come around the bend, cry out\n                         and turn around and slap the\n                         officer...\n\n               Lisa does this, and the officer reels back, surprised. At the\n               same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into\n               view, and see this happening.  Lisa starts to run.  When the\n               undercover officer tries to stop her, the two men grab the\n               officer, and they get into a fight.\n\n               Lisa escapes.\n\n               INT. A TAXI - THE SPRAWL\n\n               Lisa looks at her watch, then taps the window for the driver\n               to stop.  She gets out.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (V.O.)\n                         Stay on Ninth street.

The taxi driver looks at\n               her, sees her smile, sees the prepaid cash card she holds\n               out to him.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         Two hundred dollars if you don't\n                         scan me.\n\n               It's The Sprawl -- stranger things have happened.  He grabs\n               the card, and jerks his head for her to get in.

NINTH STREET  LATER\n\n               Lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky.\n               It is dense with holographic billboards, skim-jets,\n               dirigibles.  Somewhere in all that is a Precrime hovercraft.\n\n               And the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale.\n\n                                     ANDERSON (V.O.)\n                         The hovercraft will try to drop\n                         altitude, but the air traffic will\n                         slow it down.\n                              (beat)\n                         Precrime loses you.

She stands out in\n               her white dress -- a spot of vulnerable color in world of\n               black.\n\n               Too vulnerable to pass up.  A MAN in a gray overcoat slides\n               out from between two buildings in front of her.  He is not\n               coy about his intent.  He comes straight at her, all business.\n\n               Lisa freezes in place.  She looks at her watch.  The man\n               grabs her by the shoulder.  When she starts to scream, he\n               claps his hand over her mouth, hard.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your\n                         teeth out.\n\n               Her eyes look around frantically.  He starts to drag her\n               backwards into the dark.\n\n               ANDERSON leaps into view, and slams the man's head into a\n               light post.  It takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens\n               his grip on Lisa.  His legs at last collapse under him.\n\n               Anderson scoops Lisa off the ground.  She hugs him hard.\n\n               Then pulls back from him.  She gives him a look.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         Cut it a little close there,\n                         honeybunch.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Rose got the street wrong.

THE BOARDING HOUSE -- LATER\n\n               Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson\n               together.\n\n               Lisa needs to touch him.  She keeps a hand on his arm, brushes\n               back a loose look of his hair.  Rose is mesmerized by her\n               actions.  She drinks in everything, every bit of life.\n\n               Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation.  They speak to\n               each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room.\n\n               Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Two discs.

Whoever planned it, wasn't\n                         counting on two.\n\n               They are silent for a long time.

Who ever\n                         talked to us?  Who cared that we\n                         could talk?\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Rose.

Her brothers\n               sit in their usual places on either side of her.  The\n               technicians tend to them.\n\n               Rose's eyes are open.  She sees everything in the room.  The\n               technicians, the machines ... and across the room a large\n               window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe\n               computer.\n\n               Rose watches through the window ...\n\n               As the computer emits discs, Page gathers them\n\n                                     ROSE (V.O.)\n                         Ed Witwer entered Page's office.\n\n               Witwer carries a mug of coffee.\n\n               Ennis Page goes red in the face, stares at the coffee.  Speaks\n               to Witwer, angrily, pointing to the coffee.  We can't hear\n               the words.\n\n                                     ROSE (V.O.)

It\n               tips, and spills.\n\n               Page looks like his head will explode.  He pulls a neatly\n               folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops\n               to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the\n               coffee stain on his spotless rug.\n\n                                     ROSE (V.O.)

He looks through the window into\n               the Precog Chamber, but the only one watching him is Rose --\n               and what does she matter?\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       102.\n\n\n               Page rises angrily from cleaning the rug.  Witwer shrugs in\n               apology and leaves the room.  Page stares after him.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               Rose is weeping.  She looks at Anderson and Lisa.\n\n                                     ROSE (CONT'D)\n                         I didn't understand what I'd seen.\n                         And I had no one to tell ...\n\n               Lisa puts her arms around Rose Anderson tries to comprehend\n               what he has heard.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Ed ...\n\n               Lisa turns, and speaks softly to her husband.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         The perfect system -brought down by\n                         a cup of coffee.

If I\n                         stay here I won't kill him.  Right?\n\n               But Rose and her brothers have already answered that question\n               for him.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. WITWER'S OFFICE\n\n               Lieutenant Glaser looks at his watch.  Witwer is still in\n               his chair, turned away from him.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         You see, if you think you can put me\n                         on a hovercraft and save me, then\n                         you don't believe in the infallibility\n                         of the Precog system.\n\n               Lieutenant Glaser has his orders.  He begins to approach.\n\n               And as he does, Witwer swivels his chair around, and lifts\n               the weapon he has been holding and silently shoots Lieutenant\n               Glaser in the forehead.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         And what I do not want around me,\n                         are nonbelievers.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       103.\n\n\n               Witwer steps over the body as if it doesn't exist, and walks\n               out of the office, locking the door behind him.\n\n               EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE, MD -- LATER\n\n               Witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete\n               building that houses the lab.  The lights are out in all the\n               windows except the back section of the second floor.  There,\n               the lights burn brightly.\n\n               Witwer sees Precrime officers posted at intervals around it.\n               He smiles as if he knows something they don't.  He looks at\n               his watch.  It is a cool night, but his face is slick with\n               sweat.\n\n               He walks to the entrance of the building.  An OFFICER 1s\n               startled to see him.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Things quiet?\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         Sir.

I need to\n                         see what the Precogs have seen.\n\n               Witwer is IdentiScanned.  The door opens and he goes in.\n\n               INT. THE LAB\n\n               Dr. Resfield looks up as Witwer strides into the lab, carrying\n               a tv under his arm.  Witwer is the last person he wants to\n               see.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Borrowed this from the technicians'\n                         lounge.  You don't think they'll\n                         mind, do you?\n\n                                     DR.RESFIELD\n                         You shouldn't be here, Director.\n\n               Dr. Resfield's eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall,\n               the red numbers ticking off time in seconds.\n\n               Witwer looks for a plug, finds one.  Plugs in the tv.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       104.\n\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         No, no.  This is exactly where I\n                         should be.\n\n                                     DR. RESFIELD\n                         You're under a lot of strain,\n                         Director.\n\n               Witwer finds what he's looking for -- the continuous loop of\n               his murder by Anderson.  \"Call Now!  Call Now!\"\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         And tv's so good for that -- soothes\n                         the mind.\n\n               Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a\n               bright smile.  The scientist looks like he wants to run out\n               of the room.\n\n               Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the\n               Precogs.  Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjusting\n               IV's and turning dials on the Precogs's organic helmets.\n\n               The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial.\n               But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too\n               weak for that.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         Bring me up to speed, Doc.\n\n                                     DR.

BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL\n\n               Rose looks like she's on fire.  Anderson wets another towel,\n               wrings it over the sink.  Lisa takes it, and wipes down Rose's\n               face and arms .\n\n               Rose's lips are moving soundlessly.  Her eyes are shut tight.\n               She begins to writhe in bed.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Jesus Christ.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         Come on, Rose.\n\n               ANDERSON LOOKS AT HIS WATCH\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         One hour.

Rose's body contorts\n               horribly and she arches up off the bed.  Lisa can't control\n               her.\n\n               Anderson reaches for her, wraps her in his arms, trying to\n               hold and comfort her.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Rose!\n\n               She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         He's killed him, Anderson!\n\n               Rose stiffens into a seizure posture, then her body goes\n               slack.  Anderson eases her back on the bed.  He stares at\n               her, stricken.\n\n               Her voice barely leaves her now\n\n                                     ROSE (CONT'D)\n                         You didn't save my brother.\n\n               Anderson reels at her words.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       106.\n\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Did he kill both of them, Rose?\n                         Rose!\n\n               Rose manages to speak, one last time.

Looks down at Rose.\n\n               It matters.  He starts to move, quickly.\n\n               Lisa takes hold of his arm.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         If you leave this room...\n\n\t       Anderson kisses her.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         Then I'm a cop, just trying to do\n                         hisjob.\n\n               He reaches for his duffel bag.\n\n               When the door closes behind him, Rose turns her head slightly\n               and looks.  And then her eyes drift closed, as she goes to a\n               place deep within her own mind.\n\n               EXT. A STREET - THE SPRAWL - MOMENTS LATER\n\n               He passes by several cars on the street.  But they're all\n               auto-drive, they won't do him any good.\n\n               So he smashes a store window within forty-five seconds a\n               city police transport zooms up, lights flashing.  Two city\n               officers leap out of the transport.  They approach the\n               smashed-in store window, weapons drawn.  Which is a mistake.\n               Anderson rises into view behind them, and sonically blasts a\n               small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on.\n\n               As they trip and fall, he is already spraying them down with\n               BindFoam.\n\n               Their second mistake is they left the engine running to power\n               the bank of Nits -Tracker lights on the car's hood and roof.\n               Anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets\n               of The Sprawl, a beacon of light in the darkness.\n\n               INT. THE LAB\n\n               The DIGITAL CLOCK races through time.  Witwer reaches his\n               hand up and touches the vanishing numbers.\n\n               The camera pulls back, and we see Dr. Resfield and the two\n               technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       107.\n\n\n               And when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on\n               the floor in front of his chair is one of the Precog brothers.\n               A small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of\n               his skull.\n\n               The other Precog sits very still in his chair.  He is still\n               connected to everything -- his helmet is in place, the TVs\n               drip into him.  His eyes are open, and when Witwer moves,\n               the Precog's eyes follow him.\n\n               Witwer can feel them on him.  He turns around.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Is he coming?  No?  Yes?  Maybe?\n                              (beat)\n                         I think yes.\n\n               The Precog looks at him.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         And you think yes.\n\n               Witwer points to the tv screen, running Anderson's murder of\n               Witwer.  Witwer smiles triumphantly.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         Infallibly, immutably yes.\n\n               The Precog looks at him.  Witwer's smile vanishes, and\n               suddenly strides across the room, and claps his hand over\n               the Precog's eyes.  Then he turns, and stares again at the\n               clock.\n\n               EXT. THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB\n\n               Three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the\n               building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons\n               cradled in their arms.\n\n               Behind them is a line of yew bushes.  AS we watch, the officer\n               on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes.\n               Several moments pass, and the same thing happens to the\n               officer on the right.\n\n               The officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right.\n               Then he looks hard.  He grips his weapon tight, and swings\n               left.  No one there, either.\n\n               ANDERSON drops him hard, from behind.  The officer crumples\n               onto the cement.\n\n               But Anderson's not done with him.  Anderson lifts him up,\n               struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance.\n\n               Anderson holds him upright in place.  The man's head lolls\n               backward.  Which is.  Perfect for what Anderson needs to do.\n               Anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes.\n               He pulls up on the eyelids.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       108.\n\n\n               An IdentiScan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's\n               eyes.  Access granted, the doors HISS open.  Anderson enters\n               the building, dragging the officer with him.\n\n               INT. THE LAB\n\n               Anderson enters the lab.  The very building sickens him.\n               What he sees sickens him even more.\n\n               The remaining Precog sits strapped into his chair.  Witwer\n               sits beside him in the other Precog chair, the dead brother\n               at his feet.  Witwer wears the dead Precog's helmet.  His\n               hand is in his lap, holding a gun.\n\n               He grins when Anderson appears.  He takes off the helmet,\n               drops it on the floor.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         I figured, since I can see the future,\n                         too, maybe I could get a little disc\n                         action going.\n                              (beat)\n                         Just kidding.\n\n               Anderson stares at his old partner.  Then he looks up at the\n               digital clock.  Five-seventeen AM.  Witwer looks too, then\n               turns back to Anderson.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         You find you been doing that a lot\n                         this week?  Looking at clocks?\n                              (beat)\n                         Three minutes to go.\n\n               Anderson turns to the tv.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         There's never anything good on, you\n                         know?\n\n               Now Witwer smiles.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         There.  That's the old Paul.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         You're not the old Ed. You've lost\n                         it.\n\n               Witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         You lost it.  You went weak in the\n                         knees, partner.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         I'm not your partner.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       109.\n\n\n               Witwer looks at him sadly.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         The air went out of you when Frank\n                         D'Ignazio killed himself.\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         He was guilty.  I accepted that.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         No you didn't.  The doubts were\n                         creeping in on you.  The lab trying\n                         to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm\n                         pressuring you to expand ...\n\n               Witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining Precog\n               brother's cheek.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         Belief is the basis of the system.\n                         It was your job to be the ultimate\n                         believer.\n\n               Witwer is breathing hard.

The TV REALITY is almost in synch\n               with what is happening in the room.\n\n               Witwer lifts his gun -- and then realizes something is\n               terribly wrong.\n\n               Anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the\n               disc -- except there is a major difference.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         You sonofabitch!\n\n               Anderson lifts up both hands\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         You didn't bring your gun!\n\n                                     ANDERSON\n                         That's right.

A thick, yellow fluid\n               begins to flow toward the Precog's jugular vein.\n\n                                     WITWER (CONT'D)\n                         You're killing him, partner.\n\n               And what choice, finally, does Anderson have?

And stands there between Anderson\n               and the doomed Precog.\n\n               The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precog's jugular.\n\n               Anderson shoots Witwer, once in the heart.  Witwer is thrown\n               back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock.\n\n               Anderson drags himself to the Precog, and rips the yellow IV\n               out of the main line.  The yellow drips onto the floor,\n               mingling with Witwer's red.\n\n               Anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him.  Witwer\n               whispers something, and Anderson leans close to hear him.\n\n                                     WITWER\n                         Now do you believe?\n\n               Anderson pulls away from Witwer, and lets him take his last\n               breaths alone.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       112.\n\n\n               DARKNESS\n\n               And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,\n               beautifully proportioned FACE.\n\n               It is Rose's face.  The camera pulls back and we see that\n               she is lying on a grassy hillside.  Her brother is lying\n               beside her.\n\n               They are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with\n               stars.\n\n               Rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to\n               her brother.\n\n                                     ROSE\n                         James.

And then, after a long moment, so does Rose.\n\n                                                                    THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nMinority Report\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Scott Frank\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:31:17.846958"}
