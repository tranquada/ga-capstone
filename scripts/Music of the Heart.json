She stares at the photo -- \n               it's the two couples dancing. A quick glimpse of hurt on her \n               face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half. \n               There's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young \n               boys' voices.\n\n<b>                                     BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>                         Can you come out now, Mommy?

At one point she even unties \n               a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect. She looks \n               pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy \n               housewife.

She crosses to a small \n               Christmas tree, obviously decorated by her and the boys, and \n               plugs in the tiny blinking lights. It's not exactly \n               Rockefeller Center.

She sits down on the \n               couch, pours herself some eggnog, adds rum, adds more rum, \n               goes back into the kitchen, returns with nutmeg, sprinkles \n               some on top, then drinks. She sighs, glancing miserably at \n               the tree and the T.V. Pathetic. She couldn't look any less \n               festive if she tried.

Nick is a professional \n               cellist in a graduate music program, and Alexi has been \n               accepted to medical school.\n\n               Roberta teaches violin to approximately 150 students a year \n               in three East Harlem elementary schools. The East Harlem \n               Violin Program, however, is still not funded by the New York \n               City Board of Education.\n\n               The money raised from Fiddlefest supported Roberta's violin \n               program for three years. Roberta and Opus 118 continue their \n               fundraising efforts to keep the program alive.\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Music-of-the-Heart.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Music of the Heart</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Pamela Gray\" title=\"Scripts by Pamela Gray\">Pamela Gray</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Music of the Heart Script.html#comments\" title=\"Music of the Heart comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:12:09.948399"}
