GUASPARI BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               The WOMAN -- ROBERTA GUASPARI-DEMETRAS (38) -- retrieves the \n               photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it. \n               She's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but \n               right now she looks like hell. She stares at the photo -- \n               it's the two couples dancing. A quick glimpse of hurt on her \n               face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half. \n               There's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young \n               boys' voices.\n\n                                     BOY'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Can you come out now, Mommy? Please?\n\n               She puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser, \n               then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into \n               pieces.\n\n                                     BOY #2 (O.S.)\n                         Mommy, Nick broke my crayon!\n\n                                     BOY #1 (O.S.)\n                         Well, Lexi hit me and he almost \n                         broke... he almost broke my ear!\n\n               O.S. arguing \"I DID NOT!\" \"YES YOU DID!\" \"LIAR!\" etc. As if \n               that one action siphoned all her energy, Roberta returns to \n               bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond \n               the wall, ignoring the O.S. voices.\n\n                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Hear that?

GUASPARI HOUSE - DOORWAY - DAY\n\n               ASSUNTA GUASPARI (58), Roberta's slender, tired Italian-\n               American mother, stands in the doorway of a well-tended \n               working-class home, addressing a young NAVAL OFFICER who \n               holds a lengthy delivery inventory. It's a gray day with \n               ominous storm clouds. Late 70's CARS are parked on the street.\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         But I have no room for this!\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         I'm sorry, M'am. We have orders to \n                         deliver these.\n\n               Assunta looks beyond the man, dismayed.\n\n               HER POV\n\n               Large wooden CRATES cover her front lawn, and TWO MOVERS \n               plant down another. They hurry back to the TRUCK, grabbing \n               the next crate too quickly this time. It slips from their \n               hands, CRASHES to the ground and splinters open. Several \n               VIOLIN CASES spill out. The crate looks like it holds a whole \n               lot more.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               Instantly a second-story window is flung open, and Roberta \n               sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than \n               we've seen her so far.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Watch it, you idiots! Be careful \n                         with those!\n\n               The men scramble to pick them up. Assunta looks at all the \n               violins, then up at Roberta.\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         Why so many?\n\n               Roberta disappears inside and slams the window shut.\n\n               INT. GUASPARI LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n               The living room is filled with boxes shipped from Greece, \n               labelled by the U.S. NAVY. And on the floor, in the middle \n               of the boxes, are FIFTY VIOLIN CASES of various sizes, also \n               with Greek and U.S. NAVY labels. NICK (7) and LEXI (5) climb \n               over the boxes as if they were giant blocks.\n\n                                     NICK\n                              (calling)\n                         Mommy, which box has our toys?\n\n               INT. GUASPARI HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n               ROBERTA'S on the phone, yelling at someone. She's still in \n               the same ratty nightgown.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Look, I know he's there, so quit \n                         lying to me!... Then check under \n                         Lana Holden -- Mrs. Lana Holden... \n                         Fine. Just tell Lieutenant Demetras \n                         that his wife called and --\n\n               ASSUNTA grabs the phone from her hand and hangs it up.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Ma!\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         No. I want you to listen to me.

You're a beautiful, talented \n                         woman and you have your whole life \n                         ahead of you.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         If I'm so beautiful and talented, \n                         why did Charles leave me?\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         Because Charles is a big jerk.\n                              (beat)\n                         Now get dressed.\n\n               She exits, leaving Roberta to mull over her words.\n\n               INT. GUASPARI KITCHEN - DAY\n\n               Coffee is brewing and homemade cinnamon rolls are cooling on \n               a rack. We recognize the kitchen from the home movie footage. \n               As Assunta clears the boys' breakfast dishes from the table, \n               Roberta enters. She's dressed, but hasn't put on makeup or \n               done much with her hair. It's a start.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         You really think Charles is a jerk?\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         From the day you married him.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Why didn't you say something?\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         Since when do you listen to me?\n\n               Roberta half-smiles, pours herself some coffee, then sits \n               down at the table.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (sighs, then)\n                         What am I gonna do?\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         First, you eat breakfast.

DEPARTMENT STORE - GIFT WRAP COUNTER - ROME, N.Y. - DAY\n\n               Roberta is behind the counter, meticulously wrapping a present \n               with ribbons, bows and stickers. At one point she even unties \n               a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect. She looks \n               pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy \n               housewife. There's only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a \n               long line of impatient customers. A male SUPERVISOR appears \n               behind Roberta.\n\n                                     SUPERVISOR\n                         Just wrap. You're not Picasso.\n\n               He exits, and Roberta quickly tries to finish her task.\n\n                                     MALE VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Picasso would probably put the bows \n                         on the back of the box.\n\n               Roberta looks up to find BRIAN TURNER (40), a handsome, sexy \n               guy with longish hair and a beat-up leather jacket.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Brian Turner?\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Hello, Roberta.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         I thought you moved away.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         I did. I'm in town for my Mom's \n                         birthday.\n\n               He holds out his hand. Roberta misunderstands the gesture \n               and tries to shake his hand.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         No -- that's her gift.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (embarrassed)\n                         Oh!

A sign on her \n               desk indicates that she's the DIRECTOR. Also on the desk is \n               a FRAMED PICTURE of Janet, her husband, daughter (14), and \n               son (12).

All three have violins. INSIDE, Janet's in \n               conversation with DENNIS RAUSCH (38), an uptight man with a \n               tie that doesn't match his suit jacket. He's showing Janet a \n               large scheduling chart.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         I'm sorry to interrupt, but I wanted \n                         you to meet my sons -- Nick, Lexi...\n\n               They enter.\n\n               INT. JANET'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Janet smiles at the boys, but clearly thinks Roberta's a \n               little off. Roberta holds her hand out to Dennis.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Roberta Guaspari-Demetras.\n\n               Dennis shakes her hand, regarding her warily.\n\n                                     JANET\n                         This is Dennis Rausch, our music \n                         teacher and program coordinator.\n                              (beat)\n                         Mrs. Demetras, didn't I make things \n                         clear yesterday?\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         If I could just show you something -- \n                         it'll only take a minute.\n\n               Before Janet can answer, Roberta and the kids quickly take \n               out their violins and get into position. Janet and Dennis \n               exchange a look.\n\n                                     DENNIS\n                         Are we having a talent show?

The three of \n               them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an \n               ETUDE in three-part harmony. For the first measures, Janet's \n               still annoyed by the intrusion, but she's quickly won over. \n               Dennis watches impassively.\n\n               Roberta and the boys finish their piece; Janet applauds and \n               Dennis joins in to be polite.

Naeem's learning to play \n                         music -- and that makes him feel \n                         good about himself.

You \n                         white women come up here and think \n                         you can rescue our poor inner city \n                         children who never asked to be rescued \n                         in the first place. No thank you.\n\n               She walks off with Naeem. He glances back at Roberta, then \n               turns away quickly. Roberta watches after them.\n\n               INT.

There's no answer and she hangs up. She starts to \n               straighten the already clean room, then gets her purse, takes \n               out her wallet, and opens it to the plastic covered pictures.\n\n               INSERT - PICTURES\n\n               Charles in uniform; a studio shot of the boys when they were \n               3 and 1; the whole family posed on the terrace of their home \n               in Greece, a view of the ocean behind them.\n\n               BACK TO ROBERTA\n\n               She's really depressed herself now.\n\n               INT.

Roberta holds out the violin case. Guadalupe \n               lunges forward and hugs her around the waist. Roberta \n               awkwardly accepts the hug, startled and touched by it, and \n               strokes the girl's hair. Guadalupe lets go, takes the violin \n               and exits.

EMPTY APARTMENT - EAST HARLEM - DAY\n\n               Roberta walks around an empty, rundown apartment, her \n               expression somber. Crayon markings on the walls, cigarette \n               burns on the floors, a filthy bathroom and kitchen. An older \n               Puerto Rican woman stands back as Roberta inspects the place. \n               Roberta wipes grease off one of the windows.\n\n                                     LANDLADY\n                         Is just for you and your boys?\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     LANDLADY\n                         No husband?

She sees Naeem and his mother and approaches them.\n\n                                     NAEEM\n                         Hi, Roberta.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Hi, Naeem. Can I talk to your mom \n                         for a minute?\n\n               Naeem nods and moves off.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Look, I didn't come up here to rescue \n                         anybody. I'm a single mother and I \n                         needed a job. And I know you think \n                         you're protecting your son, but you're \n                         not. I mean, what if Arthur Ashe's \n                         mother had stopped him from playing \n                         tennis because it's a \"white man's \n                         game\"?\n                              (beat)\n                         The important thing is that when \n                         Naeem plays music, his whole face \n                         lights up. You should see him.\n\n               Mrs. Adisa takes this in. Roberta exits. Mrs. Adisa looks \n               for Naeem and sees him watching the violin students, longing \n               to be among them. She watches her son with compassion.\n\n               EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY\n\n               Roberta and the boys shop in a colorful outdoor produce market \n               in their neighborhood.\n\n               The boys suddenly rush over to A MAN sitting on the ground \n               with mixed-breed PUPPIES in a cardboard box. The boys pet \n               them excitedly. Roberta watches her sons; they're happier \n               than she's seen them in ages.\n\n               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               A brown puppy is jumping all over Nick and Lexi who laugh \n               delightedly. Roberta is putting down newspapers.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         We all have to take turns cleaning \n                         up, O.K.?\n\n               The boys are oblivious to her -- they're in heaven.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (to herself)\n                         Yeah, right.\n\n               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY\n\n               Roberta's SCREAMING at the kids as they play \"Twinkle Twinkle \n               Little Star.\"\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         First finger on the E! Three -- two -- \n                         one -- open!\n                              (to a white girl with \n                              pigtails)\n                         Wrong string, Becky! We've done this \n                         fourteen times! And look at your \n                         nails! You're supposed to cut them \n                         for violin class! O.K, everybody \n                         stop! It sounds horrible! I can't \n                         believe how bad it sounds!\n\n               They stop playing. Tanisha raises her hand.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Is this an important question, \n                         Tanisha?\n\n               Tanisha nods.\n\n                                     TANISHA\n                         Do you have two of those skirts?\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         What?\n\n                                     TANISHA\n                         You wore a skirt just like it on \n                         Monday.\n\n               Some of the kids crack up.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         You know, Tanisha -- I don't think \n                         that's such an important question.\n                              (to class)\n                         O.K. Let's try --\n\n               The door opens and Naeem enters with Mrs. Adisa. Roberta \n               crosses to them.\n\n                                     MRS. ADISA\n                         Naeem and I were wondering if he \n                         could still be in the class.\n\n               A beat.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         I'd love that.\n                              (to Naeem)\n                         You'll have a lot of catching up to \n                         do. You think you can work that hard?\n\n                                     NAEEM\n                         Yeah, I can.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Maybe we can also arrange some private \n                         lessons at my house.\n\n                                     MRS. ADISA\n                         I wouldn't have the money for that.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         That's O.K.\n                              (to Naeem)\n                         Why don't you go grab one of my spare \n                         violins?\n\n               Naeem happily runs to the extra violins at the front of the \n               room; Mrs. Adisa nods to Roberta with a look of gratitude, \n               then exits. Roberta crosses back to the front of the room.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (to class)\n                         Let's try it again.\n\n               They begin again, and we see Naeem take out a violin and \n               join in. As they play, Roberta's ears perk up at something \n               she's hearing. She crosses to Lucy.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         What are you playing?\n\n                                     LUCY\n                         Twinkle.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (to class)\n                         Everyone stop!\n                              (to Lucy)\n                         Let me hear.\n\n               Lucy hesitates, thinking she's in trouble. She plays a jazz \n               variation of the song. Roberta smiles.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Did someone teach you that?\n\n                                     LUCY\n                         No. I made it up.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         That's really great, Lucy. I'm proud \n                         of you.\n\n               Lucy beams.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (to class)\n                         All of you -- try it.\n\n               The class plays Lucy's jazz variation and Naeem happily joins \n               in.\n\n               INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Roberta sits opposite Janet and MRS. LAMB, a white woman in \n               her 30's.\n\n                                     MRS. LAMB\n                         You're shouting at them. All the \n                         time.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Not all the time. But if they don't \n                         listen --\n\n                                     MRS. LAMB\n                         Didn't you tell them that they were \n                         making their parents sick?\n\n               Janet raises her eyebrows at this.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         That wasn't exactly what I said --\n\n                                     MRS. LAMB\n                         I'm raising Becky in a supportive \n                         atmosphere. I don't send her to school \n                         to be abused.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         I'm just trying to discipline them. \n                         If they're gonna learn an instrument, \n                         they need to take it seriously --\n\n                                     JANET\n                         I think what Mrs. Lamb is trying to \n                         say, Roberta, is that you're a little \n                         too harsh. I'm sure you might be \n                         able to soften some of your comments \n                         to the children?\n\n               She gives Roberta a long hard look. Roberta nods.\n\n               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY\n\n               Roberta listens to the students play \"Go Tell Aunt Rhody\" -- \n               badly. They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Well, that was... that was pretty \n                         good... that wasn't too bad...\n\n               They look at her in disbelief, then look at each other.\n\n                                     DE SEAN\n                         It wasn't? I thought we stunk.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         I wouldn't put it that way... You \n                         all just need to practice a bit more.\n                              (to James)\n                         James, have you practiced this week?\n\n               The boy nervously shakes his head no.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Can you please try a little harder \n                         for next week?\n\n               James nods. The kids are baffled by her politeness.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Good. Just do the best you can.\n\n                                     DE SEAN\n                         Why you acting like that?\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Like what?\n\n                                     DE SEAN\n                         Nice.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Don't you want a nice teacher?\n\n                                     DE SEAN\n                         I already got nice teachers.

We like you better the way you \n                         used to be.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Oh.\n                              (to Becky)\n                         What about you, Becky?\n\n                                     BECKY\n                         Yeah. This is even worse.

You \n                         all stunk.\n\n               The kids laugh.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         But don't tell your parents I said \n                         so!\n\n               The kids laugh again.\n\n               INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DEPARTURE GATE - DAY\n\n               Christmas MUZAK plays in the b.g. as Roberta kisses and hugs \n               Lexi and Nick goodbye. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT stands nearby.\n\n                                     LEXI\n                         Can't you come with us? Please?\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Honey, I told you. This is Daddy's \n                         special time with you.\n\n               Lexi looks upset; Nick is stoic. Roberta hugs them one last \n               time. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT steps forward.\n\n                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n                         I'll take good care of them.\n\n               The FLIGHT ATTENDANT escorts them into the jet way. Roberta \n               holds back tears as they get further away from her. At the \n               last moment, Lexi turns and waves; Nick does not. Roberta \n               waves, tears starting to fall, and the boys disappear from \n               sight. She observes all the families travelling together, \n               and feels like the loneliest person in the airport.\n\n               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Roberta enters her apartment, back from the airport, and \n               double-locks the door behind her. You can see on her face \n               that she's dreading the emptiness. She crosses to a small \n               Christmas tree, obviously decorated by her and the boys, and \n               plugs in the tiny blinking lights. It's not exactly \n               Rockefeller Center. She turns on the T.V., playing IT'S A \n               WONDERFUL LIFE.\n\n               She crosses to the kitchen, then returns with a carton of \n               eggnog, a glass, and a bottle of rum. She sits down on the \n               couch, pours herself some eggnog, adds rum, adds more rum, \n               goes back into the kitchen, returns with nutmeg, sprinkles \n               some on top, then drinks. She sighs, glancing miserably at \n               the tree and the T.V. Pathetic. She couldn't look any less \n               festive if she tried. There's a KNOCK on the DOOR.\n\n               Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Who is it?\n\n                                     BRIAN (O.S.)\n                         Santa Claus.\n\n               She looks through the peephole, then quickly unlocks the \n               door and opens it, revealing BRIAN, giving her a big smile.\n\n               He looks sexy as hell (even with a silly lit-up Santa Claus \n               pin on his leather jacket), and he holds a long-stemmed red \n               rose in one hand, and a Christmas present in the other.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         I'm back.\n\n               Roberta's thrilled and relieved to see him. She embraces \n               him, and they kiss passionately.\n\n               INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (TIME CUT - TWO MONTHS LATER)\n\n               CLOSE ON plaster walls being knocked down with sledgehammers. \n               REVEAL Brian, Roberta, and a couple of workmen knocking down \n               the walls in an old brownstone.\n\n               EXT. BROWNSTONE - EAST HARLEM - THE SAME DAY\n\n               A mild winter day. Roberta, covered with plaster dust and \n               overheated from working, leans against a car and drinks a \n               beer. The three-story brick building has some graffiti on it \n               and is badly in need of a paint job; there are a few broken \n               windows, and the front stairs need repairing. WORKMEN file \n               in and out. We can see from the STREET SIGNS that we're on \n               118th STREET, a few houses off FIRST AVENUE.\n\n               Brian (also dust-covered), Nick and Lexi toss around a \n               football. LAWRENCE (6), a Black boy who lives next door, \n               joins them. Brian crosses to Roberta, sweaty and out of \n               breath. He takes a swig of her beer.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         O.K., enough goofing off -- back to \n                         work.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         You trying to kill me?\n\n               She laughs and they kiss.\n\n               ASSUNTA comes up the street with a bag of take-out food. She \n               casts a dubious glance at the lovers.\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         I was the only person in the whole \n                         coffee shop not speaking Spanish.\n\n               Roberta rolls her eyes. O.S. a car BACKFIRES.\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         You hear that? Gunshots!

I \n                         want to live here.\n\n               The boys approach and Assunta hands them sandwiches. Lawrence \n               hangs back. Assunta calls to him.\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         What's your name?\n\n                                     LAWRENCE\n                         Lawrence.\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         You hungry, Lawrence?\n\n               Lawrence nods and she hands him a sandwich. Roberta smiles \n               at her mother's gesture. The kids move off to Lawrence's \n               front steps and Assunta gives Roberta and Brian sandwiches.\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                              (to Brian)\n                         Why did you let her buy this house?\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Hey, your daughter does what she \n                         wants -- or haven't you noticed?\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         I've noticed.\n\n               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY\n\n               Robert washes dishes and Assunta dries. The leftovers from \n               an Italian dinner are on the counter.\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         I still don't understand the rush.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Having my own place will make me \n                         feel like I'm really starting my \n                         life again.\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         But if you invested your divorce \n                         settlement, you could buy something \n                         nice someday. It's bad enough that \n                         you've been renting in this \n                         neighborhood, but to lock yourself \n                         into a mortgage --\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (snapping)\n                         Mama, please.

Don't make the \n                         same mistake twice, Bert. You barely \n                         knew Charles when you married him.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (defensive)\n                         I don't get it -- you're ragging on \n                         me about buying the house -- I would \n                         think you'd want Brian to live with \n                         me.\n\n                                     ASSUNTA\n                         Not if he's the wrong person.\n\n               Roberta locks her jaw, not wanting to believe that she's \n               right.\n\n               INT.

As a matter of fact, I think \n                         I'll go grab a cup of coffee.\n\n               She starts for the door and the kids moan and groan: \"Come \n               on, Roberta!\" \"Roberta, get back here!\" She smiles.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Well, O.K.

De Sean looks around, \n               embarrassed, then raises his too. Roberta smiles.\n\n               INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Brian and Roberta finish making love on the futon.

BROWNSTONE - DAY\n\n               Ernie's radio plays a BLUES SONG. The BRICK WORKERS radio \n               plays SPANISH MUSIC, and the PAINTERS' radio plays a RAP \n               SONG. Roberta stands in the middle, about to lose her mind.\n\n               HER POV - Ernie sits on a stool facing his wiring. He's fast \n               asleep.

SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n\n               ROBERTA\n\n               Stands in the aisle, leading the students and playing violin.\n\n               ON STAGE\n\n               The fifty fifth-grade students play the \"Twinkle\" variations. \n               Their playing is impeccable and they look terrific.\n\n               As the CAMERA PANS the audience, we recognize: MRS. ADISA, \n               tears in her eyes as she watches Naeem; MRS. LAMB and her \n               husband, watching Becky in amazement; ISABEL and her daughter \n               sitting with ASSUNTA, NICK and LEXI; JANET, impressed as \n               hell; and DENNIS, seething with jealousy. As the kids start \n               the jazz variation of \"Twinkle,\" a WOMAN elbows her husband:\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         That's the one Lucy wrote!\n\n               The CAMERA returns to the children and captures their own \n               pride in their playing, including LUCY, who smiles as she \n               hears her song played by fifty.\n\n               THE CONCERT - TIME DISSOLVE\n\n               The students are now playing \"Allegro,\" and they reach the \n               fermata. They hold their positions in silence and the audience \n               watches in anticipation. Roberta cues them and they play the \n               next note in perfect unison. An involuntary smile lights on \n               DE SEAN's face. They finish the song, the audience applauds, \n               and Roberta turns to face them.\n\n               She lights up when she sees how thrilled Janet looks, and \n               Janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds Roberta.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.

It reads \n               ONLY THE STRONG SHALL SURVIVE.\n\n               INT. CLASSROOM - DAY\n\n               Roberta stands in front of a classroom of twenty cute first-\n               graders -- mostly Black and Latino, a few white -- sitting \n               on the floor, chatting excitedly. Even though Roberta's ten \n               years older, she seems more youthful; her wavy hair is loose \n               over her shoulders, her clothing's casual and artistic. Beside \n               her is Janet, her hair flecked with gray, and Dennis, who \n               looks pretty much the same. The classroom teacher is ISABEL, \n               a little older, a little tougher.\n\n                                     ISABEL\n                         C'mon everybody, settle down -- Janet \n                         wants to talk to you.\n\n                                     JANET\n                         Today's a very special day because \n                         we're starting the tenth year of the \n                         East Harlem Violin Program.

The \n                         violin makes him want to be good at \n                         everything.\n\n               He shows no response, and she exits.

Roberta nears the front door and finds Isabel and \n               some teachers huddled in conversation. A few students are \n               crying.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (to Isabel)\n                         What happened?\n\n               INT.

She takes \n               note of what Ramon is doing, and overhears Toussaint and \n               Shandra in mid-conversation.\n\n                                     TOUSSAINT\n                         My grandpa died and my uncle, so \n                         that makes six.\n\n                                     SHANDRA\n                         I know more than that. At least seven \n                         people... maybe even nine.\n\n               Roberta gently tells Ramon to sit, and then she sits down on \n               a child-sized chair in front of them.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (quietly)\n                         I know that you've all heard the bad \n                         news about Justin.\n\n                                     MYESHA\n                         I didn't hear.\n\n                                     TOUSSAINT\n                         There was a drive-by shooting by his \n                         house and he got shot on accident \n                         and he died.\n\n               Myesha takes this in, looking sad.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Does anyone want to talk about it?\n\n                                     RAMON\n                              (angry)\n                         I think we should just play violin.\n\n               Roberta watches him.\n\n               INT.

An awkward beat: \n               will he or won't he? Dan leans in to kiss her, and Roberta \n               turns away, uncertain.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Look, Dan -- I went along with this \n                         'cause it's been a while.

ROBERTA proudly \n               leads the children. At the side of the stage, we see DOROTHEA \n               photographing the concert. THE CAMERA PANS THE AUDIENCE of \n               teary-eyed parents, many of them with CAM CORDERS. We FIND \n               Ramon's family. Manuelo is riverted by his son's playing, \n               and he starts to cry. Concepcion knows this without looking. \n               She takes his hand.\n\n               ANGLE - JANET stands along the side and her eyes start to \n               fill with tears. She tries to stay composed, then discreetly \n               exits the auditorium.\n\n               The song ends and the audience APPLAUDS, rising from their \n               seats, including ASSUNTA (now 65), next to ISABEL and DAN. \n               Someone remains seated: a REPORTER (40's), sitting beside \n               Dan and taking notes.\n\n               The STUDENTS bow, then point to Roberta who bows and takes \n               the stage. She gestures for people to sit. A beginner student \n               brings her flowers. Roberta kisses her, then approaches the \n               mike.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (to the audience)\n                         The beautiful concert that you just \n                         heard could be the last concert of \n                         the East Harlem Violin Program. The \n                         Board of Education and the District \n                         Superintendent don't think that music \n                         is important for our children. But \n                         they're wrong -- and they're in for \n                         a fight.\n\n               The parents stand and applaud. We see the REPORTER writing \n               quickly. Dorothea snaps more pictures. Roberta extends an \n               arm towards the kids, directing the applause at them.

She opens it, revealing JANET, \n               who's carrying two bags of groceries. Assunta's demeanor \n               instantly cools when she sees her. In the b.g.

And you \n                         can't just write a check -- you have \n                         to get involved.\n\n                                     ARNOLD\n                         Involved how?\n\n               The look on her face tells him it's more than he bargained \n               for.\n\n                                     ARNOLD\n                         Uh-oh.\n\n               INT. SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY\n\n               1. Arnold Steinhardt speaks on the phone. His Roladex is \n               open to the name ITZHAK PERLMAN. In the b.g., Dorothea tensely \n               waits to hear if Itzhak Perlman will say yes.\n\n               2. Parents, Roberta, Nick and Lexi hang \"FIDDLEFEST CONCERT\" \n               posters around their neighborhood, announcing a concert at \n               THE 92ND STREET Y with ARNOLD STEINHARDT, ITZHAK PERLMAN and \n               STUDENTS FROM THE EAST HARLEM VIOLIN PROGRAM.\n\n               3. Parents -- including Beverly Wilson, Concepcion, Mr. Adams \n               and Carlos' mom and dad -- stuff envelopes with INVITATIONS \n               to \"FIDDLEFEST\" and accompanying LETTERS and TICKET ORDER \n               FORMS. Roberta and Dorothea open envelopes with filled-out \n               TICKET ORDER FORMS and CHECKS. They stack the checks in a \n               pile, address return envelopes and place FIDDLEFEST TICKETS \n               inside them.\n\n               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY\n\n               Thirty-three excited kids from Roberta's different classes \n               chat, tune their violins, rosin their bows. The students \n               include Carlos, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Rachel, Simon, \n               Ramon, Vanessa, and Shandra. Roberta enters the room, full \n               of energy, and addresses them as she heads to the front.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Listen up, everyone! Quiet down!\n\n               The students give her their attention.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         You are my very best beginner and \n                         advanced violin students and I've \n                         chosen you to play in Fiddlefest \n                         because I trust that you can handle \n                         the pressure. It's gonna be a lot of \n                         work -- a lot. Right now, we've sold \n                         some tickets, but I'm not gonna be \n                         back here in the fall if the audience \n                         storms out of their seats, demanding \n                         a refund!\n\n               She nods to Rachel who starts handing out sheets of music.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Rachel's gonna be my lieutenant and \n                         I expect you to listen to her.\n\n               Ramon looks through his music sheets.\n\n                                     RAMON\n                         Bach's \"Minuet One\"?\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         People are gonna be paying good money \n                         for this concert -- we're not just \n                         gonna play \"Twinkle.\"\n                              (handing out papers)\n                         I'm passing out a contract that you \n                         and your parents need to sign.\n\n               The kids read the contracts. Carlos' eyes widen.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Every Saturday and Sunday?\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Plus night time rehearsals during \n                         the week. There's only six weeks \n                         till the concert, so classes in school \n                         won't be enough.\n\n               The kids look sobered by this.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Come to think of it, we'll probably \n                         also need to meet before school.\n\n               Lots of grumbling: \"Say what?\" \"No way!\" \"Before school?\" \n               I'ma be sleepwalking!\"\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         You've heard of Navy Seal Training? \n                         Well, this is gonna be Roberta String \n                         Training.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE - Two young men and two young women walk in, \n               carrying violins. We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM \n               (20), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall. \n               With him is DE SEAN (19), a short guy with dreadlocks, looking \n               more like a rapper than a violinist. GUADALUPE (19), walking \n               with a cane, is now a beautiful young woman, her long braid \n               pinned up. The fourth is a reserved Puerto Rican woman (20).\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Oh my god! Naeem! De Sean!\n                              (hugs them)\n                         Guadalupe!\n\n               She hugs her, then looks closely at the other woman.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Lucy? Is that you?\n\n               The woman snaps her fingers and smiles. Roberta laughs and \n               embraces her, then turns to the students.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Kids, these are four of my very first \n                         violin students and I've asked them \n                         to play in the concert with us.\n                              (to the alumni)\n                         I was just telling them how hard \n                         they're gonna have to work.\n\n                                     DE SEAN\n                              (to class)\n                         Take it from me -- this lady don't \n                         lie. Y'all are gonna work your butts \n                         off.\n\n               INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Ramon's father carefully reads the violin contract while \n               Ramon and Concepcion anxiously watch. He stops to look up a \n               word in the English-Spanish dictionary beside him. Ramon and \n               his mom are squirming. Manuelo nods as he finishes reading, \n               then SIGNS the contract. Ramon breaks into a smile, throws \n               his little arms around his Papa and kisses him.\n\n               EXT. RIVER EAST - DAY\n\n               School's letting out; Carlos' sister exits, carrying Carlos' \n               violin. A few beats later, Carlos quickly exits, checking \n               his watch. He sees his LOS LEONES teammates standing in a \n               group, and tries to bypass them without being noticed, but \n               they spot him.\n\n                                     TEAMMATE #1\n                         Hey Carlos! Where ya goin'? We got a \n                         game, remember?\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Yeah, I know, but... I can't make \n                         it.\n\n                                     TEAMMATE #1\n                         What you talkin' about?\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         I just can't make it.\n\n                                     TEAMMATE #2\n                         You got a date with the violin \n                         teacher?\n\n               A beat.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Yeah. I do.\n\n               He dashes off, a barrage of Spanish and English curses behind \n               him, and crosses to his sister, waiting for him DOWN THE \n               STREET. He takes the violin from her and carries it himself.\n\n               INT. CPE MUSIC ROOM - DAY\n\n               The Fiddlefest kids, including Carlos, Vanessa, Shandra, \n               Ramon, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Simon, Thomas, De Sean and \n               Guadalupe practice Bach's \"Minuet One,\" Roberta leading them \n               and giving direction. They're playing badly.\n\n               Rachel plays as well, but walks around the room making \n               corrections. It's early morning, and the kids look half-\n               asleep.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Frog! Frog! I need more accents on \n                         the down beat! More bow! More!\n\n               They play a few more bars and still sound pretty bad.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Stop! Stop!\n                              (they do so)\n                         You sound horrible! Isn't anyone \n                         practicing?\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         How can we practice? We're rehearsing \n                         all the time.\n\n               Some kids laugh, including Stephanie.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                              (to Stephanie)\n                         You think this is funny, Stephanie?\n                              (to all of them)\n                         You think the four hundred people \n                         who've bought tickets so far will \n                         think it's funny too? You think Itzhak \n                         Perlman will think it's funny that \n                         he's donating his time and you're \n                         all gonna stink?\n\n               Vanessa yawns and Roberta sees her. Uh-oh.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Am I boring you, Vanessa?\n\n                                     VANESSA\n                         No. It's 7:30 in the morning. I'm \n                         just tired.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         There's no time to be tired.\n                              (to all, getting her \n                              violin in position)\n                         Let's try it again.\n\n               INT. ARNOLD AND DOROTHEA'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Dorothea opens the door for Roberta who just charges in, \n               agitated, without even saying hello. We sense that Dorothea \n               too, is troubled by something.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         I must have been crazy to agree to \n                         this. They're never gonna be ready. \n                         And you should hear the Bach Double! \n                         A disaster. So the good news is \n                         tickets are selling like hot cakes, \n                         but the bad news is that the kids \n                         sound like shit.\n\n                                     DOROTHEA\n                         There's more bad news...

The concert hall was damaged \n                         and they've cancelled all events.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Until when?\n\n                                     DOROTHEA\n                         \"Until further notice.\"\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         This can't happen!

ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT\n\n               The Fiddlefest kids are crammed into Roberta's house, \n               (including De Sean, Guadalupe, Ramon, Vanessa, Shandra, \n               Carlos, Thomas, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, and Simon), \n               rehearsing \"Orange Blossom Special.\" They play badly.

She's holding her violin case. She looks \n               at the UPPER BALCONIES -- THE LOWER BALCONIES -- THE ORCHESTRA \n               SEATS.

She can't believe her eyes. A beat, and she looks \n               around to make sure she's alone. She takes out her violin, \n               takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her \"audience,\" \n               then starts to play the second violin part of the Bach Double \n               Concerto.

They \n               smile at each other, but Roberta's clearly a bit shaken to \n               see him. They're not quite sure how to greet each other -- \n               he takes her hand, and then kisses her on the cheek.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Congratulations.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         Thank you...\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         I knew you'd get here sooner or later. \n                         I'm glad I'm here to see it.\n\n               A beat.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         I am too.\n\n               INT.

When a \n                         program like this is cut, our \n                         children's future is compromised. I \n                         want to thank you for your support. \n                         Enjoy the concert.\n\n               INT.

Roberta walks out to APPLAUSE. She \n               bows to the audience, turns to the kids, signals them with a \n               slight nod and the BACH MINUET ONE begins.
