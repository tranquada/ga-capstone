A pistol next\n     to each.\n\n     REVEAL the dealers. Two young Dominicans seated across\n     from the TV, getting high, drinking beer and laughing out\n     loud at the Spanish language version of Time Traxx.\n     Then --\n     BANG!

A LATINA\n     girl screams. Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a\n     hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered,\n     Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw\n     and knocks him through the bathroom door. Lowrey cuffs\n     him to the sink. Meanwhile... Back to:\n\n8    LIVING ROOM                                                  8\n     Burnett's in trouble. He's still got his gun in hand.\n     But the other dealer has him pinned underneath the legs\n     of a chair.\n                              BURNETT\n                Lowrey!\n     Burnett stomps the bad guy's instep.

From a prone position, Fouchet puts on his night\n     vision goggles and reveals a palm top computer. Quickly\n     he scrolls through the labyrinthine schematics loaded\n     onto the unit. TILT DOWN to see the various ducts.\n     Endless. Bottomless. But clearly, Fouchet's a man who\n     knows his way.\n\n14   INT.

Another air conditioning vent grate crashes to\n     the floor. Their headlights blazing, two men clamber\n     into the cavernous room, Fouchet along with Casper. This\n     is the special Drug Holding Room: The lock cuts like\n     butter and the steel door is yanked open. One hundred\n     million dollars in heroin.

And now she sees Casper's shadow as he\n     approaches.\n\n     CLOSE ON DOORKNOB\n     As it turns. Julie suddenly reaches for it and pulls\n     open the door with a surge.
