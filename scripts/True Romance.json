But, you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">In \"Jailhouse Rock\" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is \nrockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck \nabout anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and \nleaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it \nbig he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, \nand he's singing, \"Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care\". Now, they \ngot him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this \nhorrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him \nwearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the \nparty, big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' \nmotherfucker. I'd watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis \nlooked good. I'm no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' \nprettier than most women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I \nmean had too 'cause my life depended on it...

DINGY HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots and violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained black.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the suitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. \"Bewitched\" is playing.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and FLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic bags and a weigher.

It's so funny, oh it's so funny.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(he takes a hit off of a joint)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their \npussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with \nwhite boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">- Because it's good!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FLOYD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And \nbecause you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up \nfor every nigger in the world everywhere.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BIG D\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Drexl. On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to \nexpress our gratitude -\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl and Big D bust up.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FLOYD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got \npussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to \ndo a bunch of fucked-up shit.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BIG D\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So you do eat pussy!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FLOYD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Naw naw!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BIG D\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You don't like it, but you eat that shit.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Drexl)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He eats it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Damn skippy.

Now what would you do.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FLOYD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'd say fuck it!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd sitting all alone.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching \"Bewitched\".\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FLOYD\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(yelling after them)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ain't no man have to eat pussy!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BIG D\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(not even looking)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Take that shit somewhere else.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(marching back)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FLOYD\n</p><p id=\"dia\">If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, \nkiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, \nnigger, you'd aim to please.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">BIG D\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(glued on TV)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm hip.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, \ntoss me that shotgun.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Without turning away from \"Bewitched\" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to Drexl.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Floyd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">All right, check this out.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(referring to shotgun)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back.

CLIFF'S MOVING CAR - MORNING\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Cliff  Worley is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently to the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In between singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a security guard uniform.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. TRAILER PARK - MORNING\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Cliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning.

However, that's where the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit magnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh yeah, we got married.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(referring to the magnets)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You still have these.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Alabama)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one. \nI never shit it out, so I guess it's still there.

It's hard to tell you what to get \n'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get \nthat, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he \nhas. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if \nyou did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death.

Take a \nseat, Pop, we gotta talk -\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how \nmuch like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and \nthrough. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a \nsudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn \nbulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. \nNow, when did you get married?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">BLACK TITLE CARD: \"HOLLYWOOD\"\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

Am I correct?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question \nyou've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, \nat the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Want a Chesterfield?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(as he lights up)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this \nmust be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his \nbrought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road \nwith 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a \nchoice.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with his fist.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got \nthat pain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It \nain't any kind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's \never gonna get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your \nneighbors. They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, \nparked in front of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your \nson?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Cliff's defeated.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I've seen him.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance \nyou're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore \nyour boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't \njust mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. \nWell, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do \nsome business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room \nblastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What are you talkin' about?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it \noutta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he \nis, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the \ncommode filled in all the blanks.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't believe you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that \nI believe you. Where did they go?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">On their honeymoon.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they \ngo?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">They didn't tell me.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Coccotti looks at him.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Now, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years. \nYesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me \nhe needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could borrow \nfive hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a check. We \nwent to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me God. They \nnever thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never thought to ask.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil, quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal on the wound. Cliff screams.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in the car.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm in agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my \nold man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from \ngrowin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen \ndifferent things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has \nseventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen. And \nif you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to \nhell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna \nshow me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know \nwhere they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away \nfrom.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart. He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sure.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Got a match?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, don't bother. I got one.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(he lights the cigarette)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So you're a Sicilian, huh?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(intensly)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Uh-huh.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I \nfind that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, \nSicilians were spawned by niggers.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what he's hearing.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Come again?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLIFF\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If \nyou don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years \nago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, \nSicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, \nonce the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so \nmuch fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, \nfrom blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it \nabsolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, \nSicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a \nfact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, \ngreat, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. \nThat is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic, grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets through Cliff's head.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon, and turns to his men.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">COCCOTTI\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity \nin fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands!

When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic banana magnet that says: \"Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and address)\".\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">LENNY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Boss, get ready to get happy.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">TITLE CARD: \"CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A.\"\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus \nappears, and the bus-driver says, \"Get her in here.\". He forgot all about \nhis route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such \na nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. \nWell, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if \nI'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo.

What's the story \nbehind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a \ntheater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ask me them again. One by one.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What do you do?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't remember.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Where are you from.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's your favorite color?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's your favorite movie star?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Burt Reynolds.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Would you like a bite of my pie?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes, I would.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Like it?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Very much. Now, where were we?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What kinda music do you like?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like \"He's a Rebel\".\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What are your turn-ons?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like \nElvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Turn-offs?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only \nthing that comes to mind are Persians.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Do you have a fella?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She looks at Clarence and smiles.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town \nalone?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a \nform of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or \nwhere I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even \nknow my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a \nTallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they \ntold me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on \nme, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For \nsome reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told \nhim to stop and I got out.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure \ncouldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until it makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Aren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy?\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(eats her last piece of pie)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Where to next?\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">It's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a comic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-cool.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wow. What a swell place to work.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, \nplay music.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">How long have you worked here?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Almost four years.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's a long time.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what \nI'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of \nthe customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Do you get paid a lot?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow \nsome money if you need it. Wanna see what \"Spiderman\" number one looks \nlike?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You bet. How much is that worth?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence gets a box off the shelf.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Four hundred bucks.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" Lunch \nboxes. \"Green Hornet\" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main \nbusiness. There's a lot of collectors around here.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's that?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's a \"Rookies\" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. \nThey're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors \nin \"The Black Hole\"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid \nplayin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He pulls a plastic-cased \"Spiderman\" comic form the box.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">\"Spiderman\", number one. The one that started it all.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">God, Spiderman looks different.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. \nGene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, \njust disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. \nHold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He pulls out another comic.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">\"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\". One of the coolest series known to \nman. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about four \nbucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(he opens one up)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Just look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look \nat this one.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We see the \"Sgt. Fury\" panels.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Nick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on \na chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on \na ship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain \nand the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. \nIsn't that cool?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Alabama, I'd like you to have this.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence hands her the \"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\" comic book that he loves so much.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis, anything you can imagine. The two walk through the door.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What a cool room!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Later. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album. Clarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you \nthen?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Five.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She turns the page.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">LATER - LIVING ROOM\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's \"Piece of My Heart\".\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know when you sat behind me?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">At the movies?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, \nshe doesn't want me bothering her.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What would make you think that?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You're not stupid. Just wrong.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the song.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I love Janis.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">She OD'd, didn't she?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take \ntoo much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what \nshe took.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You mean she got a bad batch?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the \nhappiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't \ntrust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her \nto marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she \ncouldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her \nmoney. So, she said no. And the guy says, \"Look, I really love you, and I \nwanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter \nwhat happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it.\" So she \ndid, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told \nher a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">So he really loved her?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Uh-huh.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They kiss.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">It's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks around, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a robe and investigates.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair crying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You didn't do nothing.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Did you hurt yourself?\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(he takes her foot)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the \ntheater. I was paid to be there.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make \nsure they're not rippin' the place off.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Pause.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You're a whore?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that \ncomic book place.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">\"Heroes For Sale\"?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into \nyou, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I \nwas gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. \nThat I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich \nmillionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That dazzling imagination.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's over on the TV. All it says is: \"Dear Clarence.\" I couldn't write \nanymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not \nto ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had \nthat much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, \"Alabama, come clean, Let \nhim know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back \nto Drexl and fuck yourself.\"\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who and what is a Drexl?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">My pimp.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You have a pimp?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Uh-huh.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">A real live pimp?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Uh-huh.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is he black?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Is he nice?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty \ndecent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough \nwith Arlene the other day.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What did he do to Arlene?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty \nscary.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">This motherfucker sounds charming!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence is on his feet, furious.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer \nbefore he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck \ndid you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an \nagency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They \nhave a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total \nwhite-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least \nfive hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry \nbeepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in \"Dressed to Kill\". And when I was \nready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says \nhe makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's \ngonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or \nwind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the \nropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till \nlast night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. \nSince it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I \nwant a second date.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. \nBama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together \nall throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you \nwanna marry me?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Will you be my wife?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Yes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(a little surprised)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You will?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You better not be fucking teasing me.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They seal it with a kiss.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">LATER - THAT NIGHT\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CLOSEUP - Alabama's wedding ring.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV.

You stomp them bitches to death to get \nthe kind of pussy I'm talkin' about.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-out boxes of Chinese food.

Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've \nalready given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly \nwhere your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some \ndinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to \nmyself, \"This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the \nworld. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, \nhe don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, \nwatch my TV.\" See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you \nbeen in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't \neven bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, \nbut I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' 'cause I'm not \nstayin'. I'm not lookin' at the movie 'cause I saw it seven years ago. It's \n\"The Mack\" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by \nBobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama Releasing \nCompany in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In that \nenvelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener \npastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter.  I don't like to \ndicker. I never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's \nin that envelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that \nmuch. Not one penny more, not one penny more.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">You could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full alert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl. Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's empty.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, \"That's right, asshole.\"\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Silence.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we got \nhere? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be? Mr. \nMajestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't got \nno hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand -\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at Clarence, catching him of guard.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold. \n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus. We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ya wanna fuck with me?\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(hits Clarence)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Ya wanna fuck with me?\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(hits Clarence)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs his nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and starts twisting.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of his head.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's thumb.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and busting his nose.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets up on his knees.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of LPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Marty)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Clarence)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in \nmy goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, \nin my house, in front of my employees. Shit!

Hey, Marty.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(laughing)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">He must of thought it was white boy day.

Next time you bogart your way into a \nnigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(hurting)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Wannabee nigger...\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Fuck you! My mother was Apache.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost \nlike a nigger name.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Clarence)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, dummy.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Before you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I \njust chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're some \nmacho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you are, \nClarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th  street, apartment \n48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same address. \nMarty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Marty)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'll keep lover boy here entertained.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Clarence)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her \nsuck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. \nShe's done it before. But I want you as a audience.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(hollering to Marty)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTY\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(off)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm tryin' to find my jacket.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DREXL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there \nlately.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's standing over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger and blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARTY\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(off)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's happening?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Marty steps into the room.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Two of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other Hooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to be terrified.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Drexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his balls and his dick.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Get a bag and put Alabama's thing in it!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She doesn't move.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the bed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like a pillbug.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CLOSEUP - Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to Drexl)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Open you eyes, laughing boy.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He doesn't.

Clarence takes off the corkscrew and opens the wine.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a little one for himself.

And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know \nthose guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot \nto piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a \nlittle bit at a time -\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No way!

How difficult can that be?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DICK\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. \nFat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two \nhundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more \nimportant, they don't know you.

Fuck, \nClarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean \nshit.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a \nfuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he \ndeserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a \nmerit badge or somethin'.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Dick rests his head in his hands.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Look, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need \nyou to rise to the occasion.

HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste of the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil standing there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again to the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hurts, don't it? It better. Took me a long time to kick like that. I'm \nthird-degree blackbelt, you know? At home I got trophies. Tournaments I was  \nin. Kicked all kinds of ass. I got great technique. You ain't hurt that  \nbad.

And when he's comin' back?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to die, because this man is going to kill her.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Go take a flying fuck and a rolling donut.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach. The air is sucked out of her lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours gasping for air that's just not there.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one up with a Zippo lighter. He takes a long, deep drag.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Whatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get used to it.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

Virgil steps in front of her.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you? Dream  \non, cunt. You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool. And your pretty face is gonna  \nturn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my fuckin' coke?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her head slams into the left side of the wall.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Where's Clarence?!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Nothing. He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side. Her legs start to give way. He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her lightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">When's Clarence getting back?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the middle finger.

It's a pretty decent one.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Have you read the story on Elvis?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CUSTOMER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No. Not yet.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But,  \nI look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old  \nshit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was  \never wrong.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CUSTOMER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">That good, huh?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the Elvis article.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It  \ncovers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the  \npeople who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce  \nSpringsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but  \nthey give me the creeps.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CUSTOMER\n</p><p id=\"dia\"> I can see what you mean.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every  \nbranch on the way down.

HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's crawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the cocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\"> Now the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're  \nthe Boston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles  \nWhitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you  \ngreen money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was  \nthe bitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to hoe. Now,  \nthe second one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to  \nhoe. You still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around.  \nThen you completely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's  \ngotten to the point now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the bed, and the black suitcase is right there.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the black case and almost goes snow blind.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Well, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great.  \nOne less thing I gotta worry about.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth -\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands. Mr. Karate-man smiles.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Kid, you got a lotta heart.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He moves toward her.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama's hands are shaking.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a free swing. Now, I only do  \nthat for people I like.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He moves close.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open. Buttons fly everywhere.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Go ahead, girl, take a stab at it.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(giggling)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You don't have anything to lose.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CLOSEUP - Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose. Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many women all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into \"I'll take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do\" seething hatred.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CLOSEUP - VIRGIL'S FACE\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Talk about bloodcurling yells.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running down his face.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster, so it doesn't kill him.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">OK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the nose, breaking it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to it, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back, sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama. Alabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not one of them has ever laughed before he did it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">What's so fuckin' funny?!!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(laughing)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You look so ridiculous.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Laugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you  \nlaughing now?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his eyes.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh Jesus!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VIRGIL\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Oh Mary, help me!\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a Tasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming toward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into the toilet.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the toilet tank.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net hairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground. He crawls toward it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45 automatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama snatches the shotgun.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second hits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been functioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nand where there is sadness, joy.\nO Divine Master, grant that I may not\nso much seek to be consoled as to console;\nto be understood as to understand;\nto be loved as to love;\nfor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born\nto eternal life.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn, only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Honey?\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She continues. He puts his gun away.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CLARENCE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Sweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute,\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She lies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his shoulder.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"right\">CUT TO:\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT.

You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because  \nI don't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with  \nprofessionals. I'm not a professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take  \nthat, and I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and  \nmake a helluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become  \na drug dealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting  \nbusted all of the time. Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta  \nme, and you're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking  \nmovie-maker. I like you, and I'm still scared. I'm a punk kid who picked up  \na rock in the street, only to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a  \nmillion dollars, but I can't get the million dollars for it. But, you can.  \nSo, I'll sell it to you for a couple a hundred thousand. You go to make a  \nmillion. It's all found money to me anyway.

She steps into the elevator, the doors close.\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">LOBBY\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Alabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out. In the background, cops are all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">LENNY\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready  \nto take me to Kilimanjaro and... and a million bucks!\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(pause)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Small bills!\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT.

She's muttering to herself.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ALABAMA\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked \naway. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred \npercent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling \nbad. I should laugh 'cause you don't deserve any better. I could get \nanother guy like that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. \nAsshole. You're a asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted \nit all, didn't ya? Didn't ya?

Donut.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The song \"Little Arrows\" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks down and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues. She wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on the dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view mirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens on the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads it: \"You're so cool\".\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She looks around for, and finally finds, the \"Sgt. Fury\" comic book Clarence bought her.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">And with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away from the Mustang forever.\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">FADE OUT\n\n\n\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenplay by Quentin Tarantino\n\nProduced by Samuel Hadida\nSteve Perry\nBill Unger\n\nDirected by Tony Scott\n\nCast List:\n\nChristian Slater Clarence Worley\nPatricia Arquette Alabama Whitman\nDennis Hopper Clifford Worley\nMichael Rapaport Dick Ritchie\nBronson Pinchott Elliot Blitzer\nChristopher Walken Vincenzo Coccotti\nSaul Rubinek Lee Donowitz\nSamuel L.
