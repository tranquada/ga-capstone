Yet there is also a deeper pathos \n               to the scene.\n\n               And the NUN is spectacularly beautiful.

It gave \n                         nothing at all and left nothing \n                         behind. No trace of my act, yes my \n                         act.

Something divine. His \n               silent reactions embody both decadence and awe.
