He leaps on Fisher with a \n               wild cry.\n\n                                     BOYD\n                         I want that money!\n\n               Boyd and fisher fight like animals; choking, pounding, \n               mauling, a fight to the death. Fisher is losing, Boyd is \n               choking the life out of him, killing him. Fisher is going \n               down, eyes rolling back, he's dying, until...\n\n               CRASH. Boyd's head is caved in from behind. REVEAL Liz \n               wielding a big, heavy crucifix. Boyd slumps to the ground. \n               Fisher gasps for air. Boyd stirs. Liz beats him repeatedly \n               with the crucifix until he's dead as a door knob. Fisher is \n               stunned. Liz tosses the cross. Miraculously, only one perfect \n               droplet of blood has gotten on her wedding dress. She flicks \n               it off with her finger.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                              (composing herself)\n                         Here comes the bride.\n\n               Liz gathers up her train and marches out. Fisher looks at \n               Boyd, a bloody dead mess.\n\n               THE WEDDING\n\n               Fisher joins Moore at the alter. JUDGE TOWER smiles warmly \n               at Fisher.\n\n                                     MOORE\n                         Where's Boyd?\n\n                                     FISHER\n                              (whispers)\n                         Downstairs in the closet.\n\n               Before Moore can ask, the ORGAN begins playing the WEDDING \n               MARCH. Liz starts down the aisle, escorted by her father, \n               She smiles radiantly.\n\n               Liz's father kisses her and gives her to Fisher. They stand \n               before the Judge who starts talking. TIGHT ON Fisher. His \n               head pounding. He hears none of what the Judge says until...\n\n                                     JUDGE TOWER\n                         May we have the rings please?\n\n                                     FISHER\n                         What?\n\n                                     JUDGE TOWER\n                         The rings?\n\n               Fisher looks at Moore.\n\n               INT.

He looks at \n               Liz who stares straight ahead.\n\n               INT. CHURCH BASEMENT\n\n               Moore rolls Boyd over, checks every pocket, trying not to \n               get blood on himself.\n\n               INT.

The \n               Judge looks at Moore. He pulls his jacket sleeve down.\n\n                                     JUDGE TOWER\n                              (continues)\n                         These rings represent the commitment \n                         Fisher and Liz make to each other on \n                         the day.

FISHER'S CAR\n\n               Fisher drives, Moore's in the passenger seat. They're still \n               in their tuxedos. Extreme silence.
