The images \n               are grainy to match the tone of the Zapruder film.  People \n               are on rooftops, hollering.  The crowd is wild with \n               enthusiasm.  We pan past Jack Ruby and slam into him in black-\n               and-white.  The camera shows a Cuban man with a radio; a man \n               with an umbrella; subliminals.  Through open windows on the \n               fifth floor of the Criminal Courts Building, convicts watch \n               and holler from their jail cells.

Ferrie, \n               Bertrand, O'Keefe, and four Cubans in battle fatigues are \n               laughing and fooling around.

Oswald drags behind two Cubans - one is \n               \"the Bull\", heavyset with a scar over his left eye, who we \n               saw at the Canal Street incident, and the other, \"the Indian\", \n               is quiet and cold.  The men ring the doorbell and talk to a \n               concerned Silvia as Oswald hangs back, watching, in the \n               shadows.  The men give her intimate information about her \n               father, who is imprisoned in Cuba.

I don't know this \n                         man.  Obviously then, I wouldn't \n                         have him to dinner.  Incidentally, I \n                         do not live in an apartment.  It's \n                         an 1860's house built by Gallier.  \n                         I've restored it faithfully.  You \n                         know I am quite an advocate of \n                         restoration.\n\n               At Shaw's house, dinner is served at a long table by the \n               black butler.  The table is decorated by a sumptuous setting \n               of silver and candelabra.\n\n               Shaw uses a bell to summon the butler.\n\n<b>                                     JIM (V.O.)\n</b>                         Perhaps a few more details about the \n                         evening will refresh your memory.  \n                         Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served \n                         by a uniformed waiter - a colored \n                         man.  He particularly remembers that \n                         you sat at one end and he at the \n                         other - which he found rather unusual \n                         because the table was so long.  Does \n                         that bring back memories of Willie \n                         O'Keefe?\n\n<b>                                     SHAW\n</b>                              (in present)\n                         Not at all.  But on the other hand, \n                         I do have a lovely Chippendale dining \n                         table and I often have a friend over \n                         sitting at one end while I sit at \n                         the other.  That is precisely the \n                         point of a long dining table.  The \n                         splendor of the meal adds to the \n                         enjoyment of it.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                         I would imagine a uniformed waiter \n                         helps.\n\n<b>                                     SHAW\n</b>                         It adds a taste of elegance for which \n                         I must confess a weakness for now \n                         and then.

Two \n                         wars.  I was one of those secret \n                         guys in the Pentagon that supplies \n                         the military hardware - the planes, \n                         bullets, rifles - for what we call \n                         \"black operations\" - \"black ops\", \n                         assassinations, coup d'etats, rigging \n                         elections, propoganda, psych warfare \n                         and so forth.  World War II - Rumania, \n                         Greece, Yugoslavia, I helped take \n                         the Nazi intelligence apparatus out \n                         to help us fight the Communists.  \n                         Italy '48 stealing elections, France \n                         '49 breaking strikes - we overthrew \n                         Quirino in the Philippines, Arbenz \n                         in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran.  \n                         Vietnam in '54, Indonesia '58, Tibet \n                         '59 we got the Dalai Lama out - we \n                         were good, very good.  Then we got \n                         into the Cuban thing.  Not so good.  \n                         Set up all the bases for the invasion \n                         supposed to take place in October \n                         '62.  Khrushchev sent the missiles \n                         to resist the invasion, Kennedy \n                         refused to invade and we were standing \n                         out there with our dicks in the wind.  \n                         Lot of pissed-off people, Mr.  \n                         Garrison, you understand?  I'll come \n                         to that later... I spent much of \n                         September '63 working on the Kennedy \n                         plan for getting all U.S.  personnel \n                         out of Vietnam by the end of '65.  \n                         This plan was one of the strongest \n                         and most important papers issued \n                         from the Kennedy White House.  Our \n                         first 1,000 troops were ordered home \n                         for Christmas.  Tensions were high.  \n                         In November '63, one week after the \n                         murder of Vietnamese President Diem \n                         in Saigon, and two weeks before the \n                         assassination of our President...\n\n               FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon offices in 1963.  X strides down a \n               busy hall and into the offices of one of his superiors, Major \n               General Y, a lean, cold warrior, battlefield handsome, \n               civilian clothes, and several advisors.  There's a U.S. flag \n               on the wall.  The status of Y is only clear by the sing on \n               the desk, the name blocked by a passing figure.\n\n<b>                                     X\n</b>                         ...a strange thing happened.  I was \n                         sent by my superior officer, call \n                         him Y, to the South Pole as the \n                         military escort for a group of \n                         international VIP's.  This trip had \n                         nothing to do with my nine years of \n                         work in Special Operations.  It was \n                         sort of a \"paid vacation\".\n\n               We hear vague ad-lib mutterings on the soundtrack indicating \n               a friendly atmosphere, and we see stock footage of a C-130 \n               transport flying to Antarctica and ice floes on the surface \n               of the sea.\n\n               Then, at a New Zealand airport, we see X, in a uniform, at a \n               newsstand reading of Kennedy's assassination.  The banner \n               headline of an \"Extra\" edition of The Christchurch Star \n               screams out \"KENNEDY SHOT DEAD.\"\n\n<b>                                     X\n</b>                         It wasn't until I was on my way back \n                         in New Zealand that I read of the \n                         President's murder.  That was 2 in \n                         the afternoon the next day New Zealand \n                         time, but already the papers had the \n                         entire history of an unknown 24-year-\n                         old man, Oswald - a studio picture, \n                         detailed biographical data, Russian \n                         information - and were pretty sure \n                         of the fact he'd killed the President \n                         alone, although it took them four \n                         more hours to charge him with the \n                         murder in Texas.  It felt as if, \n                         well, a cover story was being put \n                         out like we would in a black op.\n\n               Back at the Pentagon office, we see X returning and meeting \n               Y.  The atmosphere is cordial, but Y is slightly different \n               from before - more harried, more nervous.  He turns away to \n               light a cigarette, he doesn't want the usual conversation.\n\n<b>                                     X\n</b>                         Anyway, after I came back I asked \n                         myself why was I, the chief of special \n                         ops, selected to travel to the South \n                         Pole at that time to do a job that \n                         any number of others could have done?  \n                         One of my routine duties if I had \n                         been in Washington would've been to \n                         arrange for additional security in \n                         Texas.  The Secret Service is \n                         relatively small, and by custom the \n                         military will augment them.  I checked \n                         it out when I got back and sure \n                         enough, I found out someone had told \n                         the 112th Military Intelligence Group \n                         at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam \n                         Houston to \"stand down\" that day, \n                         over the protests of the unit \n                         Commander, a Colonel Reich...\n\n               We see an outdoor shot of the Texas Army Headquarters on a \n               day in 1963.  Inside, on the same day, Col. Reich is on the \n               phone, puzzled.\n\n<b>                                     X\n</b>                         Now this is significant, because it \n                         is standard operating procedure, \n                         especially in a known hostile city \n                         like Dallas, to supplement the Secret \n                         Service.  Even if we had not allowed \n                         the bubbletop to be removed from the \n                         limousine, we'd've put at least 100 \n                         to 200 agents on the sidewalks, \n                         without question!  There'd already \n                         been several attempts on de Gaulle's \n                         life in France.  Only a month before \n                         in Dallas UN Ambassador Adlai \n                         Stevenson had been spit on and hit.  \n                         We'd have arrived days ahead of time, \n                         studied the route, checked all the \n                         buildings...\n                         We never would've allowed all those \n                         wide-open empty windows overlooking \n                         Dealey... never...  We would have \n                         had our own snipers covering the \n                         area.  The moment a window went up \n                         they'd have been on the radio.  We \n                         would've been watching the crowds - \n                         packages, rolled up newspapers, a \n                         coat over an arm, never would have \n                         let a man open an umbrella along the \n                         way - Never would've allowed that \n                         limousine to slow down to 10 miles \n                         per hour, much less take that unusual \n                         curve at Houston and Elm.  You would \n                         have felt an Army presence in the \n                         streets that day, but none of this \n                         happened.  It was a violation of the \n                         most basic protection codes we have.  \n                         And it is the best indication of a \n                         massive plot in Dallas.  Who could \n                         have best done that?  People in my \n                         business, Mr. Garrison.  People like \n                         my superior officer could've told \n                         Col. Reich, \"Look - we have another \n                         unit coming from so and so providing \n                         security.  You'll stand down.\"  That \n                         day, in fact, there were some \n                         individual Army Intelligence people \n                         in Dallas and I'm still trying to \n                         figure out who and why.  But they \n                         weren't protecting the client.  One \n                         of them, by the way, was caught in \n                         the Book Depository after police \n                         sealed it off.\n\n               In Dealey Plaza, 1963, we see an Army intelligence man taking \n               a shot with a Minolta camera.\n\n<b>                                     X\n</b>                         Army Intell had a \"Harvey Lee Oswald\" \n                         on file, but all those files have \n                         been destroyed.  Many strange things \n                         were happening that day, and Lee \n                         Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with \n                         them.  We had the entire Cabinet on \n                         a trip to the Far East.  We had a \n                         third of a combat division returning \n                         from Germany in the air above the \n                         United States at the time of the \n                         shooting, and at 12:34 P.M., the \n                         entire telephone system went dead in \n                         Washington for a solid hour, and on \n                         the plane back to Washington, word \n                         was radioed from the White House \n                         Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson \n                         that one individual performed the \n                         assassination.  Does that sound like \n                         a bunch of coincidences to you, Mr. \n                         Garrison?  Not for one moment.  The \n                         cabinet was out of the country to \n                         get their perception out of the way.  \n                         The troops were in the air for \n                         possible riot control.  The phones \n                         didn't work to keep the wrong stories \n                         from spreading if anything went wrong \n                         with the plan.  Nothing was left to \n                         chance.  I bet you there were even \n                         backup teams and cars on the other \n                         side of the underpass in the event \n                         that Kennedy got through wounded.  \n                         They would have moved in with vehicles \n                         like they did with de Gaulle.  He \n                         could not be allowed to escape alive.\n\n               The camera is on Jim, listening.  This information is much \n               greater than he ever envisioned, and he is stunned.

Vietnam started for \n                         real.  There was an air of, I don't \n                         know, make-believe in the Pentagon \n                         and the CIA.  Those of us who'd been \n                         in secret ops since the beginning \n                         knew the Warren Commission was \n                         fiction, but there was something... \n                         deeper, uglier.  And I knew Allen \n                         Dulles very well.  I briefed him \n                         many a time in his house.  He was \n                         also General Y's benefactor.  But \n                         for the life of me I still can't \n                         figure out why Dulles was appointed \n                         to investigate Kennedy's death.

No war, no money.  \n                         Sometimes I think the organizing \n                         principle of any society is for war.  \n                         The authority of the state over it's \n                         people resides in it's war powers.  \n                         Even Eisenhower - military hero of \n                         WWII - warned us about it: \"beware \n                         the military - industrial complex\", \n                         he said.

He \n                         wanted to call of the moon race in \n                         favor of cooperation with the Soviets.  \n                         He signed a treaty with the Soviets \n                         to ban nuclear testing, he refused \n                         to invade Cuba in '62, and he set \n                         out to withdraw from Vietnam.

The cops were \"bad\" back then - \n                         they'd shake you down for the money \n                         in your pocket.  They put a lotta \n                         people in the cemetery, especially \n                         colored people.\n\n<b>                                     LOU\n</b>                         Beverly, what about Lee?\n\n               Jada and Beverly sit down at the table with Ferrie, Oswald, \n               and Jack, with Jack doing the buying.

One time I came in, Jack \n                         introduces me to these two guys.  He \n                         said, \"Beverly, this is my friend \n                         Lee...\" and I didn't catch the other \n                         guy's name.  He was a weird-looking \n                         guy with those funny little eyebrows.  \n                         The other guy, Lee, didn't make much \n                         of an impression either.  He wasn't \n                         good-looking or nuthin', he didn't \n                         look like he had any money, and he \n                         was in a bad mood, so I didn't pay \n                         him much mind.  Well, I might not \n                         remember a name, but I always remember \n                         a face.  When I saw him tow weeks \n                         later on the television, I screamed, \n                         \"Oh, my God - that's him!

Jim and Lou walk with Dodd and Holland near \n               the picket fence.

We will return to this photograph in more detail \n               later.\n\n<b>                                     JEAN HILL\n</b>                         I jumped out in the street and yelled, \n                         \"Hey Mr. President, look over here, \n                         we wanna take your picture.\"  He \n                         looked up and then shots rang out.  \n                         Mary fell to the ground right away, \n                         shouting, \"Get down, they're shooting, \n                         get down, they're shooting.\" I knew \n                         it but I was moving to get closer to \n                         him.  The driver had stopped - I \n                         don't know what was wrong with that \n                         driver.  And then, out of the corner \n                         of my eye, I saw this flash of light, \n                         in the bushes and that last shot... \n                         just ripped his head off, I mean, \n                         blood, brains, just blew everything...\n\n               FLASHBACK TO the day of the shooting.  We hear the sound of \n               shots and see the Grassy Knoll from Jean's point of view.\n\n<b>                                     JEAN HILL\n</b>                         I looked up and saw smoke from the \n                         Knoll.  And everything was frozen - \n                         seemed like people wasn't even \n                         breathing, like you're looking at a \n                         picture - except this one guy.  I \n                         saw this one guy running from the \n                         Book Depository towards the railroad \n                         tracks.  And that was the same man I \n                         saw on TV two days later shooting \n                         Oswald.  That was Jack Ruby.  No \n                         question about it.\n\n               Blurry image - we're not at all sure what or who or if... \n               but a seed is planted.  We see smoke - the same smoke Bowers \n               saw... then Jack Ruby in a brown coat running from the Book \n               Depository toward the railroad tracks.  Then we see Jean's \n               view as she runs toward the Knoll along with others.  there \n               are yells, shouts, and general confusion.\n\n<b>                                     JEAN HILL\n</b>                         It was him I was chasing up the Grassy \n                         Knoll, thinking our guys had shot \n                         back and maybe we got one of them.  \n                         I don't know what I would have done \n                         if I had caught him, but I knew \n                         something terrible had happened and \n                         somebody had to do something.\n\n               At the picket fence, we see blurry images of police officers, \n               railroad workers, cigarette butts, buddy footprints, \n               confusion...\n\n<b>                                     *JEAN HILL\n</b>                         I never did catch him.

Members of the press pack the hot room, \n               and a fan turns overhead.\n\n<b>                                     JIM\n</b>                         To prove their was a conspiracy \n                         involving Clay Shaw we must prove \n                         there was more than one man involved \n                         in the assassination.  To do that, \n                         we must look at the Zapruder film, \n                         which my office has subpoenaed.  The \n                         American public has not seen that \n                         film because it has been kept locked \n                         in a vault in the Time-Life Building \n                         in New York City for the last five \n                         years.  There is a reason for that.  \n                         Watch.\n\n               The Zapruder film (8mm) now rolls.  We have seen pieces of \n               it before in the opening of the film, but now we see it whole.  \n               It is crucial that this piece of film be repeated several \n               times during the trial to drive home a point that is easily \n               lost on casual viewing.  The first viewing is silent except \n               for the sound of the clanky projector.  It lasts about 25 \n               seconds, and then the lights come on.

The Warren Commission \n                         thought they had an open and shut \n                         case: three bullets, one assassin - \n                         but two things happened that made it \n                         virtually impossible: 1)the Zapruder \n                         film which you just saw, and 2)the \n                         third wounded man, Jim Tague, who \n                         was nicked by a fragment down by the \n                         Triple Underpass.  The time frame of \n                         5.6 seconds established by the \n                         Zapruder film left no possibility of \n                         a fourth shot from Oswald's rifle, \n                         but the shot or fragment that left a \n                         superficial wound on Tague's cheek \n                         had to come from a bullet that missed \n                         the car entirely.  Now they had two \n                         bullets that hit, and we know one of \n                         them was the fatal head shot.  So a \n                         single bullet remained to account \n                         for all seven wounds in Kennedy and \n                         Connally.

Earlene \n               peeks out the shades as she hears two short honks on a horn.\n\n               Outside is a black police car driven by Tippit.  Also in the \n               car is the fence shooter, dressed as a Dallas policeman.  \n               The car drives by, honks twice, waits, then moves away.  \n               During this visual, we see the fence shooter changing his \n               uniform into civilian clothes.\n\n<b>                                     JIM (V.O.)\n</b>                         Oswald returns to this rooming house \n                         around 1 P.M., half hour after the \n                         assassination, puts on his jacket, \n                         grabs his .38 revolver, leaves at \n                         1:04... Earlene Roberts, the \n                         housekeeper, says she heard two beeps \n                         on a car horn and two uniformed cops \n                         pulled up to the house while Oswald \n                         was in his room, like it was a signal \n                         or something... Officer Tippit is \n                         shot between 1:10 and 1:15 about a \n                         mile away.  Though no one actually \n                         saw him walking or jogging, the \n                         Government says Oswald covered that \n                         distance.  Incidentally, that walk, \n                         if he did it, is in a straight line \n                         toward Jack Ruby's house.  Giving \n                         the government the benefit of the \n                         doubt, Oswald would have had to jog \n                         a mile in six to eleven minutes and \n                         commit the murder, then reverse \n                         direction and walk 3/5 of a mile to \n                         the Texas Theatre and arrive sometime \n                         before 1:30.  That's some walking.\n\n               On a street, Oswald walks alone, fast.  A police car pulls \n               up alongside him on 10th Street.  Oswald leans on the \n               passenger side of the window.  Officer Tippit, suspicious, \n               gets out to question him.  Oswald pulls his .38 revolver and \n               shoots him down in the street with 5 shots.\n\n<b>                                     JIM (V.O.)\n</b>                         It's also a useful conclusion.

Less than six weeks later, he was \n               narrowly defeated for a fourth term as District Attorney.\n\n               ** In 1978, Garrison was elected Judge of the Louisiana State \n               Court of Appeal in New Orleans.

He now lives in \n               the same house he lived in with Elizabeth.  She lives a block \n               away.  Their five children are grown.\n\n               ** SOUTHEAST ASIA: 58,000 American lives, 2 million Asian \n               lives, $220 billion spent, 10 million Americans air - lifted \n               there by commercial aircraft, more than 5,000 helicopters \n               lost, 6.5 million tons of bombs dropped.\n\n               ** A Congressional Investigation from 1976 - 1979 found a \n               \"probable conspiracy\" in the assassination of John F. Kennedy \n               and recommended the Justice Department investigate further.  \n               As of 1991, the Justice Department has done nothing.
