A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS\n          light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off\n          the fence.

The\n          viperwolves have him encircled.\n          \n          The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each\n          other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on\n          his legs from behind but --\n          \n          JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face.   It yips and goes\n          past, but ANOTHER moves in --\n          \n          He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS,\n          retreating, baring its fangs.\n          \n          Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees\n          what he's up against.   The VIPERWOLVES are six-limbed with\n          shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS.\n          Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums.\n          \n          Jake realizes that he is making his final stand.   He whirls\n          the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay --\n          \n          And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a\n          lightning bolt and the fear is gone.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                        (SCREAMING)\n                    I don't have all goddamn night! Come on!\n                    Come on!\n          \n          With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK.\n          \n          Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as --\n          \n          ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking\n          true, but --\n          \n          Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes\n          flying. Left in semi-darkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as--\n          \n          A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in\n          pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which --\n          \n          CUTS deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go.\n          \n          JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf\n          leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its fore-hand. Jake\n          tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as --\n          \n                                                                       38.\n          \n          \n          \n          THREE WOLVES charge at once.     The nearest LEAPS at his throat\n          just as --\n          \n          THUNK!! -- an ARROW appears in its chest.\n          \n          The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight.    He pushes it\n          off in time to see --\n          \n          A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw\n          and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another\n          wolf falls.\n          \n          NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the\n          skull of a circling wolf.\n          \n          ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but\n          rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand.\n          \n          Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest.\n          \n          SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away,\n          but --\n          \n          It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its\n          throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face.\n          \n          MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT\n          across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                    Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!\n          \n          The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past\n          them. Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and--\n          \n          They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them--\n          \n                                 NEYTIRI\n                    Raaaarrrr!\n          \n          Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his\n          weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it\n          and looks up at --\n          \n          NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening\n          to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is\n          over, she turns.\n          \n          She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him.\n          Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Wait, don't --\n          \n                                                                       39.\n          \n          \n          \n          Jake blinks around at the darkness -- realizing he can still\n          see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest\n          is transformed.\n          \n          The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE -- spots and\n          patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue-green light.\n          \n          Jake scrambles to recover his spear.   Neytiri kneels beside --\n          \n          A DYING WOLF. It's CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air,\n          trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its\n          chest.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                        (in Na'vi)\n                    Forgive me, my brother.\n          \n          She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches\n          its head gently, regarding it with sadness.\n          \n          Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her\n          waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling\n          the arrow from its heart.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Look, um, I know you probably don't\n                    understand this. But -- thanks. Thank\n                    you. I owe you.\n          \n          Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead\n          animal.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                        (in Na'vi)\n                    Forgive me. May your spirit run with the\n                    Great Mother.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    I would have been screwed if you hadn't\n                    come along --\n          \n          She rises and walks away without looking at Jake.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'?\n          \n          He crashes through some plants, catching up to her.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Slow down a second will you. I just want\n                    to thank you for killing those --\n          \n          He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and --\n          \n                                                                     40.\n          \n          \n          \n          WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a\n          fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat.\n          \n          He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who\n          speaks English -- accented, halting, angry English.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                    Don't thank! You don't thank for this!\n                    This is sad. Very sad, only.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Okay, I'm sorry.    Whatever I did -- I'm\n                    sorry.\n          \n          She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                    All this is your fault!

How'm I the bad guy\n                    HERE--\n          \n          She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                    Your fault! You are like a baby, making\n                    noise, don't know what to do. You should\n                    not come here, all of you! You only come\n                    and make problems. Only.\n          \n          Jake gets up, slowly, facing her.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Okay, fine, you love your little forest\n                    friends. So why not just let them kill\n                    my ass? What's the thinking?\n          \n          CU Neytiri -- looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes\n          MEET HIS for the first time -- a riveting gaze with those big\n          gold orbs.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                    Why save you?\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Yes, why save me?\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                    You have a strong heart.

Ignorant like a child!\n          \n          She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her.\n          \n          TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT.\n          \n          WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which\n          forms an elevated walkway.\n          \n          Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far\n          above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move\n          through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should\n                    teach me.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                    Sky people can not learn.   You do not\n                    See.\n          \n          She leaps to another elevated root.   Jake follows, surprised\n          that he made it.\n          \n                               JAKE\n                    Whooaa.\n          \n          He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Then teach me to \"see.\"\n          \n          She stops and he almost runs into her.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                    No one can teach you to See.\n          \n          Then she turns and trots on.\n          \n          EXT. GORGE - NIGHT\n          \n          They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree -- a\n          horizontal trunk big as an oak.\n          \n          WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers\n          silver in the Polyphemus-light.

He drops\n          the spear and almost falls off the root.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Whooaaa -- shit!\n          \n          Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He\n          watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river.\n          \n          She pulls him upright.

Several ALIGHT on him.\n          \n          Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid -- but somehow\n          he's not. He spreads his arms.

Rings of green\n          light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each\n          footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch\n          down. Dream-like, surreal beauty.\n          \n          WIDE ON THEM as they run over a large root, across a mirror-\n          like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL.\n          \n          Jake follows Neytiri, running along a raised root-trunk.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    What's your name?\n          \n          JAKE hears WHOOSH-WHOOSH and snaps a look as a BOLO flies at\n          him, spinning end for end and --\n          \n          SHWHAP!! -- tangles around his legs.   He topples off the root\n          and crashes into the foliage below.\n          \n          JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as --\n          \n          SEVERAL NA'VI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding\n          DIREHORSES -- six-legged, armor-skinned alien Clydesdales.\n          \n                                                                       44.\n          \n          \n          We see that the riders' QUEUES are connected to the horses'\n          long moth-like antennae -- a neural-link with which they can\n          command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons.\n          \n          The riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach. Jake\n          turns to bolt, but --\n          \n          NA'VI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed --\n          blocking his retreat.\n          \n          Neytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the\n          LEAD RIDER.

There has been a sign. This is a\n                    matter for the Tsahik.\n          \n          Tsu'tey clenches his jaw with frustration -- frustration with\n          her as much as the situation. He turns and angrily remounts\n          his direhorse, barking a command to the HUNTERS.\n          \n                               TSU'TEY\n                        (SUBTITLED)\n                    Bring him.\n          \n          They grab Jake and haul him to his feet. Encircled by spears\n          and bows, he is shoved forward along the trail, as Tsu'tey\n          and the others ride ahead.\n                                                                  CUT TO:\n          \n          EXT. HOMETREE - NIGHT\n          \n          JAKE is hauled roughly toward Neytiri's village, which is\n          sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is 250\n          meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the\n          largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove-pillars.\n          \n                                                                      45.\n          \n          \n          \n          TSU'TEY rides inside the columns at the base of Hometree,\n          shouting an ululating WARNING.\n          \n          Jake is force-marched through the pillars into --\n          \n          INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT\n          \n          An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the\n          arriving hunt party.

The huge eyes of the children follow\n          him.\n          \n          Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light\n          of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical\n          gallery -- a living cathedral.\n          \n          Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with\n          fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting.\n          \n          The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous\n          creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM.\n          Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is --\n          \n          EYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader.

The horses' hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a\n          misty canyon.\n          \n                              JAKE (V.O.)\n                    Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway\n                    to heaven.

Thick vine-like\n          trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in\n          their gnarled grip.\n          \n          A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the\n          twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural\n          occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the\n          clouds.\n          \n          There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and\n          the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at --\n          \n          One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a\n          nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is\n          drifting toward them, filling half the sky.\n          \n          The Hunters dismount.\n          \n          JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds.

BEANSTALK - DAY\n          \n          200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along\n          the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium\n          BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.\n          \n          JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of\n          a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs\n          over it -- it floats upward.\n          \n          They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them,\n          the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from\n          one of the waterfalls hits them.\n          \n          Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper\n          branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.\n          \n          One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.\n          \n          Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling\n          over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands\n          above.\n          \n          EXT. MONS VERITATIS - DAY\n          \n          TINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small\n          island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis.\n          \n          WIDE SHOT looking down a rock face bigger than Half Dome --\n          the sheer side of Mons Veritatis.\n          \n          Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of\n          sunlight. Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below.\n          \n          EXT. GROTTO/BANSHEE ROOKERY - DAY\n          \n          A waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the\n          gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below\n          -- a view from Olympus.\n          \n          A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI'S\n          BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She\n          dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven\n          HOOD. It waits, docile, as --\n          \n          She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu'tey leads them\n          through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And\n          Jake sees --\n          \n          The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out-\n          croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls\n          with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.\n          \n                                                                       71.\n          \n          \n          \n                              TSU'TEY\n                    Jakesully will go first.\n          \n          Tsu'tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two\n          teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough.\n          \n          Tsu'tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                        (WHISPERING)\n                    Now you choose your ikran.

Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like\n          it didn't happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with --\n          \n          The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK\n          and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing\n          rows of fangs, in a threat display.\n          \n          Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one-ended BOLO.\n          \n          A LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares\n          straight at him.\n          \n          Jake looks directly into its eyes -- and strides toward it.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Let's dance.\n          \n          The challenged banshee HISSES and leaps at him, jaws wide as--\n          \n          Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then\n          slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT.\n          \n          Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong\n          whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED\n          SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but --\n          \n                                                                      72.\n          \n          \n          \n          Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the\n          banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he\n          SWARMS IT -- arms around its thrashing head.\n          \n          Jake grabs its whip-like antenna and brings it toward his\n          queue but --\n          \n          The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! -- clocks him right in\n          the face, almost knocking him out and --\n          \n          IT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the\n          rock and almost goes over the edge as --\n          \n          NEYTIRI gasps. Tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly.\n          \n          The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way\n          pissed off now, but --\n          \n          Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his\n          leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN\n          HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top,\n          pinning it and --\n          \n          Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams\n          the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and --\n          \n          The banshee stops struggling. It lies there panting.   They\n          are locked together, literally eye to eye.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    That's right! You're mine.\n          \n          ECU BANSHEE -- the pupil like a deep black well.\n          \n          Jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over\n          the creature's back.\n          \n          Neytiri runs to him.\n          \n                              NEYTIRI\n                    First flight seals the bond. You cannot\n                    wait.\n          \n          Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power.   He grips\n          a hank of the beast's main, and --\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    Heeeyyyaaaah!\n          \n          THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS\n          as they PLUMMET off the cliff -- the banshee WAILS and --\n          \n                                                                      73.\n          \n          \n          \n          They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is\n          almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so\n          much he can't think.\n          \n                               JAKE\n                     Shut the hell up!!\n          \n          It does.\n          \n                                  JAKE\n                     Level out!     Fly straight!\n          \n          It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking \"bank left\"\n          and the animal complies.

The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips\n          on top of it, stabbing.\n          \n          QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning\n          Neytiri's legs under its great bulk.

He CLOSES faster than the suit\n          can move and --\n          \n          K-CRACK! -- SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy,\n          crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with\n          the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash\n          and --\n          \n          SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again\n          -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying.\n          \n          QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away.\n          Jake rolls just before --\n          \n          THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was.

HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks.\n          The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and --\n          \n          FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing\n          it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside.\n          \n          INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and --\n          \n          P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air.\n          Quaritch can see again.

Walks away.\n          \n          FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us\n          and --\n          \n          CRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the\n          window.

Through a haze of\n          pain, he recognizes Jake.\n          \n                              TSU'TEY\n                        (NA'VI)\n                    I See you, Jakesully.\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.\n          \n                              TSU'TEY\n                    Are the people safe?\n          \n                              JAKE\n                    They're safe.\n          \n          Tsu'tey weakly clutches his severed queue.\n          \n                               TSU'TEY\n                    I can never ride again, or bond with my\n                    woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa.
