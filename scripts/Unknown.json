It's\r\n          too small and it moves too fast.\r\n          Thynnidae. It's a kind of wasp,\r\n          but it looks like an ant. Only\r\n          the males have wings. The orchid\r\n          re-produces the pheromones of the\r\n          female wasp to lure it in. It's\r\n          a trick. It's pretending to be\r\n          something it isn't...\r\n          Bressler looks to Martin. Surprised... curious now. Martin\r\n          sees his opening.

With major\r\n          trauma, the puzzle is shattered.\r\n          But the brain's ability to\r\n          recover is remarkable. The mind\r\n          needs a narrative, an identity...\r\n          a soul. Without memory, without\r\n          a past, we are nothing. In the\r\n          coma state, memories are rebuilt.\r\n          In some cases the pieces move.\r\n          In others they go missing. And\r\n          sometimes... completely new\r\n          pieces are found.\r\n          The bird flies off.
