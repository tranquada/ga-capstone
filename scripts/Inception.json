A young\r\nJapanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.\r\n\r\n<b>                    COBB\r\n</b>          A bacteria?

The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs\r\nlevel with the rim of the tub.\r\n\r\nA sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A\r\ndistant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the\r\nwindow, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD\r\nCITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.\r\n\r\nNash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds\r\nTWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch-\r\n<b>THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.\r\n</b>\r\nNash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's\r\nfeet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the\r\nbriefcase to Arthur's wrist.\r\n\r\nNash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where\r\nthey pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of\r\nthe door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to\r\nhis wrist.
