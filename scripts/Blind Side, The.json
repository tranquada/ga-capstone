Then, like a traffic\r\n          accident, stuff begins to randomly\r\n          collide. From the snap of the ball\r\n          to the snap of the first bone is\r\n          closer to four seconds than five.\r\n\r\n          2 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD/GAME FOOTAGE - NIGHT 2\r\n\r\n           We're watching footage of the 1985 Redskins/Giants Monday\r\n           Night Football game. Lots of angles, faces, knuckles as the\r\n           two teams line up, Redskins on offense, for the snap of the\r\n           ball. As the play begins --\r\n\r\n          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE\r\n          One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the\r\n          Redskins quarterback, takes the\r\n          snap and hands off to his running\r\n          back.\r\n          JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps\r\n          forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann.\r\n          The footage PAUSES AND PLAYS like a coach breaking down film.\r\n\r\n          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)\r\n          Two Mississippi. It's a trick play,\r\n          a flea flicker, and the running\r\n          back tosses the ball back to the\r\n          quarterback.\r\n          HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has\r\n          the ball back and races toward him. Theismann steps up and\r\n          to the side and Carson flies past.\r\n\r\n          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)\r\n          Three Mississippi. Up to now the\r\n          play's been defined by what the\r\n          quarterback sees. It's about to be\r\n          defined by what he doesn't.\r\n          LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins\r\n          lineman trying to block him.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           \r\n\r\n                         2 CONTINUED: 2\r\n          The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses.\r\n          Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann.\r\n          The image FREEZES.\r\n\r\n          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)\r\n          Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor\r\n          is the best defensive player in the\r\n          NFL and has been from the time he\r\n          stepped onto the field as a rookie.\r\n          The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes\r\n          Theismann's body.\r\n          PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating.\r\n          TAYLOR pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman.\r\n\r\n          LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)\r\n          He will also change the game of\r\n          football as we know it.\r\n          WE ARE WATCHING the MNF feed and hear the ANNOUNCER'S VOICES.\r\n\r\n          FRANK GIFFORD (V.0.)\r\n          Again, we'll look at it with the\r\n          reverse angle one more time.

What you\r\n          probably don't know is that more\r\n          often than not the second highest\r\n          paid player is, thanks to Lawrence\r\n          Taylor, a left tackle.\r\n          The camera goes to WALTER JONES, Seattle's left tackle.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            3\r\n\r\n                         3 CONTINUED: 3\r\n\r\n           LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)\r\n          Because, as every housewife knows,\r\n          the first check you write is for\r\n          the mortgage and the second is for\r\n          the insurance.

Lots of folks out, milling\r\n          about, but our focus is on A TEENAGER in the distance, moving\r\n          TOWARD US in SLO-MO while everyone else is at normal speed.\r\n          He's extremely large, six and a half feet, but he carefully\r\n          steps instead of strutting.

Not only\r\n          the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants\r\n          and T-shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to\r\n          the fact that he doesn't belong here.\r\n          Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a\r\n          wide, cautious berth.

HURT VILLAGE - REPEATED SHOT - DAY 168\r\n\r\n          Michael moves through the tough crowd.\r\n\r\n          MICHAEL (V.0.)\r\n          It all depends on who you are,\r\n          where you come from. Didn't at\r\n          least one of the six hundred guys\r\n          think about giving up and joining\r\n          with the other side? I mean,\r\n          Valley of Death, that's pretty\r\n          salty stuff.\r\n\r\n          169 EXT. WINGATE - REPEATED SHOT - DAY 169 \r\n\r\n          Michael walks under the arch for the first time.\r\n\r\n          MICHAEL (V.0.)\r\n          That's why courage is tricky.\r\n          Should you always do what others\r\n          tell you to do? Sometimes you\r\n          might not even know why you're\r\n          doing something. I mean, any fool\r\n          can have courage.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            109\r\n\r\n          170 INT.

It's who you are and maybe\r\n          who you want to be. If you die\r\n          trying for something important then\r\n          you have both honor and courage and\r\n          that's pretty good.\r\n\r\n          171 INT.

That you should try for\r\n          courage and hope for honor. And\r\n          maybe even pray that the people\r\n          telling you what. to do have some,\r\n          too.\r\n          Bob, visibly moved, sets down the essay and smiles.\r\n\r\n          172 INT.
