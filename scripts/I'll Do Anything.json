Each side of the \n               frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the \n               middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,... everyone \n               having the \"high\" of their lives.\n\n<b>               INT.

His open, friendly, \n               American face slips between some of the many cracks in his \n               profession. The face at 26, and forever more, not arresting \n               enough for a leading man; not quirky enough for a \"character.\" \n               Matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way \n               past a knot of people. He dances furiously for two seconds, \n               then steps down as THE DANCERS BEGIN TO SING \"WOW\", but just \n               as the song breaks out musically, we hear the SOUND OF PEOPLE \n               SHHHING; the singers falter and then stop as the party-goers \n               gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted TV \n               set.\n\n<b>               MAN ON TV\n</b>\n               We can barely discern the words. . .\"with his review is \n               Leonard Graff.\"\n\n               A FRANTIC ACTRESS yelps a command:\n\n<b>                                     FRANTIC ACTRESS\n</b>                         I can't hear over this shhing.\n\n               Silence, then:\n\n<b>                                     TV CRITIC\n</b>                         ...a play about guess what?

There's all different \n                         ways. Did you know Woody Allen never \n                         reads actors? He just looks at them, \n                         feels around a little and then decides \n                         who he wants. That's his way. Doesn't \n                         hear them do a line. I also have a \n                         way. What I do is interview first--\n                         then read--maybe do it all over again \n                         the next day. I call up people the \n                         actor has worked with--check him \n                         out. If he's famous, I do an opinion \n                         survey to test how much people like \n                         him. If he's not famous, I put him \n                         on tape and show it to everyone I \n                         can grab. I believe in screen tests; \n                         I believe in replacing if the dailies \n                         are bad, in cutting people out if \n                         the previews aren't there. Because \n                         I'm not doing movies for theaters \n                         where they serve cappucino in the \n                         lobby. I'm doing popcorn movies. You \n                         want to know what I like? Come to my \n                         house, look at my lamps... you won't \n                         find it in my movies. In my movies, \n                         you'll find out what I know. I know \n                         how to do detail. What I don't know, \n                         I discover. Yesterday we finished \n                         mixing a movie--the last scene is in \n                         a field of windmills which blows up \n                         and all the blades of these windmills \n                         slice through the air, one of which \n                         hits a four-story tank of propane \n                         gas. A humongous explosion scene. I \n                         kept on saying 'louder', and they \n                         finally said to me they couldn't go \n                         louder without distortion. We went \n                         louder. We had to discover a thing, \n                         a filter, but we went louder. I don't \n                         question doing these things. I do \n                         them. So if you want to know if it's \n                         okay to do it differently--not to \n                         talk--to just read first...

CATHY'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\n               We HEAR the strains of the theme of a past hit movie coming \n               from Cathy's cassette player. A rack of soundtracks clearly \n               visible. Cathy is frowning as she reads the last of the galley \n               pages. She overhears some conversation in the adjoining room \n               which begins to disturb her concentration.\n\n<b>                                     FEMALE D PERSON (O.S.)\n</b>                         I'm not supposed to read TV pilots. \n                         Don't call us D-Girls.

As she does so, the \n               pad is supered on the screen--action seen through it. As she \n               writes, we see the notations on the super.\n\n               It is marked COVERAGE--CONFIDENTIAL FROM: CATHY BRESLOW. TO: \n               BURKE ADLER.

The pen checks FAIR for \n               story, POOR for all else, CHARACTER, DIALOGUE, etc. The form \n               then states--CHECK ONE OF THE FOLLOWING SENTENCES:\n\n<b>               I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PROJECT \n</b><b>               I RECOMMEND THIS PROJECT \n</b><b>               I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PROJECT \n</b><b>               I'D STAKE MY ALL ON THIS PROJECT \n</b><b>               I'D GLADLY STAKE MY ALL ON THIS PROJECT\n</b>\n               The phone rings.
