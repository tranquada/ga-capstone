PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT\n\n               The CAMERA briskly retreats as FORTY, HIGHLY CHARGED, \n               ATTRACTIVE, YOUNG PEOPLE march towards it. Each side of the \n               frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the \n               middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,... everyone \n               having the \"high\" of their lives.\n\n               INT. NEW YORK CLUB - NIGHT\n\n               As the troupe, with geometric precision, spills into a large \n               room (containing a raised dance floor); the CAMERA begins to \n               move past dancing couples as a legend appears:\n\n               'This is 1975 and Matt Hobbs is singled out for the first \n               time.'\n\n               And now the CAMERA reveals MATT HOBBS. His open, friendly, \n               American face slips between some of the many cracks in his \n               profession. The face at 26, and forever more, not arresting \n               enough for a leading man; not quirky enough for a \"character.\" \n               Matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way \n               past a knot of people. He dances furiously for two seconds, \n               then steps down as THE DANCERS BEGIN TO SING \"WOW\", but just \n               as the song breaks out musically, we hear the SOUND OF PEOPLE \n               SHHHING; the singers falter and then stop as the party-goers \n               gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted TV \n               set.\n\n               MAN ON TV\n\n               We can barely discern the words. . .\"with his review is \n               Leonard Graff.\"\n\n               A FRANTIC ACTRESS yelps a command:\n\n                                     FRANTIC ACTRESS\n                         I can't hear over this shhing.\n\n               Silence, then:\n\n                                     TV CRITIC\n                         ...a play about guess what?

Everyone they pass is straining, upwards, at the TV.\n\n                                     HANDSOME CONTEMPORARY\n                         How can we not listen to this?\n\n                                     MATT\n                         We'll know all we need to from the \n                         reaction.\n\n               At that moment, the rest of the party-goers turn from the TV \n               as one, looking mugged. (One girl briefly gets our attention \n               because she is particularly distraught; tears streaming down \n               her angry face. The mixture of tears and rage are, of course, \n               the chemical components of incredible sexiness. Her name is \n               BETH.)

Good Lord, it is what \n                         we're alive for.\n\n               Beth turns from the conversation, finding it preposterous, \n               then rivets her attention on the Director, walking towards \n               them, holding a ridiculously thick sheaf of papers. Beth \n               begins to sob in anticipation.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         You've just got to be tougher than \n                         this.\n\n                                     BETH\n                              (incredulous)\n                         Tougher than this?!?\n\n               The Director reaches them.\n\n                                     DIRECTOR\n                         I took it all down over the phone. \n                         It's quite bad. And, unfortunately, \n                         it's very, very long.

There's all different \n                         ways. Did you know Woody Allen never \n                         reads actors? He just looks at them, \n                         feels around a little and then decides \n                         who he wants. That's his way. Doesn't \n                         hear them do a line. I also have a \n                         way. What I do is interview first--\n                         then read--maybe do it all over again \n                         the next day. I call up people the \n                         actor has worked with--check him \n                         out. If he's famous, I do an opinion \n                         survey to test how much people like \n                         him. If he's not famous, I put him \n                         on tape and show it to everyone I \n                         can grab. I believe in screen tests; \n                         I believe in replacing if the dailies \n                         are bad, in cutting people out if \n                         the previews aren't there. Because \n                         I'm not doing movies for theaters \n                         where they serve cappucino in the \n                         lobby. I'm doing popcorn movies. You \n                         want to know what I like? Come to my \n                         house, look at my lamps... you won't \n                         find it in my movies. In my movies, \n                         you'll find out what I know. I know \n                         how to do detail. What I don't know, \n                         I discover. Yesterday we finished \n                         mixing a movie--the last scene is in \n                         a field of windmills which blows up \n                         and all the blades of these windmills \n                         slice through the air, one of which \n                         hits a four-story tank of propane \n                         gas. A humongous explosion scene. I \n                         kept on saying 'louder', and they \n                         finally said to me they couldn't go \n                         louder without distortion. We went \n                         louder. We had to discover a thing, \n                         a filter, but we went louder. I don't \n                         question doing these things. I do \n                         them. So if you want to know if it's \n                         okay to do it differently--not to \n                         talk--to just read first...

She \n                         has a real case on me, but so far \n                         I've been keeping it in the bank.\n\n               He stops talking, stops breathing, as he sees.\n\n               BURKE'S POV - THE TEST AUDIENCE\n\n               The line consists of disparate, disinterested people who are \n               focused on their own small, personal dramas--not at all \n               cognizant of the fact that they hold a life in their hands. \n               They are clearly growing impatient.\n\n               INT.

As BURKE CONTINUES TO SING... \n               the song builds as does the dance... Burke sings even more \n               passionately, his D-PEOPLE perhaps joining in as BACKGROUND \n               SINGERS. At a key point, the disparate groups turn and form \n               a SOLID UNIFIED LINE. They begin the rhythmic clapping of \n               impatience--having become a line, they now threaten to become \n               a mob. Burke sings one more Joe Cocker-like passionate plea \n               before turning to camera to shout over the mayhem:\n\n                                     BURKE\n                         Let them in.\n\n               As they enter.\n\n               INT.

He is right behind his \n               boss' ear. He leans in and offers an intimacy.\n\n                                     BURKE\n                         I'm glad you came yourself instead \n                         of sending your staff.\n\n               The boss is startled--jumps.

He moves down three \n               rows and sits in an aisle seat just as the film opens with a \n               series of violent explosions.\n\n               CLOSE ON NAN\n\n                                     NAN\n                         Please, God, let tonight give him \n                         peace.\n\n               Incredibly, Burke turns and gestures to her that the sound \n               of her small voice is interfering with the cacophony of his \n               movie.

WHOLESALE BUTCHER'S (THE FILM) - DAY\n\n               As the muscular hero moves with stealth through the giant \n               refrigerated meat door. He passes cows and dead men hanging \n               from alternate hooks. Suddenly, he is attacked by the villain \n               brandishing an electric meat dismembering tool. The hero \n               ducks, the machine ripping apart hanging cow flesh. The hero \n               grabs the only weapon he can find: a large piece of meat on \n               a large bone, which he uses as a mace.

If he had a little more confidence \n               going for him right now, he would make his move. But, for \n               now, they are two self-doubters on different trips.\n\n                                     CATHY\n                         I never thought it would do this \n                         well.

Beth, still fierce and attractive, is packing \n               her daughter's suitcase when she senses him and looks up. \n               Shaking her head with a disapproval which will never die, \n               she walks to him.\n\n                                     BETH\n                         Hello--did you two meet?\n\n                                     MATT\n                         Not really.

PLANE - DAY\n\n               Jeannie and Matt in the center two seats of a five seat row. \n               Jeannie is coloring in a book which Matt bought her; he is \n               holding some extra crayons.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         Don't stare at me.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         Sorry.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         I want to put on my yellow dress \n                         now.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         It's underneath the plane. We can't \n                         get it.\n\n               And just that quick, Jeannie screams.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         I want to put on my dress. I want to \n                         put on my dress.\n\n               Other passengers turn around. This is pretty raw stuff we're \n               into. Temper in all its wildness, MUSIC UNDER... electric \n               guitar beginning to match the energy and naked emotion of \n               the child.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         There's no way we can get the dress--\n                         it's impossible.\n\n               Jeannie's feet start kicking in front of her--the person in \n               that seat turning sharply around.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         Don't kick the seat!\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         I want the yellow dress.\n                              (a shriek)\n                         Give me a compromise.\n\n               She is crying now.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         As soon as we land. That's the \n                         compromise.\n\n               MORE MUSIC\n\n               Without warning, Jeannie slaps herself in the face. All five \n               people in the row ahead turn and say in unison:\n\n                                     WOMEN IN ROW\n                         Don't hit her.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         God, I didn't hit her--she hit her.\n\n               ANGLE ON LIGHTS\n\n               As everyone starts pushing the cabin attendant call button. \n               These dings magnify until they're part of the music--as it \n               drives and drives... Matt takes Jeannie's hand and tries to \n               restrain her.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         Noooooo. Let go of me. Noooo. The \n                         yellow dress... let go... let go.\n\n               She breaks away from him. He moves after her.\n\n               CAMERA MOVING\n\n               At breakneck speed, Jeannie dashes through the plane with \n               her father in pursuit... flashes of disapproving faces. The \n               seat belt sign goes on. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT blocks his path.\n\n                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n                         You'll have to sit down.\n\n               Jeannie takes advantage of Matt's being stopped and moves \n               into the toilet, locking the door behind her.\n\n                                     MATT\n                              (yelling)\n                         Jeannie, we have to sit down.

Will \n                         the cabin attendants please take \n                         their seats?\n\n                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n                         Sir.\n\n                                     MATT\n                              (simply and utterly)\n                         I have no idea what to do.\n\n               A sudden bump and Matt falls. He yells to the locked door.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         Jeannie, you okay?\n\n                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n                         Go back to your seat. I'll get her.\n\n               As Matt makes his way back, the Flight Attendant uses a hidden \n               latch to open the door. Music building--then calming, the \n               worst is over. Matt makes his way back to his seat, shell-\n               shocked. The Attendant leans over him.\n\n                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT\n                         She wants to be alone. So we're \n                         upgrading her.\n\n               He just nods.\n\n               FULL SHOT\n\n               Down the aisle--Jeannie lets an Attendant lead her as she \n               peers back at her dad.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n               Matt carrying the sleeping child like a sack over his \n               shoulder, also managing to hold onto all her luggage.\n\n               INT. MATT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               He has propped her on the sofa, a cotton nightgown out. He \n               is unbuttoning her dress. She opens her eyes, the window's \n               protective bars PLACING A SHADOW ACROSS HER FACE. She attempts \n               to cover her fear.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         These are the wrong jammies.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         Okay... so what do we do?\n\n               Jeannie mimics him perfectly under her breath. She goes to \n               an open suitcase and throws things on the floor until she \n               finds the right jammies.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         Where do I sleep?\n\n                                     MATT\n                         I have a sleeping bag and bed. Which \n                         one do you want?\n\n               She surveys her pitiful choice; then points to the sleeping \n               bag.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         That.\n\n               She gets into it. He zips her up--then she says something \n               remarkably unexpected.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         Hug.\n\n               Amazed, Matt hugs her. A half-beat, then:\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                              (sharply)\n                         Let go.\n\n               He does--then stands and looks down at her. She looks back, \n               mocking his stare with one of her own.\n\n               INT. BATHROOM - DAY\n\n               Nan uncertainly enters this decidedly masculine bathroom. \n               She is wearing an evening gown. The sun streams through the \n               lush foliage outside a wall-sized window. MUSIC as she opens \n               her purse and removes a pillbox; at one point lightly singing \n               a snatch of lyric concerning the conflicts of being a single \n               woman and a single mother--this while totally focused on the \n               pills.\n\n               INSERT - PILL BOX\n\n               A major movie shot of this compartmentalized box. Each \n               burrowed nest clearly labeled for the pill it contains: \n               VITAMIN B, VITAMIN A, OSCILLOCOCCINUM, PROZAC, CALCIUM, TEST \n               DRUG, ASPIRIN, XANAX, ETC.\n\n               ON NAN\n\n               MUSIC CONTINUES. She dials a phone number while arching her \n               neck and swallowing one pill after another with little swigs \n               of water. This process continuing, even as she speaks into \n               the phone.\n\n                                     NAN\n                         Monica--is Leslie up yet? Good. I \n                         didn't want you to get worried when \n                         you realized I wasn't there. I'm \n                         still with that man. I'll tell you \n                         about it later. But it's sure nice \n                         to have wobbly legs again. Look, \n                         today's recycling day for Leslie at \n                         school, so give her some empty cans... \n                         well, then dump some out for her! \n                         Tell her I had to leave real early \n                         for work and I'll pick her up at \n                         school myself to make up for it and \n                         we'll rent any cassette she wants \n                         for tonight. Thank you... Take good \n                         care.\n\n               She hangs up. Another snatch of lyric as she bends to brush \n               her teeth with her finger; prepares herself and opens the \n               door to greet her new lover.\n\n               INT.

MATT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               We hear a muffled argument between Matt and Jeannie coming \n               from inside their apartment. Then the door opens and Matt, \n               holding Jeannie by the hand, moves down the hall to the next \n               door and knocks. (NOTE: Jeannie is dressed in layers of varied \n               clothing--some of the layers play clothes, some fit for a \n               coronation. She is a pocket contemporary Annie Hall... her \n               style so much her own it transcends judgement. Her hair is \n               unkempt. The door opens revealing Lucy, an Hispanic woman in \n               her mid-30s.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         How're you doing?

Few adult women have \n               sung with such appropriate passion out of need and loss, \n               aloneness and confusion. The song finishes. Jeannie sits \n               huddled.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.

The whole \"D\" staff is there, including Cathy, \n               having lunch, along with Claire, the casting assistant. In \n               the b.g., we see Matt, huddled, sitting on the roof's awful \n               green outdoor carpeting, feeling much the same as Jeannie in \n               the previous scene.\n\n               ON MATT\n\n               Off in the distance, the Popcorn execs contentedly ply their \n               trade.

CATHY'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Matt, holding the script, walks the small lane through the \n               tidy lawn to the perfect Silver Lake cottage. We HEAR MUSIC \n               from inside. (A soundtrack.) There is a note on the door, \n               which is slightly ajar, reading: \"Come right in if you loved \n               it--ring if you have reservations.\" Matt enters.\n\n               INT.

He starts \n               to cry and, urgently seeking privacy, he moves quickly towards \n               the bathroom, rubbing Jeannie in an instinctive gesture of \n               reassurance. He closes the door.\n\n               ON JEANNIE\n\n               Devoid of anger. Sympathy so pure that it wrenches. She starts \n               to move towards the bathroom. Her voice sweet...\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         Dad? Daddy?\n\n               Matt opens the door quickly.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         Everything's okay... I'm sorry I \n                         forgot to put you back on with Cathy.\n\n               He walks across the room, Jeannie tracking him.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         You didn't cried because of that... \n                         I don't even want to talk to her.\n\n               Matt sits down, still suffering a bit of dysfunction, unable \n               to keep up appearances other than a few minor half-hearted \n               tweaks at his daughter who stands solemn and silent at his \n               side. She pets him some... this goes on for several beats as \n               the STRAINS OF \"YOU COULD BE WONDERFUL\" accompany the moment. \n               Then:\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                              (a whisper)\n                         Dad. Can I say just one thing?\n\n               With some effort, Matt lifts his head and nods permission.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         You've got to make me supper.\n\n               Matt nods, rises and leads her into the small kitchen.\n\n               INT.

If the pilot sells, his kid \n                         will be making five thousand a week. \n                         So what do you know about 'People \n                         Get Hurt?'\n\n                                     NAN\n                         I'm told that they're not going to \n                         release it...\n\n                                     BURKE\n                         I knew.

But telling you about \n                         this latest failure of yours--it \n                         pleases me.

It's just that rooting \n                         for you is a good deal more \n                         complicated than you realize.\n                              (as he rises)\n                         Don't go.\n\n                                     BURKE\n                         Don't worry. I'm not that mad. I \n                         gotta do this.\n\n               MUSIC IN as Burke leaves the table. This \"Dance of \n               Desperation\" is classical. Burke himself lifting one of the \n               women in greeting, then, as he puts her down.\n\n                                     BURKE\n                              (again)\n                         Sorry. I thought you were someone \n                         else.\n\n               As he continues to go from table to table.\n\n               TIGHT ON NAN\n\n               As she looks down on him, dying for him, we HEAR her sing \n               the song \"Poor Bastards\". Finally, not only about Burke--but \n               the other damaged souls he seeks to dance with. Now, Nan can \n               take no more. She exits.\n\n               FULL SHOT - BURKE\n\n               As he sees her go past in the background, he goes after her, \n               finally grabbing her near the Maitre D' station. This, just \n               as TWO IMPORTANT COUPLES arrive. Burke frantically tries to \n               cover.\n\n                                     BURKE\n                         Nan, you know Victor and his wife...\n                              (he mumbles, unable \n                              to remember any wife's \n                              name)\n                         and Jay and his wife...\n                              (he mumbles)\n\n                                     NAN\n                         Yes.

I'm \n                         very upset about what's happening to \n                         Burke, so I just made up my mind I \n                         can't be witness to it anymore if I \n                         love him and I certainly shouldn't \n                         be here if I don't... so I was just \n                         in the process of leaving when he \n                         stopped me and you folks walked in... \n                         I'm sure you've had something like \n                         this happen to you some time... some \n                         horrible thing in your personal life \n                         happening in public.\n\n               They all nod and ad-lib agreements with her premise to Burke's \n               amazement.\n\n                                     NAN\n                              (again)\n                         Thank you for understanding.\n                              (to Burke)\n                         Goodbye. I wish only good things for \n                         you even though I feel I've been \n                         really damaged by this relationship.\n\n               She exits, enormously upset. Burke, torn between following \n               her and repairing the social damage. But the couples are \n               paying him no mind; rather they are impressed with Nan. As \n               they comment, i.e.\n\n                                     COUPLES\n                         Wasn't that spectacular? I've never \n                         seen anybody that secure...\n\n               Burke accepts the compliments as if meant for him.\n\n                                     BURKE\n                         Thank you. Thank you. We're very \n                         close.\n\n               EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\n               The strains of \"Poor Bastards\" underscoring the moment as \n               Burke rushes into the parking area and grabs Nan's hand just \n               as a valet brings her car.\n\n                                     NAN\n                         You don't understand that I'm \n                         exhausted from hurting. I'm through \n                         with you.\n\n               She begins to cry. Ordinarily this would be a scene which \n               would be unendurable for Burke. However, the lesson of a \n               moment ago is not lost on him. As people get out of cars and \n               witness the sobbing Nan.\n\n                                     BURKE\n                              (to restaurant patrons)\n                         Excuse me, we're working our shit \n                         out... I'm sure it happened to you... \n                         you know, private stuff in public.\n\n               The reaction to his openness is disdain and passing contempt. \n               She drives off, leaving Burke hurt and alone. \"Poor Bastards\" \n               up and out.\n\n               INT. MATT'S APT. - NIGHT\n\n               The lighting soft and sweet. Jeannie's words are tentative \n               as she talks to her father who sits watching intently.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         I don't know if I've been bad.

Jeannie looks at him shyly... he looks at her \n               with encouragement. Suddenly she is in his arms, hugging him \n               hard, an emotional dam seems to have broken.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         Oh, I love you so much, I love you \n                         so much... I love you so much.\n\n               Matt holds on--clearly, deeply moved. Then he exercises the \n               effort to control his emotions and speaks, surprisingly, as \n               a Black woman.\n\n                                     MATT\n                              (as Black woman)\n                         I hope that makes you feel a whole \n                         lot better, Chile...

MAKE-UP ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               We see Jeannie's face in the mirror, but it is seen through \n               something resembling fleece, which we now recognize as the \n               strands of Jeannie's hair being combed out to the side by an \n               expert hair-dresser. Jeannie is shifting nervously in the \n               large room where each chair is filled with a child of a \n               different age and color. In the b.g., we can HEAR the voice \n               of the WARM-UP MAN.\n\n                                     WARM-UP MAN\n                         ...pilot for a new show called \n                         'Rainbow House'.

The BAND PLAYS as someone closes \n               the door to the make-up room muffling the offstage sound... \n               There is a good deal of tension in the brightly lit room. \n               Jeannie sits between a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD HISPANIC BOY and a \n               FOUR-YEAR-OLD ASIAN GIRL. The room is abuzz... kids running \n               lines and loudly talking... this builds to a musical life as \n               in our first audition scene... there is a briefly sung phrase \n               (Jeannie not taking part).\n\n               INT. GREEN ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The parents, in the same variety of skin colors as the child \n               actors, are stuffed into a small room being patronized by \n               the ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. Matt is grimly seated in the middle \n               of a long sofa containing stage mothers. Another sofa is two \n               feet away; the parents strain at each other. The A.D. is \n               talking grandly but we cannot hear his words because the \n               Rainbow Parents are SINGING a phrase from the same song we \n               heard in the make-up room. Matt does not take part in the \n               singing. The music goes under allowing us to now hear the \n               A.D.'s words.\n\n                                     A.D.\n                         ...and when you're in the audience, \n                         make sure you laugh and applaud even \n                         when it's somebody else's kid...\n\n               There is appreciative laughter from everyone save Matt, who \n               rises in disgust and crosses out of the room.\n\n                                     A.D.\n                              (again)\n                         You're not allowed near the stage. \n                         We only have a few minutes...\n\n               Matt ignores him and exits.\n\n               INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               MUSIC NOW EMPHASIZING THE TENSION OF THE PRE-SHOW ATMOSPHERE. \n               Matt, moving about the area, looking for Jeannie, spots a \n               cluster of other cast members excitedly awaiting their \n               introduction. Jeannie not among them. An A.D. talks with \n               concern to a P.A.\n\n                                     A.D.\n                         Let me know if you see the little \n                         white girl.\n\n               Matt, growing concerned, walks on, then:\n\n               MATT'S POV\n\n               Across the stage to the distant make-up room. Jeannie, alone \n               in the room, which is so brightly lit it creates a bizarre \n               effect, as if she were under a surreal spotlight. MUSIC \n               reprises Jeannie's Sinead O'Connor song, \"Lonely Life of \n               Mine.\"\n\n               ON MATT\n\n               Stopping his impulse to go to her--he continues to observe.\n\n               MATT'S POV\n\n               Jeannie is nervous and uncertain... She plays with the handle \n               of the make-up chair... turns herself back and forth... Then \n               a very attractive TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY enters the scene--obviously \n               telling her to hustle... He offers his hand and she takes \n               it, instinctively masking all clues that this hand holding \n               is a \"first\" of great moment in her life. As they move toward \n               the main stage area, Jeannie looks around, needing \n               something... her dad.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         Jeannie.\n\n               She turns--sees her father and gives a small, cursory nod... \n               He moves quickly, drawing even with her but still giving her \n               a bit of space and a low-key pep talk.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         Just remember.

She rolls her eyes as she is pulled \n               away towards the front of the stage. Matt watches as the 10-\n               year-old veteran actor leads his little daughter towards her \n               debut.\n\n               INT.

Gotta go.\n\n               From the stage, we HEAR the VOICE of the WARM-UP MAN.\n\n                                     WARM-UP MAN'S VOICE\n                         First, in her first appearance ever, \n                         Jeannie Hobbs...\n\n               There is applause.

I'd ask you to save me, but \n                         I'm so far gone, I wouldn't want you \n                         to waste your time.\n\n                                     MATT\n                              (after a moment)\n                         Huh?\n\n               She reacts, but he walks off, not wanting to get into it. \n               Cathy, however, has had a tricky nerve struck. She continues, \n               biting off each word.\n\n                                     CATHY\n                         You know, I don't have a kid or a \n                         mate or a talent.\n                              (holding up book bag)\n                         I got this.\n                              (she's quite upset)\n                         And shoot me if I think it's \n                         important.\n\n               MATT'S POV\n\n               Cathy, who looks alone and adorable as we HEAR MUSIC of \"THIS \n               LONELY LIFE OF MINE.\" He puts a comforting hand on her. She \n               speaks nakedly from deep within herself; her eyes downcast.\n\n                                     CATHY\n                         You think I'm a superficial jerk.\n                              (and then a whispered \n                              afterthought)\n                         You can't be right.\n\n                                     MATT\n                         I think you're the best of the bunch.\n\n                                     CATHY\n                              (broadly)\n                         Oh, great.\n\n               And now she raises her eyes--big, blue and vulnerable. If \n               this look were returned, \"I love yous\" could flow--they could \n               sink to the floor in a joint epiphany; but there is no romance \n               or kindling in Matt's eyes. He is in a hurry. Pridefully, \n               Cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction, her \n               flight so instinctive, she forgets her book bag. We hold on \n               this--her exit, then:\n\n               INT. STUDIO FLOOR - BURKE AND MATT - 20 MINUTES LATER\n\n               Standing just behind the four television cameras, immediately \n               behind them, the \"rail\" where the Show's Staff and Crew \n               Members and Network Bosses stand crowded, choreographed in \n               the way in which they \"clear\" for a moving camera. Behind \n               these people is the studio audience. There is a loud laugh. \n               Burke turns around to study the audience.\n\n               BURKE'S POV\n\n               Happy faces accompanied by the strains of Burke's love song \n               to the crowd...\n\n                                     BURKE\n                              (to Matt)\n                         What do you think?\n\n               But Matt doesn't hear him... a few feet away, Jeannie is \n               making ready for her big moment. Three cameras swing in front \n               of them, TV monitors showing a MASTER and CLOSE-UPS of the \n               three characters in the scene: a short comic WHITE MAN, the \n               Black Female Lead, and Jeannie, dressed as a poor child.\n\n                                     MATT\n                              (wide-eyed)\n                         Wait.

She looks outward for help.\n\n               JEANNIE'S POV\n\n               She looks at the Lead Actress giving Jeannie all she can.\n\n               BACK TO JEANNIE\n\n               Jeannie still can't cry. She looks past the cameras.\n\n               JEANNIE'S POV\n\n               Her father nervously pulling for her.\n\n               BACK TO JEANNIE\n\n               That didn't do it either. She looks into herself... she blinks--\n               there are tears running down her cheek.\n\n                                     WHOLE AUDIENCE\n                         Awwwww.\n\n               GROUP SHOT\n\n               Matt, very much as he was when he watched Brando on the \n               plane... and then some.

She turns from him to go back to work but, \n               on impulse, he restrains her. He is kneeling down, holding \n               her lightly by the arms, her back to him as he states an \n               ultimate truth:\n\n                                     MATT\n                         I'm very proud of you.

Having silenced him \n               though, she finds that she has something of her own to say. \n               She'd never tell it to her father, but she can't resist \n               telling it to her acting coach.\n\n                                     JEANNIE\n                         When I had to cry, I thought of you \n                         buried in the ground.\n\n                                     MATT\n                              (a beat, then)\n                         Give me a kiss.\n\n               She does.\n\n               INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The cast of Rainbow House taking off their make-up, changing \n               clothes, etc. This is more than high energy and excitement--\n               what's the opposite of trauma? All are off the wall with \n               pleasure--the MUSICAL LIFE of the earlier dressing room scene \n               returning--peaks of glee resulting in sung phrases as before. \n               Jeannie enters and is immediately surrounded with love, \n               attention and ad-libbed compliments about her work. In this \n               glare of good will, Jeannie turns gloriously shy.\n\n                                     BLACK LEAD ACTRESS\n                         Do you have any idea how special you \n                         were?\n                              (on Jeannie's goony \n                              reaction)\n                         That looks like a 'yes.'
