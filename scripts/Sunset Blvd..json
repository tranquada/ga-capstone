Okay.\n\n          Gillis enters.\n\n\n  A-31    INT. NORMA DESMOND'S ENTRANCE HALL\n\n          It is grandiose and grim.  The whole place is one of\n          those abortions of silent-picture days, with bowling\n          alleys in the cellar and a built-in pipe organ, and\n          beams imported from Italy, with California termites\n          at work on them.  Portieres are drawn before all the\n          windows, and only thin slits or sunlight find their\n          way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always\n          burning.\n\n\n\n          Gillis starts up the curve of the black marble\n          staircase.  It has a wrought-iron rail and a worn\n          velvet rope along the wall.\n\n                            MAX\n                      (From below)\n                 If you need help with the\n                 coffin call me.\n\n          The oddity of the situation has caught Gillis'\n          imagination.  He climbs the stairs with a kind of\n          morbid fascination.  At the top he stops, undecided,\n          then turns to the right and is stopped by\n\n                            WOMAN'S VOICE\n                 This way!\n\n          Gillis swings around.\n\n          Norma Desmond stands down the corridor next to a\n          doorway from which emerges a flickering light.  She\n          is a little woman.  There is a curious style, a\n          great sense of high voltage about her.  She is dress-\n          ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled\n          pumps.  Around her throat there is a leopard-pat-\n          terned scarf, and wound around her head a turban of\n          the same material.  Her skin is very pale, and she\n          is wearing dark glasses.\n\n                            NORMA\n                 In here.  I put him on my massage\n                 table in front of the fire.  He\n                 always liked fires and poking at\n                 them with a stick.\n\n          Gillis enters the SHOT and she leads him into\n\n\n  A-32    NORMA DESMOND'S BEDROOM\n\n          It is a huge, gloomy room hung in white brocade which\n          has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly\n          torn in a few places.  There's a great, unmade gilded\n          bed in the shape of a swan, from which the gold had\n          begun to peel.  There is a disorder of clothes and\n          negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars\n          about.\n\n          In an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn-\n          ing.  On the massage table before it lies a small\n          form shrouded under a Spanish shawl.  At each end on\n          a baroque pedestal stands a three-branched cande-\n          labrum, the candles lighted.\n\n                            NORMA\n                 I've made up my mind we'll bury him in\n                 the garden.  Any city laws against that?\n\n\n                            GILLIS\n                 I wouldn't know.\n\n                            NORMA\n                 I don't care anyway.  I want the\n                 coffin to be white.  And I want\n                 it specially lined with satin.\n                 White, or deep pink.\n\n          She picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the\n          color.  From under the shawl flops down a dead arm.\n          Gillis stares and recoils a little.  It is like a\n          child's arm, only black and hairy.\n\n                            NORMA\n                 Maybe red.  bright flaming red.\n                 Gay.  Let's make it gay.\n\n          Gillis edges closer and glances down.  Under the\n          shawl he sees the sad, bearded face of a dead\n          chimpanzee.  Norma drops back the shawl.\n\n                            NORMA\n                 How much will it be?

Or I'll buy you a boat\n                 and we'll sail to Hawaii.\n\n                            GILLIS\n                 Stop it.  You aren't going to buy\n                 me anything more.\n\n                            NORMA\n                 Don't be silly.\n                      (She reaches under a\n                       pillow of the couch\n                       and brings out a\n                       leather box)\n                 Here.  I was going to give it to\n                 you at midniglht.\n\n          Gillis opens the box.  It contains a matched gold\n          cigarette case and lighter.\n\n                            NORMA\n                 Read what's inside.\n\n          Gillis snaps open the case.  Engraved inside the\n          cover is: TO JOE FROM NORMA, and two bars of\n          music.\n\n                            GILLIS\n                 What are the notes?\n\n                            NORMA\n                 \"Mad about the boy.\"\n\n                            GILLIS\n                 Norma, I can't take it.  You've\n                 bought me enough.\n\n                            NORMA\n                 Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer\n                 than all this new Hollywood trash.\n                 I've got a million dollars.\n\n                            GILLIS\n                 Keep it.\n\n                            NORMA\n                 I own three blocks downtown.\n                 I have oil in Bakersfield --\n                 pumping, pumping, pumping.\n                 What's it for but to buy us\n                 anything we want.\n\n                            GILLIS\n                 Cut out that us business.\n\n          He rises.\n\n                            NORMA\n                 What's the matter with you?\n\n                            GILLIS\n                 What right do you have to take\n                 me for granted?\n\n                            NORMA\n                 What right? Do you want me to\n                 tell you?\n\n                            GILLIS\n                 Has it ever occurred that I may\n                 have a life of my own? That there\n                 may be some girl I'm crazy about?\n\n                            NORMA\n                 Who? Some car hop, or a dress\n                 extra?\n\n                            GILLIS\n                 Why not? What I'm trying to say\n                 is that I'm all wrong for you.\n                 You want a Valentino -- somebody\n                 with polo ponies -- a big shot --\n\n                            NORMA\n                      (Getting up slowly)\n                 What you're trying to say is\n                 that you don't want me to love\n                 you.  Is that it?\n\n          Gillis doesn't answer.  Norma slaps his face and\n          rushes from the room and upstairs.\n\n          Gillis stands paralyzed, the slap burning his cheek.\n\n\n  C-1O    THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE AND CORRIDOR\n\n          Norma rushes up the last few steps, down the corridor\n          and into her bedroom, banging the door.  MOVE THE\n          CAMERA toward the closed door, centering on the\n          gouged-out lock.\n\n\n  C-11    GILLIS, IN THE BIG ROOM\n\n          He still stands motionless.  He glances around fur-\n          tively, to see if his humiliation has been observed.\n\n\n  C-12    THE ORCHESTRA\n\n          The musicians are playing away.  They have turned\n          their eyes away from Gillis rather too ostentatious-\n          ly for comfort.\n\n\n  C-13    GILLIS\n\n          His eyes move over toward\n\n\n  C-14    MAX\n\n          He is subtler than the musicians.  He appears very\n          busy at the buffet, putting empty bottles and used\n          glasses on a tray.  He walks across the room with\n          them.\n\n\n  C-15    GILLIS\n\n          He starts slowly out.  As he does so his long gold\n          key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa\n          and holds him for a second of additional embarrass-\n          ment.  He yanks it loose and walks with as much\n          nonchalance as he can muster to\n\n\n  C-16    THE HALL\n\n          Crossing towards the coat closet, Gillis throws a\n          look upstairs.  Then he pulls the Vicuna coat from\n          its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the\n          entrance door.  He opens the door on the darkness\n          of the courtyard.\n\n\n  C-17    EXT. DESMOND HOUSE \n          (NIGHT - RAIN)\n\n          Gillis shuts the door.           GILLIS'VOICE\n          He takes a few steps       I didn't know where I was\n          forward, then stands       going.  I just had to get\n          for a while breathing      out of there.  I had to be\n          deep.  The rain is         with people my own age.  I\n          balm to that cheek         had to hear somebody laugh\n          where the slap still a     again.  I thought of Artie\n          burns.  He walks for-      Green.  There was bound to\n          ward with a great          be a New Year's shindig\n          sense of relief.           going on in his apartment\n                                     down on Las Palmas -- the\n                                     hock shop set -- not a job\n  C-18    DRIVEWAY LEADING TO        in the room.  but lots of\n          \tfun on the cuff.\n\n          Gillis walks to the\n          street, which is dark\n          and empty.  He starts\n          down Sunset in an\n          Easterly direction.\n          A car passes.  He\n          tries to thumb a\n          ride, without success.\n          However, the second\n\n          car, a florist's\n          delivery wagon, stops.\n          Gillis jumps in and the\n          car drives off.\n\n          DISSOLVE TO:\n\n  C-19    ARTIE GREEN'S APARTMENT\n\n          It is the most modest one-room affair, jam packed\n          with young people flowing over into the miniature\n          bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette.  The only\n          drink being served is punch from a pressed-glass\n          bowl -- but everybody is having a hell of a time.\n          Most of the men are in slacks and sweaters, and only\n          a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests\n          party dress.\n\n          Abe Burroughs sits at a small, guest-festooned piano\n          and sings Tokio Rose.  By the door, a group of young\n          men and girls respond to the song by sing1ng Rinso\n          White or Dentyne Chewing Gum or something similar,\n          in the manner of a Bach choral.  Artie Green, a dark\n          haired, pleasant-looking guy in his late twenties,\n          is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl.\n\n          The door behind some of the singers is pushed open,\n          jostling them out of their places.  In comes Gillis,\n          his hair and face wet, the collar of his Vicuna coat\n          turned up.  Artie stops conducting, but the commer-\n          cial goes right on.\n\n                            ARTIE\n                 Well, what do you know !

There\n          are whistles and 'stares of astonishlnent at his tails.\n          When they reach the punch bowl, Artie picks up a\n          half-filled glass and fills it.\n\n                            GILLIS\n                 Good party.\n\n                            ARTIE\n                 The greatest.

The phone is busy.  A\n          girl sits listening to it, giggling wildly.  Another\n          girl beside her is laughing too.  They are apparently\n          sharing a conversation with some man on the other end\n          of the wire.

Right on Lemon Grove\n                   Avenue.  Father was head elec-\n                   trician here till he died.

Grandma did stunt work\n                   for Pearl White.  I come from a\n                   picture family.  Naturally they\n                   took it for granted I was to become\n                   a great star.  So I had ten years of\n                   dramatic lessons, diction, dancing.\n                   Then the studio made a test.  Well,\n                   they didn't like my nose -- it slanted\n                   this way a little.  I went to a doctor\n                   and had it fixed.  They made more\n                   tests, and they were crazy about my\n                   nose -- only they didn't like my acting.\n\n                             GILLIS\n                      (Examining her nose\n                       by the flame of his\n                       lighter)\n                   Nice job.\n\n                             BETTY\n                   Should be.
