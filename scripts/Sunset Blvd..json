Around her throat there is a leopard-pat-\n          terned scarf, and wound around her head a turban of\n          the same material.

There's a great, unmade gilded\n          bed in the shape of a swan, from which the gold had\n          begun to peel.  There is a disorder of clothes and\n          negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars\n          about.\n\n          In an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn-\n          ing.
