The entire script to Clueless\nincluding important actions, songs from the\nsoundtrack, and my own personal comments.\nJust hit the little speaker \u00a0next\nto the character's name to hear the lines from the movie (They're\nnot working yet). I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed\nwriting it. It's amazing the things you pick up when watching a scene 50\ntimes. One thing: this is written by a hopelessly devoted and loyal Alicia\nSilverstone fan, so some of the commentary may be biased. But, I figure\nif you're reading this then you must have some interest her. Enjoy.\n\nAny suggestions, errors, anything?! Please email\nme pacey578@rocketmail.com\n\n\u00a0 \n\nSCENE I - CHER'S HOUSE\n\n\"Kids in America\" The Muffs\n\n(Heaps of shots of the girls having fun)\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nSo OK, you're probably thinking, \"Is this, like\na Noxema commercial, or what?!\" But seriously, I actually have a way\nnormal life for a teenage girl. I mean I get up, I brush my teeth, and\nI pick out my school clothes.\n\n\n\"Fashion Girl\"\nDavid Bowie\n\n\nDaddy's a litigator. Those are the scariest kinds\nof lawyers. Even Lucy, our maid, is terrified of him. He's so good he gets\npaid five hundred dollars an hour just to fight with people, but he fights\nwith me for free 'cause I'm his daughter.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nDaddy!\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nCher, please don't start with the juice again.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nDaddy, you need your vitamin C.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nWhere's my briefcase?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nIt's been a couple of months now, so I say we go out\nto Malibu.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nDon't tell me those braindead low-lifes have been\ncalling again.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nThey are your parents. And don't try sneaking out\nof the office. Dr. Lovitz is coming by to give you a flu shot.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nOh, Josh is in town. He's coming for dinner.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nBecause he's your step-brother!\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nBut you were hardly even married to his mother and\nthat was five years ago. Why do I have to see Josh?\n\n\n(Watch those LIPS!!)\n\nMEL\n\n\nYou divorce wives, not children.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nHere.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nForget it!\n\n\nSCENE II - CHER'S CAR\n\n\"Just a girl\" No\nDoubt\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nDid I show you the loqued-out Jeep Daddy got me? It's\ngot four wheel drive, dual side airbags and monster sound system. I don't\nhave a licence yet, but I need something to learn on.\n\n\n(Cher runs over a potted plant\non the kerb)\n\n\nOh, why that came out of nowhere.\n\n\n(Watch her face when she looks\nback at the road)\n\n\nHere's where Dionne lives. She's my friend because\nwe both know what it's like to have people be jealous of us.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nDude!\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nGirlfriend!\n\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nAnd I must give her snaps for her courageous fashion\nefforts.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nHey Cher.\n\n\nCHER V.O. \n\n\nDionne and I were both named after great singers of\nthe past who now do infomercials.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nSo?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nShopping with Dr. Seuss?\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nWell, at least I wouldn't skin a Collie to make my\nbackpack.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nIt's Faux.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nHello. That was a stop sign!\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nI totally paused!\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nYeah, OK.\n\n\nSCENE III - SCHOOL WALKWAY\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nIt's not even eight thirty and Murray is paging me.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nHe is so possesive.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nTell me about it. This weekend he called me up and\nhe's all \"Where were you today?\" and I'm like \"I'm at my\nGrandmother's house\"...\n\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nDionne and her boyfriend, Murray are in this dramatic\nrelationship. I think they've seen that Ike and Tina Turner movie just\ntoo many times. Now I have to say to her...\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nDee, why do you put up with it? You could do so much\nbetter.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nAlright, sh, sh. Here he comes.\n\n\n\"Shoop\" Salt n'\nPepa\n\nMURRAY\n\n\nWoman, why don't you be answering any of my pages?\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nI hate when you call me Woman!\n\n\nMURRAY\n\n\nWhere you been all weekend? What's up? You been jeepin'\naround behind my back?\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nJeepin'?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nJeepin'.\n\n\n(Watch Cher closely. It's Classic!)\n\nMURRAY\n\n\nJeepin', jeepin'.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nNo, but speaking of vehicular sex, perhaps you can\nexplain to me how this cheap K-mart hair extension got into the back seat\nof your car.\n\n\nMURRAY\n\n\nI don't know where that came from. That looks like\none of your stringy something on others you got up here...\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nExcuse me. I do not wear polyester hair, OK. Unlike\nsome people I know, like Shawanna.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nDee, I'm outie.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nBye.\n\n\nMURRAY\n\n\nWhy do you gotta go there?\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nThat's it. I've had it with you.\n\n\nMURRAY\n\n\nIs it that time of the month again?\n\n\n(Croud Gasps)\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nI don't know why Dionne is going out with a high school\nboy. They're like dogs. You have to clean them and feed them and they're\njust like these nervous creatures that jump and slobber all over you.\n\n\n(Random guy puts his arm around\nCher)\n\nCHER \n\n\nOoo! Get off of me! Uh, AS IF!\n\n\nSCENE IV - CLASSROOM DEBATE\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nShould all oppressed people be allowed refuge in America?\nAmber will take the con position. Cher will be pro. Cher, two minutes.\n\n\nCHER \n\n\nSo, OK, like right now, for example, the Haitians\nneed to come to America. But some people are all \"What about the strain\non our resources?\" But it's like, when I had this garden party for\nmy father's birthday right? I said R.S.V.P. because it was a sit-down dinner.\nBut people came that like, did not R.S.V.P. so I was like, totally\nbuggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish\nin extra place settings, but by the end of the day it was like, the more\nthe merrier! And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange\nsome things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion,\nmay I please remind you that it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue of\nLiberty?\n\n\n(Class breaks into applause)\n\nCHER\n\n\nThank you very much.\n\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nUh, Amber? Replying?\n\n\nAMBER\n\n\nMr. Hall, how can I answer that? The topic is Haiti\nand she's talking about some little party.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nHello?! It was his fiftieth birthday!\n\n\nAMBER\n\n\nWhatever. If she doesn't do the assignment, I can't\ndo mine.\n\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nLadies. So, does anyone have any further thoughts\non Cher's oration? Elton? Comments?\n\n\nELTON\n\n\nYeah, I can't find my Cranberries CD. I've gotta do\nto the Quad before somebody snags it.\n\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nI'm afraid I can't permit that. Any further insights?\n\n\nTRAVIS\n\n\nI had an insight, Mr. Hall.\n\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nI'm all ears.\n\n\nTRAVIS\n\n\nOK, like, the way I feel about the Rolling Stones\nis the way my kids are going to feel about Nine Inch Nails, so I really\nshouldn't torment my Mom anymore, huh?\n\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nYes. Well, it's a little off the subject of Haiti,\nbut tolerance is always a good lesson, even when it comes out of nowhere.\n\n\nTRAVIS\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nAnd with that in mind, I'm going to distribute you\nreport cards. Now, is there a Christian Stobich in this class?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nMR. Hall? The buzz on Christian is that his parents\nhave joint \ncustody, so he'll be spending one semester in Chicago\nand one semester here. I think it is a travesty on the part of the legal\nprofession.\n\n\n(Look at Cher's face while speaking!\nAhhh, I can't take it anymore!)\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nThank you for that perspective Cher.\n\n\n(Mr. Hall hands out the report\ncards)\n\n\nNow could all conversations please come to a halt.\n\n\n(Travis jumps up to the window)\n\n\nAnd could the suicide attempts please be postponed\ntill the next period?\n\n\nTRAVIS\n\n\nMust die.\n\n\n(After Cher, the most classic\ncharacter in the movie)\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nSuddenly, a dark cloud settled over first period.\nI got a C in debate?!\n\n\nSCENE V - SCHOOL HALLWAY\n\nCHER (on phone)\n\n\nDee?\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nWassup?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nDid you get your report card?\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nYeah, I'm toast. How'd you do?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nI totally choked. My father is going to go ballistic\non me.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nMr. Hall was way harsh!\n\n\n(Cher and Dionne meet up in\nthe hall)\n\n\nHe gave me a C minus.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nWell, he gave me a C, which drags down my entire average.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nBye.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nI'll call ya, OK?\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nSCENE VI - CHER'S HOUSE\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nIsn't my house classic? The columns date all the way\nback to 1972. Wasn't my Mom a betty? She died when I was just a baby. A\nfluke accident during a routine liposuction. I don't remember her, but\nI like to pretend she still watches over me.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nHey, Ma. 98 in geometry. Pretty groovy, huh?\n\n\n\"Fake Plastic Trees\n(Acoustic Version)\" Radiohead\n\nCHER V.O. \n\n\nYuk! Uh, the maudlin music of the University station.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nWaa, waa, waa.\n\n\n(Cher enters the kitchen)\n\n\nYuh, what is it about college and cry-baby music?\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nHey, who's watching the Galleria?\n\n\nCHER \n\n\nSo, the flannel shirt deal. Is that a nod to the crispy\nSeattle weather, or are you just trying to stay warm in front of the refrigerator?\n\n\nJOSH (grabs Cher's tummy)\n\n\nOo, wow. You're filling out there.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nWow. Your face is catching up with your mouth.\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nI went by Dad's office.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nHe is not your Dad. Why don't you torture a new family.\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nHey, just because my mother marries someone else,\ndoesn't mean he's my father.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nActually, Kato, that's exactly what it means.\n\n\n(They enter the Lounge)\n\n\nI hope you're not thinking of staying here.\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nI sure want to.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nI'm sure you do.\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nI've got a place in Westwood, near School.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nShouldn't you go to school on the East Coast? I hear\ngirls at N.Y.U. aren't at all particular.\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nHahaha, you're funny.\n\n\n(Josh changes the channel from\nBeavis and Butthead to the News)\n\nCHER\n\n\nHey! God, you just got here and already you're playing\ncouch Commando!\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nHey! In some parts of the Universe, maybe not in Contempo\nCasual, but in some parts, it's considered cool to know what's going on\nin the world.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nThank you, Josh. I so need lessons from you on how\nto be cool. Tell me that part about Kenny G again?\n\n\nMEL (From Dining Room)\n\n\nC'mon you chuckleheads, get in here!\n\n\n(They move to the Dining Room)\n\n\nJosh, are you still growing? You look taller than\nyou did at Easter.\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nI don't think so.\n\n\nMEL (to Cher)\n\n\nDoesn't he look bigger?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nHis head does.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nSo, Josh, have you given any thought to our little\ndiscussion about Corporate Law?\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nYeah, you know, but I think I'd really like to check\nout Environmental Law.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nWhat for? Do you want to have a miserable, frustrating\nlife?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nOh, Josh will have that no matter what he does.\n\n\nMEL \n\n\nAt least he knows what he's doing. And he's in good\ncollege. I'd like to see you have a little bit of direction.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nI have direction.\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nYeah, towards the mall.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nWhich reminds me, where's your report card?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nIt's not ready yet.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nWhat do you mean, \"it's not ready yet?\"\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nWell, some teachers are trying to low-ball me, Daddy.\nAnd I know how you say, \"Never accept a first offer\", so I figure\nthese grades are just a jumping off point to start negotiations.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nVery good.\n\n\n(One of the mobile phones rings,\neveryone answers their phone)\n\nCHER\n\n\nDee?\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nYeah?\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nHello? Yeah, Jake, what? NO! Not the afternoon.\n\n\n(Cher and Josh put their phones\ndown)\n\nCHER\n\n\nYou are such a brown-noser.\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nOh, and you are such a superficial space-cadet. What\nmakes you think you can get teachers to change your grades?\n\n\nMEL (in background)\n\n\nI told you I wanted it in the morning! Doesn't he\nunderstand? In the morning.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nOnly the fact that I've done it every other semester.\n\n\nSCENE VII - VARIOUS SCHOOL LOCALES\n\n\"Shake some action\"\nCracker\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nI told my P.E. teaher an evil male had broken my heart,\nso she raised my C to a B.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nI'm so miserable. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't\nstudy.\n\n\nMISS STOEGER\n\n\nThey're slime, they're slime, I mean they're horrible,\ndon't feel bad, don't feel bad, I know, and you see they're all like this.\n\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nThen I promised Miss Giest I'd start a letter writing\ncampaign to my congressman about violations of the clean air act.\n\n\n\nBut Mr. Hall was totally rigid. He said my debates\nwere unresearched, unstructured, and unconvincing, AS IF!\n\n\n\nI felt impotent and out of control, which I really\nhate. I needed to find sanctuary in a place where I could gather my thoughts\nand regain my strength.\n\n\nSCENE VIII - THE MALL\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nDude, what's wrong? Are you suffering from buyer's\nremorse or something?\n\n\n(Watch Cher flick her head)\n\nCHER\n\n\nGod, no! Nothing like that. It's just that, we've\nbeen shopping all day and I still don't know what to do about Mr. Hall.\nI have tried everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude, but\nI was brutally rebuffed.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nGet over it, OK. He's a miserable little man who wants\nto make everyone else miserable too.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nDee, that's it! We've got to figure out a way to make\nMr. Hall sublimely happy.\n\n\nSCENE IX - SCHOOL\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nHere's the four-one-one on Mr. Hall. He's single,\nhe's 47, and he earns minor duckets for a thankless job. What that man\nneeds is a good healthy boinkfest. Unfortunately, there was a major babe\ndrought in our school. The evil trolls from the math department were actually\nmarried,... oooh Snickers... and in the grand tradition of P.E. teachers,\nMs. Stoeger seemed to be same-sex oriented. Of course, there was always\nMiss Giest. Something told me not to discount Miss Giest. Well sure, she\nhas runs in her stockings, and her slip is always showing, and she always\nhas more lipstick on her teeth than her mouth. God, this woman is screaming\nfor a make-over. I'm her only hope.\n\n\n(Cher is writing a note outside\nMiss Giest's pidgeon hole)\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May but thy\neternal summer shall not fade. Phat! Did you write that?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nDuh, it's like a famous quote.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nFrom where?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nCliff's notes.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nOh.\n\n\n(Travis and Miss Giest walk\nout of her office toward where Cher and Dionne have split the scene)\n\nMISS GIEST\n\n\nI know you're going to be better now. Now, you run\nalong and I'll see you third period and you will try to remember to bring\nyour textbook.\n\n\nTRAVIS\n\n\nUh, OK.\n\n\n(Miss Giest reads the note left\nby the girls and her face brightens)\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nOh, my God! She actually looked happy!\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nOooh, classic!\n\n\n(Scene changes to Mr. Hall's\nclassroom)\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nParoudasm Budapshawn, 16 tardies to work off.\n\n\n(Paroudasm mutters something\nin Farsi and his friends cheer)\n\n\nJanet Huon, no tardies.\n\n\nCLASSMATES\n\n\nKisser!\n\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nTravis Berkenstock, 38 tardies. By far the most tardies\nin the class. Congratulations.\n\n\n(The whole class cheers and\napplaudes. Travis approaches the podium)\n\nTRAVIS \n\n\nThis is so unexpected, I, uh, I didn't even have a\nspeech prepared. Uh, but I would like to say this: Tardiness is not something\nyou can do all on your own. Many, many people contributed to my tardiness.\nUh, I'd like to thank my parents for never giving me a ride to school,\nthe L.A. city bus driver for taking a chance on an unknown kid, and, uh,\nlast but not least, the wonderful crew at McDonalds for spending hours\nmaking those egg McMuffins, without which I might never be tardy.\n\n\nMR HALL \n\n\nWell, if Mr. Berkenstock has no political messages\nto include in his speech, I'll go on. Cher Horowitz, two tardies.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nI object! Do you recall the dates of these alleged\ntardies?\n\n\n(Cher in lawyer mode. Legendary!)\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nOne was last Monday!\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nMr. Hall, I was surfing the crimson wave, I had to\nhaul ass to the ladies'.\n\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nI assume your referring to women's troubles, and so\nI'll let that one slide.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nThank you, Mr. Hall. Miss Giest was right about you.\n\n\nMR HALL\n\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nWell, she said that you were the only one in this\nschool with any intelligence.\n\n\nSCENE X - CHER'S HOUSE\n\nMEL\n\n\nCher, get in here!\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nYes, Daddy?\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nWould you tell me what the hell this is?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nUm, a second notice for three outstanding tickets.\nI don't remember getting a first notice.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nThe ticket is the first notice. I didn't even know\nyou could get tickets without a licence.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nOh, sure you can. You can get tickets anytime.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nOh, is that so?\n\n\n(Cher nods)\n\n\nWell not around here you can't. From this moment on,\nyou will not drive, sit, do anything in that jeep without a supervised\ndriver present. And no cruisin' around with Dionne, alright? Two permits\ndo not equal a licence! Do I make myself clear?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nYes, Daddy.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nCher, I expect you to become a good driver. I want\nto see you apply yourself.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nI will. I'm gonna practise real hard.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nOK.\n\n\n(The scene moves to the poolside)\n\nCHER V.O. \n\n\nA licenced driver with nothing to do? Where would\nI find such a loser?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nHey, granola breath, you got something on your chin.\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nI'm growing a goatee.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nOh, that's good. You don't want to be the last one\nat the coffee house without chin pubes.\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nI can't tell you how much I enjoy these little chats\nof ours, but in the interest of saving time, why don't you just tell me\nwhat you want.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nOK. So, actually, I have a permit and I can drive\nand all, but Daddy says I can't take the jeep out without a licenced driver,\nand since your not doing anything and all, you know?\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nWhat are the chances of you shutting up until you\nget your way?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nHmmm, slim to none. C'mon!\n\n\nSCENE XI - CHER'S CAR\n\nJOSH\n\n\nHey, James Bond, in America we drive on the right\nside of the road.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nI am. You try driving in platforms.\n\n\nJOSH \n\n\nLook, I got to get back to school. Ah, you want to\npractise parking?\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nWhat's the point? Everywhere you go has valet. What\nclass you going to?\n\n\nJOSH\n\n\nActually, I'm going to a tree people meeting. Me might\nget Marky Mark to plant a celebrity tree.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nHow fabulous.

A night alone with Christian! I sent\nfor reinforcements. Then, Dee and I had to design a lighting concept, and\ncostume decisions. I don't rely on mirrors, so I always take polaroids.\nWhenever a boy comes, you should always have something baking.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nOh, I'm still all red.\n\n\nDIONNE\n\n\nWell, I'm trying to make you\nas white as I can, Cher. Look, you're all flushed. You have to calm down.\nOK? Calm.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nYou know, I am so glad I never\ndid it with someone I had lukewarm feelings for.

Relax, relax.\n\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nBoy, getting off the freeway\nmakes you realize how important love is. After that, Dionne's virginity\nwent from technical to non-exisistant. I realized how much I wanted a boyfriend\nof my own.\n\n\nSCENE XXX - THE MALL\n\nCHER V.O.\n\n\nNot that Christian wasn't a\nblast to hang out with.

You are the most beautiful girl in Beverly Hills. And\nto tell you the truth, I'm not sure I want you with a stupid fella like\nthat.\n\n\nCHER\n\n\nWell, actually he is a smart\nguy and, you know he's one of those do-gooder types, and now I feel like\nall my after-school commitments are just not good enough.\n\n\nMEL\n\n\nHow can you say that?

But what makes someone a better\nperson? And then I realised, all my friends were really good in different\nways. Like, Christian, he always wants things to be beautiful and interesting.\nOr Dionne and Murray, when they think no one is watching, are so considerate\nof each other. And poor Miss Giest, always trying to get us involved, no\nmatter how much we resist?\n\n\nMISS GIEST\n\n\nOh, it's just, that doesn't\neven show... you know, every single possesion, every memory, everything\nyou had your whole life... gone in a second.
