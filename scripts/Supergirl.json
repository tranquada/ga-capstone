SPACE\t\n\nTHE CAMERA PULLS BACK. . . \n\nINT. ARGO CITY\n\nAND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes.\n\nTHE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTEACHER\n\t\t\t\tAnd now, who can give me the electron \n\t\t\t\twave functions for Kryptonian covalent \n\t\t\t\tbonding?\n\nThe five year olds eagerly raise their hands. The teacher points to one.\n\nCHILD\n\t\t\t\tThe cube root of the wavelength over the \nnatural log of the integral of the speed of \nlight squared.\n\nThe teacher smiles.\n\nTEACHER\n\t\t\t\tWell, maybe that was a bit too easy...\n\nTHE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound: an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND. The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. .\n\nA small girl is watching him with fascination. Her name is Kara, and she is seven.\n\nBehind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside.\n\nKARA\nWhat are you making:\n\n\tZALTAR\nIt's going to be a tree, I think.\n\n\n\n\nKARA \nWhat's a tree?\n\n\tZALTAR\nIt's something they have on Earth. You know,\n where your cousin went.\n\n\tKARA \nWhere is Earth?\n\n\tZALTAR\nDidn't you study six-dimensional geometry in \nschool?\n\n\tKARA\nYes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in \nmy head.\n\nZaltar laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tEven I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in \nouter space. And we're in inner space. \n\n\tKARA\nI don't understand.\n\n\tZALTAR\nWait till you're older. Here -- watch this. \n\nZaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR.\n\t\t\t\tThis is one of the four Power Sources of the City. \nI borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I \ncan do with it. \n\nZaltar touches his MATTER.WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the \nsculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. Kara claps her hands with delight \nat the spectacle. Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. He carefully puts down the\nOMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks.\n\n\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\tYou see, a tree is a living thing.\n\n\t\t\t\tKARA\n\t\t\tCan you create life?\n\n\t\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tNo, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of \nhalf-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real \nthing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays \nover the surface. . . \n\nA woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance.\n\nWOMAN'S VOICE \nKara. Kara.\n\nKara calls out in reply.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKARA \nI'm here, mother.\n\nKara's mother ALURA appears through the lacey architecture of the city.\n\nALURA\n\t\t\t\tKara, you shouldn't be so near the Edge \nwithout a grown-up.\n\n\tKARA\nI'm sorry, Mother.\n\n\tZALTAR\nI was keeping an eye on her.\n\n\nAlura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately, showing she's not really angry. Together they watch Zaltar's latest sculpture, flickering with the play of inner light and shadow.\n\nALURA\n\t\t\t\tThank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the rules.\n\nZaltar takes another swig from his flask. and lowers his voice confidentially.\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tYou and your husband have been kind to me, \nAlura. I have something to tell you: I'm going \naway. Soon.\n\n\tALURA \nBut where?\n\n\nZaltar bends down to Kara and hands her his matterwand.\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tPut your fingers there, Kara. And press hard.\n\nShe does, and the wand makes a horrible squawk. Kara laughs with delight.\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tGood. Now, go make something pretty.\n\nKara scampers away, hardly able to believe her good fortune, and starts to make all kinds of \nsurprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby. Zaltar speaks to Alura in a low, confidential voice.\n\nZALTAR\nI've discovered a new way into the Phantom \nZone.\n\n\tALURA\nBut the phantom Zone is for criminals.\n\n\tZALTAR\nIt's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself \nto  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm \nstarting to repeat myself here with this airy, \nglittery stuff....\n\nZaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him.\n\nALURA\n\t\t\t\tBut Zaltar---you founded the city! It's yours. We \nwere all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered \nus together and brought us here, to the inner dimension. \nYou can't abandon us now. You have a responsibility to us!\n\nIn the background, Kara has been modeling a spiky insect-like CREATURE. Now she suddenly finds the OMEGAHEDRON on the ground beside her. She doesn't stop to wonder how it got there from beside Zaltar's feet. She simply picks up the OMEGAHEDRON and touches it to the spiky creature. The creature suddenly flicks its wings and COMES TO LIFE, unnoticed by the adults. Kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head, glittering as if it were made of diamonds.\n\nZALTAR\nI'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other \npeople come second.\n\n\tALURA\nHow can you create beauty...with a selfish heart?\nThe spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.\n\nThe spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it. With a giant WHOOSH all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole. Kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind. She cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother. THE OMEGAHEDRON is swept toward the hole as well. Kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane.\n\nZALTAR \nKara---the Power Source!\n\nKara reaches for it, but it is too far from her, and the OMEGAHEDRON is sucked out into infinity by the wind. Zaltar picks up the matterwand from where Kara dropped it and touches her with the wand. She is instantly held fast. Zaltar pulls her back inside. He gives her to her mother Alura. Then Zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir. \n\nThe wind dies down and all is silent, except for the quiet sobbing of Kara in her mother's arms. Zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair  tenderly.\n\nKARA\n\t\t\t\tI'm sorry... I didn't know.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tIt was my fault. You aren't old enough to use \nthe wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.\n\n\tALURA\nBut the Power Source, Zaltar.\n\n\tZALTAR\nIt couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do \nwith three.\n\n\tALURA\nBut what will happen?\n\n\tZALTAR \nThe Guardians will be angry. They may even \nsend me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't \nreally have permission to borrow it. I must go \nexplain to them...\n\nZaltar hurries off nervously. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON KARA'S FACE as she senses this may be her last sight of Zaltar.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\nEXT. A SPRINGTIME MEADOW - U.S.A. - DAY. UNDER TITLES\n\nA beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers. Butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower. The blonde's name is SELENA. She is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady.\n\nHer current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road. Selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak. and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth..\n\nSELENA \nOver here George. It's the perfect spot. Nice view.\n\nGeorge sets down the wicker basket and Selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food. She unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\t\t\tYou sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks \ntoo pretty to eat.\n\n\tSELENA\nBetter eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's \nall covered with ants.\n\nShe hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\t\t\tSelena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled \ndown---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle\ndown with than you.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tWhy George, are you proposing?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGEORGE\nMarry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring \nin much now, but...\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tGeorge---I thought you'd never ask.\n\nA shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake.\n\nGEORGE\n\t\t\t\tWhat the heck is that?\n\nThey look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth.\n\nSELENA\nA squirrel Frisbee?\n\nSelena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON. It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter.\n\nSelena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. Her face takes on a new expression. Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tThat's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is, \nbut I've never seen it before.\n\nShe stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck.\n\nGEORGE\n\t\t\t\tHey, where you going?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\t     (calling over her shoulder) \nI've got things to do.\n\n\tGEORGE \nWhat about my proposal?\n\n\tSELENA \n         (dismissively) \nCall me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.\n\nShe gets in the pickup and. drives away.\n\nGEORGE \nHey! My truck!\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n KARA' S FACE\n\nShe is ten years older now, a young lady. Almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen.\n\nALURA\n\t\t\t\t      (voice over)\n\t\t\t\tBut Kara, you are too young to go.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED\n\nThey are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her.\n\nKARA\n\t\t\t\tI am almost an adult. This is what I want.\n\nZOR-EL\n\t\t\t\tBut Kara, no one has ever gone from here to \nEarth. The journey is dangerous.\n\n\tKARA\nIt was my fault we lost the Power Source.\n\n\tZOR-EL\nYears ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.\n\n\tKARA\nI allowed it to escape the City.\n\n\tALURA\nEver since we told you how your cousin Superman \nwas sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do \nwas visit this place.\n\n\tKARA\nYes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our \nscanning shows the Power Source has finally \nreached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless \nsomeone brings it back.\n\n\tZOR-EL \nSuperman will return it.\n\n\tKARA\nWhy haven't you been able to contact him? He should \nhave returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He \nmay be dead.\nZOR-EL\nBut what can you, a mere girl-\n\n\tKARA\nI'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait. \nOur lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a \nchild the City was bright and shining. Look at it now.\n\nZor-El and Alura sigh. There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALURA\n\t\t\t\tWhat do your teachers think?\n\nZor-El looks around the circle. A beautiful woman speaks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTEACHER\n\t\t\t\tIt would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones \nto the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much \nlonger without the Power Source. It is her future she's \nfighting for, Zor-El.\n\n\tZOR-EL\nVery well, let it be done.\n\nAlura embraces Kara emotionally, fighting back the tears. Kara too is struggling to control her own emotions.\n\nKARA\n\t\t\t\tDon't worry, Mother, I'll be all right. I've studied \nthe transmissions from Earth. I know their customs.\n\nKara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents.\n\nALURA\n\t\t\t\tBut they are such strange, unstable people.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKARA\n\t\t\t\tThen I will learn to act strange like them.\n\nKara holds up a small handbag. Inside we glimpse red and blue material.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKARA\n\t\t\t\tI have made clothing and copies of their money, I \nwill be fine.\n\n\n\n\nHer father puts his hand on her shoulder .\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZOR-EL\n\t\t\t\tBe brave, my .daughter. Be wise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKARA\n\t\t\t\tAs brave as my father. As wise.\n\nThey embrace, briefly. Kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city.\n\n Instantly transparent bubble forms around her.\n\nHer parents watch as she floats away.\n\nShe passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the City, and off into an infinity of space.\n\nMONTAGE: THE JOURNEY OF KARA INSIDE \"HER SPHERE FROM THE INNER DIMENSION TO OUR WORLD.\n\nHer sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo. The atmosphere thickens around her. Soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above. A fish darts past with a flash of silver. The sphere rushes upward faster and faster. It breaks the surface of the , water. Kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears. She is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin Superman.\n\nShe lands on a nearby beach.\n \nEXT. EARTH.  BEACH BESIDE THE SEA. SUNRISE\n\nShe looks around her, feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world.\n\nKara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet. To her astonishment, she \ncrushes it to powder in her hand, and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath.\n\nShe looks down at her feet, so firmly planted on the ground. She rises a few inches into the air, and reacts with amazement. Then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing. With a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward.\n\nEXT. HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH.  DAY\n\nKara loops and rolls, swoops and circles, laughing with sheer delight.\n\n\n\n\n\nEXT. HIGH ABOVE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS.  HORSES.  DAY\n\nKara swoops down at a herd of horses. The herd parts and gallops off in all directions as she pulls out of her dive and flies away.\n\nCUT TO:\n EXT. MOUNTAINTOP.  DAY\n\nKara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view. The she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow. She stares at it with awe.\n\nINSERT. MICROSCOPIC SHOT OF SNOW CRYSTALS IN ALL THEIR INFINITE VARIETY AND BEAUTY.\n\nBACK TO SCENE.  DAY\n\nKara stands up, smiling. She flies into the air again.\n\nEXT. FOREST.  DAY\n\nShe lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest. Shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom. These trees are much more impressive than Zaltar's imitation back in Argo City. She hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles. She sees a BABY DEER hopelessly tangled in the long canes. She shoots RAYS OF HEAT VISION from her eyes and slices through the tough stems. The fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest. Kara watches it with a benevolent smile. She removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape.\n\nEXT. MANSION --- GARDEN PARTY\n\nA big impressive house somewhere in the Middle West. People mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from. passing waiters. All the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference.\n\nSELENA, the blonde who discovered the Power Source, is circulating among the quests. She has changed since we saw her last. No longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels. She walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests. A smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention. But we notice odd details of the party: the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols. At the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot WICKER SCULPTURE OF A FEMALE GOAT covered with paper flowers. And the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them. BIANCA, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in Selena's ear .\n\nBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tBe careful. Nigel is going to try something.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tDon't worry about old Nigel, I can take care of him. \nHe's just a sore loser.\n\nAn ELDERLY MAN in a three-piece pin-stripe suit grabs her elbow.\n\nELDERLY MAN\n\t\t\t\tI don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.\n\nSELENA \nWhat do you want?\n\n\tELDERLY MAN \nWestern Europe.\n\n\tSELENA\nI'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could \nhave Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.\n\n\tELDERLY MAN\nNo problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.\n\nSelena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette.\n\nSELENA \nCheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.\n\nNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tIt may well be. I know how you won that election \nSelena. You can't fool me.\n\n\tSELENA\nI have plans Nigel. You could come with me...\nI'm going places.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tYou're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville.\nYou're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all \nthese people have served years and years of apprenticeship.\nSome of their families have been in the Craft for generations. \nYou can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.\n\nSelena smirks at him, self-confidently.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI just did. Because I have the Power.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tYou're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow \nis tricky. Use it too much and it takes over. \n\nNigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case.\n\nSELENA\nBianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as \nlong as I don't go too far. \n\n\tNIGEL\nCigarette?\n\nHe holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection.\n\nINSERT. SURFACE OF THE CIGARETTE CASE. Selena's reflection. She is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her...invisible to ordinary eyes...is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS.\n\nBACK TO SCENE.\n\nQuick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tSorry. Forgot you were trying to quit.\n\n\nNigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tNigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering \nback.\nNigel shakes his head.\n\nNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tYou need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save \nyou from a terrible fate.\n\n\tSELENA\nI need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now \nburn rubber.\n\nNigel locks eyes with her.\n\nNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tMake me.\n\nHe takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass.\n\nNigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. Everyone laughs at him.\n\n\nNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tBalefire on you, Selena!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\t    (grinning)\n\t\t\t\tYou Scorpios can never take a joke.\n\nAll quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tYou think you are on top now. Well there is someone \ncoming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.\n\n\tSELENA \nThrow him out.\n\nTwo burly waiters seize Nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking.\n\nNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tYou won't last a year, Selena. The cards don't lie!\n\nThe crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation. \n\nBianca stands up on a chair. The crowd falls silent.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tLet's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. I give you \nthe first woman in eight hundred years to head \nthe Circle: Selena!\n\nApplause. Selena steps up onto a raised dais. And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tThank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a \ngreat honor you have given me, and I will try to be\nworthy. And when my secret plans are revealed --\nyou will learn that we are on the threshold of \npower and influence undreamed of when Nigel was \nour leader.\n\nMore applause. One of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel-pot under a chafing dish. The fuel-pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tAnd now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit \nof Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the \ncoming year...\n\nA woman in the .audience screams. Everyone looks where, she is pointing. The huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames.\n\nPanic and pandemonium. Some of the quests run for safety. Others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain. Selena frowns at the spectacle, and, without a word, turns and stalks into her house.\n\nINT. SELENA'S HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM\n\nTHE CAMERA FOLLOWS Selena through the French doors and into her large living room. On one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed MIRROR, covered with a thick veil.\n\nSelena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor. She reaches inside and removes a finely wrought METAL BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A GARGOYLE and a pack of cards. She puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns.\n\nThe Elderly Man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden. Outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard. Someone runs by in the b.g. with a coil of garden hose. The Elderly Man walks over to Selena, timidly.\n\nELDERLY MAN \nIs this Nigel's doing?\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tIt's a warning, that's for sure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tELDERLY MAN\n\t\t\t\tMaybe it was just an accident.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\t     (mysteriously)\n\t\t\t\tThere's no such thing as an accident. Everything has \nmeaning, if you can read the signs.\n\nThe elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards Selena has cast on the floor.\n\nELDERLY MAN\n\t\t\t\tThen what does it mean???\n\n\n\n\nSelena shrugs and puts aside her cards.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tDon't ask me. I can't read the signs worth spit.\n\nEXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DAY\n\n A bus stops in front of the school. Kara, disguised in a brunette wig and unfashionable clothing gets out of the bus. (From now on we shall refer to her in human guise by the name of her secret identity LINDA LEE.) Linda walks up the driveway toward the main building. Around her the campus is full of girls all in the school uniform of skirt, blazer, and white knee socks. Many of them stare frankly at the new girl in the slightly dowdy dress, carrying a battered old suitcase.\n\nIn front of the school, LUCY LANE, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game. She swings and hits one over the fence for a homer. Linda watches the excited, deliriously happy girls---wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions. Linda walks up the steps to the main building.\n\nINT. MAIN BUILDING. MIDVALE SCHOOL. STAIRWAY\n\nLinda walks up the long stairway in the entrance hall.\n\nMYRA, the school bully, passes with her spy and toady the loathsome MUFFY. As they pass MYRA speaks in a loud voice.\n\nMYRA\n\t\t\t\tGeeze, another barfy new student. They're really \nscraping the bottom of the barrel these days.\n\nLinda walks on up to the next f1oor.\n\nINT. MAIN BUILDING . MIDVALE SCHOOL. HALL\n\nLinda walks along the deserted hall and stops at the office of the registrar, MR. Danvers. She enters.\n\nINT. REGISTRAR'S OFFICE\n\nMR. Danvers turns from his desk and glares at her.\n\n MR. DANVERS\n\t\t\t\tDon't you believe in knocking?\n\nLINDA\nOh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.\n\nShe knocks on the open door. Her manner is so open and guileless that MR.

STREET OPPOSITE H]1..MBUP.GER RESTAURANT. NIGHT\n\nThere is a construction site next to the Hamburger Place.  A giant BULLDOZER suddenly ROARS TO LIFE and bursts through the chain link fence surrounding the construction site. With no one at the controls, the bulldozer drives out onto the street. Ethan sees its GAPING JAWS and runs clumsily away. They snap at him with the clash of steel. He stumbles and the bulldozer scoops him up. It wheels around and starts to carry him away, with one of his legs protruding through the teeth of its giant mouth. The onlookers are stunned and horrified.\n\nLUCY\n\t\t\t\tOmigod, it's a runaway!\n\nLucy sprints out into the street, running after the driverless bulldozer.\n\nLINDA \nLucy; come back!\n\n\tLUCY\nSomebody's gotta do something!!\n\nLucy dodges through the cars and alongside the bulldozer. She climbs bravely up into the driver's seat and tries to tug at the controls. They are frozen. In desperation Lucy yanks on the steering wheel. The bulldozer turns ninety degrees into the gas station.\n\nEXT. GAS STATION. NIGHT\n\nA TOURIST is filling his station wagon at one of the self-service pumps. His WIFE is bringing their TODDLER back from the rest rooms. The bulldozer suddenly smashes into the gas pumps and through the gas station. The tourist dives out of its path. The bulldozer circles behind the gas station toward a small motel next door, leaving in its wake a totaled station wagon, and gasoline leaking on the ground from the smashed pumps.\n\nEXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT\n\nLinda watches with mounting horror. And yet she remembers the warning from Alura, and stands frozen, unable to intervene.\n\nEXT. MOTEL/GAS STATION. NIGHT\n\nLucy fights the wheel in vain. The bulldozer circles through the motel, smashing the individual cabins into matchsticks. The bulldozer drives under the MOTEL SIGN which HITS LUCY ON THE HEAD, KNOCKING HER UNCONSCIOUS. Finally, the bulldozer comes full circle and halts against a utility pole next to the gas station. The utility pole leans at a crazy angle. Its ELECTRIC WIRES break and dangle down, flashing blue arcs of electricity where they touch the pavement. The RIVER OF GASOLINE from the broken pump flows inexorably toward the arcing power lines. The mother kneels beside her dazed husband and looks over at her toddler running toward the arcing wires, his arms held out eagerly.\n\nMOTHER\nMy baby!!!!!\n\nInstead of helping, the onlookers turn and flee the inevitable fire.\n\nEXT. HAMBURGER RESTAURANT. NIGHT\n\nLinda can't take it any longer. She ducks into the deserted hamburger restaurant. An instant later, she emerges through a skylight in the roof in red and blue costume as SUPERGIRL! She stands on-the roof in front of a big illuminated advertising sign, which hides her from the fleeing crowd. Supergirl takes a deep breath and blows with her super lungs:. The toddler is blown safely 1nto his mother's arms.\n\nMOTHER\n\t\t\t\tMy baby.\n\nShe grasps the child in her arms and helps her husband hobble to safety just as the river of gasoline reaches the sparking wires and BURSTS INTO FLAMES .\n\nThe bulldozer, with Lucy Lane unconscious at the controls and Ethan imprisoned in the scoop, is surrounded by an IMPENETRABLE RING OF FIRE . \n\n\n\nSupergirl dashes through the ring of fire so fast that if there were any spectators who weren't running for their lives she would only be visible as a red and blue streak.\n\nEXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. NIGHT INSIDE THE RING OF FIRE.\n\nSupergirl takes the unconscious Lucy from the driver's seat and carries her in her arms to the front of the bulldozer.\n\nSupergirl pulls open the massive metal jaws with one hand like they were sheet rubber.\n\nINT. SCOOP OF BULLDOZER\n\nEthan looks up as Supergirl slides Lucy Lane in beside him. He sees Supergirl's face backlit by the raging inferno outside.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tEverything's going to be all right. She's just \nunconscious. No broken bones.\n\nINSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V. LOOKING AT SUPERGIRL FROM INSIDE THE SCOOP\n\nEthan's swirling distorted vision suddenly focuses with , absolute clarity. A moment outside of time. The most romantic glamorous image imaginable: the blonde, backlit, looking at him with concern, her lips slightly parted.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThere is something about Ethan's ecstasy, which holds Supergirl for a moment.\n\nETHAN \nGod...you're beautiful.\n\nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM\n\nSelena watches the image of Ethan and Supergirl in her mirror. Her face is a study in jealousy and dismay.\n\n\nETHAN (in the mirror) \nGod...you're beautiful.\n\n\tSELENA\nThat was meant for me!\n\nEXT. ACCIDENT SCENE/GAS STATION. BULLDOZER.

Immediately afterwards, the flames reach the underground storage tank and the bulldozer is enveloped in a FIERY EXPLOSION.\n\nEXT. ACCIDENT SCENE. OUTSIDE RING OF FIRE. NIGHT\n\nThe entire gas station is a column of flame and black smoke reaching up into the night sky. A fire truck and a police car arrive on the scene, sirens screaming. The tourist family watch from a safe distance, their toddler clapping his hands excitedly at the spectacle.\n\nEXT. IN THE SKY. HIGH ABOVE THE ACCIDENT. NIGHT\n\nSupergirl flies out of the column of black smoke, carrying the sealed bulldozer scoop with Ethan and Lucy safely inside.\n\nETHAN \n       (calling from inside) \nWhat's happening?\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\n        (shouting over the wind) \nI'm taking you to the hospital.\n\n\tETHAN\n           (within)\nLet me out.

What is the danger?\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tIt's what we were warned about.\n\nSelena points to the mirror, which shows the IMAGE OF SUPERGIRL FLYING THROUGH THE AIR CARRYING THE BULLDOZER SCOOP. Bianca can't quite make out what it is at first.\n\nBIANCA \nA Storm Dragon?\n\n\tSELENA \nNo, a super girl.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE.

I love her, don't you understand? I'll die \nif I can't have her.\n\nThe intern pulls away and points to Lucy, who is beginning to come to.\n\nFIRST INTERN \nShe's right here fella.\n\n\tETHAN\nNo, not her. The blonde, the one who carried us \nthrough the air:. She can fly. She's an angel.\n\nThe two interns exchange a glance. One of them steps to a wall intercom.\n\nSECOND INTERN\n\t\t\t\tThis is Stenzl in Emergency. We got\n\t\t\t\ta 412. Send down the boys from psycho.\n\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tNo! She's real !

Selena covers the mirror with its heavy veil. She speaks to Bianca standing beside her.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tWhy did she have to show up now?\n\nBIANCA \nEliminate her.\n\n\tSELENA\nThat's easy for you to say, Bianca.\n\n\tBIANCA\nYou can do it. You're the most powerful woman \non Earth.\n\nSELENA \nAm I? Still?\n\nThere is a pause as the implications reverberate.\n\nBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tYes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can \nwithstand its power.\n\nSELENA \nI've been saving it. For the right moment.\n\nBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tThat moment is now! What good is a sword unless \nit be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare \noppose you again. No one.\n\nSelena toys with the idea in her mind, turning over the various arguments. A smile creeps across her face.\n\nSELENA \nNot even Nigel.\n\nSelena goes to the secret compartment, opens it and takes out the metal gargoyle box. She looks at it with a dreamy, far-away expression on her face.\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tWhat do I do?  I don't know her name.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tThe Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate \non her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.\n\nSelena holds the gargoyle box out in front of her and opens the lid. Inside is the OMEGAHEDRON power source from Argo City, spinning around a strange dark region in its centre. Selena closes her eyes and whispers to the spinning ring.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tPower of Shadow hear me. Find her wherever she be. \nFind her and destroy her.\n\nA BLACK CLOUD OF SHADOW bursts out of the centre of the OMEGAHEDRON, filling the room. Selena drops the gargoyle box and shrinks back with sudden misgivings at what she has unleashed. Even Bianca's face has gone white. The two women huddle together as a HUGE INVISIBLE PRESENCE fills the room with darkness. Then the unseen presence suddenly SMASHES ITS WAY OUTSIDE THROUGH THE SOLID WALL OF SELENA'S LIVING ROOM, leaving a big hole and a trail of crushed furniture behind it. Light returns to the room as the shadow departs. And from outside the sound of crackling shrubbery dies away. Selena regains her composure and looks around at the mess of her once splendid living room.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tNext time, remind me to do this out in the yard.\n\nBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tYes, of course, it was foolish of me.\n\nBianca reaches down to the floor for the gargoyle box with the OMEGAHEDRON, which is still lying right where Selena dropped it. But Selena quickly picks it up herself before Bianca can touch it.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI think I'd better keep it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIANCA\nWhatever you say.\n\nSELENA \nYes. Whatever I say.  From now on.\n\nShe shuts the lid of the gargoyle box, sealing the spinning OMEGAHEDRON safely inside.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nINT. DANVERS ' LIVING ROOM. NIGHT\n\nMrs. Danvers is on the phone.\n\nMRS.

NIGHT\n\nLinda drives up in Lucy's car, the one left behind at the scene of the accident outside the hamburger place. She drives past the paddle tennis court and parks in front of the dorm. Linda gets out of the car, and lets herself into the dorm with a key. Inside, she signs her name in the book. ,\n\nINT. DORM CORRIDOR. NIGHT\n\nLinda walks down the long dormitory corridor past room after empty room. The place is kind of spooky.\n\nINT. LINDA'S ROOM. NIGHT\n\nLinda enters the room she shares with Lucy. She puts Lucy's car keys on her bedside table next to the snapshots of  Lucy's family and of her half-dozen current boyfriends. Linda turns and crosses the room to her own monastic bed in its drab, undecorated corner. She lies down on her bed with a sigh, staring at the ceiling in a melancholy mood.\n\nSuddenly, she senses that something is not right. She gets up from the bed, walks to the window, and gazes out a-t the deserted campus.\n\nEXT. OUTSIDE DORM. TENNIS COURT. NIGHT.\n\nThe dorm is set apart from other school buildings and surrounded by tall trees. The tennis court is visible from Linda's window, and a city park adjoining the school property. The UNSEEN MONSTER is heard approaching through the park with a thud of heavy footfalls and the crack of snapping tree trunks and branches. A bolt of lightning flashes, followed by a crash of thunder. The wind howls. A storm is brewing.\n\nFar away across the campus something huge and powerful forces itself between the two big oaks, snapping them like matchsticks. The unseen monster hauls its enormous bulk toward the dormitory, crushing everything in its path, its footsteps making the ground tremble like an earthquake.\n\n INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT\n\nLinda watches with uncomprehending eyes the approaching swath of destruction heading straight for her. Nothing she has learned about this strange alien world has prepared\" her for this. For the first time since she left Argo City, her eyes show fear. And yet there's a deeper streak of defiance in her that impels her to stand her ground and face the horrible juggernaut.\n\nEXT. FORM. TENNIS COURT. CAMPUS. NIGHT\n\nHUGE FOOTPRINTS sink into the damp grass of the campus. A bicycle rack full of Schwinns is flattened into the dirt with a metallic screech. The monster proceeds inexorably toward the wooden rain shelter on one side of the tennis court. The shelter is crushed to kindling wood. The monster drags its enormous unseen bulk across the smooth clay surface of the tennis court, crunching , deep cracked depressions in the clay. The net stretches and groans toward Linda as the' invisible enormity comes closer, and finally snaps with a loud twanging sound as the steel cables part. The tall cyclone fence bulges outward toward Linda and momentarily outlines the form of\" the monster before it crumples and falls with the screech of twisted steel. The only thing between Linda and the monster is Lucy.' s parked car. The monster stomps the car flat with a noise like colliding express trains and heads for Linda.\n\nINT. LINDA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT\n\nLINDA\n\t\t\t\tHey, that's my roommate's car!\n\nDetermination floods her face. She whips off her brunette wig and her civilian clothing to reveal the blonde hair and red blue tunic of SUPERGIRL!\n\nEXT. OUTSIDE THE DORM. NIGHT\n\nSupergirl flies out the dorm window and lands in front of the unseen monster. She raises her hand in challenge and calls out in a commanding voice.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tLeave this place and do no harm.\n\nSomething picks Supergirl up and flings her against the wall of the dorm, crushing the soft drink dispenser under her and squirting cola in every direction. Lightning flashes and thunder booms overhead. Supergirl picks herself up, shaken.\n\n\n\n\nShe launches herself directly at the space in mid-air ten feet above the monster's footprints. She crashes into something hard and invisible with the sound of a tremendous impact. Supergirl falls to the ground, staggered by the concussion. The irresistible force has met the immovable object. Supergirl looks up, and---altering the wavelength of her X-Ray vision to a transcendental frequency---paints this beam over the monster and just for an instant makes it visible: a HUGE NIGHTMARE SHAPE LOOMING OVER HER, AND REACHING OUT TO CRUSH HER WITH MASSIVE TALONS. Then the image fades.\n\nSupergirl is seized again and flung against the school flagpole, breaking it off at the base. Supergirl stands up and seizes the flagpole. She looks up at the flickering lightning in the sky. She flies straight upward into the storm with the bare flagpole held in front of her.\n\nEXT. THUNDER STORM. LIGHTNING\n\nAgain and again huge bolts of lightning strike the flagpole. Supergirl's face is contorted with agony as her body absorbs enough electricity to run Las Vegas for a year. She looks down and sees through a break in the clouds the campus far below.\n\nEXT. CAMPUS\n\nSuddenly Supergirl dives down from the sky, glowing with accumulated electricity. She embraces the monster with a tremendous crackle of energy. The two of them are bathed in brilliant arc light. The monster is briefly made visible again by the energy. But this time it is shrinking, shriveling up into a shapeless lump. The light fades as the energy is discharged. A dark, shapeless lump detaches itself from Supergirl's grasp and flies shrieking away into the night. Supergirl stands alone and exhausted, her muscles trembling with fatigue. \n\nShe turns and walks unsteadily back toward the dorm.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. CAMPUS. NIGHT\n\nMR. Danvers drives up the long driveway toward Linda's dorm. He parks his car behind the flattened remains of Lucy's car, and gets out, staring with amazement at the destruction wrought by the titanic struggle.\n\nHe walks toward the dorm, fear and confusion on his face.\n\nINT. DORM. ENTRY. NIGHT\n\nMr. Danvers pushes through the unlocked front door. He glances in the sign-out book for Linda's name. Then he knocks on the door labeled HOUSEMOTHER MRS. MCCLOSKEY. No reply.

He stands beside the bed for a long time looking down at her, and then walks out of the room, closing the door shut behind him.\n\nCUT T0:\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATE AFTERNOON\n\nSelena strides down the hospital corridor almost as if she is floating an inch above the floor. Her huge silk cape billows around her, making her seem larger-than-life. Nurses, orderlies, patients scatter to get out of her way. Her presence is so formidable and she moves so fast and inexorably that no one has a chance to stop her and inquire what she's doing there. She knows exactly where she's going to. She turns a corner, and steps inside an open door and closes it behind her.\n\nINT. ETHAN'S ROOM. DAY\n\nHe is sitting in bed, an ice bag on his head, drawing a picture of Supergirl on a piece of cardboard. He is in pajamas and robe.\n\nSelena steps beside the bed.

Visiting hours are over.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tThey're over for you sweetheart.\n\nSelena removes the gargoyle-shaped box from her sleeve and opens the lid. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins and sends out a powerful force, which slides the nurse backwards out the door and pins her to the wall of the corridor outside. The door slams shut. Selena closes the lid of the Coffer and turns to Ethan.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tNow you see who you're dealing with.\n\nEthan scrambles out of the bed and away from her, backing toward the window.\n\nETHAN \nLeave me alone.\n\nSelena, at the bed, discovers his sketch of Supergirl on the piece of cardboard.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tThis is your problem, right here. This girl's driving \nyou insane, Ethan. Let me help you.\n\n\tETHAN\nI don't want your help.\n\n\tSELENA\nCome back to my house. My car's outside.\n\nSelena reaches out a hand to Ethan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tNo!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no \ndifferent from the rest!\n\nThe door opens behind her and TWO SECURITY OFFICERS push  inside, with guns drawn.\n\n\nSECURITY OFFICER\n\t\t\t\tOkay, what's going on in h--\n\n\n\nSelena gestures with the gargoyle box at the men and their guns fly out of their hands and up to the ceiling. The men stare at the ce1ling, astonished. Ethan takes advantage of the distraction to dash out through the open door. Selena turns to look at Ethan escaping and the\nguns fall to the floor and discharge. The security men run into Ethan's bathroom, slamming the door behind them.\n\nSelena ducks out into the corridor.\n\nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR\n\nEthan is running away down the corridor. Frightened patients peek out of their rooms. The nurse who was ejected from the room cringes in fear as Selena emerges into the corridor.\n\nEthan dodges past two orderlies who are pushing a HEART-LUNG MACHINE down from the surgery. Selena raises the gargoyle box and points it at the HEART-LUNG MACHINE.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tPower of Shadow---seize him.\n\nThe HEART-LUNG MACHINE comes to life---its lights flash, its array of tubes tipped with needle probes writhe like Medusa's hair, its wheels turn around, and it chases  Ethan down the corridor. Selena laughs her deep throaty chuckle of triumph. Ethan looks behind, sees the machine chasing him and cries out with alarm. A CART OF SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS rolls out of a closet in front of him, its scalpels standing up and pointing at him, quivering eagerly, blocking his path.\n\nEthan dives through a swinging door to his left.\n\nINT. OPERATING THEATRE\n\nA team of surgeons and nurses are bent over a patient on the table. Ethan runs through in the background. The surgeons continue with their work. The heart-lung machine wheels through after him, followed by the scalpels flying through the air like a swarm of hornets.\n\nThe surgical team doesn't look up from their work.\n\nSeveral cylinders of anesthetic gas tear themselves loose from the wall and trundle away out of the room after Ethan and the other apparatus. One of the nurses finally looks up.\n\nNURSE\n\t\t\t\tDoctor, I think you' re going to have a gas \nproblem.\n\n\tDOCTOR\nI shouldn't have had the cabbage at lunch.\n\n\n\n\nINT. X-RAY ROOM\n\nEthan bursts into an empty surgical X-Ray room---the pursuing apparatus visible a few yards behind. He slams the heavy lead-lined door and bolts it shut.\n\nHe hears the thud of the apparatus beating impotently against the door. He leans against the door panting, his cotton hospital gown and robe soaked with cold sweat. Suddenly, with a whir of motors, the giant multi-armed C.A.T. SCANNER behind him comes to life, its lights glowing, and reaches out its chrome steel arms toward him.\n\nEthan yells, runs across the room, climbs on a gurney, rips a metal grill off the wall, and dives into the air conditioning duct.\n\nINT. DUCT\n\nEthan scrambles noisily along inside the metal duct as if all the fiends of hell were after him.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nINT. LUCY'S HOSPITAL ROOM\n\nLucy is showing off the controls of her bed. The door opens. Lucy, Jimmy and Linda look with amazement at what's outside in the corridor.\n\nLUCY\n\t\t\t\tOmigod.\n\nA DELIVERY BOY enters with A SPECTACULAR FLORAL ARRANGEMENT.\n\nDELIVERY BOY \nWhere you want this?\n\n\tLUCY\nOver by the window. It must be from my sister. Give him \na tip, Jimmy.\n\nJimmy is acutely aware how pathetic his daffodils look as he fumbles in his pocket for a dollar for the delivery boy. Suddenly overhead there is a loud banging and clattering from the air-conditioning duct. Everyone looks up at the ceiling with alarm. But Linda's X-RAY VISION lets her alone recognize Ethan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tGosh, what do you suppose .that is?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t\t\tWell, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to \nmeet you, Jimmy.\n\n\tLUCY\nYou're not gonna stay for the ice cream?\n\n\tLINDA\nI have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.\n\n\tLUCY\nAgain? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna \nbe a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.\n\nHer phone rings and she picks it up.\n\nLUCY\n\t\t\t\tPhillip! When are you gonna come see me?\n\nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR\n\nLinda walks out of Lucy's room and quickly down the corridor. Jimmy hurries to catch up with her.\n\nJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tCan I give you a lift?\n\nLINDA \nOh, no thanks.\n\n\tJIMMY\nIt's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.\n\nLinda's heart sinks as she realises she doesn't know how to get rid of him politely.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL SUNSET\n\nEthan batters the top off a ventilator and crawls out onto the roof. He turns and quickly replaces the aluminum top, bashing it firmly closed with his fist. He straightens up, sweat-soaked, bedraggled, haggard and exhausted, looking like an escaped lunatic with his disheveled hair and his torn hospital robe. He heaves a sigh of relief, and turns to see Selena standing behind him, her silk cape billowing in the breeze.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tGive up?\n\nEthan  takes a beat to make sure he's not hallucinating, then he summons new reserves of strength and runs over to the TALL BRICK SMOKESTACK from the hospital's incinerator.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tNever! \n\nHe starts to climb up the steel ladder on the side of the chimney.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tWhat goes up must come down.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. SUNSET\n\nJimmy opens the door of his car for Linda. It's parked in the ambulance zone, right behind \nSelena's Cadillac.\n\nJIMMY\nI probably would've got a ticket without this press pass \non the windshield. Does Clark get many tickets?\n\nLinda pauses, looking up at the sky.\n\nLINDA \n      (distractedly)\nI wouldn't know. Look. Up in the sky.\n\nJimmy follows the direction of her gaze.\n\nINSERT. THEIR P. O . V. OF THE ROOF\n\nEthan clings to the iron ladder on the side of the chimney, his robe fluttering in the wind.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nJIMMY \nAn escaped wacko! What a picture!\n\nJimmy opens the trunk of his car, takes out his camera bag, removes his Nikon, and starts fumbling around trying to change his 50mm lens for a telephoto. Linda watches Ethan with an expression of growing concern on her face.\n\nEXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL \n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tCome down from there, you foo1...\n\nEXT. LADDER ON.THE SIDE OF THE CHIMNEY\n\nAlthough she is forty feet below him, Ethan hears her voice as though it were inches away from his ear.\n\nSELENA\n      (continuing)\n...before you get blown off and kill yourself.\n\nEthan is so surprised at hearing her voice so close that he looks around with a start, misses his footing, and nearly falls off the ladder.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY.  JIMMY'S CAR\n\nJimmy gasps with anguish, as he struggles to mount his telephoto lens, dropping lens caps, film boxes, and filters all over the place.\n\nLINDA \nSomeone's chasing him.\n\n\tJIMMY\nSay---you think that's the same guy who was in the \naccident with Lucy?\n\nLINDA\n\t\t\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tThe scoop of the year!\n\nHe starts shooting film. His motor drive whirrs.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL ROOF\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tIt'll be dark soon. And cold. Come down while you've \ngot the chance.\n\nEXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY\n\nEthan reaches the top of the chimney. He climbs over the lip of the brickwork and stands up, half hidden in the thick white smoke belching from the chimney.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tNo. She'll come for me. Like she did the last time. \nMy angel. \n\nHe starts to cough from the smoke and nearly loses his balance.\n\nEXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tShe's not coming for you. I killed her. She's dead.\n\nEXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY\n\nEthan is staggered by this news. He reacts as though he had been punched in the gut.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tNo. I don't believe you. It's not true. She's alive \nsomewhere. My angel. My love--\n\n\nHe falls off the chimney, and catches himself on the lip of the brickwork. He hangs there by \none hand.\n\nSELENA'S VOICE \nYou idiot!\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. JIMMY'S CAR\n\nJimmy runs out of film. He frantically rips off the magazine and tries to load a fresh one, while Ethan dangles.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tThere goes my Pulitzer Prize.\n\nLinda steps around to the other side of his car. Bianca is staring up at the chimney from the driver's seat of the Cadillac. She doesn't see Linda lift up a sewer grating with her toe and drop noiselessly and suddenly out of sight into the storm drain below.\n\nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOSPITAL\n\nA red and blue streak bursts upwards out of another storm drain. The iron cover flips off and lands with a clang as Supergirl flies skyward toward the roof.\n\nEXT. TOP OF CHIMNEY\n\nEthan's grip fails and he falls.\n\nEXT. CHIMNEY. SKY\n\nSupergirl appears, snatches Ethan in mid-air, and flies off with him into the clouds above.\n\nEXT. ROOF OF HOSPITAL\n\nSelena reacts with relief---then, realizing who has saved him, her face clouds with resentment.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY\n\nJimmy Olsen's magazine pops open and film unspools out of his camera as his motor drive whirrs.\n\nJIMMY\nDarn!\n\nHe turns to Bianca, who is looking up in the sky from beside the Cadillac.\n\nJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tHey lady, did you see that?\n\nBianca gives him a glance of contempt.\n\nBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tSee what?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tThe girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in \nmid-air.\n\n\tBIANCA\nReally? Maybe you should check into the hospital and \nhave your head examined.\n\nEXT. HIGH IN THE AIR ABOVE THE HOSPITAL. SUNSET\n\nSupergirl carries Ethan beside her, her arm tight around his upper chest, his arm over her shoulders. They are above the clouds bathed in the rich warm glow of sunset. He looks at her ecstatically, his eyes drunk with love.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tYou're alive! She didn't kill you! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL \nWho didn't?\n\n\tETHAN\nThat woman who's after me. She hates you. Because \nshe knows I love you.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL \nYou love me?\n\n\tETHAN\nMy angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my \nlife. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking \nat you, holding you in my arms... \n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nWe have to have a long talk about all this.\n\n\tETHAN\nI know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.\n\n EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRY. TWILIGHT\n\nSelena comes striding out 'of the hospital, scowling. Jimmy Olsen notices her, and senses her \naura of power. He drops his useless Nikon into his camera bag and starts rummaging for another camera.\n\nBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tHome?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tNo way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a \n\t\t\t\tmonkey out of me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIANCA\n\t\t\t\t      (shrewdly)\n\t\t\t\tIs it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?\n\nSelena looks at Bianca with wounded dignity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit \nwhenever I want.\n\nShe gets in the back seat of the car, just as Jimmy Olsen snaps a photo of her with a Polaroid. Selena slams the car door and Bianca drives off. Jimmy examines the instant photo he just took. His eyes widen with wonder and the hair prickles on the back of his neck as he sees the image.\n\nINSERT: THE POLAROID IN JIMMY'S HAND. THE PICTURE OF SELENA ENTERING HER CAR, BUT BEHIND HER THERE IS A HIDEOUS LOOMING SHADOW---MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN NIGEL SHOWED IT TO HER.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT\n\nThe park is deserted, in darkness. One by one the lights come on, outlining a1l the structures in jewel-like, fairyland colours. It looks strangely familiar. On some deep level there is a resemblance to Argo City.\n\nTHE CAMERA PANS over to reveal Ethan standing beside the huge fairground switch boxes, turning on the lights. Supergirl stands beside him.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tThis is my favourite place in the city.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tAre you sure it's all right for us to be here?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tThey don't care, they're tearing it down for a \nshopping centre.\n\nHe flips the last switch, which starts the Ferris wheel revolving slowly, like a great spiral galaxy in space. Soft music plays.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tLike it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tYes. It reminds me of home.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\nWhere Superman's from? Krypton?\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nNo. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of \nKrypton once---but we moved it to inner space.\n\n\tETHAN\nI'm sorry, I don't understand.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nIt's not important. The important thing is I'm here to \nfind something and I think you can he1p me.\n\n\tETHAN\nCome on, let's ride.\n\nThey walk to the slowly revolving Ferris wheel and hop aboard one of the gondola cars.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI used to work here summers when I was a kid.\n\t\t\t\t\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tEthan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tLet's talk about us, not her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tTell me where I can find her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.\n\t\t\t\n\n\nEthan puts his arm around her shoulders, casually, no big deal.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tBut be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her \nshe'll try again. And maybe hurt you.\n\n\tETHAN\nI'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of \nour lives.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nWe can't do that.\n\n\tETHAN\nWhy not ?\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nWe're from different worlds.\n\n\tETHAN\nJust give me a chance to show how much I love \nyou. Love changes everything. Love makes \neverything possib1e.\n\nEXT. ENTRANCE TO AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT\n\nSelena gets out of her Cadillac and walks to the chained and locked gate. A big sign says KEEP OUT. CONDEMMED PROPERTY. FUTURE SITE OF FUNFAIR MALL SHOPPING PLAZA. She mutters something under her breath and the chains fall away, the locks click open, and the gate glides noiselessly ajar. Se1ena strides in imperiously.\n\nEXT. TOP OF FERRIS WHEEL\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tAll this talk about love, it's silly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tYou don't like me? You hate me?\n\nThere is such a look of tragedy on Ethan's face, that Supergirl is afraid he might instantly fling himself to his death if she said yes. \n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tOf Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tWhat do you feel about me?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tI...I don't know. This is all so sudden.\n\nTHE CAMERA RACKS FOCUS FOR A MOMENT TO DISCOVER :\n\nSelena, lurking.be1ow them in the shadows of the Spine Snapper Ride.\n\nETHAN \n\t\t\t\tThere's one sure way to find out how you feel.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nWhat's that?\n\n\tETHAN \nLet me kiss you.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tYou're not afraid are you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tOf course not, but...there are things we don't understand.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tIf we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead.\nCome on. You can learn more from one kiss than from \nyears in school.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nWell...I guess one is all right.\n\nShe closes her eyes, parts her lips, and leans forward.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nIs this how?\n\n\tETHAN\nTerrific.\n\nTheir lips meet. Zowie.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tWhat a touching scene!\n\nHer voice is like having a bucket of ice water dashed over you. Ethan and Supergirl pull apart. The Ferris wheel has carried them all the way around and back down again. Selena is standing beside them. Supergirl stands up and steps boldly out of the gondola to confront her.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tWho are you ?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both \nbe sorry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tI don't scare that easily.\n\nSelena rummages down deep in her handbag and pulls out the gargoyle box.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tAll right, Miss Know-it-all.

DODGEM CARS TENT\n\nHe falls through the tent and onto the electrified floor below. The wooden gondola shatters on impact. Ethan sits up, dazed by the fall, and sees a dodgem car painted like the face of a vicious football player heading toward him. Ethan scrambles away on his hands and knees. Another hideously painted car attacks him, and another, and another. He dodges and scuttles around desperately. Finally he manages to climb aboard one of the cars.\n\nEXT. AMUSEMENT PARK\n\nSupergirl reaches out to seize Selena. But Selena holds up the gargoyle box and is surrounded by an impenetrable, glowing shield of force. Supergirl tries to push through, the shield in vain.\n\nSupergirl flies to the little fence made out of steel spikes surrounding the Haunted House. At super speed she rips up the entire line of fence posts and hurls them like javelins at Selena.\n\n\n\nSelena dissolves her force field and tries to run away, ducking and dodging the rain of javelins. She turns too quickly and the GARGOYLE BOX slips out of her hand and rolls underneath the deck of the carousel. Selena moans with despair, and pauses, reluctant to leave without the box. This is the opportunity Supergirl needs. The fence posts bury themselves in the ground in a perfect circle around Selena---effectively imprisoning her.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tThat ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.\n\nSELENA \nA cheap trick.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL \nCheap but effective.\n\nINT. DODGEM CAR TENT\n\nEthan is holding on to his car desperately as all the other cars viciously ram into it. Suddenly his car is lifted up, carried through a hole in the tent roof, and off into the night sky.\n\nETHAN\nSupergirl'?\n\nHe looks under the car. There she is, carrying him to safety. She smiles reassuringly.\n\nEXT. AMUSEMENT PARK\n\nSelena is trapped inside the ring of posts, fumbling in her bag. One by one she takes out dried herbs, feathers, dusts, and flings them at the bars while she shouts magic word. Nothing works.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tYookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope. \nKa-ma-hoochie!\n\nBianca appears out of the shadows. Selena looks up, embarrassed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tSure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tShut up, and get me a hacksaw.\n\nBianca pauses uncertainly.\n\nBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tWhy don't you use the Coffer of Shadow?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n                  (evasively)\nI don't feel like it right now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tShe didn't take it from you, did she?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tThat little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.\n\nBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tThere's no need. I learned the Craft from my \t\t\t\t\t\tgrandmother.\n\nBianca takes out a bundle of twigs from her pocket and strokes the bars of the fence with it.\n\nBIANCA \nSycoraka f'kah s'koo...\n\nThe bars fall down like boiled spaghetti. Selena steps out of the circle of confinement with queenly dignity.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tGood. Now bring the car. We must call a meeting of \nthe seven.\n\nBianca bows.\n\nBIANCA \nYes, mistress.\n\nBianca hurries off toward the parking lot. Selena watches her until she turns the corner of the Haunted House. Then Selena kneels down and carefully reaches under the deck of the carousel for the GARGOYLE BOX.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tThere you are. Come to mama.\n\nShe takes out the box, s1ips it inside her cloak, and stands up. She casts a last glance around the scene of her defeat, and strides off after Bianca.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY\n\nSupergirl lands Ethan in his battered dodgem car on a beautiful, deserted tropical beach. Palm trees wave over a white sand beach. The blue ca1m of a lagoon mirrors huge white clouds that hang motipn1ess on the horizon like colossal snowy mountains. Gaily-coloured parrots screech in the branches of blooming hibiscus and jacaranda. Ethan gets out of his carnival ride and gazes around w1th awe at the beautiful scene.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tI thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN \nIt's paradise . We could be very happy here.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tBut I have to go back. I brought you here so \nyou'd be safe. From her.\n\n\tETHAN\nYou can't just abandon me.  Alone.\n\nHis words strike a sensitive nerve in her. She relents.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nI'll stay for a while.\n\nEthan is filled with enthusiasm.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tGreat! I'II build a house-- right over there, with \na veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a \ngarden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes---\nanything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, \nand we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---\n\n\tSUPERGIRL \nEthan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.\n\nEthan's face falls. He looks at her beseechingly.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tWell, maybe a little longer than that.\n\nShe smiles and takes his hand. Together they walk along the beach.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n\nEXT. SELENA'S MANSION. NIGHT \n\nRolls Royces, limos, and Maserattis parked in the driveway. It looks like a meeting of the ostentatious car club. A helicopter lands on the front lawn. The ELDERLY MAN from the garden party gets out and walks across the lawn toward the house with the aid of a cane. Behind him the helicopter takes off again. Selena opens her front door and confronts him angrily.\n\nSELENA \nYou're late.\n\n\tELD ERL Y MAN\nThe President was giving a speech. I couldn't just \nwalk out.\n\n\tSELENA\nYou're more afraid of the President than me???\n\n\tELDERLY MAN \nNo, of course not.\n\nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. CANDLELIT. NIGHT\n\nWaiting for her are an extraordinary group of people, all of whom we met or glimpsed briefly at the garden party. Bianca is talking to ERICA, a red-haired female dwarf. A proud, barefoot AMERICAN INDIAN WOMAN in fringed doeskin is talking to a muscular, young BLACK MAN in a cashmere suit with lots of gold and diamond jewelry. NIGEL is sulking in the bar, his face covered with tannisroot ointment.\n\nSelena enters with the Elderly Man in the banker pinstripe. They all form a circle in the centre of the room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tLet us begin. I invoke the rule of seven.\n\nOTHERS IN UNISON \nThe Circle is complete.\n\n\tNIGEL\nYou better have a pretty good explanation for \nthis, Selena.\n\n\tSELENA\nWe are in great danger. A being has come to Earth \nwith powers far beyond those of anyone member of \nthe Craft.\n\n\tINDIAN WOMAN\nBut Superman has been away.\n\n\tSELENA\nIt is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She \nknows we exist..\n\n\tELDERLY MAN\nThen she must be destroyed.\n\n\tNIGEL \nHow did she find out about us?\n\n\tELDERLY MAN\nThat is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will \nbecome curious and learn more. When she learns \nwe plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet \nand avenge the centuries of persecution---she will \ntry to stop us.\n\n\tBIANCA\nWe must destroy her first.\n\n\tERICA\nBut how can we destroy her?\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tBy the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must \nvolunteer  to take on the combined power of us all.\n\nNigel stands up and points an accusing finger at Selena.\n\nNIGEL\nYou! You want to take our power for yourself!\n\nSelena reacts calmly, speaking in low, modulated tones, as if to an overstimulated child.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tNige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate \nPower must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit.\n\nSelena takes hold of a golden chain hanging around her neck and draws out a little glass vial attached to it. Inside the glass vial a tiny spark glows brightly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t \t\t\t      (continuing)\n\t\t\t\tWhich of you is willing to make that sacrifice?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tYou would! You revealed our existence so you could \nhave all of our power.\n\n\tSELENA\nMaybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, \nNigel?\n\n\tNIGEL\nWhy get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer \nof Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.\n\n\tSELENA\nNonsense.\n\nNigel pulls aside the heavy veil covering her mirror.\n\nFOR AN INSTANT SELENA SEES HER REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR. BEHIND HER LOOMS THE DARK, EVIL PRESENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE OTHERS IN THE ROOM, AND MUCH LARGER THAN WHEN SHE GLIMPSED IT AT HER GARDEN PARTY.\n\nThen Bianca leaps to the mirror and pulls the veil back across it. Bianca stands challenging Nigel, daring him to try again. Selena looks at the gargoyle-shaped Coffer of Shadow, sitting beside her hearth. It too seems much larger than when we last saw it at the hospital. Selena wonders for a beat if maybe Nigel is right. Can the Shadow be ruling her?\n\nBIANCA \nEnough quibbling. Let us vote.\n\nThey all draw their sacred white-handled knives out of concealment in their clothing. Nigel defiantly places his on the floor with its blade pointing inward. Then one by one, the others put down their knives with the blades pointing outward. They all look at Nigel. His shoulders sag with dejection.\n\n \t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree?\n\nNigel speaks with the voice of someone pronouncing his own death sentence. \n\nNIGEL\nI have no choice.\n\nHis knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. Everyone joins hands in the circle. A fire springs to life on the hearth. Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon.\n\n\n\nThe house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow. Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer. She opens the lid. She pulls the glass vial off the golden chain \naround her neck and drops it into the Coffer.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. TROPICAL BEACH. DAY\n\nEthan wanders along the beach with Supergirl, holding hands. She stops to pick up a seashell. Ethan clutches his head as if he has a sudden violent headache, moans, and collapses on the sand. Supergirl kneels beside him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tEthan, what IS wrong?\n\nEthan opens his eyes and looks at her. He speaks in a voice of bleak despair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tShe said it wouldn't last.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tWhat wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?\n\nEthan sits up, wincing like someone with a bad hangover.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI don't love you any more.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nJust like that?\n\n\tETHAN\nLike turning off a light.\n\nHe struggles to his feet and stands there unsteadily.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI feel awful. All that romantic garbage. All that \nmushy talk.\n\nHe lurches off into the undergrowth, toward the interior of the island. She plunges into the vegetation keeping pace with him.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nWhere are you going?\n\n\nETHAN \nAway. From you. \n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nBut why?\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tBecause you remind me of all the dumb things I said.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tI sort of like what you said.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tThat makes it worse.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tBut I don't understand.\n\nHe stops and stares at her for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tOf course you don't. We're from two different \nworlds, remember?\n\nHe stalks off into the jungle, leaving her behind, hurt and bewildered.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM/PAGAN TEMPLE. NIGHT\n\nA barbaric ritual. Selena's companions sway and gyrate to the sound of gongs and drums. The floor is covered with a red mist. In the middle of a column of fire a figure like Selena seems to float. The ritual reaches its climax and everything pauses for a moment of sti11ness.\n\nSelena steps forth from the column of fire. She is clothed in a shimmering garment---white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence. The six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe. Selena seems to glow with an inner radiance. She laughs, and the pagan temple around her changes back to the living room of her house in Midvale. In her shining gossamer gown and her new aura of majesty, she seems too large, too powerful to be contained in the familiar surroundings of her house.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tAt last. Ultimate Power.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tAnd the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tWhat do you mean we?\n\nShe turns on the kneeling six. They cringe from her. Selena raises her hands and the kneeling six cry out in fear.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. BESIDE A STREAM. TROPICAL PARADISE. DAY\n\nEthan is sitting beside a stream on a gravelly bank idly tossing pebbles into the water. Supergirl steps out of the jungle and watches for a moment. Then she comes and sits down beside him.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tHi.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tHello. Are you still mad at me?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI'm not mad at you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tIt seemed that way to me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL \nMiss what?\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tWhat I had before. What's not there now. It's like I \nwoke up and found part of me wasn't there any more:\nsomething that made me feel really alive and aware of \nthings. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything \nfitted together perfectly---you and me and the world \naround us--like we were a wonderful song...\n\nHe falls silent, and tosses a few pebbles into the stream.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tAnd now?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tAnd now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words \ndon't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...\n\n\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nWell...I don It know much about these things, but maybe \nif you had that feeling once...it can, come back. \n\nHe turns to her hopefully.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN \nYou think so?\n\n\tSUPERGIRL \nI don't see why not.\n\n\tETHAN\nBut what if---it wasn't real? \n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tFeelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours \nforever.\n\nEthan's face lights up. The future begins to exist for him again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tHey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we \ncould get together every now and then and see each \nother. And maybe something might. happen again. \nWhat do you think?\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nAre you asking me for a \"date\"?\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tWhy not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm---\navailable.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nAren't you forgetting about Selena?\n\n\tETHAN\nShe'll forget about us eventually.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM\n\nIn the polished surface of her mirror, Selena makes a scene appear: Ethan and Supergirl on the tropical island.\n\n\n\nSUPERGIRL\n      (image)\nThere's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...\n\n\tETHAN\n        (image)\nI know what it is. She has this lead container shaped \nlike a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. TROPIAL ISLAND\n\nSupergirl becomes very excited.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tThat's the Power Source that was lost from Argo \nCity! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live? \n\n\tETHAN\nIn this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better \nstay away from there.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nI can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only \nthing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't \nsee the Power Source at the amusement park.\n\nShe stands up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tWait. Don't leave me.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tYou'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have \nthe Power Source.\n\nHe stands up and takes her hand.\n\nETHAN \nBefore you go...\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nWhat?\n\n\tETHAN \nJust one kiss. For old times' sake.\n\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nAnd you can see how you feel about me, right?\n\n\tETHAN\nYes.\n\nShe closes her eyes and parts her lips. Slowly their lips come together and touch. Then a sudden rush of sheer desire flows through them and the simple experimental kiss become an ecstatic prelude to the heights of lovemaking. But before either one of them can go one step further, ETHAN DISAPPEARS WITH A FLASH OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. A cloud darkens the sun, and the trees are lashed into a frenzy by gale-force winds. Selena's laughter can be heard from somewhere far away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tEthan!\n\nSupergirl flies into the air.\n\nEXT. TROPICAL ISLAND. SUNSET. SKY ABOVE ISLAND. DAY\n\nSupergirl flies around the island very fast at high speed, searching for Ethan and Selena. She hovers like an eagle for a moment, then speeds straight upwards.\n\nEXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN. DAY\n\nSupergirl flies back to North America, faster than she has ever flown before.\n\nEXT. ABOVE MIDVALE. DAY\n\nSupergirl zeros in on Selena's house like an exocet.\n\nEXT. SELENA'S FRONT LAWN\n\nSupergirl lands and walks cautiously up to the front door, ready for anything but what she finds: the front door is ajar. She pushes it open with a creak of its massive hinges. She walks slowly inside.\n\nINT. SELENA'S MANSION. FRONT HALL/LIVING ROOM\n\nSupergirl looks around. The house seems deserted and drastically neglected. Cobwebs hang over everything. The dust has the thickness of a hundred years. Moths have eaten away all the splendid tapestries. Rats cavort along the baseboards. Bats sleep in the chandeliers. In the living room Supergirl finds Bianca crouched in A Corner, gibbering mindlessly. Bianca too has changed: she is dressed in rags, and her wild staring eyes are rimmed with dark circles. When she sees Supergirl she cries with fright.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tHey take it easy. I won't hurt you.\n\nBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tI thought .it was her, coming back. Spared me. \nBut I thought. . . maybe changed her mind. \nNigel warned us. Wouldn't listen to him.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nWhat are you talking about? Where's Selena?\n\nBIANCA\n\t\t\t\tNo. Don't want to know. She's bad. Don't go near her.\n\t\t\t\tHurt you.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nI have to find her. Tell me.\n\nSupergirl looks into Bianca's eyes with her calm, heroic gaze, and Bianca comes somewhat to her senses. Bianca points to the adjoining bar. Supergirl walks over warily and sees FIVE GOLDEN CAGES suspended among the bottles. Nigel and the four remaining members of the Circle are imprisoned in them, shrunken but alive. Nige1 is in a perpetually turning squirrel wheel. He sees her and calls out.\n\nNIGEL\n\t\t\t\tSupergirl! She's waiting for you. On Taliesen Mountain. \nStop her before it's too late!\n\nSupergirl gets a look of determination on her face. She turns and flies out through the French doors and heads straight up into the air.\n\nINT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE (A MOUNTAIN-TOP PALACE) \n\nEthan is in a dark, shadowy place, bound to a stake with stout cords. Sticks of wood are piled all around his feet. Selena stands beside him in her shining gown of power. She looks even more gorgeous and cruel than before. She offers him a glass of water to drink, but he turns his head away violently.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI'm wise to your tricks, lady.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI could force you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tIf that worked, you would've done it already. No, \nyou want me to drink it of my own free will. Well \nlet me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell \nbefore I fall for that one again.\n\n\tSELENA\nGo on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.\n\n\nShe puts the glass of water in a, basket at the end of an iron chain hanging down from above. There is a straw in the glass at such an angle that Ethan can just reach it with his lips if he stretches as far as possible.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tYou've been without water for a whole day. Let's \nsee how thirsty you get in a week.\n\n\tETHAN \nYou vicious--\n\n\tSELENA\nCareful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.\n\n\nShe glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away.\n\nTHE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER revealing that she has been talking to Ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room. Her new house is enormous. Where before she lived in a mansion, now she dwells in a palace. The fireplace is seven feet high, the living room floor is wide as a football field, and. the French windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the North transept of Chartres Cathedral. Selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butler's pantry--each now the size of a basketball court.\n\nBack in the fireplace, Ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone, then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby. He pokes the straw with his forehead. The glass swings slightly. The glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm. He gauges the swing of the glass and, at the precise moment, grabs for it with his mouth. He catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done. He bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth.\n\nThe glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash, leaving Ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin. He leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders. A droplet of blood falls into his hand. He drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it. He grins, and sighs with relief. Then spits to clear his mouth. Slowly he saws. at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand. One by one the strands part.\n\nEthan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps. He quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace. He looks around the mammoth room. The coast is clear. He spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth, and dashes out of the doors\nto the garden.\n\n\n\n\nEXT. SELENA'S HOUSE. GARDEN.  CONSERVATORY\n\nEthan sees a green plastic garden hose, which the gardener has left running in a trickle to irrigate the hydrangeas. Ethan remembers that he is very thirsty. He picks up the hose, rinses out his mouth hurriedly, and then takes long, desperate gulps of the water. Behind him he hears Selena's laughter. He drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig.\n\nINSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V.\n\nThe same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time. The plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours. At the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding Selena. She approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power. As she comes nearer, the clear area expands and drives out the visual chaos. Selena speaks, and her voice is a close-miked throaty purr.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI told you I'd win.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nEthan is held by the spell of her magic. And yet there is part of him that still resists. You can see him try to turn his head away from the vision of ideal beauty before him, and then give in as she comes closer and I touches him with her hand. A zap of energy passes between them at her touch.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tKiss me.\n\t\nHe embraces her roughly and crushes her lips with a kiss. He is filled with a tigerish lust that thrills her deeply. She rakes her long red fingernails across his back and moans with pleasure.\n\nEXT. ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS. DAY\n\nSupergirl flies over the Rockies toward Selena's house.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY\n\nSupergirl flies over Selena's new house. For the first time we can see the enormousness of it: \na grotesque, towering monstrosity, that seems to brood threateningly over the landscape.\n\nEXT. GARDEN BEHIND SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. DAY\n\nSupergirl lands and walks toward the towering French doors of the living room. But something distracts her. She turns and enters the gigantic conservatory to her right.\n\n\nINT. CONSERVATORY\n\nSupergirl looks around and sees in the middle of the conservatory a reflecting pool surrounded by exotic plants. She walks closer and looks down into the reflecting pool. In the bottom of the shallow pool she sees Ethan securely bound. His eyes stare wildly. Dead or drowning.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tEthan!\n\nShe leaps into the shallow pool, and sinks over her head. A polygonal section of the surface of the reflecting pool detaches itself from the water and rises up perpendicularly. It is a door to the Phantom Zone. Supergirl is trapped behind an impenetrable force field, looking out in despair. Ethan is not there with her. His image has disappeared. \n\nThe real flesh and blood Ethan appears with Selena from behind the strangler fig. They look in at Supergirl trapped behind the shimmering polygon that la ads to the Phantom Zone. Selena laughs at her, but Ethan stares as if at a long forgotten acquaintance whose name he is trying to recall.\n\nSelena notices Ethan's wandering attention and she puts her arms possessively around him.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tEnjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever.\n\nSupergirl calls out to Ethan, her hands and face pressed against the transparent wall of her prison, but no sound can escape the impenetrable force field.\n\nINT. PHANTOM ZONE DOOR\n\nSupergirl is seen in reverse, beating on the hard crystalline surface of the prison.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tEthan! Don't let her do this!\n\nBeyond the threshold of the zone, Selena in her conservatory kisses Ethan with fierce lust. He returns her , emotion, forgetting all about Supergirl.\n\nSUPERGIRL\nNo. No. It isn't true.\n\nThe image of Selena and Ethan begins to recede, getting smaller and smaller, until it vanishes entirely in infinite blackness.\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nThe flat two-dimensional polygon that is Supergirl's prison whirls away through space. Behind the transparent surface we can see Supergirl's face stained with tears.\n\nEXT. PHANTOM ZONE \n\nAnother kind of reality. Unlike anything we have ever seen. The crystal prison lands on the ground of the Phantom Zone and shatters. Supergirl picks herself up from among the fragments of her prison and looks around. The landscape is utterly strange and alien, with a feel of stark, oppressive sterility. As far as the eye can see there is no sign of life. Supergirl stands up and raises her arms to fly. She hops into the air about eight inches and lands flat-footedly on the sand. With a shock she realises SHE CAN'T FLY.\n\nShe hops a few more times, with no more success.\n\nShe picks up a small rock from the ground. She tries to crush it in her hand. She can't. Angrily she hurls it from her as far as she can. Instead of disappearing into infinity it drops at her feet a few yards away. She scoops up some sand from the ground and holds it cupped in her hand. She takes a deep breath and tries to blow it away. She is barely able to disturb a few grains. She drops the sand and sits down on a rock, forlorn and dejected.\n\nSuddenly she hears Alura's voice, very faint and coming from a long distance away.\n\n ALURA'S VOICE \nKara, where are you?\n\n\tKARA\nMother? I can hardly hear you.\n\n\tALURA. S VOICE\nKara! You're alive. We were so worried. You disappeared \nfrom the scanners...\n\nKARA\n\t\t\t\tI'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore. \nAnd I'm weak.\n\n\tALURA'S VOICE\nKara, you must not give up. We must retrieve the \nPower Source. The City is dying.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKARA\n\t\t\t\tThen send someone else. I failed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALURA'S VOICE\n\t\t\t\tWe can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no \nlonger have the power to push through.\n\nKARA\n\t\t\t\tBut Mother, I'm lost. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tALURA' S VOICE \nYou must try. . . it's cold. And dark. . .\n\nThe rest of her sentence fades out, and is lost. \n\nKARA \nMother---I tried. I really tried.\n\nKara puts her face in her hands and starts to sob hopelessly.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. UNITED NATIONS, NEW YORK. DAY\n\nEstablishing shot. \n\nINT. GENERAL ASSEMBLY\n\nThe DELEGATE FROM URITANIA is going on (in Esperanto) denouncing the latest outrage against his peace-loving country. A few bored DELEGATES of various nationalities\nare sprawled in their seats listening to the simultaneous translation over earphones. The dign1fied PRESIDENT of the General Assembly is sitting on the dais behind the ranting delegate. With a FLASH OF LIGHT and a chok1ng cloud of sulfur fumes, Selena appears beside the podium. She is in her shimmering white robe. The dozing delegates wake up with amazement. The URITANIAN delegate stares at her with his mouth open as she slides him away from the microphone. \n\nINT.  TRANSLATOR\"S BOOTH . GENERAL ASSEMBLY\n\nInside the translator's booth, the entire panorama of the enormous hall is visible through the glass window. The eight TRANSLATORS stop translating and stare at the scene below.\n\nBACK TO GENERAL ASSEMBLY\n\nSelena is about to speak in the microphone, when two SECURITY GQUARDS attempt to step onto the podium. Selena reaches out toward them. A field of force from her hands stops them in their tracks, knocking them backwards off the steps to land on their butts. The delegates gasp at this act of magical violence.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tNations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age!\n\nThe President of the General Assembly starts to shout at her and bang on the podium with his gavel. Selena looks over her shoulder with mild annoyance. Instantly the President's gavel turns into a live eel. The President drops it with horror. Selena continues her speech.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI bring you a return to the ancient true worship of \nNature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And \nI bring you myself as her representative here \non Earth.\n\nThe URITANIAN suddenly recovers his wits and tries to place a hand on Selena's shoulder. A whirlwind hurls him off the podium into the desks of the front row delegates. The delegates babble in consternation but keep to their seats. Selena raises her voice to be heard over the uproar.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tFrom this moment forth, all science, religion and other\n\t\t\t\tunnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I \nwill teach the One True Way of our ancient \ngrandmothers.\n\nThe President of the General Assembly has recovered enough from the surprise of the eel to \ninterrupt Selena.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPRESIDENT\n\t\t\t\tYou are talking about the end of Civilisation as we \nknow it.\n\n\tSELENA\nAnd it's about time too.\n\n\tPRESIDENT\nI do not know who you are, or what evil force \nyou represent, but it will take more than a\nfew threats from you to make mankind turn back \nthe clock and abandon thousands of years of progress.\n\nSelena has listened with a mocking smile as he speaks. He finishes to a smattering of applause from some of the delegates.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tThreats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. \nI have something better.\n\nShe snaps her fingers in the air. Immediately a RAIN OF MONEY BEGINS TO FALL ALL OVER THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. PAPER MONEY AND COINS OF ALL NATIONS. Selena looks at her work with pleasure. Then she disappears in a FLASH OF LIGHT.\n\nThe delegates blink with astonishment. The only trace of her presence is the tang of sulfur in the air---and the money. One delegate forgets his dignity and starts scooping up money from his desk and stuffing it into his pockets. Suddenly all the delegates are doing the same thing. The only exception is the delegate from the United Kingdom who thinks it might be beneath his dignity, and looks about with mild disapproval.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n\nEXT. THE PHANTOM ZONE\n\nSupergirl walks across the rolling monotony of the Phantom Zone. We have never seen her like this before: sweating, her hair unkempt, streaks of dirt and grit on her face, exhausted and full of despair. She stumbles at the crest of a low ridge and falls down to the bottom of the slope, banging her head on a rock. She sits there, a big rip in her ,uniform, rubbing her bruised forehead. It is hard to imagine her any worse off.\n\nShe hears a sound, vaguely familiar. She looks around for its source. She follows the sound, crawling slowly along the base of the ridge. The sound gets louder and as she, approaches. It is a sound of celestial, spiritual beauty: the music of the spheres.\n\nSuddenly she comes out into a tiny valley in the Phantom Zone and sees before her the most beautiful sight she could imagine. The harsh monochromatic sterility of the Phantom Zone gives way to a riot of bright colours. A dome-like building protrudes from the ground. All around it are gorgeous singing sculptures in the style of Argo City. A sculptor. in the clothing of Argo City is modeling a glassy statue with a matterwand. He turns and catches sight of Supergirl. It is Zaltar.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tZaltar.\n\nZaltar drops his wand and comes running over to Supergirl. He kneels beside her on the sandy ground.\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tKara? Is it you?\n\nSupergirl nods. She is obviously exhausted. Zaltar takes the bulb full of liquid off his belt and offers her a drink. She drinks thirstily of the refreshing green liquid, and feels strength returning to her body.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nWhat is this place?\n\n\tZALTAR\nThis is the Phantom Zone. But why did you \ncome here from Argo City?\n\n\tSUPERGIRL \nI was on Earth...\n\n\tZALTAR\nEarth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nYes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...\n\n\n\tZALTAR \nShouldnt've done that.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\n...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me \nto the Phantom Zone.\n\n\tZALTAR\nIt's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can \nunleash all sorts of terrible forces---\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nI know.\n\n\tZALTAR\nWell, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. \nYou can stay with me, until I build you your own \nplace. I expect you won't want to mix with the others--\nnot our type of people.\n\nHe helps her to her feet and over to his house, a sort of Argonian gothic cathedral half-buried in the sand. The curves of the arches and the materials are strongly reminiscent of Zaltar's work on Argo City.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tOthers?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tCriminals.\n\nZaltar gestures vaguely to the horizon on his right.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tA few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid \nthem. And you should too.\n\nZaltar leads Supergirl past the singing sculptures. She smiles as she passes them, and remembers his \"tree\" in Argo City.\n\nSUPERGIRL \n...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam...\"\n\n\tZALTAR \nWhat? Palace? Hardly.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nJust feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...\n\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tYes. Can't seem to get away from that style. \nMust try something new.\n\nINT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE\n\nHe helps her down a long spiraling staircase to the floor of a high domed room. In the centre of the room is a huge round table cluttered with tools, models and unfinished projects.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nIt's lovely. . .\n\n\tZALTAR\nNo, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything \njust right. Nobody telling you to change this, \nmove that around. Please yourself. That's \nthe secret of happiness.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nAre you happy, Zaltar?\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tWhat kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do \nwhatever I want. All the time.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nBut what about other people? Don't you miss them?\n\nThey have reached the ground floor. Zaltar plucks one of the liquid filled bulbs from the stem of a large plant growing in a niche in the wall. He squirts some of the green liquid in his mouth with great satisfaction.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tI look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy. \nIt's quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise.\n\nHe carefully applies some of the green liquid to the wound on her scalp.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tYou look at them? How?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tThe Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you \nhave the right tools.\n\nZaltar sweeps the clutter off the table and onto the floor.\n\n\n\nHe passes his hand over the table and instantly the table turns into a WINDOW INTO ANOTHER WORLD, showing an image of a herdboy riding on the back of a water buffalo in a rice paddy.\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tThere you see? What could be more boring than that?\n\nHe waves his hand, and the image disappears.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tWait. Could...could I see the place I just came from?\n\nZaltar sighs with great martyrdom, and starts to fiddle with his controls.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tIt'll only make you sad. \n\nHe shows her the proper hand gestures to control the image.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tThis goes closer. This moves it around. And \nthis begins.\n\nHe gestures with his hand and the WINDOW OPENS again. Supergirl ZOOMS THE IMAGE IN as fast as she can, trembling with desperate urgency. The IMAGE ON THE TABLE DISSOLVES FROM HIGH ABOVE A CITY DOWN TO :\n\nEXT. WALL STREET.  DAY\n\nThe financial district. Bank clerks are shoveling money out the windows of several large, imposing banks. Passersby ignore the bonanza, and trudge dejectedly on.\n\nINT. STOCK EXCHANGE. DAY\n\nChaos and pandemonium on the floor. Not the everyday chaos and pandemonium you always see. Brokers are trying to strangle one another. Fist fights. Bloody noses. The crunch of breaking knuckles.\n\nEXT. SUPERMARKET.  DAY\n\nPeople are waiting in line with wheelbarrows full of money. The store manager shakes his head and sends them away. The only people he lets in the store are a man with a live turkey under his arm, a little old lady carrying a Rembrandt in a nice gold frame, a woman who gives him her fur coat and a man with an antique clock.\n\n\n\n\n\nEXT. HIGH ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN.  DAY\n\nThe CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN and DISSOLVES THROUGH THE ROOF TO:\n\nINT. ANTE ROOM IN SELENA'S NEW HOUSE\n\nA mob of dignitaries and petitioners is waiting anxiously outside the large imposing doors to Selena's reception room. Generals in uniform, diplomats wearing their medals pinned ,on their formal suits, bankers in pin stripes, and the robed ecclesiastics and holy men of various faiths. A secretary opens the door to the reception room, and the dignitaries all surge forward.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSECRETARY\n\t\t\t\tNo more audiences today. Go home. All \nof you.\n\nThrough the open door Selena can be glimpsed sitting .on her throne-like chair, with Ethan kneeling at her feet, resting his head in her lap like  a pet animal.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. SELENA'S SITTING ROOM\n\nThe secretary closes the doors leaving Ethan and Selena alone. She strokes his head. Outside crowds can be heard chanting her name: \"Selena! Selena!\"\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tThey want me. Doesn't it make you proud?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tYeah.\n\nSelena gets up and walks over to the door leading out to her balcony.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tComing?\n\nEthan follows her sullenly.\n\nEXT. BALCONY\n\nThey walk out onto the balcony. The crowds scream her name. She waves smiling. Ethan stands a step behind her with a moody expression on his face.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tSmile, lunk-head. You're not a gardener any more, \nyou're Prince Ethan now.\n\nEthan lifts his hand and waves half-heartedly.\n\nEXT. GROUNDS OF SELENA'S NEW HOUSE.  BENEATH THE BALCONY\n\nThe crowd is enormous, held back behind police barricades. Guards in the special livery of Selena's service hold back the surging tide of humanity: people .praying, chanting, walking on their knees, cripples on crutches, the ailing on stretchers carried by relatives. And in front a disciplined youth group in a distinctive costume perform chants and fanatic cheers. Huge banners display Selena's portrait. Images of her are everywhere.\n\nINT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE\n\nSupergirl reels with shock at the scene \n\nSUPERGIRL \nThat horrible woman!\n\n\tZALTAR\nTold you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would \nmake you sad.\n\nHe starts to gesture the image away, but she puts her hand on his arm, stopping him.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tNo. I have to see this.\n\nZaltar shrugs.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. MIDVALE. DAY\n\nThe roadside complex where Lucy's traffic accident occurred. The Hamburger Place is boarded up. The area is almost deserted and no cars pass on the street. All of the huge advertising billboards along the way are now covered with pictures of Selena. The only writing is in mystic symbols. A lone figure walks furtively along the street. It is LUCY LANE, her face disguised with dark glasses. She goes to the rear of the abandoned Hamburger Place and knocks four times. The door opens quickly and she ducks inside.\n\nINT. HAMBURGER HEAVEN. DAY\n\nThe restaurant has been converted into a clandestine print shop. A few serious teenagers are working the press and turning out seditious handbills. Freshly printed pages are hung on clothes-lines so the ink can dry. \"THE TRUTH ABOUT SELENA\" is the headline over JIMMY'S PHOTO of her getting into the Cadillac with her huge shadow looming behind. Lucy crosses to Jimmy Olsen, who is tying up bundles of handbills.\n\nLUCY\n\t\t\t\tI had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers \nhave been arrested!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tHow do you know?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\t\t\tI saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJIMMY \nDid anybody notice you?\n\n\tLUCY\nI can't help it if men notice me.\n\n\tJIMMY\nLucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!\n\nShe kisses him on the nose.\n\nLUCY \nJust kidding. Nobody saw me.\n\nJimmy gives her another bundle of handbills. HELMETED GUARDS in the livery of Selena's service kick down the door. and rush in, weapons drawn. They smash up the print shop and arrest everybody. Jimmy and Lucy are handcuffed and dragged away.\n\nINT. PRISON\n\nThe Danvers and all the teenagers from the print shop are crowded into tiers of barred cells set into the walls of a dark, enormous cavern. Jimmy and Lucy huddle together for warmth in one of the tiny cells.\n\nJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tI sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't \nlet any of this go on. Not for one minute.\n\n\tLUCY\nI wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.\n\nJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tI heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.\n\nThere is the clank of an iron door, and Ethan enters the prison with several of the guards in Selena's livery. He walks past the cells, glancing now and then with compassion at the poor wretches inside. Lucy calls out as he passes.\n\nLUCY \nHey! Ethan!\n\n\tETHAN\nHmmm?\n\nLUCY\n\t\t\t\tRemember me? We were in a disaster together.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN .\n\t\t\t\tOh yeah, the girl in the hospital, on the other stretcher.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\t\t\tRight! Say, do you swing any weight around here?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tA little.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\t\t\tCan you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We \nthought they were selling hamburgers in that place.\n\n\tETHAN\nI'll mention it upstairs.\n\nHe turns to go, but Jimmy reaches out and grabs his sleeve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tThe blonde girl who saved your life---where \nis she now?\n\nEthan pauses. Buried memories rise to the surface of his mind, bringing pain.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tShe's gone. No one will ever see her again.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. ZALTAR'S HOUSE IN THE ZONE\n\nSupergirl waves her hand over the table angrily, decisively. The WINDOW of the Zone closes, and the image of Ethan disappears. She crosses to Zaltar, who is reclining on a couch in an adjoining room, getting drunk on the green liquid from the plant bladders.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nZaltar, please help me.\n\n\tZALTAR\nOf course, my dear. What can I do?\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nHelp me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. \nThey need me.\n\nZaltar looks pained, and takes several deep drinks of green plant sap before he answers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tThere's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. \nThat's why they send the criminals here.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tIf there's a way in, there must be a way out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tNo, that's not true---there's well...no--\n\nHe suddenly has an idea, vaguely forming at the back of his drink-sodden brain. He toys with it, while Supergirl leans forward eagerly, waiting. He changes his mind several times about whether it's possible or not, each time changing his facial expression. Supergirl has the feeling she's watching a debate conducted by squints and grimaces.\n\nZALTAR \nThere is a way.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL \nI knew it!\n\n\tZALTAR\nBut it's impossible.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nWhy?\n\n\tZALTAR\nNo, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too---\nif it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity---\nno, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.\n\nSupergirl's heart sinks. She rocks back, clutching her knees, trying not to show her sadness.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tI could do it.\n\nShe is suddenly all excitement and hopefulness again.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nThen teach me how.\n\n\tZALTAR\nNo, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get \none go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a \nsip of this? It's delicious, I think.\n\n\nHe takes another sip of his drink.\n\nSUPERGIRL \nTell me how. to do it. If you could do it, I can.\n\nHe looks at her shrewdly, appraising her abilities with a suddenly lucid glance.\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tTakes a long time, you know, learning the wand. \nJust begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a \nkind of life--can also take away life; works backwards \ntoo. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have \nthe one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's \nout of the question.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nThen come with me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tLeave the zone? What would I do on Earth?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tYou could do anything. You could sculpt \nmountain ranges...draw with rainbows! \nYou'd have superpowers.\n\n\tZALTAR\n Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nPlease. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are \nin trouble. And unless I bring back the Power \nSource, Argo City will die.\n\nHe looks at her kneeling beside his couch, tears streaming down her cheeks, pleading with him.\n\nZALTAR\nOh, all right. Stop crying. Let's go.\n\nHe stands up, takes his matterwand, and heads for the stairs up to the surface. Supergirl can hardly believe her plea has been granted. She runs after him, up the stairs.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tYou're going to take me back?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tGoing to try. Didn't say I could.\n\nEXT. ZALTAR' S HOUSE. PHANTOM ZONE\n\nThey emerge from the circular doorway out onto the flat monotonous terrain of the zone. Zaltar pauses for a moment to get his bearings, then strikes out with long energetic strides. Supergirl hurries to keep up with him.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tI heard my mother ask you once \"how could a \nman with such a selfish heart create beauty?\" \nShe was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous \nheart.\n\n\tZALTAR\nNot doing this for you. Just sick of this place, \nthat's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling \nat you. Boring!\n\nSupergirl scampers along beside him, smiling. Zaltar never looks back at his abandoned house, but keeps his gaze fixed on the horizon straight ahead.\n\nINT. SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. HALLWAY\n\nEthan is walking down the hall and sees guards dragging Lucy Lane and Jimmy Olsen in chains. Lucy calls out to him.\n\nLUCY\n\t\t\t\tHey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI did.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLUCY\n\t\t\t\t     (bitterly)\n\t\t\t\tWell thanks a pile, fella.\n\nEthan watches them dragged away. He has a puzzled expression on his face.\n\nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM. DAY\n\nEthan enters. Selena is staring into her magic mirror. Her face is white with fear.\n\nETHAN \nWhat's going on?\n\nSelena snaps irritably at him.\n\nSELENA \nGuess! Go on.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI don't know. You seem afraid.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tYou're a regular Einstein, aren't you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\t     (the truth dawns on him)\n\t\t\t\tSupergirl?\n\nSelena doesn't answer, but looks back at the mirror. Ethan moves to her side and watches with her the IMAGE OF THE PHANTOM ZONE.\n\nINT. PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX\n\nZaltar leads the way, firming their path with the matterwand, and then hauling himself and Supergirl forward over an upward sloping, undulating surface. Behind them luminescent waves of energy can be seen, like the ocean at the base of a steep cliff, constantly sweeping backwards and downwards, away from their goal.\n\nINT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM\n\nSelena looks up and realises Ethan is behind her, looking intently at the image.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tQuit staring so hard. You'll strain your eyes.\n\nShe puts her hand on his cheek. He turns away from the image of Supergirl and looks deep in \nSelena's eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tYou're not going to hurt her, are you?\n\nSelena is furious. Her eyes get that dangerous look.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tYou can't put her out of your mind, is that it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tWell...I guess I can't.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI'm ready for her. I'll show you.\n\nSelena walks out the French doors followed by the dazed Ethan.\n\n\n\nEXT. CONSERVATORY. DAY\n\nMR. & Mrs. Danvers, Lucy Lane, and Jimmy Olsen are imprisoned in four metal cages hanging over the reflecting pool in the conservatory. The ropes that keep the cages from falling into the pool are GIGANTIC GOLDEN SERPENTS, their tails around an overhead beam, and the jaws tightly locked on the tops of the cages. A fifth cage hangs there empty. The water in the reflecting pool has changed colour to an opaque yellow. Selena shows the arrangements to Ethan.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tUnless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the \nserpents will drop them one by one. \n\nSelena puts a small silver whistle to her lips and blows a high, melodious note. The fifth serpent opens his jaws and releases the empty cage into the pool.\n\nINSERT: REFLECTING POOL\n\nThe empty cage lands in the water and is instantly eaten up by the most powerful acid imaginable, leaving nothing but froth and acrid fumes. Ethan looks down into the cool at his reflection distorted by the spreading ripples. \n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tWhy the empty cage?\n\nSELENA\nThat one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and \nsee how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd \nhate to lose you, Ethan.\n\nSelena steps beside him and puts her hand on his shoulder. Ethan cries out with terror. Selena looks down at what he sees.\n\nINSERT: REFLECTING POOL\n\nBehind Selena, distorted almost beyond recognition by the ripples on the surface, is a GIANT MONSTROUS SHADOW-BEING, ITS ARMS OUTSTRETCHED, ALMOST ENVELOPING HER, but invisible except in reflections.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nSelena steps away from the pool, shaken by the sight.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tWhat...?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tYou don't get this far without paying...a \ncertain price.\n\nShe turns and walks quickly out of the conservatory, followed by Ethan.\n\nMR. DANVERS\n\t\t\t\tIf only I hadn't made that speech denouncing her.\n\nMRS . DANVERS\nI'm not afraid to die. I'm proud of you.\n\nShe stretches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely. Lucy turns her face away to give them some privacy in their. final moments. Jimmy is looking at her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJIMMY \n       (shyly)\nI've been in love with you for years. Remember \nhow you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? \nAnd put your fingerprints on my lens.\n\nLUCY\n\t\t\t\tRemember? I was trying desperately to get you're \nattention.\n\n\tJIMMY\nYou were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what...\nall this time?\n\n\tLUCY \nYou bet your ass.\n\n\tJIMMY\nWhy didn't you tell me?\n\n\tLUCY\nYou're supposed to guess.\n\nShe reaches out her hand through the bars and clasps his bravely, like the Danvers.\n\nINT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX\n\nZaltar is continuing his climb, but the way is getting steeper, and he is tired and short of breath. He pauses.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tWhy are you stopping?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tStopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you \nmusn't do.\n\nHe continues forward, and upward, firming their path with the matterwand. The wand creates a warm circle of white light around them in contrast to the monochromatic energy field of the Phantom Zone. Because of the inherent curvature of the Phantom Zone vortex, they seem to be scrambling up a sheer vertical wall now. Supergirl is close beside Zaltar helping him along, not merely following as she had before. The throbbing sound of energy waves surging down the vortex is growing louder as they proceed. Zaltar stumbles, and drops the matterwand.\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tOh dear!\n\nThe vortex starts to sweep the wand backwards, down to where they have just climbed from.  Supergirl makes a desperate lunge and retrieves the wand as it sweeps past. But now she is being swept backwards.\n\nZALTAR \nThe wand. Use it.\n\nSupergirl somehow finds the right grip on the controls and points the wand at the undulating surface beneath her. She stills the moving surface and stops her backwards motion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tGood girl! That's the way!\n\nBut now Zaltar is being swept backwards toward her. She points the wand at his feet and halts his downhill slide.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tYou can use the wand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tBetter than when I was a child.\n\nShe hands it back to him and they resume their slow upward progress.\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tI remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like \nyour mother.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. SELENA'S NEW LIVING ROOM\n\nSelena stands watching the image of Zaltar and Supergirl in her mirror. Beside her on the floor is the Coffer of Shadow, now swollen to the size of a large pumpkin. It pulses and glows with inner light. The lid of the Coffer of Shadow starts to rattle as if something inside is attempting to get out.\n\nINT. THE PHANTOM ZONE/QUANTUM VORTEX\n\nFlaming spheres of BALL LIGHTNING begin to whizz past Zaltar and Supergirl. Zaltar is startled, and he stops his forward progress.\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tWhat's that? Never saw anything like that.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tDon't stop. Keep moving.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tZALTAR \nYes, mustn't stop.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\n       (grimly) \n It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.\n\nAnother flaming sphere whizzes toward them. It hits Zaltar on the shoulder and knocks him off the safe path. He starts to roll backwards down the vortex.\n\n\nSUPERGIRL \nZaltar. Use the wand!\n\nZALTAR\n\t\t\t\tToo late. Too late. Save yourself.\n\nHe is being swept faster and .faster away from her, receding like the image of Ethan when she was trapped in the zone. Zaltar throws the wand to her, and then is swept away, out of sight, downward to his death. He calls out after he disappears.\n\nZALTAR \n  \t\t\t\t       (voice over) \nGoodbye...\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nZaltar!\n\nShe begins to be swept backwards, but she uses the wand, and stops her slide. Gripping the wand fiercely, she starts to forge ahead. All the while she has to dodge the flaming spheres that Selena sends down the vortex.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tYou're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you.\n\nSuddenly Supergirl enters another area of the vortex. She begins to move forward, upward, without clawing her way. She accelerates, moving faster and faster.\n\nEXT. GRASSY MEADOW BESIDE A POND\n\nSupergirl lands, in a deserted sunny meadow. She collapses sobbing on the grass. The matterwand lies beside her.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tZaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart.\n\nShe looks up at the sun shining down serenely, bathing the Earth in its life-giving rays---and returning her superpowers to her.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tWherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you.  \n\nShe stands up and flexes her muscles. She no longer looks tired or disheveled. Her red and blue costume shines in the bright sunlight. She picks up the matterwand and leaps into the air, flying faster than a speeding bullet.\n\nEXT. ABOVE SELENA'S NEW HOUSE. TALIESEN MOUNTAIN\n\nSupergirl swoops down from the sky and dives through the roof.\n\nINT. SELENA'S LIVING ROOM\n\nSupergirl smashes through the ceiling and lands next to the French doors. Ethan and Selena are standing against the opposite wall, next to the veiled mirror.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tYou've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN \nShe has hostages.\n\n\tSELENA\nThe Danvers. And two of your little friends.\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nIt's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.\n\nEthan points to the conservatory and mimes the words 'out there'. Selena blows on the silver whistle on the chain around her neck.\n\nINSERT: THE SERPENT HOLDING JIMMY OLSEN'S CAGE OPENS ITS MOUTH AND THE CAGE DROPS AWAY.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nSupergirl blows an enormous blast of superbreath out the French doors.\n\nINT. CONSERVATORY\n\nJimmy Olsen's cage is blown away from the acid bath and he lands in a bank of ferns.\n\nJIMMY\n\t\t\t\tHey, what gives?\n\nThe blast of superbreath blows the cages of Lucy and the Danvers away from the pool as well. The serpents loose their grip, arid the Danvers and Lucy land beside Jimmy in the fern bank.\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM. DAY\n\nSelena witnesses the destruction of her hostage scheme.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tAll right, Supergirl. The game's not over till \nthe last card's dealt.\n\nSelena opens the lid of the grotesquely swollen Coffer of Shadow sitting beside her on the floor. The OMEGAHEDRON inside spins.\n\nAll the FURNITURE in the room suddenly launches itself at Supergirl. Huge oak refectory tables, alabaster thrones, marble urns, iron firegrates, shie1ds and armour, bronze statuary, and razor sharp panes of glass from the windows all shatter themselves against her invulnerable body. Ethan stands in the corner, ducking the stray fragments that come his way.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tYou've run out of things to throw, Selena.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tNot yet.\n\nSelena points her hand at Supergirl with a gesture of attack. The COFFER OF SHADOW emits a dense black mist that darkens the room. A giant invisible hand seizes Supergirl and hurls her into the alchemical bar with a crash of bottles. Supergirl stands up with the wand held in front of her to ward off another attack.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tIt's her shadow-self! Her dark side!\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tHow do I fight it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tTurn it against her.\n\nSupergirl raises the wand and APPLIES IT TO HER OWN BODY. THERE IS A FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT, and Supergirl is transformed into a perfect image of Selena---as she was at the fairgrounds.\n\nThere are now two Selenas in the room---the real one beside the Coffer of shadow, and the one holding the matterwand in the alchemical bar. The Real Selena is first astonished, and then furious.\n\nREAL SELENA\n\t\t\t\tPower of Shadow, kill her!!\n\nThe Second Selena calls out to the SHADOW-SELF in Selena's own unmistakable voice.\n\nSECOND SELENA \nNo. I am your mistress. Do not harm me.\n\nREAL SELENA \nDon't listen to her! Kill her! She's lying.\n\n\tSECOND SELENA\nYou are my shadow, you must obey me.\n\nThe Real Selena is distracted by the duel of willpower with her double and doesn't notice Ethan creeping along the wall toward the Coffer of Shadow.\n\nEthan lunges for the shining OMEGAHEDRON inside, and snatches it out just as the heavy lid slams shut with a clang of metal. Ethan rolls over and over on the floor, away from Selena, clutching the, shining ring to him like a football in the end zone after a quarterback sneak on a fourth down trailing seven to six with three seconds on the clock.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI've got it! The Power Source!\n\nThe Real Se1ena cries out with despair.\n\nAnd then the SHADOW attacks her. The Real Selena cries out as she is surrounded by a black mist that starts slowly choking the life out of her.\n\nREAL SELENA\n        (terrified)\nNo! Stop! Please!\n\n\nEthan hands the Power Source to the Second Selena in the bar. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSECOND SELENA\n\t\t\t\tThank you. I'll take this back to Argo City.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tIt is you, then, really?\n\nWithout a word, the Second Selena kisses him on the lips.\n\nSECOND SELENA\n\t\t\t\tWell?\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tIt's you all right.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSECOND SELENA\n\t\t\t\tI'll make it easy for you.\n\nShe again APPLIES THE WAND TO HER OWN BODY. There is a flash of light, and once more Supergirl stands before him, clutching both the Power Source and the wand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tETHAN\n\t\t\t\tI couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tI never doubted you for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tREAL SELENA\n\t\t\t\tSupergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying...\n\nSupergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the Real Selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness. Supergirl touches the SHADOW with her wand. There is a cosmic musical chord, and the SHADOW is destroyed; it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders.\n\nThe Real Selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow. She looks at herself in the mirror. She is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the Omegahedron. THERE IS NO MORE EVIL SHADOW LOOMING BEHIND HER IN THE MIRROR REFLECTION. She turns to Supergirl and Ethan.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tI'm free. I can never thank you enough.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tFor what?\n\n\t\t\t\t\nSelena points to the glittering OMEGAHEDRON Supergirl holds.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tEver since I found that thing I've been like \na prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have \nno idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tYour nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to \nArgo City where it won't be misused.\n         (to Ethan)\nYou could come too. It might be safer for you.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tNo thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll \nvouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks \nfor my memoirs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tI'll come back as soon as I can.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSELENA\n\t\t\t\tWhat about me? They'll make, hash out of me around \nhere.\n\nSupergirl and Ethan exchange a glance. Selena's innocence is the one problem they have not foreseen.\n\nETHAN\n\t\t\t\tShe's right. They'll string her up.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tDo you want to come to Argo City?\n\nSELENA \n\t\t\t\tWhat's it like?\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tIt's the most beautiful place in the universe.\n\nSELENA \n\t\t\t\tSounds O.K. to me. Let's go.\n\nSupergirl holds out the matterwand to Selena.\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tGrab hold of this. It forms a force field for the \njourney through inner space.\n\nSelena grasps the matterwand and the two of them fly together out the French doors.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PRISON. DAY\n\nSupergirl and Selena fly through the prison. Supergirl melts open the locks with BEAMS OF HEAT VISION.\n\nThe prisoners climb out of their cells cheering and rejoicing.\n\nEXT . HAMBURGER HEAVEN. GAS STATION. DAY\n\nAll the people of Midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of Selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street. Statues, banners, mystic symbols, giant tarot cards, old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group --every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze. People are smiling, dancing, holding hands, drinking: the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HIGH ABOVE THE SEA.\n\nSUNSET\n\nSelena and Supergirl fly over the ocean toward the setting sun.\n\nSELENA \nWhere is inner space?\n\nSUPERGIRL\n\t\t\t\tIt's everywhere. But water is always \nthe door.\n\nThey plunge down into the sun's reflection on the sea surface.\n\nEXT. INNER SPACE\n\nSupergirl and Selena fly together through the dark reaches of inner space. Supergirl is tired but triumphant. The OMEGAHEDRON glows brightly in her hand. Selena looks around her with awe and wonder.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tWill they be angry with me for \nstealing the Power Source?\n\n\n\n\tSUPERGIRL\nThey'll be grateful. If you hadn't found \nit, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.\n\nSELENA\n\t\t\t\tYes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERGIRL \n\t\t\t\tThat's home.\n\nP.O.V. OF SUPERGIRL AND SELENA\n\nArgo City floats ahead, seeming to welcome them, its lights, growing brighter and brighter as they return with the lost Source\n\n\nFADE OUT:\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nSupergirl\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David Odell\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Action\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:43.247861"}
