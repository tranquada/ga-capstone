Behind it\nthe sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense.\n\nMr. Brooks nudges the door with his foot. It opens enough for\nhe and Marshall to see the Couple inside.\n\nThe Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are\nnaked on the bed.\n\nAs much as Mr. Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching.\nHe can now hear his heart beating in his ears.\n\nHe begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his\nexpression is distant almost clinical.\n\nWhen the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr. Brooks's face\ngoes blank.\n\nOn the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of\nthem lie there basking in the afterglow.\n\nBehind them Mr. Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips\ninto the ROOM.

BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT\n</b>\nEverything is as it was.\n\n<b>INT. KITCHEN - BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT\n</b>\nIt's dark. In his robe and pajamas, Mr. Brooks is standing in\nfront of the open refrigerator gazing blankly at the contents\nwith a glass of milk in one hand. There's nothing he wants in\nhere. He closes the door.\n\n<b>INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY \u00d1 BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nCarrying the glass of milk, Mr. Brooks passes Jane's ROOM.\nThe door is ajar. He stops, backs up and looks. His\nDaughter's asleep.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                       127.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT\n</b>\nMr. Brooks walks to the bed and leans over to give her a kiss\non the cheek.\n\nHis lips have just brushed her flesh when she twists\nviolently under him and stabs upward with a pair of scissors.\nThe blades are driven deep into his throat. Mr. Brooks jerks\nback, the milk flies out of his hand.\n\n<b>                    MR. BROOKS\n</b>          Agghhh!!! Agghhh!!!\n\nHe grabs at the handle of the scissors, but his blood makes\nthem too slippery. He can't pull them out.\n\n<b>                    EMMA (V.O.)\n</b>          Honey, Earl, Earl...\n\n<b>INT.

After a moment Mr.\nBrooks turns over on his side and looks directly at us. His\nlips begin to move but we can't hear what he's saying, so we\nmove in on his face. It's not until it fills our view that we\ncan hear the words.\n\n\n\n\n<b>                                                  (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                   128.\n</b><b>CONTINUED:\n</b>\n\n<b>                       MR.
