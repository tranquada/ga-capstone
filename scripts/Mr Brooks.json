ICE CREAM PARLOR \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nIn a booth, Mr. Brooks and Emma are sharing a Sundae. Mr.\nBrooks steals a look at the Arthur Murray dance class that is\ntaking place behind the full-length windows fronting the\nsecond floor of the Building across the street.\n\n                    EMMA\n          ... Labradors are supposed to be\n          nice, or maybe a rescue mutt...\n\n                    MR.

BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nTwo story modern. Not ostentatious, but the elegance of the\nline and the grounds say there's big money here.\n\nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThrough the door of the DRESSING AREA, Emma can be seen\ntaking off her evening clothes.\n\nHidden by the darkness on the other side of the bed, Mr.\nBrooks is hunched forward on a chair, his head in his hands.\nHis bow tie is undone, but he's still wearing his Tuxedo. In\nobvious torment, he is whispering to himself.\n\n                       MR. BROOKS\n             ... I can't do this, I can't do\n             this, I can't do this, please don't\n             let me do this, God grant me the\n             Serenity to accept the things I\n             cannot change...\n\nIn the DRESSING AREA\n\nEmma is putting on her sleep-wear. Mr. Brooks steps into the\ndoorway.\n\n                       MR. BROOKS\n             I'm going to stay up a while, maybe\n             go to the studio and play with some\n             glazes.\n\n                       EMMA\n             Okay, I'm going to read. If I'm not\n             awake, wake me when you come back.\n\nMr. Brooks comes forward, puts his arms around Emma and hugs\nher, then easing back, kisses her.\n\n                       MR.

THE BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nMr. Brooks exits the back door and starts down a path that\nleads away from the house.\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n              (to himself)\n          Don't do this, don't do this,\n          please don't do this, don't do\n          this, don't do, please don't do\n          this...\n\nHe passes through a screen of trees and arrives at a small\nbeautiful industrial-looking Building.\n\nNo windows except for a narrow strip on three sides just\nunder the edge of the roof.\n\nMr. Brooks lets himself in with a key.\n\nINT. BUILDING \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nExquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls, vases, cups,\nplates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around\nthe room.\n\nThis is Mr. Brooks's CERAMICS STUDIO.\n\nMr. Brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the\ntemperature, then in a series of quick cuts changes out of\nhis tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects from a\ndozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging in a\ncloset.\n\nBelow the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical\nleather work shoes. The windbreaker he puts on is also from a\ndozen identical windbreakers.\n\nHe takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which\nopens into a garage. Under the light is an older model non-\ndescript Toyota.\n\nEXT. CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nThe Toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door\nclosing behind it, pulls away.\n\nINT. TOYOTA \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nMarshall is up front with Mr. Brooks.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            8.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                       MARSHALL\n             Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I've missed\n             this!

RESIDENTIAL STREET \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nA mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings. Mr.\nBrooks's Toyota is parked in the semi-dark cast by a tree.\n\nWe rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the\nother side of the block and come down to find Mr. Brooks\nworking the lock on the side door of a small BUNGALOW.\n\nHe has on surgical gloves.\n\nThe pick is extracted, the handle turned. The door opens.\nThere's a chain.\n\nMr. Brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from\na pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives\nthe tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward.\n\nThe chain has been released.\n\nINT. BUNGALOW \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nMr. Brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath\nstands very still and listens.\n\nThere's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of\nthe house.\n\nMr. Brooks's feet glide out of the PANTRY. Now coming\nslightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark\nslacks.\n\nMove up; the person in the black slacks is Marshall.\n\nIn the middle of the KITCHEN, the sound is now recognizable.\nIt's the moans of a Couple fucking. This disturbs Mr. Brooks,\nhe hesitates.\n\nMarshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            9.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                       MARSHALL\n             Don't you dare quit on me, you\n             piece of shit. I want to see what\n             they're doing.\n\nMr. Brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again.\n\nEntering a HALLWAY, he reaches into his jacket. When his hand\nreappears it's inside a Ziplock bag, his fingers around the\nbutt of a silenced pistol.\n\nHe brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the\nZiplock against his wrist.\n\nThe two Men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. Behind it\nthe sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense.\n\nMr. Brooks nudges the door with his foot. It opens enough for\nhe and Marshall to see the Couple inside.\n\nThe Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are\nnaked on the bed.\n\nAs much as Mr. Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching.\nHe can now hear his heart beating in his ears.\n\nHe begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his\nexpression is distant almost clinical.\n\nWhen the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr. Brooks's face\ngoes blank.\n\nOn the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of\nthem lie there basking in the afterglow.\n\nBehind them Mr. Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips\ninto the ROOM. They don't know he's there until he speaks.\n\n                       MR. BROOKS\n             Hello.\n\nBoth the Man and Woman jump with surprise and look. The Woman\nscreams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself.\n\n                       MAN\n             What the fuck?!\n\nThen he sees the gun.\n\n                       MAN\n             Hey, man, don't...\n\n\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        10.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n              (to the Woman)\n          Be quiet and sit up.\n\nIn an attempt to get away, the Woman pushes herself back\nagainst the wall. She can't take her eyes off Mr. Brooks and\nshe can't stop screaming.\n\nPOP! A hole appears above her left eye. The impact of Mr.\nBrooks's High Velocity .22 slug bounces her head off the\nwall. The screaming stops.\n\nThe Man opens his mouth and begins to shake. POP! The bullet\nthrough his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples\nonto the Girl.\n\nMr. Brooks looks at what he's done. His nostrils flare at the\nscent of death. Then he moves, he's got work to do. On his\nway to the bed, the pistol goes into his pocket.\n\n                    MARSHALL (O.S.)\n              (barks)\n          Whoa, Earl, what the fuck is\n          this?!!\n\nMr. Brooks snaps a look.\n\nThe curtains of the bedroom window are open; and over half of\nthe Apartments in a four story Building on the other side of\nan alley can see into this room.\n\nMost of their windows are dark. And there's no one looking\nout of the windows that are lit.\n\n                    MARSHALL\n          These pigs liked to fuck with the\n          blinds open, you should have known\n          that, Earl.

APARTMENT \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nMoonlight seeps around the blinds to reveal Mr. Smith asleep\nin bed.\n\nBeyond the open BEDROOM door down the hall is only darkness\nuntil the eruption of illumination from a penlight\nmomentarily outlines the figure of a Man.\n\nThen we're looking at what the penlight sees.\n\nA keyring. Hands in surgical gloves isolate the - safety\ndeposit key - and press it into a soft wax block where it\nleaves its impression. The light goes off.\n\nIn the BEDROOM at the end of the hallway, Mr. Smith begins to\nsnore. The Figure coasts silently toward the sound.\n\nMr. Smith's face is sideways on the pillow. The snores and a\nlittle drool burbles out of the corner of his mouth.\n\nWHOOMP!! The impact of something landing on the bed bounces\nMr. Smith upright and awake.\n\n                    MR. SMITH\n          Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!!\n\nThe beam from the penlight hits him in the face. He raises\nhis hands to shield his eyes.\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n          Don't worry, if I were here to kill\n          you, you would already be dead.\n\nThe penlight leaves Mr. Smith and Mr. Brooks places it\ndeliberately under his own chin casting long sinister shadows\nup his face. He's sitting on the bed next to Mr. Smith.\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n          After you left today, I realized\n          our friendship was a little one-\n          sided.\n                    (MORE)\n\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           32.\nCONTINUED:\n                       MR. BROOKS (CONT'D)\n             So when we meet tomorrow night\n             would you be so kind as to bring\n             all of the pictures and the memory\n             card from your camera. That way we\n             can like each other simply for who\n             we are. If you don't show up, I\n             will presume you've gone to the\n             police and I will kill you. Even if\n             I go to jail because of you,\n             someone will find you wherever you\n             are and kill you.\n\nThe penlight goes off. There's total silence.\n\n                       MR. SMITH\n                 (squeaks)\n             Mr. Brooks?...\n\nHe squints into the black.\n\n                       MR. SMITH\n             Mr. Brooks?...\n\nFinally he gathers the courage to extend a shaky hand. The\nbedside lamp goes on. The room is empty. Cautiously Mr. Smith\nswings his legs out of bed and stands up.\n\nHe forces himself to go to the door and from there curls his\narm around the jamb into the darkness.\n\nThe HALL light is dazzling.\n\nA peek into the BATHROOM shows there is nobody there. He\ncontinues on into the LIVING ROOM.\n\nHis camera equipment is on the table. The tripod is still set\nup. There is no sign of Mr. Brooks.\n\nMr. Smith eyes the front door. It's closed and the 'security\nchain' is in place!!\n\nAnother quick scan of the room. It sure seems that he's\nalone.\n\nHe opens the front door the length of the chain and looks up\nand down the hallway. It's empty. Slowly he closes the door.\n\nStanding in the light of his LIVING ROOM, Mr. Smith is more\nscared and strangely more excited than he's ever been in his\nlife.\n\n                       MR. SMITH\n             Wow!...\n\n                                                         33.\n\n\n\nINT. BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nIn a robe and pajamas, Mr. Brooks comes down the HALLWAY\ncarrying a glass of milk. The door to his Daughter's ROOM is\npartly open. By the nightlight in the plug at the head of the\nbed he can see she's asleep.\n\nINT. BEDROOM \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nMr. Brooks walks to the bed, leans over and kisses his\nDaughter on the cheek.\n\n                       MR.

BROOKS\n          No, I like her because she found\n          something that's hers. It's not the\n          family business. And she's good at\n          it. I'd like Jane to find something\n          that's hers and that she could be\n          good at.\n\n                    MARSHALL\n          That's exactly why Atwood scares\n          the shit out of me. She's a cop who\n          doesn't need the money and she's\n          looking for us. That's one fucking\n          dangerous human being.\n\n                    MR.

Neither one of them is hit.\n\nAt the same time Atwood pulls hard on the handcuff that Meeks\nis holding in his left hand and twists into him. This\ndislodges Meeks and he's off of her.\n\nSnarling like animals they fight for the gun.\n\nCRACK! Atwood's leverage breaks Meeks' trigger finger. His\ngrip loosens on the weapon. She pulls it out of his hand.\n\nA quick push skitters it across the floor. It drops through\nthe open side door into the street.\n\nAtwood rolls away and reaches for her ankle gun. Now it's\nMeeks' turn. A sharp tug on the chain of the handcuff stalls\nher motion.\n\nHe flicks his other arm and a switchblade is delivered into\nhis right hand. Snap!! The blade comes out. Atwood is\nreaching again for her ankle gun. She sees the flash of metal\nand flings her head back.\n\nLuckily all she receives is a deep gash above her right eye.\nBlood immediately begins to cascade over her brow.\n\nMeeks grins and gives another sharp tug on the handcuff to\npull Atwood into the range of his knife.\n\nWith one foot Atwood kicks at him, with the other she pushes\noff and propels herself backward to grab a handful of the\nDriver's hair.\n\nAtwood's weight hinges the Driver's head back until she's\nlooking at the ceiling. Her scream is equal parts pain and\nsurprise.\n\nEXT. STREET \u00d1 MORNING\n\nThe Brown Van veers into the on-coming traffic. The Driver of\nthe car dead ahead swerves.

I have the rest\n             of today and tomorrow left.\n\n                       CAPTAIN LISTER\n             Detective Atwood, meet FBI Agents\n             Longnecker and Campbell, they're\n             taking over your investigation.\n\n                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD\n             You promised you would keep them\n             out of it for three days.\n\n                       CAPTAIN LISTER\n             They won't allow me to keep that\n             promise.\n\nAtwood glares at her then at the FBI Men.\n\n                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD\n             This is my case, what you're doing\n             is fucked. But since I can't stop\n             you, and she won't, here's a tip.\n             James Baffert, you should stake him\n             out, he knows something.\n\n                       DETECTIVE LONGNECKER\n             We have some other ideas we are\n             looking into.\n\n                       DETECTIVE ATWOOD\n             Then what's the problem? You do\n             that and I'll tail Baffert.\n\n                       DETECTIVE LONGNECKER\n             Thank you for all your good work,\n             Detective. This is our case now.\n\nAtwood looks from one Man to the Other.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          103.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                        DETECTIVE ATWOOD\n             Good luck.\n                 (to Captain Lister)\n             Later I suppose you'll fill me in\n             on what I'm supposed to be doing\n             around here.

RECEPTION AREA - BROOKS BOX FACTORY - LATE EVENING\n\nIt's deserted with only a small spill of light coming from\nMr. Brooks' Office.\n\nINSIDE\n\nMr. Brooks is at his desk.\n\nThe lamp at his elbow throws a yellow cone across his face.\nHis head is in his hands, he's been crying.\n\nMarshall steps out of the shadows behind him.\n\n                       MARSHALL\n             It's time to go.\n\n                       MR. BROOKS\n             Yeah.\n\nHe reaches into a bottom drawer and as he takes out an\nenvelope, Marshall reads the tear-stained hand written letter\nresting on the blotter.\n\n                       MARSHALL\n             Dear Emma and Jane, my loves, I\n             have a terminal illness and instead\n             of subjecting you to my\n             deterioration, I have decided to\n             disappear. Don't try to find me, I\n             don't want to be found. Please\n             believe that the time I spent with\n             you brought me the greatest joy of\n             my life. Love.

BROOKS\n             It's all planned to work out,\n             Marshall.\n\nOn the envelope he writes: For EMMA and JANE.\n\nEXT. STREET \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nOn the sidewalk Mr. Smith is walking toward the on-coming\ntraffic. The headlights make it difficult to tell one car\nfrom the other until they pass. That doesn't keep him from\nlooking for Mr. Brooks.\n\nThe houses stop and he's passing a pocket park. In a dark\nspace between the street lamps, a hand falls on Mr. Smith's\nshoulder. He jumps and a scream squeaks out of his throat.\nIt's Mr. Brooks, in his Pottery-Throwing clothes.\n\n                       MR. BROOKS\n                 (smiles)\n             Are you ready to rock and roll, Mr.\n             Smith?\n\nMr. Smith swallows hard and nods. Mr. Brooks propels him into\nthe park.\n\nINT. MR. BROOKS' CAR \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nMr. Brooks is driving. Mr. Smith is in the passenger seat.\nBoth are lost in a wary silence. Abruptly from the back seat:\n\n                       MARSHALL\n             I smell gun oil, a gun oil that's\n             different than yours.\n\n                       MR.

You were\n             counting on that, weren't you?\n\n                       MR. BROOKS\n             It has a certain logic.\n\n                       MARSHALL\n             But if your plan is to have him\n             kill you, why do you have to kill\n             someone else first?\n\n\n\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       105.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                       MR. BROOKS\n             He'll need to see that to get up\n             the courage to kill me.\n\nMarshall roars with laughter.\n\n                       MARSHALL\n             Not even you believe that, Earl. It\n             makes it more exciting, doesn't it,\n             to think he's going to kill you\n             after you kill someone else. You're\n             getting your rocks off big time,\n             that's why you're doing it.\n\n                       MR. BROOKS\n             Not true... and if it were, so\n             what?\n                 (to Mr. Smith)\n             You're goddamn great, you know.

Mr. Smith aims the gun again.\n\nClick!... Click!\n\n                          MR. BROOKS\n             I'm sorry.\n\nAs he talks he counters around until Mr. Smith is the one\nwith his back to the open Grave.\n\n                       MR. BROOKS\n             I really did want you to kill me.\n             But in case at the last minute I\n             changed my mind, I returned to your\n             apartment and bent the firing pin\n             on your gun.\n\nHe wrenches the shovel out of a mound of waiting earth. Mr.\nSmith tries to fire the gun at Mr. Brooks again.\n\nCLICK!... CLICK!\n\n                       MR. BROOKS\n             In fact I even brought another gun\n             for you so you could finish me if I\n             had decided to go through with it.\n\nHe opens his jacket and shows Mr. Smith the gun.\n\n\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       122.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n          Unfortunately for you, my daughter\n          is pregnant and just before you\n          pulled the trigger, I realized how\n          much I want to see the end to that\n          story.\n\n                    MR. SMITH\n              (dry mouth)\n          If you do anything to me, if you\n          touch one hair on my head, the\n          Police will find the pictures of\n          you killing that Couple.\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n          The contents of your safety deposit\n          box, Mr. Smith, have vanished.\n\nWithout warning, Mr. Brooks swings the shovel. The force of\nthe blow breaks Mr. Smith's left arm. He howls.\n\nThe next blow comes almost immediately. It smashes into the\nleft side of Mr. Smith's head.\n\nThe screams stop and a misfiring set of neurons causes Mr.\nSmith to stand up straight and wobbling, look directly at Mr.\nBrooks.\n\nThe blood streaming down his face is black in the moonlight.\n\nMr. Brooks takes a step to the side, cocks his wrists and\nswings again. His full weight is behind this one.\n\nThe blade of the shovel strikes Mr. Smith in the throat very\nnearly taking off his head. The flesh that was once Mr. Smith\nfalls to the ground.\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n              (looking down at the\n               corpse)\n          Before I was the Thumbprint Killer,\n          Mr. Smith, I killed a lot of people\n          in a lot of different ways.\n\nINT. GRAVE \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nLooking up. Mr. Smith's body is rolled over the edge. It\nfalls on top of us.\n\n                                                       123.\n\n\n\nEXT. CEMETERY \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nMr. Brooks takes a shovel of dirt from the pile and whistling\n'By The Light Of The Silvery Moon', begins the task of\ncovering Mr. Smith.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u00d1 MORNING\n\nA Newspaper is lying unfolded on the Counter next to the\nremnants of a breakfast.\n\nThe headline reads - NATIONWIDE MANHUNT FOR THUMBPRINT KILLER\n- Under that headline is a large picture of Mr. Smith aka Mr.\nBaffert.\n\nIn the lower right corner is another headline to a story -\nMurder Suicide For The Hangman -.\n\nThe reader of the paper is Mr. Brooks. On a stool next to\nhim, Marshall is also reading.\n\n                    MARSHALL\n          It says here the Thumbprint Killer\n          is a monster... annoys you a little\n          bit that you can't take credit,\n          doesn't it?\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n          Anyone who is good at what they do,\n          wants recognition. But since I'm\n          not going to do it anymore, I'll\n          let Mr. Smith take the credit.\n\n                    MARSHALL\n          Don't kid yourself, Earl, you're\n          going to kill again.\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n          No, I'm not. I'll continue the AA\n          meetings and I'll control it.\n\nOn the other stool next to Mr. Brooks is a WOMAN. Her large\npurse hangs open from the back of the stool; the cel phone\nclearly visible inside. Mr. Brooks looks at the phone.\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n          But there is an answer I would like\n          to have.\n\n                                                       124.\n\n\n\nINT.

ROOFTOP PARKING LOT \u00d1 MORNING\n\nLooking out at the city, Mr. Brooks speaks into the cel phone\nhe stole from the Woman.\n\n                       MR.

In his robe and pajamas, Mr. Brooks is standing in\nfront of the open refrigerator gazing blankly at the contents\nwith a glass of milk in one hand. There's nothing he wants in\nhere. He closes the door.\n\nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY \u00d1 BROOKS HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nCarrying the glass of milk, Mr. Brooks passes Jane's ROOM.\nThe door is ajar. He stops, backs up and looks.

JANE'S BEDROOM - BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT\n\nMr. Brooks walks to the bed and leans over to give her a kiss\non the cheek.\n\nHis lips have just brushed her flesh when she twists\nviolently under him and stabs upward with a pair of scissors.\nThe blades are driven deep into his throat. Mr. Brooks jerks\nback, the milk flies out of his hand.\n\n                    MR. BROOKS\n          Agghhh!!!
