STREET - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          A small kid, TJ FORNEY (13), with a grubby worn cast on his arm,\r\n          rides his BMX really fast down a street. He chases a tow truck\r\n          towing a badly wrecked red Volvo.\r\n                         \r\n          He struggles to keep up. The truck makes a turn. TJ follows,\r\n          turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic.\r\n                         \r\n          The truck makes another turn. TJ turns with it, running straight\r\n          into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway. He comes off\r\n          his bike and is thrown across the hood. He picks himself up,\r\n          stunned. The driver of the car gets out to see if he's hurt.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in\r\n          the distance. He hurries back to his bike. He jumps on and\r\n          continues after the truck.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ gives chase. He gains on the truck. He can see it pull into a\r\n          used car lot ahead - FAIR OAKS CAR CITY.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

TJ dumps his bike, out of breath.\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           This car has to go back.\r\n                         \r\n           TOW TRUCK DRIVER\r\n           Huh?\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           This car has to go back to where it\r\n           came from.

TJ doesn't\r\n          like being ignored. He moves around to the driver's side of the\r\n          wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed-in door. He climbs\r\n          behind the wheel, slams the door shut and locks the door.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY (CONT'D)\r\n           Get out of the car, son.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ ignores him.

Open it.\r\n                         \r\n          The window is rising. Dustin grabs at TJ. TJ keeps winding the\r\n          window. It gets to the top, trapping Dustin's arm.\r\n                         \r\n                          DUSTIN (CONT'D)\r\n           Ow, fuck. What the fuck you doing?\r\n           Open it.\r\n                         \r\n          Dustin is stuck. Larry, Bill and Tony laugh. Dustin yells at TJ.\r\n          TJ ignores him, staring straight ahead.\r\n                         \r\n          The men laugh some more. Dustin's humiliation sets in.\r\n                         \r\n                          DUSTIN (CONT'D)\r\n           Put down the fuckin' window. I'm\r\n           serious.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry goes around to the passenger's side broken window and\r\n          opens the door. He leans in and easily drags TJ out of the car.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           4.\r\n                         CONTINUED: (3)\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           I'd get out of here kid, before he\r\n           works himself loose.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ's not getting the car back. The men continue laughing at the\r\n          trapped Dustin. TJ picks up his bike and rides away defeated.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

He steers his bike\r\n          with his broken arm as he tries to peel and eat the banana with\r\n          the other. He glides down a hill. It's a long hill.

He veers up a driveway to avoid it. He\r\n          passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto\r\n          the road, trying to keep control of his bike. He hits the road\r\n          and loses his balance. The handlebars twist and he crashes onto\r\n          the road.\r\n                         \r\n          He jumps up and yelps in pain, clutching his elbow. He looks at\r\n          it. It's badly grazed. He yelps again, angry. He picks up a rock\r\n          lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house. He\r\n          hurls the rock through its front window. Glass crashes down.\r\n                         \r\n          A silent beat passes, and then the front door of the house opens\r\n          and a late-20s, long-greasy-haired, wiry shirtless guy in filthy\r\n          black jeans emerges. He has a baby moustache and a cracked front\r\n          tooth. This is HESHER.

Their faces are close\r\n          together. Hesher makes a very serious finger-to-mouth gesture to\r\n          'shhhh'.\r\n                         \r\n          The SOUND of a car idling outside. Hesher listens.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ is on his stomach, freaked. TJ looks around the room - a\r\n          duffel bag, some beer cans, a few porn magazines, a weathered\r\n          bass guitar and a sleeping bag.\r\n                         \r\n          A car door closes loudly. Hesher peers through the window and\r\n          sees a SECURITY GUARD inspecting TJ's bike in the front yard and\r\n          then making his way toward the house.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher looks at TJ with serious and considered venom.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER (CONT'D)\r\n           You just fucked me.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher snaps into action.

A dirty black van\r\n          screams out onto the road and tears away, spraying dirt and\r\n          rocks in its wake. The security guard stumbles around, covered\r\n          in dirt and disoriented. He rushes back to his car and gives\r\n          chase.

It bounces onto the floor. TJ\r\n          looks around to find where it came from - and then another one\r\n          hits him in the head.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks out the window. Hesher is right outside the window. He\r\n          takes the cap off of a large BLACK MAGIC MARKER. He holds it up\r\n          to his nose and takes a long slow inhale. He exhales slow and\r\n          long, staring hard at TJ.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ looks around confused. Hesher recaps the marker, throws it\r\n          hard at TJ and wanders off. The marker hits TJ, then falls to\r\n          floor near his feet. He reaches for it. Mrs. Elsberry sees this.\r\n                         \r\n           MRS ELSBERRY (CONT'D)\r\n           TJ! What are you doing?

FAIR OAKS HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON\r\n                         \r\n          It's after school. Kids are leaving campus. TJ wheels his bike\r\n          across the school yard.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Dustin is boiling.\r\n                         \r\n                          DUSTIN\r\n           You're fuckin' dead.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           19.\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          We see that someone has drawn - in BIG BLACK MARKER - a crude\r\n          picture of a body, sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis.\r\n          The picture is drawn on the side of Dustin's Mustang door, so\r\n          his real head lines up with the drawing. It's drawn in\r\n          perspective so it looks like Dustin's head is attached to the\r\n          naked defecating body to outsiders. The words 'SUCK MY COCK'\r\n          have been scrawled beside the picture. Dustin swerves the car\r\n          toward TJ, narrowly missing him. TJ cuts into a large super\r\n          market parking lot, attempting to get away.\r\n                         \r\n          Dustin accelerates ahead of TJ and screeches to a halt in front\r\n          of him, cutting him off, almost hitting him. TJ stumbles and\r\n          falls off his bike. His bike lands on top of him.\r\n                         \r\n          Dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating TJ in the middle\r\n          of parking lot traffic. TJ struggles just to protect himself,\r\n          cowering on the ground and covering his head. Dustin tries to\r\n          wrestle TJ free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him.\r\n          He drags TJ by his T-shirt, ripping it off in the process.\r\n                         \r\n          And then a WOMAN'S VOICE -\r\n                         \r\n           VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           Hey!\r\n                         \r\n          Dustin ignores the voice.

Dustin looks\r\n          around at the scene he's created in the street. A man steps out\r\n          of his car. Dustin realizes it's time to go.\r\n                         \r\n                          DUSTIN\r\n                          (TO TJ)\r\n           I'm not finished, you fuck.\r\n                         \r\n          He gets back into his car, slams the door and speeds off.\r\n                         \r\n          Nicole watches him go, then helps TJ up.

He pours cereal into a bowl. He grabs\r\n          the milk carton. He pours it into the bowl, but the carton's\r\n          empty.\r\n                         \r\n                          GRANDMA\r\n           Oh, I'm sorry, honey. We're out of\r\n           milk.

The crowd clears a moment and we find TJ\r\n          sitting on a bench in the shade, alone and depressed, hidden\r\n          away from the other kids.\r\n                         \r\n          He drinks from a can of soda.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

You made it\r\n           pretty clear the last time you were\r\n           here, and I thought I made it pretty\r\n           clear that I couldn't give it to you.\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           What do I need to do to get it back?\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           The car's not for sale.\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           I want to get it back, though. How\r\n           much do you want for it?\r\n                         \r\n          Larry takes a breath. He doesn't want to be having this\r\n          conversation. He counts the obstacles out on his fingers.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           I don't know. We're talking at least\r\n           eighteen hundred dollars, not\r\n           including taxes, registration, ADM, or\r\n           dealer's fees. On top of that, you'd\r\n           need a driver's license. I'm guessing\r\n           you don't have one of those. You'd\r\n           need valid car insurance. I'm guessing\r\n           you don't have that either. But even\r\n           if you did have these things, I still\r\n           couldn't sell it to you because the\r\n           car's not street legal. There's a\r\n           million reasons why I can't sell it to\r\n           you.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           34.\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          For a second it seems Larry feels sympathetic toward TJ.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY (CONT'D)\r\n           Look kid, I appreciate your\r\n           enthusiasm, I really do, but I don't\r\n           know what to tell you. You can't have\r\n           the car. End of story.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ churns all this over in his head. Larry thinks he's made\r\n          himself clear. He motions to the papers on his desk.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY (CONT'D)\r\n           Do you mind if I get back to it here?\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

He walks across the\r\n          showroom, head down, mumbling angrily to himself.\r\n                         \r\n          He is stopped by a hand on his chest. It's Dustin.\r\n                         \r\n                          DUSTIN\r\n           You're lucky I'm at work right now.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

So earlier\r\n           that day I made a cherry cake and I\r\n           used a new product - I didn't know it\r\n           till afterwards- I used Fluffo. They\r\n           never made it again that Fluffo. It\r\n           was an imitation brand. I served the\r\n           cake and there was silence. And then -\r\n                         \r\n          Grandma makes a clicking sound with her tongue on the roof of\r\n          her mouth.\r\n                         \r\n                          GRANDMA (CONT'D)\r\n                          (LAUGHING)\r\n           You put the cake in your mouth and it\r\n           stuck to the roof of your mouth.

My name\r\n           is Meryl. We should start off by going\r\n           around the circle and introducing\r\n           ourselves and briefly explaining why\r\n           we are here. Hi Miss, would you please\r\n           start us off?\r\n                         \r\n          A heavy set woman, COLEEN, and her husband, JACK, sit on\r\n          beanbags looking pale and sad.\r\n                         \r\n                          COLEEN\r\n           We are the Bolder family.

Our\r\n           daughter Cynthia was murdered last\r\n           year.\r\n           (she chokes a bit)\r\n           She was the victim of a violent attack\r\n           that was unfair and sick.\r\n                         \r\n          She can't go on. Her husband Jack sets his hand on her shoulder.\r\n          She is able to hold back the tears.\r\n                         \r\n                          COLEEN (CONT'D)\r\n           We are here because we need help.

Anything.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher steps out of the bath, dripping wet, naked.\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ (CONT'D)\r\n           Say something!\r\n                         \r\n          TJ shoves him.

It's a nice pool with a\r\n          diving board.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher walks up behind them and pushes them in.\r\n                         \r\n          Nicole comes up for air.\r\n                         \r\n                          NICOLE\r\n           What the fuck!?\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           What?

He dives under the water. Suddenly TJ\r\n          is pulled under. Nicole can't see them under all the motion.\r\n          Then TJ and Hesher come bursting up for air.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           63.\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          NICOLE\r\n           Cut it out.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           R2!

Hesher has\r\n          her leg. He doesn't drag her under. He just tugs her leg. She\r\n          slaps at the water. He tugs her leg again. Pretty soon she's\r\n          laughing. Hesher's head appears above water momentarily.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER (CONT'D)\r\n           ...All the fucking trash compactors...\r\n           (underwater, then up again)\r\n           ...on the detention level!...\r\n                         \r\n          He dives again. He pulls her leg. She laughs hard. TJ watches\r\n          feeling a little left out. Hesher jumps up and climbs out of the\r\n          pool. He goes to a garden table nearby.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER (CONT'D)\r\n           Oh, shit. More trash coming in!\r\n                         \r\n          He heaves the table over and into the pool. He grabs a banana\r\n          lounge.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER (CONT'D)\r\n           Oh shit!\r\n                         \r\n          He throws it in the pool. Nicole and TJ have to dive out of the\r\n          way. They go to the sides of the pool and climb out laughing,\r\n          while Hesher continues heaving garden furniture, a barbecue and\r\n          anything else in reach into the water.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ and Nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs\r\n          dangling in the water. They're fully clothed and soaking wet.\r\n                         \r\n          He walks off, around the side of the house, looking for more\r\n          things to break.\r\n                         \r\n          There is an awkward silent moment between TJ and Nicole. TJ\r\n          looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along the\r\n          side of the pool. He manages to get one to crawl onto the his\r\n          finger.\r\n                         \r\n                          NICOLE\r\n           So, how do you know this guy?\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           I don't know, he's sort of moved into\r\n           my grandma's house with us.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           64.\r\n                         CONTINUED: (2)\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          NICOLE\r\n           What, like he's renting a room or\r\n           something?\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           No, not really, I don't know, it's\r\n           kinda a long story.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ flicks the ant off of his finger, then another one that's\r\n          climbing up his arm.\r\n                         \r\n                          NICOLE\r\n           Do you realize that the equivalent to\r\n           you flicking that ant would be like\r\n           one of us getting hit in the face by a\r\n           giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an\r\n           hour and getting thrown into the next\r\n           yard?\r\n                         \r\n          TJ stops mid ant flicking.\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           Sorry, I...\r\n                         \r\n                          NICOLE\r\n           Do you think the other ants are gonna\r\n           wonder where that ant's gone?

He climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid\r\n          through his lighter, sending streams of flames into the pool.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher douses the diving board with lighter fluid and ignites it\r\n          with his lighter.

A lot of times\r\n           snakes eat other snakes because\r\n           they're the right shape -\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           Yeah, OK, well anyway... I used to\r\n           have a snake and I fed it mice. But\r\n           one time I fed this little fuckin'\r\n           mouse to my snake and that mouse was\r\n           tough. I dropped that mouse in the\r\n           snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go\r\n           near him, and any time he tried that\r\n           mouse would just smack him with his\r\n           little, you know...\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher looks at his hand, not knowing what mouse hands are\r\n          called.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER (CONT'D)\r\n           With his little mouse hand. So instead\r\n           of eating the mouse the snake just\r\n           curled up crying in the corner and the\r\n           mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. And\r\n           this went on for weeks, the snake\r\n           wouldn't go near him. That tiny mouse\r\n           used to sit in a little miniature lawn\r\n           chair scratching his balls and\r\n           shelling peanuts and this snake was\r\n           just too scared to go near it. And cuz\r\n           the snake was scared of that mouse I\r\n           had to feed him other mice, but every\r\n           time I dropped another mouse in the\r\n           tank, it'd hide behind the brave\r\n           mouse. And so eventually the snake\r\n           starved to death. I had a cage full of\r\n           mice.\r\n                         \r\n          Grandma is stoned and sleepy and fading out.\r\n                         \r\n                          GRANDMA\r\n           So is TJ the mouse?\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           Maybe he is.\r\n                         \r\n                          GRANDMA\r\n           Well then, what am I?\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           You're an old lady.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           78.\r\n                         CONTINUED: (5)\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          GRANDMA\r\n           No, I'm a grandmother.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           Yes you are.

A gentle knock reveals Dad\r\n          at his door.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAD\r\n           Are you OK?\r\n                         \r\n          TJ refuses to look at his dad.\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           Will you just leave me alone.\r\n                         \r\n          Dad doesn't know what to say beyond this. He feels as lost as TJ\r\n          does. He leaves the room.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ paces.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER\r\n                         \r\n          He enters the garage violently. TJ sweeps Hesher's belongings\r\n          off the work bench in the garage. He kicks Hesher's sleeping bag\r\n          and pillow. A weathered bass guitar leans against a little\r\n          amplifier. TJ kicks the guitar, snapping it in two.\r\n                         \r\n          Out of breath, he stands in the mess he has created. Something\r\n          catches his eye. He contemplates this for a beat.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           88.\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Close on: GARDEN SHEARS.

FORNEY HOUSE / HALL / FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          TJ heads straight toward the front door of the house. He exits.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. FORNEY HOUSE / FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          It's raining hard. TJ storms out, just as Hesher is making his\r\n          way up the path, his van parked on the street behind him. Hesher\r\n          reaches out his arm to slow TJ.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           I wanna talk to you.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ pushes Hesher's arm out of the way.\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           Get your fucking hands away from me! I\r\n           told you, I never want to see you\r\n           again.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher, at a loss, watches TJ grab a brick from the muddy garden\r\n          and throw it through the passenger side window of his van.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher charges TJ. He throws him into the muddy garden and\r\n          kneels over him holding him by the collar of his hooded\r\n          sweatshirt.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           I fuckin' told you, leave my van out\r\n           of this!\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher lifts TJ up and slams him back down on the ground,\r\n          knocking the wind out of him. TJ struggles to get away.\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           Let go of me! Fuckin' let go of me.\r\n                         \r\n          Dad runs out the front door and pulls Hesher off TJ by the back\r\n          of his shirt.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAD\r\n           What in God's name -\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher shakes free from Dad's grip and punches him square in the\r\n          nose. Dad goes down hard.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           Don't fuckin' touch m-\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           89.\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Without hesitation, TJ jumps on Hesher's back, bear hugging his\r\n          face. They struggle for a beat, until Hesher manages to throw TJ\r\n          off. He lands on the wet grass like a ragdoll.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER (CONT'D)\r\n           Fuck you both! Motherfuckers!\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher stands breathing hard, dripping wet from the rain, fists\r\n          clenched.\r\n                         \r\n          He turns back to his van, gets in, slams the door and peels\r\n          away. TJ picks himself up out of the mud, grabs his bike and\r\n          rides off in the opposite direction. Dad stands holding his\r\n          bloody nose. He watches Hesher, he watches TJ. He is left\r\n          confused and bleeding in the pouring rain.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          It's raining cats and dogs. TJ stands outside Dustin's house,\r\n          soaking wet with his hoodie pulled over his head, the garden\r\n          shears in his hand.\r\n                         \r\n          He walks around the side of the house and looks in the window.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          From TJ's POV outside, we see Dustin in the kitchen preparing a\r\n          sandwich, one eye on the TV. He takes the sandwich to the couch\r\n          in front of the TV and lies down.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          TJ walks around the back of the house. He tries the handle to\r\n          the back door. It's locked. TJ sees the dog door. He climbs\r\n          through the flap, trying to be as quiet as possible. The TV is\r\n          loud inside.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          TJ treads softly through the kitchen, soaking wet, shears\r\n          poised.\r\n                         \r\n          He walks through to the living area. He steps behind the couch\r\n          out of Dustin's line of sight. Dustin's bare feet hang off the\r\n          end of the couch.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ ducks down. He opens the shears and carefully brings them\r\n          down over Dustin's big toe. He squeezes them shut...\r\n                         \r\n          Dustin squeals.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           90.\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           Where's my car?\r\n                         \r\n                          DUSTIN\r\n           What are you doing!?\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           Where's my fucking car?\r\n                         \r\n                          DUSTIN\r\n           Are you crazy?!\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           You make me ask one more time, your\r\n           toe's coming off.

He stares at Dustin who\r\n          looks genuinely frightened. TJ releases the shears and backs\r\n          away. And the second he does so, Dustin leaps off the couch,\r\n          grabs TJ by the throat and slams him down on the living room\r\n          floor. TJ drops the shears.\r\n                         \r\n                          DUSTIN\r\n           You finished?

Dustin stops punching,\r\n          stunned, and looks up to see Hesher, dripping wet, step through\r\n          the big nasty hole he has just made.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           Hello.\r\n                         \r\n                          DUSTIN\r\n           What the fuck?\r\n                         \r\n          Dustin moves to stand. Hesher pounces on him, dragging him along\r\n          the ground. He grabs the shears and brings them straight up to\r\n          Dustin's nose. In the same movement, he snaps the shears shut\r\n          and takes the end of Dustin's nose off.\r\n                         \r\n          Dustin squeals in pain and scurries backwards, clutching his\r\n          face, blood leaking between his fingers.

About ten other people sit.\r\n                         \r\n          The funeral director hits stop.

He\r\n          makes every attempt to be subtle and discreet about it, but he\r\n          is clearly struggling with today's workload.\r\n                         \r\n           MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)\r\n           We shared so many wonderful walks and\r\n           enjoyed each other's company very\r\n           much. I will miss our walks. I will\r\n           miss our talks and most of all, I will\r\n           miss Madeleine. I will always remember\r\n           what she told me, life is like\r\n           walking in the rain, you can either\r\n           hide and take shelter or you can just\r\n           get wet. She was dear to me and she\r\n           will always have a place in my heart.\r\n                         \r\n          Agnes places her hand on Grandma's coffin and stands for a long\r\n          silent beat.\r\n                         \r\n           MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)\r\n           I love you, Madeleine.\r\n                         \r\n          Another drawn out moment of silence. The funeral director takes\r\n          this opportunity to step to the microphone.\r\n                         \r\n                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR\r\n           OK, thank you, Agnes...\r\n                         \r\n          Agnes steps towards her seat. When she sees TJ she stops.\r\n                         \r\n                          MRS ROSOWSKI\r\n           TJ, I think you should say something.\r\n                         \r\n          The funeral director pauses awkward. Everyone looks at TJ.\r\n                         \r\n           MRS ROSOWSKI (CONT'D)\r\n           Go on, TJ.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ gets up reluctantly. He doesn't know what to say. He stands\r\n          at the microphone and struggles for a long beat, but nothing\r\n          comes out.\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           Sorry.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ makes his way off the stage.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           104.\r\n                         CONTINUED: (2)\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Sound of slow clapping from the back. It's Hesher. His hair\r\n          looks extra greasy, he's wearing a dirty white Budweiser T-shirt\r\n          and he's holding a tall can of beer under his arm which spills\r\n          as he claps. He is VERY drunk.\r\n                         \r\n          The funeral director tries to wrap it up.\r\n                         \r\n                          FUNERAL DIRECTOR\r\n           OK, so at this point we should\r\n           conclude today's service with a\r\n           moment's silence, after which lemonade\r\n           will be served in the...\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           Actually, I'd like to add to TJ's\r\n           speech. I think I know where he was\r\n           going with that.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher stands and makes his way to the front.

I didn't think about the\r\n           millions of bits of metal that were\r\n           gonna fly in every direction. I almost\r\n           killed myself. I woke up in a\r\n           hospital. I couldn't remember what\r\n           happened and then this doctor at the\r\n           end of my bed said 'son', and I said,\r\n           'don't call me son you fuckin' cunt',\r\n           then he said, 'you blew off your nut'.\r\n           Some shrapnel had penetrated my left\r\n           scrotal sack and ripped the furry\r\n           sucker right off.

I assaulted a nurse, a\r\n           doctor or two, I can't remember. I got\r\n           arrested. I got sent to juvie. But all\r\n           I could think about day and night was\r\n           my missing fuckin' nut. I couldn't eat\r\n           or sleep, I just wanted my fucking nut\r\n           back. I had to get out of there and\r\n           find it, so I busted out of juvie and\r\n           went lookin' for it. I looked for\r\n           days, but didn't find shit.\r\n                         \r\n          The tiny crowd listens, half offended, half intrigued.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER (CONT'D)\r\n           And then one night I was taking a shit\r\n           and I was just staring down at my\r\n           balls, looking at my flabby piece of\r\n           sack where my left nut used to be and\r\n           then I noticed my right nut, for like\r\n           the first time. My right nut was just\r\n           sitting there, totally happy, just\r\n           hanging out.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           107.\r\n                         CONTINUED: (5)\r\n                          HESHER (CONT'D)\r\n           All this time I'd been driving myself\r\n           crazy thinking about my missing nut\r\n           and not thinking about the nut I still\r\n           had all along. And I realized, I've\r\n           still got a nut. I've still got one\r\n           good nut. God or the Devil or whoever\r\n           left me with one good nut. At least I\r\n           didn't lose both my nuts. I've still\r\n           got one good nut and it works, and my\r\n           dick works too.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher looks up at TJ and Dad, sad and imploring, he's made his\r\n          point.

He goes to stomp on it. He misses\r\n          and stumbles, crashing into the microphone podium, knocking it\r\n          over and falling in a heap with it. He starts puking on the\r\n          stage. A couple of old ladies are horrified.\r\n                         \r\n          The funeral director motions to his assistants that now is the\r\n          time to move the coffin out. Hesitantly, they obey. Hesher looks\r\n          over from the floor.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER (CONT'D)\r\n           Leave her alone.

This is your last\r\n           chance.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher seems overcome with emotion, he continues pushing the\r\n          coffin toward the exit and out through the doors.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ and Dad watch him, unsure. After a moment, They follow him to\r\n          the door. They stand at the doors watching Hesher push the\r\n          coffin out into the parking lot.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ is overcome with emotion, his eyes well with tears. He heads\r\n          across the lot and catches up with Hesher, joining him on the\r\n          walk. Dad watches for a beat, his eyes well up too, then he does\r\n          the same.\r\n                         \r\n          All three are now walking together through the funeral home\r\n          parking lot with Grandma's coffin. They don't speak. It's a\r\n          release. Other mourners watch from the doorway.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher wheels Grandma's coffin across the parking lot with TJ\r\n          and Dad beside him. They seem solemn and strangely dignified in\r\n          a dishevelled way.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the street.\r\n          Traffic passes around them. Some cars come to a complete stop.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other side of\r\n          the street and the three continue their silent walk with\r\n          Grandma.\r\n                         \r\n          In slow motion the three walk. Dad puts his arm around TJ's\r\n          shoulders, TJ puts his arm around Dad's.\r\n                         \r\n          And then a cop car cruises beside them slow. The cops inside\r\n          watch them. Dad looks over. One of the cops smiles.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. FORNEY HOUSE - EVENING\r\n                         \r\n          The cop car pulls up outside the house. The back door opens and\r\n          Hesher falls out onto the sidewalk, still very drunk. Dad climbs\r\n          out and steps over Hesher helping him to his feet. A cop speaks\r\n          to them from the open window.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           109.\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          OFFICER\r\n                          (SMILING)\r\n           You'll get him to bed now, won't you?\r\n                         \r\n                          DAD\r\n           That's the plan.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher squirms and slurs.\r\n                         \r\n                          HESHER\r\n           Get your hands off me, pig.\r\n                         \r\n                          DAD\r\n           That's the plan.\r\n                         \r\n          The cop gives them a casual wave as their car pulls away. TJ and\r\n          Dad help Hesher across the lawn to the front door. We hold on\r\n          the house for a beat.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Golden\r\n          sunlight pours in through the windows.\r\n                         \r\n          A moment later he lathers his face up with shaving cream.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. FORNEY HOUSE / TJ'S ROOM - MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          There's a gentle knock at the door. TJ wakes and makes a big\r\n          stretch. His hair's a mess.\r\n                         \r\n                          TJ\r\n           Come in.\r\n                         \r\n          Dad enters, he's clean-shaven now.

FORNEY HOUSE / GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER\r\n                         \r\n          The garage door is open. The garage is flooded with daylight and\r\n          no sign of Hesher.\r\n                         \r\n          TJ and Dad walks across the garage to the open door. At the\r\n          garage's entrance they stop. Their eyes register something\r\n          seriously unusual outside.\r\n                         \r\n          'Master of Puppets' by Metallica punches in. LOUD.\r\n                         \r\n          A giant red cube of Volvo scrap metal has been placed in the\r\n          center of the driveway like a huge piece of abstract art. They\r\n          stand and stare at it, almost in awe.\r\n                         \r\n          Then from the across the street, we see the object in the\r\n          driveway and TJ and Dad on the porch looking at it.\r\n                         \r\n          We also see the words 'HESHER WAS HERE!' spray painted on the\r\n          front of the house in big letters, as yet unseen by TJ and Dad.\r\n          Dad puts his arm around TJ's shoulders.\r\n                         \r\n          On the beat we CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         HESHER MOMENTS:\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher ripping on the guitar; Hesher blowing something up;\r\n          Hesher cupping a fart and putting it in TJ's face; Hesher\r\n          pantsing Dad; Hesher metal saluting Grandma and Grandma saluting\r\n          him back.\r\n                         \r\n          Hesher behind the wheel of his van, smoking a cigarette and\r\n          making a direct line for the setting sun.\r\n                         \r\n          A mouse sits an in a tiny armchair like a human, shelling a\r\n          peanut.
