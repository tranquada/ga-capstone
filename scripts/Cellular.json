In the\ndistance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the\nDowntown Los Angeles skyline.\nIn ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal\nthe vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.\nHOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a\ngleaming mountain bike...

PLEASE--//\nSMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above\nJessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that\nhung there.\nAs phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns\nand stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking\nJessica in the darkness.\nOnly now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to\nshow through. Trembling, tears running down her face,\nJessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--\n\n\n\n                       JESSICA (CONT'D)\n            Wha... what the hell is happening?!\nThe attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\nTHE OCEAN\nSkimming along the water.\nAnd we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern\nCalifornia, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA\n\nPIER.\n\nEXT.
