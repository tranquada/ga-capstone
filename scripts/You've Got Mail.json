Mothers and fathers\n\ttaking their kids to school, people on their way to work,\n\tdogs being walked.  School buses picking up kids, bakery\n\ttrucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of\n\tunopened restaurants.\n\n\tKathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the \n\tnewsstand dealer, and picks up a New York Times.\n\n\tMetal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons,\n\tthe pharmacy, fish store, the Cuban Chinese Restaurant,\n\tZabar's.\n\n\tJoe stops at the same newsstand.

Yeah, sure.\n\n\tKathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which\n\trises, making a horrible noise.  Two cabs almost collide in\n\tfront of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts\n\tyelling obscenities at the other.  Kathleen unlocks the door\n\tto the store.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATHLEEN\n\t\tDon't you love New York in the fall?\n\n\tChristina looks at her puzzled.\n\n\tINT.

Oh my, do children not\n\t\teven know what handkerchiefs are?  A\n\t\thandkerchief is a Kleenex you don't throw\n\t\taway.  My mother embroidered it for me --\n\t\tyou see?
