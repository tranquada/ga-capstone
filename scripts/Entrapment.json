HANCOCK TOWER, CHICAGO - LATE NIGHT\n\n     Lake Shore Drive.  Four o'clock in the morning.  Minimal traffic,\n     minimal life.  As MAIN TITLES BEGIN, we PAN UP the face of...\n\n     ...Hancock Tower.  Up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark\n     up here, street sounds fading fast, and as CREDITS CONTINUE we can\n     just make out...\n\n     ...a dark FIGURE.  Like a spider.  Inching its way up the steel\n     surface of the 98th floor, and we CLOSE to see...\n\n     The THIEF.  All in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored\n     helmet that conceals the face.  Two long, oblong backpacks, climb-\n     ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt.\n     Moving STRAIGHT UP the face of the skyscraper.  How is it possible?\n     CLOSER still to see...\n\n     ...the piton-like BOLTS are electromagnetic, CLANKING to the steel\n     to support weight.  A button releases the magnetic charge when the\n     bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position.  The Thief is\n     remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision,\n     until...\n\n     ...our summit.  A softly-lit, glass-walled PENTHOUSE on the\n     100th floor.  Subtle spots which bathe paintings, sculptures,\n     in a cavernous coldly-decorated space.\n\n     Swiftly, deftly, the Thief rigs a suction-mounted HARNESS to the\n     steel casing above a massive window.  Pulleys, metal caribiner\n     clips, yellow Kevlar ropes.  So superbly practiced, the rigging is\n     placed in seconds, huge SUCTION CUPS pressed to the surface of the\n     glass.  The Thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the\n     rigging, touches a button, a motor WHINES, the ropes TIGHTEN and\n     the window...\n\n     ...POPS FREE, hangs SUSPENDED by the Kevlar ropes which amazingly\n     sustain its awesome weight.  The huge pane shudders in the wind,\n     and the Thief slips...\n\n     ...INTO the Penthouse.  Nearby, an ALARM BOX softly BEEPS its\n     60-second warning to the pulsing of a green light, and the Thief\n     attaches a small computerized DEVICE which runs a series of\n     possible CODES at dazzling speed on its display panel, until...\n\n     ...the right one STOPS.  Illuminated in red.  The beeping, the\n     green light, go OFF.  The device is removed.\n\n     Back to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction-\n     mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig\n     in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling\n     window pane.  A small remote control clicker...\n\n     ...RELEASES the outside suction cups.  The window's weight now\n     supported by the interior rigging.  The outside equipment pulled\n     INTO the apartment in a single tug.  The WHINE of a motor, and the\n     pane pulls UP, the Thief expertly POPPING it into place.\n\n     No trace of entry.\n\n     Rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle,\n     the Thief SCANS...\n\n     ...the profusion of priceless art.  The paintings run to Otto Dix,\n     Franz Marc, Marcel Duchamp.  One statue an obvious Rodin.  The soft\n     lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity\n     perspective in mind.  An obsidian slab dining table that seems to\n     end at the horizon.\n\n     The Thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin-\n     drical TUBE bearing a label we can't read.  Knows the way, quickly\n     through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early German\n     expressionists, Russian futurists, a Rothko, a Kandinsky, a Francis\n     Bacon.  The Thief has no interest in these, and as CREDITS CONTINUE,\n     we enter...\n\n     ...a powder room.  A lime-green poured concrete sink, a copper-\n     plated commode, and across from these...\n\n     ...a single PAINTING.  Unlike the others, clearly an Old Master.\n     A 17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient\n     bridge.  The Thief wastes no time, unceremoniously...\n\n     ...CUTS the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes.\n     Rolls it quickly in acid-free paper.  Opens the cylindrical tube,\n     pulling out...\n\n     ...another CANVAS which we cannot see.  Deftly unrolls this,\n     fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now-empty frame.\n     Re-hangs it.  Stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor.\n     Approves.  Slips the rolled-up stolen canvas into the empty tube.\n     Leaves.  Before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement\n     canvas...\n\n     A cheerful acrylic portrait.  Bozo the Clown.\n\n     WITH the Thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library.  There is\n     a CHUTE built into the wall, a brass lid with the words U.S. MAIL.\n     The Thief pops the labeled tube DOWN the chute.  Gone.  Steps...\n\n     ...onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating,\n     and...\n\n     Disappears into the vent.  Reaching back to refit the grating\n     seamlessly into place.\n\n     INT. VENT\n\n     Halogen flashlight leading the way, our Thief shimmies down the\n     narrow space, arriving at...\n\n     ...an open vertical AIR SHAFT, BLASTING air straight up the 100\n     floor height of the skyscraper, with frightening FORCE.  Calmly,\n     the Thief clips on a different harness, unzips a nylon cover from\n     the backpack, and simply...\n\n     LEAPS DOWN the air shaft, startling the shit out of us, as, for an\n     instant...\n\n     ...the force of the updraft seems to HOLD the Thief in place,\n     suspended above 100 stories of nothingness.  Then suddenly, the\n     Thief...\n\n     ...DROPS SHARPLY, an exhilarating moment of absolute FREE FALL,\n     until a cord is tugged and...\n\n     ...a nylon PARACHUTE OPENS with a pop.  We watch the Thief drifting\n     lazily down.  A ride any kid would pay big money for...\n\n     EXT. HANCOCK TOWER - LATE NIGHT\n\n     Our original exterior VIEW of the skyscraper's penthouse.  REVERSE\n     ANGLE now to see in far distance...\n\n     ...the dense forest of silhouetted OFFICE TOWERS of downtown\n     Chicago against the night sky, and we ZOOM TOWARD them, covering\n     miles in three seconds, to CLOSE on...\n\n     ...the highest floor of the SEARS TOWER, and THROUGH an unlit\n     window to see...\n\n     ...a TELESCOPE.  A silhouetted FIGURE looking through it.  SNAP\n     to...\n\n     VIEW through the scope's lens.  An amazingly CLOSE detail of the\n     Hancock Tower Penthouse.  The scope now PANS DOWN the length of the\n     Tower, to...\n\n     The street.  The Thief climbing onto a battered old Lambretta.\n     Calm as you please.  And as the scooter glides off...\n\n     We HEAR our unseen voyeur WALK AWAY from our telescope.  A door\n     OPENS somewhere, and as CREDITS CONCLUDE, it...\n\n     Closes.  Softly.\n\n     INT. WEBBER ASSURANCE - DAY\n\n     A basement corridor.  Long, bare, dimly lit.  Silent.  We're in the\n     bowels of somewhere.  A startling CLANK, like a prison cell\n     unlocking.  A FIGURE enters the corridor, coming this way, on the\n     hurried side of brisk.\n\n     HECTOR CRUZ is 42, tanned, fit, graying hair swept back in a Pat\n     Riley do.  He wears Riley's Armani, too.  Maybe this guy coaches.\n     Heels ECHO until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering...\n\n     NO ADMITTANCE FOR ANY REASON.  There is a dull silver rectangle\n     below the words.  He holds his hand up to it...\n\n     Nothing happens.  Shit.  Dries his palm on his perfectly-creased\n     slacks.  One more time.  CLICK.  Enters...\n\n     INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY\n\n     An unexpectedly VAST semi-circular room, the entire inner circum-\n     ference made up of a single continuous WALL SCREEN, separated into\n     a seamless array of IMAGES...\n\n     Three-dimensional rotating GRAPHICS of every room in the Hancock\n     Tower Penthouse, SCHEMATICS of electrical, plumbing, and ventila-\n     tion systems.  See-through rotating multicolored models of every\n     piece of security EQUIPMENT imaginable, components FLASHING as\n     performance simulations are run.  Rapid-fire sequences of indiv-\n     idual human PROFILES, complete with photos and bio blurbs.  Screens\n     flickering with blizzards of DATA, hurtling past at warp speed.\n\n     The Pentagon and CNN would kill for this room.\n\n     The largest segment of screen, twenty feet square, runs a LIVE FEED\n     from the crime scene.  The living room of the Penthouse, crawling\n     with slow-moving cops and technicians, doing their slow-moving\n     thing.  Surrounding this image are a dozen smaller screens, showing\n     this and other rooms from a variety of camera angles.  All live.\n     We see the library, the mail chute.  The powder room.  Bozo.\n\n     Cruz skips down three steps to floor level, nine separate CONTROL\n     STATIONS, each outfitted with super-tech panels to process the\n     avalanche of information.  But today, all stations are empty.\n\n     Except one.\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     Baker.  You got it solved?\n\n     And now we see her.  From the rear.  Slouched at her station.\n     Looks like a skinny teenager in tousled tawny hair, rumpled\n     oversized workshirt, vintage jeans.\n\n                               GIN (O.S., from the rear)\n                     Actually.  Yeh.\n\n     Not a kid's voice.  Throaty.  Music and whiskey and sex and\n     effortless confidence.  Even the voice turns us on.\n\n                               CRUZ (glances at his watch)\n                     What took you so long, Gin?  I\n                     called 4:30 this morn...\n\n     And stops.  Because she turns with a look that would freeze anyone\n     to stone.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I was with someone, all right?\n\n     Now we really see her.  Delicate bones and features, slender body,\n     radiating the power of a natural heart-stopping beauty.  GINGER\n     BAKER is 32, ethereal and feral at once.  Electric green eyes\n     crackle with an intellect and a will that are not to be fucked\n     with.\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     So?  This is work.\n\n     He is not kidding.  Stainless steel beneath the dapper.  They are a\n     matched team.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Hector, I hardly know the guy.\n                     Why be impolite to strangers?\n\n     And he smiles.  Maybe she's lying.  He likes her.\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     Look at those assholes...\n\n     He means the cops on live feed.\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     If the Vermeer were lying on that\n                     table, they'd toss their doughnuts\n                     on it.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Yeh, well, they didn't insure it,\n                     so they don't have to solve this.\n                     To them it's a crime.  To us it's 24\n                     mil, less re-insurance, which is...\n\n                               CRUZ (grim)\n                     Only thirty percent, Gin.\n\n     Ouch.  Really?\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     Which is why you're on this.\n\n     Soft and straight.  You're the best.  I need you.\n\n                               GIN\n                     He came in through the window.\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     That's not possib...\n\n                               GIN\n                     What's not possible is entry through\n                     the doors or the vents.  That would\n                     have triggered instant alarm.\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     The windows are wired, too.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Only for trauma.  They used smart\n                     glass, where the sensors respond to\n                     violation of the panel's integrity.\n\n     He's listening.  He always does with her.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I think he scaled the wall, popped\n                     the frame.  In one piece.\n\n     She sounds awfully positive.  Then again, she always does.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Then, he only had to deal with\n                     heat and motion sensors.  They\n                     were on 60-second delay, so the\n                     owner wouldn't trigger the alarm\n                     just be walking arou...\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     The pane weighs 200 pounds, the\n                     building's 1100 feet high.\n\n                               GIN\n                     This particular guy is the best.\n                     The best there ever was.\n\n     Almost as if she knows who.  Cruz shakes his head...\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     Popping the frame would trigger\n                     the alarm.\n\n     She smiles.  First time.  Even at one-tenth power, it is dazzling\n     light.  She touches the panel before her...\n\n                               GIN (gently)\n                     I wrote a program and ran it, Dumbo.\n\n     The live feed is replaced by a red-outlined rotating three-\n     dimensional DIAGRAM of the living room.  The alarm box glows green.\n     One window pane glows lavender.  She touches the panel, and the\n     window SHATTERS, the alarm instantly emits a PIERCING SCREECH.\n\n     Reset.  As he watches.  This time the window SLIDES AWAY into\n     thin air.  No sound.  A stick figure appears, crawls through the\n     opening, and the alarm begins the slow BEEP we heard last night.\n     Cruz just stares.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Here's how I figured it out...\n\n     Live feed replaces the diagram.  Our camera ZOOMS toward a VASE of\n     lilies by the window.  All the flowers are tilted in one direction.\n     Over the lip of the vase, away from the window.\n\n                               GIN\n                     No one arranges flowers like that.\n                     It was the draft from the window.\n\n     He turns to her.\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     You said.  This particular guy.\n\n     Now she is beaming.  Excited.  And just above a whisper...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Andrew MacDougal.\n\n     Delighted at his stupefied reaction.\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     Why not Houdini?  Or Pretty Boy\n                     Floyd?  Maybe Jesus Christ.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Because they couldn't do it.\n\n     His slow smile.  This fucking kid.\n\n                               CRUZ\n                     He's been out of the business.\n                     For ten years.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Maybe not.  No one ever proved,\n                     hell, even arrested him, for\n                     stealing anything.  But we all\n                     know he was numero ichiban for\n                     thirty years.

Because of the Bozo switch?\n                     Guys have been copying his pack-\n                     rat signature for decades.  Maybe\n                     the thief wanted it to look like\n                     MacDougal.\n\n     She doesn't even answer.  Just touches her panel, and one of the\n     data screens BLOWS UP to huge size.

You\n                     are in room...?\n\n                               GIN (half a beat)\n                     One thirty-eight.\n\n     In one motion, he flags the bartender...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Will you send a half-bottle of\n                     Chateau d'Yquem '67 to Room 138,\n                     please?  And some berries and\n                     chocolates for the lady to enjoy\n                     it with.\n\n     He presses some currency into the barkeep's hand.  Turning back...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Actually, I was just across the\n                     room, dickering with a gentleman\n                     over the purchase of an interesting\n                     Spitzweg.  Until I determined the\n                     painting was apparently stolen...\n\n     Oh.   She's shocked.  He agrees...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Goes against my grain.  The\n                     DeKooning in your slide, the 4.6\n                     million you can get for 3.  Can\n                     you get it for 2 and a half?\n\n     She looks in his eyes.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Sure.\n\n     And as if he believed her...\n\n                               MAC\n                     My checkbook is in my safe.  You\n                     wait here.\n\n     His smile evaporates.  He is gone before she can say...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Okay.  I'll wait here.\n\n     INT. CAR, SHINJUKU DISTRICT - NIGHT\n\n     Mac driving in silence.  Gin stealing glances at him.  Suddenly and\n     smoothly, he reaches down, and picks up...\n\n                               GIN\n                     That's my purse.\n\n     He opens it.  One eye on the road, he begins to rummage...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Just want to see if I'm with the\n                     person you say you are.  Can't be\n                     too caref...\n\n     She SNATCHES the bag away from him, he GRABS it back, the car\n     SWERVES LEFT, and...\n\n     ...CRASHES VIOLENTLY into a parked pure white Bentley.  Metal\n     BUCKLES and TEARS, both ALARMS go OFF, a cacophony of horrific\n     NOISE.\n\n                               MAC (quietly)\n                     Oh, dear.\n\n     People come RUNNING, but our focus is drawn to the refined elderly\n     COUPLE who were just returning to their precious Bentley.  Their\n     WAILS and ANGUISH would be suitable if all their grandchildren had\n     been crushed beneath Mac's wheels.\n\n     Mac and Gin are OUT of the car.  As he exits, Mac has palmed a\n     small BLADE, and in a quick unseen motion, RIPPED a jagged tear\n     in his left trouser leg.  The old couple RUSH to Mac, SHRIEKING\n     their rage and grief in Japanese, Gin is trying to calm them as\n     bystanders gather, but Mac cuts through...\n\n                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)\n                     We'll go in there, and call\n                     the police.\n\n     And HOBBLES off toward the nearest building, a block-square\n     30-story skyscraper bearing the name FUJITSU.  The couple, the\n     crowd, all race after the limping Mac...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Are you all right?\n\n     No answer, he looks dark enough to rain.  INTO the public lobby of\n     the huge industrial complex.  Two night GUARDS come hurrying from\n     their desk, as the small mob POURS in.  Mac in the lead, a\n     commanding presence, tells the guards in a loud, clear voice...\n\n                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)\n                     I have damaged the car of these\n                     kind people.  Please help them\n                     call the police...\n\n     One guard leads the hysterical couple toward a phone.  Mac pulls up\n     his trouser leg, and Gin GASPS to see a bloody GASH.  Mac drops the\n     trouser back over the wound.  Asks the remaining guard...\n\n                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)\n                     May I use a washroom, please.\n\n     The guard nods absently, disoriented by the chaos.  Mac hands his\n     billfold to Gin...\n\n                               MAC\n                     These are my papers, passport, car\n                     registration.  If the police arri...\n\n                               GIN\n                     You're going to need stitches,\n                     let me get you to a hospital.\n\n     Soft words, genuine concern.  And his eyes flicker.  As if somehow\n     seeing her for the first time.  A small spark, but she feels it.\n     Softer still...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Really, this can all wait.\n                     I'll handle it.\n\n     The look holds.\n\n                               MAC\n                     That's actually.  Very sweet.\n\n     His first real smile.  It was worth waiting for.\n\n                               MAC (to a guard, subtitled Japanese)\n                     Might you have a First Aid kit,\n                     of some kind?\n\n     INT. TOILET STALL\n\n     We are inside an empty, closed, Japanese-style toilet stall.\n     Porcelain foot rests.  A hole.  The door BURSTS OPEN, and...\n\n     ...Mac enters FAST with the First Aid kit, locking the door,\n     hitting the STOPWATCH on his wrist, which begins counting at\n     ZERO.  He pulls UP his trouser leg, revealing the bloody gash,\n     and simply...\n\n     ...RIPS the entire wound OFF, the rubbery prosthetic wound DANGLES,\n     dripping its phony blood.  Mac pulls gauze strips from the kit,\n     SOAKS them in bogus gore, expertly WRAPS his leg, then FLUSHES the\n     prosthetic DOWN the hole.\n\n     He pulls off the FUJITSU VISITOR badge clipped to his lapel, and\n     from a Ziploc bag slides a small sheet of plastic, which he PRESSES\n     to the face of the badge, fitting perfectly, turning the badge\n     into...\n\n     ...an EMPLOYEE I.D., the name KAWAKUBO, M., the PHOTO of a surly\n     Japanese male.  Quickly, Mac takes out the MATCH BOX from the hotel\n     bar, and with a fine tweezers gently removes the MICROCHIP, placing\n     it INSIDE the badge, activating it with a soft BEEP-BEEP.  He\n     reaches now...\n\n     ...behind his back, up UNDER his tux jacket, and RIPS FREE a\n     tightly-compressed PACK of what seems white paper or cloth.  He\n     SNAPS it loose, revealing it to be...\n\n     ...a baggy CLEAN SUIT, not unlike hospital scrubs and falling to\n     the floor...\n\n     ...a white HOOD.  With opaque tinted VISOR.\n\n     INT. SECURITY CORRIDOR\n\n     Mac in his clean suit and opaque-visored hood at an elevator marked\n     CLEARED PERSONNEL ONLY in English and Kanji (Japanese characters).\n     He holds his badge to the SCANNER, the door PINGS and slides OPEN..\n\n     INT. PREP ROOM ENTRANCE, 29TH FLOOR\n\n     Mac emerging from his elevator at the entrance to an AIR-LOCK with\n     sign CLEAN ROOM - CLASS 10.  Holds his badge to the SCANNER, the\n     air-lock door lights FLASH froin red to yellow to green.  He\n     enters...\n\n     ...the PREP ROOM.  Recorded VOICES purr safety instructions in\n     Japanese, while Mac stands, being bombarded by air shower, chemical\n     sprayer, blinding UV light.  The next air-lock OPENS.  He enters...\n\n     INT. CLEAN ROOM\n\n     ...a long ASSEMBLY LINE, where ROBOT ARMS work on a stream of black\n     SILICON WAFERS, which pass along a clear Lexan CONVEYOR BELT.  The\n     wafers move through various airtight CHAMBERS, exposing them to\n     multi-colored gasses, cyan, sodium yellow, magenta, etc., as part\n     of the microchip manufacturing process.\n\n     More than a dozen TECHNICIANS in their hooded clean suits watch\n     over every phase of the work, attached to the walls by grounding\n     wires and air hoses, which create a deafening NOISE.  Mac simply\n     hooks himself up, and saunters straight THROUGH the area, toward\n     the place where the conveyor belt with its newly-processed\n     MICROCHIPS...\n\n     ...DISAPPEARS through the wall.  Nearby, a HATCH is built into the\n     same wall, and Mac calmly CLANKS it OPEN, squeezing through into...\n\n     ...a dimly-lit MAINTENANCE BAY.  Panels of switches, wires, fuses,\n     fans, air cleaners.  Maximum claustrophobia, as Mac CLANGS the\n     hatch SHUT behind him, looking instantly to...\n\n     ...an OVERHEAD HATCH with letters in Kanji and English, DANGER\n     ARGON GAS.  Mac THROWS back his hood, YANKS out his mini oxygen\n     pouch, fits the slender forked breathing tube into his nostrils,\n     and slips on thick round infrared GOGGLES that make him look like a\n     refugee from 12 MONKEYS.  No time to lose...\n\n     ...up THROUGH the overhead hatch, closing it behind him as he\n     enters...\n\n     ...the conveyer TUBE, a horizontal Lexan cylinder three feet in\n     diameter, filled with billowing red gas.  Mac stretches out on his\n     belly, glancing up to where the clear conveyor belt, with its\n     precious cargo of microchips, runs along just above his head in\n     eerie red light.  He begins to...\n\n     ...shimmy, crawl, squirm along the length of the tube.  Gas too\n     thick to see the end.  He is agile as a commando, hauling ass, when\n     suddenly...\n\n     ...the floor beneath his tube FALLS AWAY, and he is crawling in\n     space 29 stories above Tokyo, as his tube spans the distance\n     between manufacturing and shipping structures.  He goes faster,\n     HARDER...\n\n     INT. MICROCHIP VAULT\n\n     A black chamber.  We can scarcely make out the endless rows of\n     shelving, the air purifying equipment, the conveyor belt entering\n     through its air lock, as machinery folds each priceless microchip\n     in foil wrappers, stacks them on shelves.  Through the gasket...\n\n     ...Mac TUMBLES into view, swinging himself neatly DOWN to the\n     floor, and in a single motion, he is already FLASHING a neon-green\n     pen light along the shelves of microchips.  We see now the wrappers\n     are different colors, with different Kanji characters, and Mac is\n     definitely looking for something special, until...\n\n     ...he's found it.  A single row, 35 chips, nothing special from\n     here, but Mac...\n\n     ...WHIPS out something coiled, SNAPS it to full length, revealing a\n     strip of shiny black SATIN CLOTH.  Three feet long, little more\n     than an inch wide.  Carefully, Mac lays the strip down directly\n     OVER the row of microchips.  And when he lifts it UP again...\n\n     ...the chips have ADHERED to the underside of the cloth.  In one\n     deft SNAP of his wrist, he COILS the cloth again, like a yo-yo.\n     Turns to leave, and...\n\n     Oh, yeh.\n\n     Tosses a small SACK of something where the chips used to be.  TIM'S\n     CASCADE BRAND POTATO CHIPS.  SEA SALT AND VINEGAR FLAVOR.\n\n     INT. CLEAN ROOM\n\n     Mac exiting from the maintenance hatch back into the Clean Room.\n     No one sees, no one cares.  Hooking up once again, he ambles toward\n     a door clearly marked EXIT ONLY TO EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - RETURN ONLY\n     THROUGH SECURITY AREA.\n\n     By the door is an employee notice tacked to the wall.  He pretends\n     to scan it.  A stack of flyers.  He takes one.  Exiting into...\n\n     INT. EMPLOYEE LOUNGE\n\n     Past a changing area, vending machines, guys bullshitting.  Mac\n     just strolling along, reading his flyer, as...\n\n     A hand.  Touches his shoulder\n\n                               VOICE (subtitled Japanese)\n                     Excuse me.\n\n     Mac turns, stares through his opaque VISOR at a well-built SECURITY\n     OFFICER.  Dead straight eyes.\n\n                               OFFICER (subtitled Japanese)\n                     The company picnic.  Saturday or\n                     Sunday?\n\n     His eyes cut to the flyer Mac is 'reading'.  Mac hands it to him,\n     and without a trace of Scottish accent...\n\n                               MAC (subtitled Japanese)\n                     Better eat first.\n\n     INT. GUEST LOBBY\n\n     Gin is up to her ears in grief.  There are no less than five COPS\n     grilling her, taking notes, while the old couple has their second\n     wind and are SHRIEKING in top form.  The bystander gallery has\n     grown to maybe three dozen, and they're all getting their word in.\n     As Gin struggles to cope...\n\n     ...she keeps looking at the clock.  Darting glances toward the\n     corridor.  She is freaking out.\n\n     Finally.  She can't stand it.  Hands Mac's billfold to one of the\n     cops, pushes her way through the mob, and...\n\n     ...TAKES OFF down the corridor, a security guard in belated\n     pursuit, we go...\n\n     ...WITH her DOWN the hallway, WHEEL around a corner, flat-out\n     SPRINTING, SKIDS to a stop at the right doorway and BURSTS INTO...\n\n     INT. MEN'S ROOM\n\n     An empty washroom.  She listens.  Nothing.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Mr. MacDougal?  Sir?\n\n     No sound.  Uh-oh.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Uh.  Mr. Ma...\n\n                               MAC (O.S., from the stall)\n                     Just 'Mac'.  And whatever became\n                     of a gentleman's privacy?\n\n     The security guard BARGES IN.\n\n                               MAC (O.S.)\n                     My God, more females?\n\n     The guard starts railing at Gin a mile a minute.  She calmly takes\n     a WAD of bills from her purse.  Hands them to the guy...\n\n                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)\n                     Stand outside.  That door.  Two\n                     minutes...\n\n     He does.  Alone again.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I was worried, it's been twenty...\n\n                               MAC (O.S.)\n                     Eighteen, actually.  The leg is\n                     fine, but I got sort of...woozy.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Woozy.\n\n                               MAC (O.S.)\n                     Lost my stomach once or twice.\n\n     CUT INSIDE the stall.  He is just re-taping the folded clean suit\n     and hood to the small of his back.\n\n                               MAC\n                     I'm an old man.  You probably\n                     noticed.\n\n     Awkward silence.  He smiles at that, much amused.  Slips on his\n     jacket.\n\n                               MAC\n                     You should see me without\n                     my teeth.\n\n     UNLOCKS the door.

He pulls OUT the coiled black satin\n     cloth strip, SNAPS it free, microchips snug to the underside.  And\n     fits it neatly...\n\n     ...DOWN his trouser leg.  The perfect tuxedo stripe.\n\n     OUT the door.  To meet her gaze.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Odd place, this.\n\n     He goes to her.

And you're off to...?\n\n                               MAC\n                     Oh, that's highly personal.\n\n     He still stares straight ahead.  The taxi pulls onto a freeway.\n     Toward Narita Airport.  Time running out.  And in her dearest, most\n     vulnerable, voice...\n\n                               GIN\n                     I did so hope to impress you.\n\n     She puts the fingertips of her left hand.  On his chest.  A\n     silence.  No reaction.\n\n                               GIN (hopeful)\n                     I'm still hoping...\n\n     And he smiles.  Turns to her eyes.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Young lady.  I am old enough to\n                     be your grandfather.\n\n     She shakes her head.  Uh-uh.\n\n                               GIN (soft)\n                     My father.\n\n     Leans her mouth in for the kill.\n\n                               GIN (whisper)\n                     That's part of the rush.\n\n     And softly.  Fits her mouth to his.  The green eyes close, as\n     she tastes him.  Nothing predatory in this kiss.  It is tender,\n     exquisite.  A kiss of deep longing.  Of true love.\n\n     His arms slip around her.  And in less than five seconds...\n\n                               TAXI DRIVER (O.S., racist accent)\n                     Still on fo' airport?\n\n     Nobody.  Says.  Nothin'.\n\n     INT. MAC'S SUITE - LATE NIGHT\n\n     A small bottle.  An ornate label.  Chateau d'Yquem '67.  Gin lifts\n     it from the table, studies the label.  She wears only a man's\n     oversized t-shirt.  Our rotating ANGLE reveals the empty bed,\n     tangled sheets.  Gin looks pretty rumpled herself.\n\n     She lifts the bottle, two glasses, a plateful of chocolates and\n     strawberries, and goes to the sliding glass door overlooking...\n\n     ...the TERRACE.  Mac sits on a futon at the balcony railing,\n     overlooking downtown Tokyo.  He wears a thin Japanese robe called\n     a yukata, and is wrapped in half of a huge down COVERLET from the\n     bed.  The other half obviously waiting for...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Here.  A reward.\n\n     She curls down into the billowing coverlet, just against his body.\n     Sets her things beside him.\n\n                               MAC\n                     A reward for what?\n\n                               GIN\n                     For not being old.  After all.\n\n     It is a lovely smile.  He studies it for a beat.\n\n                               MAC\n                     You mean.  Not as old as I look.\n\n     She traces her finger along his cheek.\n\n                               GIN (a whisper)\n                     Yeh.\n\n     And kisses him.  It takes awhile.  She seems to enjoy it.  With\n     him, it's harder to tell.  When she pulls back...\n\n     ...he picks up a chocolate.  Tears it in half.  Offers her the\n     larger piece.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Do I deserve a reward?\n\n     No answer.  He puts the chocolate into her mouth.  With great\n     tenderness, he traces the line of her lower lip.  As she swallows.\n\n                               GIN\n                     It's so hard to find good casual\n                     sex, anymore.  I'm probably out\n                     of practice.\n\n     But he just looks at her.\n\n                               MAC\n                     What's hard to find.  Is someone\n                     you truly want to be with.\n\n     And leans closer.  Just above a whisper...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Even for awhile.\n\n     He kisses her.  Beautiful and deep, the way he does it.  And\n     when he pulls back, she is staring at him.  As if at a loss for\n     something to say.\n\n                               GIN\n                     It's lucky we stopped by my room,\n                     for the wine.\n\n     She swallows.  Because his gaze is unrelenting. As if not\n     forgetting that she's changed the subject.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Otherwise, we'd never have found\n                     my bag was stolen.  Until tomorrow.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Would that make it more stolen?\n\n     She smiles.  His face looks kind now, not formidable at all.  Maybe\n     she's wondering if she actually likes him.\n\n                               GIN\n                     They even got my prescriptions.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Something you need? There are\n                     all-night chemists...\n\n     He does look concerned.  And therefore sweet.  She kisses his nose.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I take Prilosec.  For stomach\n                     acid.  And an inhaler.  For asthma.\n\n     She gets her old smile.  The soft, wicked tease.\n\n                               GIN\n                     But since I didn't have to work\n                     all that hard tonight...\n\n     He stares at her.  Cocks a finger, like a gun, right between her\n     eyes.  Pantomimes pulling the trigger.\n\n                               GIN (softly)\n                     Ouch.  I had that coming.\n\n     She pivots, and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest.  He\n     wraps strong arms around her.  Pulling her close.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Why would someone steal my luggage?\n                     Every guest in this place must\n                     have more than a wannabe art dealer.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Ah.  Maybe the thief thought you\n                     had something valuable in there.\n\n     Something in the tone.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Such as...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Well.  Wannabe dealers make\n                     excellent fences.\n\n     A flicker.  In her eyes.  And she cuddles back.  As if enjoying the\n     humor.\n\n                               GIN\n                     He thought I had a stolen\n                     painting.  In my bag.\n\n                               MAC\n                     I'm joking, of course.\n\n     Kisses the top of her head.\n\n                               MAC\n                     The Vermeer wouldn't fit.\n\n     Her eyes widen.  Just a little.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Excuse me?\n\n                               MAC\n                     Why, did you do something wrong?\n\n     She turns all the way around.  Their faces are inches apart.  Each\n     reading the other's eyes.\n\n                               GIN\n                     You said.  Vermeer.\n\n                               MAC\n                     The most famous painting stolen\n                     this week.\n\n     His turn.  To kiss her nose.\n\n                               MAC\n                     If you don't keep up on your\n                     craft.  You'll miss all the jokes.\n\n     And lowers her gently onto her back.  Still staring in her eyes, he\n     winds her legs around him.  Her mouth parts, but...\n\n     ...he fills it with his own.\n\n     This conversation.  Is over.\n\n     INT. MAC'S SUITE - MORNING\n\n     VIEW of the empty terrace, the rumpled, twisted coverlet.  Maybe\n     they spent all night.  HEAR the shower running full blast in a\n     distant bathroom.  PULL BACK to see...\n\n     Gin, hair wet, wrapped in a plush hotel robe, rapidly and expertly\n     going through dresser, night stand, closet, sofa cushions, every\n     goddam thing in the room.  She comes to...\n\n     ...Mac's tux.  The jacket, rifles the pockets, pats the lining.\n     The pants now...\n\n     ...something peculiar. The right leg has no stripe. Touches the\n     cloth.  Slightly sticky where the stripe should be.  Odd.\n\n     ANGLE...the bathroom.  Shower running full BLAST.  But there's no\n     one in it.\n\n     ANGLE...a storage closet.  Mac crouching in the smallspace.  We\n     see the travel bag.  The luggage tag, VIRGINIA ROMAY, a Darien,\n     Connecticut address.  The embossed initials VR.  But there is\n     something else in Mac's hand...\n\n     ...a prescription bottle.  Prilosec.  And a name, GINGER BAKER.\n     Chicago address.  Mac puts the pills in the pocket of his robe...\n\n     ...exits the closet.  Locks the door.\n\n     ANGLE...Mac ambling into the bedroom, toweling his hair with one\n     hand.  Holding his billfold in the other.  Gin is starting a room\n     service breakfast.  Eggs, sausage, Belgian waffles.  The girl can\n     eat.\n\n                               MAC\n                     I'm so glad I didn't leave Tokyo.\n\n     She looks up.  Trademark dry grin...\n\n                               GIN\n                     I love a guy who knows how to\n                     sweet talk.\n\n     He stands over her.  Smiling.  What he meant was...\n\n                               MAC\n                     There was a call.

Minor, but it is Giverny.\n                     He'll let me have it for 5.3 million.\n\n     She stares at him.\n\n                               GIN (cautiously)\n                     We can maybe beat that.\n\n                               MAC (pulling plastic from his billfold)\n                     I agree.  This is a bank debit card.\n                     It gives the bearer access to an\n                     account containing 4.6 and change.\n                     I dislike round numbers.\n\n     And hand. the card to her.

If\n                     that's all right.\n\n     Without looking up...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Me.\n\n                               MAC\n                     If I'm there, he'll haggle.  You\n                     just hand him the debit card, with\n                     that...luminous smile.  And say,\n                     take it or leave it.\n\n     Now her eyes come up.  She says nothing.  Hesitant.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Oh, dear.  I thought you so\n                     wanted to make a good impression.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Thought I already did th...\n\n                               MAC\n                     And along with making an excellent\n                     impression.  You will also make 2\n                     percent of the purchase price.\n\n     She blinks.\n\n                               MAC\n                     That's $92,000.

WHARF, YOKOHAMA - DAY\n\n     Gin climbing out of a taxi at a scruffy section of Yokohama's Bund.\n     Sleazy shops, pachinko parlors, hostess bars, sidewalk noodle\n     counters, all built along a tall rickety PIER nearly thirty feet\n     above the pounding surf.  The harbor is gigantic.  Every type and\n     size of vessel imaginable.\n\n     Gin carries a long neoprene-covered tube with watertight seals and\n     a lightweight bright orange foam cover.  She looks at her slip of\n     paper.  Then across at the place...KENDO SOUVENIRS, a schlock\n     kickback parlor, with a tourist bus parked out front.\n\n     This can't be right.  Pulls out the cellular phone.  Dials.\n\n                               MAC'S RECORDED VOICE (O.S.)\n                     You have reached the voice-mail\n                     of AMD Investments.

Checks the slip again.  Walks firmly across\n     the street, through the mobs of tourists, and into...\n\n     INT. KENDO SOUVENIRS - DAY\n\n     The place is huge, ramshackle, loaded with every piece of tourist\n     crap imaginable.  The only paintings on display are renderings of\n     big cats on black velvet.  She winds her way through, to a counter\n     at the back.  One guy there...\n\n                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)\n                     May I please speak with Mr. Okati.\n\n                               OKATI\n                     You doin' it.\n\n     The best we can say for the pudgy, balding fellow in the Hawaiian\n     shirt and spectacularly baggy trousers, is that he does not seem to\n     be the guy who is selling you a Monet.

The guy COUGHS horribly.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I'm from Mac.\n\n                               OKATI\n                     Lemme see card.\n\n     She hesitates.\n\n                               OKATI\n                     Four million, six hundred\n                     thirteen thousand, five hundred?\n\n     Wow.  He slaps his hand on the table.  Lay it down, toots.\n\n                               GIN\n                     You first.\n\n     He shrugs.  Lifts straight up, from beneath the counter...\n\n     ...a brown paper-wrapped rectangle.  Not much larger than two feet\n     square.  She can't even believe she's here, doing this.  Gestures\n     to him.  Open it up!\n\n     He obliges, COUGHING grossly all the while.  Unwrapped, the\n     painting does look like a Monet.  From here.  She stares at it.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Now bring me the real one.\n\n     He doesn't blink.\n\n                               OKATI\n                     This as real as it gets, lady.\n\n     And from within her pocket.  The cellular RINGS.  She takes it\n     out.  Puts it to her ear.\n\n                               MAC (O.S.)\n                     You got it?\n\n                               GIN (into phone)\n                     Is this an audition, a joke, or\n                     a rip-off?

Read what's\n                     in it.  Aloud.\n\n     She does.  Carefully unfolding several sheets of paper, maps...\n\n                               GIN (reading into phone)\n                     Shikoku Naru, a freighter, it\n                     says, Yokohama to Jakarta...dates,\n                     statistics...specs on some kind of\n                     machine, diag...\n\n                               MAC (O.S.)\n                     Papers back in the envelope,\n                     envelope back in the Ziploc, very\n                     quickly, without seeming to hurry...\n\n     Her eyes are flickering questions, but she does as she's told,\n     cradling the phone with her shoulder.\n\n                               MAC (O.S.)\n                     Now take the debit card from your\n                     purse, slipping the Ziploc into the\n                     purse as you do it, shielding the move\n                     from everyone in the room but Okati.\n\n     And she does.  More deftly than we could ever have imagined.  Like\n     a pro.\n\n                               MAC (O.S., quietly)\n                     Give him the card.\n\n     A beat.\n\n                               GIN (into phone)\n                     Mac, the painting's a forg...\n\n                               MAC (O.S., even quieter)\n                     This is a test.

In a pleasant smile.\n\n                               GIN (into phone)\n                     Yes, Mac, I do.\n\n                               MAC (0.5.)\n                     Now.  Hand him the card, and tell\n                     him in Japanese to pretend he is\n                     checking it by phone.  Tell him to\n                     take awhile, as if he's on hold.\n\n     She turns the sweet plastic smile to Okati.  Hands him the card...\n\n                               GIN (subtitled Japanese)\n                     Mac says, pretend you're checking\n                     this by phone, and take your ti...\n\n                               OKATI (subtitled Japanese)\n                     ...like I'm on hold, sure.\n\n     And suddenly, his eyes are keen and quick, and he is no longer some\n     schmuck in baggy pants.

She hops OVER the disgusting hole, boosts herself UP to the\n     small window, footfalls racing CLOSER, HOISTS herself HALFWAY\n     through, DROPPING the phone a scary 30 feet to the surf below, as\n     behind her, the door...\n\n     ...SLAMS OPEN and she FLIES OUT the window...\n\n                               GIN\n                     SHIIIIIIIIIIT...\n\n     WITH her in SLO-MO, kicking and flailing and grasping her shoulder\n     bag, and she...\n\n     HITS the ocean like a ton of bricks.  Disappears.  Comes up,\n     sputtering in the swirling water, as from out of the shadows of\n     the pilings...\n\n     ...an engine ROARS to life, the BLUR of a custom JETSKI, Mac\n     reaching to scoop the startled girl OUT of the water, and they...\n\n     ...BLAST OFF, as bullets RAIN helplessly after them.

The chase\n     is ON.  They speed toward the WAKE of a luxury liner, and as she\n     realizes...\n\n                               GIN\n                     OH NOOOOOO...\n\n     They SLAM INTO the wake HEAD ON, and are AIRBORNE for an amazing\n     distance, JOLTING back to the surface, RACING toward...\n\n     ...two gigantic FREIGHTERS which approach each other from opposite\n     directions.  The Harbor Patrol in hot pursuit, BLASTING its HORN...\n\n                               GIN\n                     WE'RE GONNA DIE, AREN'T WE?\n\n                               MAC\n                     JUST AS SOON AS I'M READY!\n\n     As we near the outbound freighter, Mac CUTS his speed.  Now the\n     Harbor Patrol is really gaining.\n\n                               GIN\n                     FASTER, NOT SLOWER, YOU TWIT!!\n\n                               MAC\n                     HAVE TO GIVE THEM A SPORTING\n                     CHANCE...\n\n     Cruising STRAIGHT TOWARD the part side of the outbound freighter,\n     as the inbound freighter begins to pass it on the far side...\n\n                               MAC\n                     ...SOMETHING WE SCOTS LEARNED\n                     FROM THE BRITS!\n\n     As the Harbor Patrol is nearly ON them, Mac VEERS suddenly AROUND\n     the stern of the outbound freighter, the Harbor patrol WHEELING\n     madly to pursue, only to find we are both CAREENING straight AT...\n\n     ...the starboard side of the inbound freighter, Mac CUTS his wheel\n     in an adroit nearly right-angle SWERVE, and hears the SCREAMS as\n     the Harbor patrol...\n\n     PLOWS INTO the freighter!  Wasting no time, he ACCELERATES into\n     maximum BURN, STREAKING toward the immensely crowded harbor and its\n     thousand vessels.  Gin can't help but look back at the impressive\n     crash site, mouthing a silent WOW.\n\n     Nearing the harbor, Mac CUTS speed completely, drifting between two\n     huge ships and...\n\n     ...vanishing from sight.\n\n     EXT. SMALL CHANNEL - DAY\n\n     The tiny Jetski cruises in a quiet channel, crowded with vessels of\n     all sizes, tugs, fishing boats, pleasure craft, junks, sampans, all\n     larger than we are.  Gin clings close to Mac, although it is no\n     necessary.  More like romantic.  She is still flushed with\n     the rush.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I guess you're gonna explain\n                     all this, huh?\n\n     But he says nothing.  Pulls out a water-tight duffle.  Hands it\n     back to her, without looking.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Dry clothes, you'll need them.\n                     In five minutes.\n\n     She takes the bag, confused.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I'm supposed to change?

No\n     one seems to be paying much attention.  What the hell.  She unzips\n     the bag, pulling out...\n\n                               GIN (astonished)\n                     These...these are mine!\n\n     He never looks around.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Found 'em in your room.  Perhaps\n                     the thief wasn't your size.\n\n     She stares at the back of his head.  wondering.  He is stripping\n     off his slickers.  A neatly-tailored SUIT beneath.\n\n                               MAC\n                     We have a business appointment.\n                     In four minutes.\n\n     Okay.

Begins drying herself\n     with a fluffy towel from the bag.\n\n                               MAC (never turns)\n                     Time has come to tell you.

Cold and warm, at once.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Or...\n\n     She slips the dry dress OVER her head.\n\n                               MAC\n                     ...you can spend the most\n                     interesting three weeks of\n                     your life.

He holds a stopwatch,\n     looking down the path, as...\n\n     ...Gin runs into view, steady stride, breathing hard, sheened with\n     sweat.  Approaching him, she slows to a stop.

BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Two figures stand in the shower, spray SOAKING their shorts and\n     tank tops.

As Mac keeps waving it,\n     she goes off line.  Concentrates.  Gets it right.  The wire PEELS\n     away...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Three and four...\n\n     EXT.

She maneuvers the\n     wooden prongs toward a pile of big rocks.  But as she positions\n     to scoop one up, her vehicle SWAYS WILDLY, and we PULL BACK to\n     see it is...\n\n     ...dangling from a CRANE, operated by Mac.  Gin stays with it,\n     concentrates, and on the next pass she glides her boards UNDER a\n     huge rock, LIFTING it awkwardly.  Ignoring the bumpy ride, she\n     pivots, and deposits her prize in place atop what has become...\n\n     ...a WALL of stones.\n\n                               GIN\n                     What the hell are we building?\n\n     He gives this some reflection.\n\n                               MAC\n                     A chalet, I think.

Fumbling\n     to BREAK the seal on a slender TUBE, which BURSTS, sending a GLOW\n     of yellow-green LIGHT in all directions.  She fits the flexible\n     tube around her head like a headlamp, pulling out...\n\n     ...a small ELECTRIC FAN with side HANDGRIPS of black metal.\n     Buffeted by the current, Gin manages to flip a small switch on the\n     housing of the fan, and...\n\n     ...nothing happens.  Again.  Nothing.  And again.  SHIT!  With a\n     supreme effort, she tries to ROLL herself upright, but...\n\n     ...can't quite make it.  Blind PANIC now, blowing bubbles, FLAILING\n     at the kayak, which suddenly...\n\n     ROLLS upright, manipulated by Mac.  She sputters and tries to\n     THROW the tethered fan at him, but it snaps back and SLAMS her\n     across the shoulder.  She is furious.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Get your fucking equipment\n                     together, man, this is a\n                     professional operation!!\n\n     EXT.

Don't breathe.\n\n     She nods, got it.  Focused.  suddenly, in the clearing before her,\n     a HOSTAGE SILHOUETTE TARGET pops up, the outline of a terrorist\n     shielding himself with a hostage, Gin's arm rising with a BLUR\n     and...\n\n     ...BLAMM, BLAMM, BLAMM!!!  The paper terrorist is NAILED in the\n     head.  Two out of three.  She lets out a thin stream of air.  Proud\n     of herself, but too cool to gloat.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Very, very nice.

A human spider, inching up the wall with\n     everything she's got.  She SLAMS the next hand rod down, and it...\n\n     ...slips.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Shit.\n\n     ...as she TUMBLES eighteen feet to...\n\n     DISAPPEAR in an ocean of STYROFOAM packing bubbles, which EXPLODE\n     in all directions like popcorn in a nuclear accelerator.\n\n     She has totally VANISHED.

The doctor\n     tilts the face up, shines a light into the minister's eyes, which\n     makes him GROAN.  Eye drops now, which make the man YELP in pain.\n     HONGWEI now moves the RETINAL SCANNER into position, resting the\n     minister's chin on the slot provided.  Turns it ON.  The machine's\n     panel FLASHES numbers in red lights.  Hongwei looks into the box\n     from the reverse angle, to view...\n\n     ...a red LASER SCAN moving across the pupil vertically, then\n     retracing its path horizontally, left to right, right to left,\n     up and down, at speed.\n\n     Hongwei moves to a computer monitor with a graphic rendering of\n     the retina, clicks the keypad to section off a slice of the\n     graphic, and ENLARGES the section 100 times.  Looks like pixels.\n\n     Back to the scanner.  Touch a button, and...\n\n     ...a COMPACT DISC pops out of the disc drive.  He places it in a\n     box, telling the minister...\n\n                               HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     We send this to the lab for finer\n                     analysis.  One piece of advice,\n                     huh...?\n\n     The minister squints up, painfully.\n\n                               HONGWEI (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     No more red pepper in your eye.\n                     Not for awhile.\n\n     The doctor LAUGHS.  The minister seethes.  But Colonel Qiu...\n\n     Has his mind.  On business.\n\n     EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, SAN FRANCISCO - LATE NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE on Gin's gloved hand, holding something we can scarcely see,\n     as MIST floats up between us.  It is a carabiner with a nylon rope\n     attached, and she CLIPS it to a thick wire.\n\n                               GIN (O.S.)\n                     I'm freezing my tender parts.\n\n     PULL BACK to see her in climbing harness, scaling a nearly-vertical\n     CABLE, three feet in diameter.

The two of them climbing\n     the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.  They are near the top, more than 700\n     feet above the silvery black BAY.  A precarious, dizzying sight.\n\n                               MAC\n                     What's amazing, is that only eleven\n                     workers died during construction of\n                     this thing...\n\n                               GIN (grim)\n                     ...thanks for sharing...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Of course, the others were saved by\n                     a safety net.\n\n     Gin keeps her focus on the small railed PLATFORM just above her.

This won't be easy.  Throws her rope\n     OVER the railing, and to her surprise, Mac braces himself with\n     his legs...\n\n     ...lifts her from the waist with strong hands, boosting her easily\n     to the platform.  Grateful, she hates to confess it.\n\n                               GIN\n                     One act of fucking human kindness...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Call it a lapse.\n\n     And he swings lightly up beside her.

He POPS the cork in one motion, and it\n     SAILS to its watery doom.  She can't help but watch.\n\n     One more motion to pour both glasses.  Hands one to her.  Toasts...\n\n                               MAC\n                     To Ginger Baker.\n\n     He clicks her glass.  She stares straight in his eye.

Goes back to...\n\n     ...Gin, waiting in her jump suit, sitting on a large pack of gear\n     just beside the window of the jump door.  Next to her, a pack that\n     is even larger.

Affection.  Something connective between\n     them.  You are my partner.  Her eyes send back that personal bond,\n     and she nods.  I can do this.  Good girl.\n\n     He pulls on his oxygen mask, goggles.  She does the same.  He OPENS\n     the door, air BLASTING in.  One more look down below, and he holds\n     up ten fingers.  Counts them down, nine...eight...\n\n     She moves to the edge.  Watching him.  And on zero, she...\n     ARCHES out INTO the starry VOID, and we go...\n\n     WITH HER, the incomparable RUSH of freefall, straining to see him\n     FOLLOW, skillfully altering his position to gain on her, coming\n     close.  She is looking between him and her altimeter, as...\n\n     ...his oxygen tank FALLS AWAY, and she CUTS hers loose, the air\n     RUSHING past her, she looks DOWN...\n\n     ...the lights below are beginning to take the shape of the\n     freighter.  Back up to Mac, as he...\n\n     PULLS his CHUTE, it is black and square, and JOLTS him to what\n     seems like a full STOP far above her, and she YANKS her cord,\n     but...\n\n     ...nothing.  It doesn't open.  She is ROCKETING down, looking back\n     up to see Mac make an exaggerated CUTTING sign across his body, and\n     she closes her eyes, PULLS her secondary chute, which...\n\n     POPS open, JARRING her violently, and she GASPS with the shock.  He\n     is well above her now, she isoff course, frantically trying to\n     manipulate her trajectory, seeing him swooping closer, the\n     freighter LOOMS in distance, she looks down and suddenly...\n\n     ...the sea is RUSHING at her, she FIGHTS her braking mechanism,\n     SHOUTING at herself...\n\n                               GIN\n                     FLARE, FLARE...\n\n     ...and SLAMS INTO the water, PLUNGING down, twisting, disoriented\n     CUTTING her chute loose, struggling not to get tangled, in a panic\n     to BREAK her light tube, which...\n\n     ...GLOWS yellow-green, illuminating the freezing depths, she FITS\n     it around her head, fights now to pull out the small ELECTRIC FAN\n     we've seen before, KICKING herself toward the surface, fighting\n     against the weight of her gear pack, she...\n\n     ...flips the switch, and the fan becomes a PROPELLER which ROCKETS\n     her upward, but she loses her hold on one handgrip, tries\n     desperately to hang on with one hand, but it...\n\n     ...PULLS FREE, goes SHOOTING off into the blackness without her,\n     one instant of TERROR in her eyes, and...\n\n     Mac is THERE, diving at her with his propeller, she GRASPS his legs\n     in a death grip, and suddenly, they are...\n\n     AT the surface, Gin GASPING for air, and he CUTS his propeller,\n     CRADLES her body with one strong arm, murmuring in her ear...\n\n                               MAC\n                     It's over, it's over...\n\n     Her eyes are wild.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Catch your breath, quickly.\n                     Hang on for the wake.\n\n     She sees the FREIGHTER now, a black mountain CUTTING the sea, a\n     huge WAKE pluming from its bow.

GO!\n\n     And he KICKS the propeller to LIFE, they ZOOM off, straight AT the\n     towering wake and burst THROUGH it, RACING to the freighter's\n     looming hull, speeding alongside, Mac looking up to find...\n\n     ...a series of metal RUNGS, which begin twelve feet above the water\n     line, climbing the dizzying height to the freighter's deck, far\n     above.  Mac has a Kevlar rope with a GRAPPLING HOOK, and as he\n     reaches the rungs, he...\n\n     ...THROWS it high, one of the pronged hooks CATCHING on a rung\n     twenty feet above them...\n\n                               MAC\n                     HOLD TIGHT!\n\n                               GIN\n                     IF YOU FUCKING INSIST!\n\n     And he LETS GO of the propeller, PULLING both of them, laden with\n     gear, OUT of the water with sheer brute strength.  PLANTING his\n     feet against the outward curve of the hull, he CLIMBS with all his\n     strength, hand over hand, until he finally...\n\n     ...GRASPS the bottom rung.  He PULLS them up, until she can GRAB\n     ON.  They hold tight to their rung for a beat.  He attaches them\n     both with metal carabiner clips.\n\n                               MAC\n                     If I were you, I'd watch\n                     the desserts.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Boy, I'll bet you were in\n                     shape before you got old.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Too long ago to remember.\n\n     And pulls himself up to the second rung, so that he is standing an\n     the first.  Offers her his hand...\n\n                               GIN\n                     I can take it from here, thanks.\n\n     Suit yourself.  They begin to climb up the rungs, like a tilted\n     backwards ladder, re-attaching their clips as they go.\n\n                               GIN\n                     If you'd packed my primary chute\n                     right, I wouldn't ha...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Yes, you would.  You're a girl.\n\n     Up, up.  And stop.  They are nearly halfway to the top.  Looking\n     across the curved hull to...\n\n     ...a large circular HATCH.  Thirty feet away.  The goal.  Mac\n     pulls from his pack...\n\n     ...their SUCTION CUP gear.  With practiced speed, they fasten cups\n     to the balls of their feet, take hold of the hand rods with cups\n     attached, and Mac takes the lead as they begin to...\n\n     ...move LATERALLY across the hull's surface toward the hatch.  Mac\n     is amazingly agile at the arduous process, scuttling sideways like\n     a crab across the precariously tilted-back hull.  Gin is deter-\n     mined, but falls well behind, intent on making every suction seal\n     solid one.  Dark water RACES by beneath her.,  By the time she looks\n     up at the hatch...\n\n     He is gone.\n\n                               MAC (O.S.)\n                     Anytime you're ready.\n\n     She looks UP sharply.  He is ABOVE the hatch, attached to the hull\n     by the balls of his feet, hanging down like a bat.  Noting her\n     astonishment...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Better angle.\n\n     That it is.  He has pulled a thick cylinder from his pack.  It's a\n     battery-operated AIR WRENCH, and with a menacing WHIRR, only\n     partially masked by the ship's wake, he begins to swiftly POP all\n     the rivets around the hatch.\n\n     Gin has pulled out the slender WELDING TOOL we saw in the shower,\n     and begins CUTTING through the metal seals around the hatch's rim.\n\n     At thecrucial moment...\n\n                               MAC\n                     You might want to move aside...\n\n     Which she BARELY does, as the hatch door PLUMMETS past her to the\n     sea.  BIG splash.  Gone.  When she turns back, Mac is already\n     THROUGH the opening and she follows, their yellow-green headlamps\n     partially revealing...\n\n     ...the maximum-security HOLD.  We've seen this with Carlsby.  The\n     fork lift.  The shadowy multitude of PLATFORMS on their gimbals,\n     all SWAYING, in different directions with the plunging of the ship.\n     Gin just stands, staring everywhere, like she's broken into Fort\n     Knox.  The ROAR of the engines is louder here, and he moves close\n     to her to speak beneath it...\n\n                               MAC\n                     May I trouble you for the torch?\n                     Or would you rather just dance.\n\n     Oh.  Slightly embarrassed at her lack of split-second efficiency,\n     she tries to find the thing in her gear.  After watching her fumble\n     for a bit...\n\n                               GIN\n                     I know I packed it.\n\n     ...he just reaches in and pulls it out.  A small LANTERN which he\n     FLICKS on, brilliantly ILLUMINATING the entire hold.  Scans the\n     platforms...polnts to a CRATE wrapped in 4-ply heavy duty plastic\n     membrane.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Coal into diamonds.  A wealth\n                     machine.\n\n                               GIN\n                     How do you know that's it?\n\n                               MAC (as if stating the obvious)\n                     It's 12 by 9 by 7 feet.  And it's\n                     the only thing worth waterproofing,\n                     in case the ship sinks.\n\n                               GIN (softly)\n                     ...you twit.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Hmmn?\n\n                               GIN\n                     I'm just finishing your sentence.\n                     Can't you answer a question with-\n                     out making me feel stupid?\n\n     He's heading toward the swaying platforms...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Why would I bother?\n\n     He is climbing onto a lower platform, easily vaulting up to the\n     magic crate.  She follows, but it isn't as easy as he's made it\n     look.  She has to scramble, almost falling.  He's already pulled\n     from his gear...\n\n     ...six rubber POUCHES.  She hands him her welding tool, and he\n     begins attaching the pouches to the top and sides of the crate.\n\n     The plunging ship has the platform really rocking.\n\n                               GIN (concerned)\n                     They don't look like flotation\n                     bags...\n\n                               MAC (working fast)\n                     Shit.  Well then, let's forget\n                     the whole thing.\n\n     She stares at him.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Okay, it was a dumb ques...\n\n     His eyes come UP.  So fast that her breath stops.  He looks plenty\n     angry.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Let's get one thing straight.  I\n                     don't work with partners much,\n                     because basically, I find most\n                     people to be idiots.\n\n     She swallows.  Hard.\n\n                               MAC\n                     You, in contrast, are first-rate.\n\n     He watches the effect of that play across her eyes.\n\n                               MAC\n                     And if I think so.  Maybe you\n                     should start thinking the same.\n                     Now move your ass.\n\n     And goes back to work.  She pauses a beat.  Then pulls out two\n     lengths of Kevlar rope.  Begins securing their platform to the one\n     above, to minimize the amount of sway.  As she struggles with this,\n     she sees him finish by welding a very small gray BOX to the top of\n     the crate.\n\n     When he glances up, he sees her staring at the box.\n\n                               MAC\n                     GPS transponder.  Sends a scrambled\n                     signal by satellite...\n\n     He touches the device.  It BEEPS.  A light glows RED.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Precise coordinates.  You could\n                     find a golf ball in the Gobi Desert.\n\n     He rises.  JUMPS down to the floor.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Where you g...\n\n                               MAC (walking away)\n                     Fork lift.\n\n                               GIN\n                     That's my assignm...\n\n                               MAC (turning back)\n                     Unless you've got the keys,\n                     someone has to hot wire it.\n\n     Oh.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Finish up on the floaters.\n\n     And heads off toward the fork lift.  Finish up?  She looks at\n     the rubber pouches.  They seem finished to her.  Tugs at a couple.\n     On pretty firmly.  Across the way, we HEAR the fork lift turn its\n     engine OVER.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Won't they hear it?\n\n                               MAC (O.S.)\n                     Over these engines?  Through five\n                     feet of steel?\n\n     She hurriedly secures the last of her Kevlar lines.\n\n                               MAC (O.S.)\n                     Hell, if they do, they don't have\n                     the second key to get in.\n\n     He is driving up in the rickety fork lift.  Weaving around crates\n     and equipment.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Thank God for redundant security.\n\n     He hops lightly from the fork lift, reaches up, and she jumps down\n     INTO his arms.  Quickly, the switch places, Gin climbing into the\n     idling fork lift, as Mac clambers up to UNBOLT the crate's pallet\n     with his air wrench...\n\n     Gin moves the fork lift into position.  Mac bracing his legs\n     against neighboring cargo, using all his strength to hold our\n     crate steady.  He is really straining.\n\n                               GIN\n                     How many tries do I get?\n\n                               MAC (with effort)\n                     One, before I beat you senseless,\n                     dump you over the side, and donate\n                     your share to charity.\n\n     She brings the fork UP.  The crate sways slightly.  She lines up\n     her prongs against the pallet's receiving holes...\n\n                               GIN\n                     You gotta work on that impatient\n                     streak.\n\n     ...and slips them straight IN.  First try.\n\n                               GIN (amazed)\n                     How professional.\n\n     She LIFTS the crate, but the boat LURCHES, and she nearly LOSES it\n     off the fork.\n\n     But she doesn't.  SWINGS her load around now.  Heading for the open\n     hatchway, the roiling sea racing by.  Picking up SPEED, slightly...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Uh.  Thing on the left is\n                     the brakes?\n\n                               MAC (laconic)\n                     Or the thing on the right.\n\n     By now she is really ROLLING toward the wide open spaces...\n\n                               GIN\n                     MAC, IT'S JAMMED!\n\n     He POUNCES off the platform, FLYING after the lift as it\n     ACCELERATES THROUGH the opening...\n\n                               MAC\n                     JUMP, for God's sa...\n\n     ...TIPPING at the hatchway lip, the crate sliding OFF the prongs,\n     our forklift TUMBLING OUT the hatch to the sea, just as Mac...\n\n     ...SNATCHES Gin by her HAIR, pulling her FREE of the falling\n     forklift, CATCHING the rim of the hatchway with his free hand, Gin\n     SCREAMING in fright and pain, BLINDLY grabbing his arm to be...\n\n     ...jerked BACK to safety.\n\n     Clutching Mac, she watches the sea behind them.  Where the crate\n     and the forklift disappeared.\n\n                               MAC\n                     You did activate the floaters.\n\n     Her head WHIPS around.  Aghast.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Activa...\n\n                               MAC\n                     I did say, 'Finish up on the\n                     floaters'.  Surely, you heard me.\n\n     Her life.  Flashes before her eyes.  As behind the ship...\n\n     ...the crate BOBS to the surface.  We can see the tiny red light on\n     the transponder from here.\n\n                               MAC (softly)\n                     Oh.  Guess I did it m'self.\n\n     She WHIPS back, and starts POUNDING at him with her fists.  He is\n     laughing so hard, he takes a few good shots before he can GRASP her\n     wrists.  She SPITS in his face.  He strikes back by...\n\n     ...kissing her hard.  She struggles for a beat.\n\n     And then she lets him.\n\n     When they finish, he reaches to UNZIP her jumping suit.  All the\n     way.  Pulls it down gently, revealing...\n\n     ...her evening gown.  A wrinkle-free material which slips down\n     across her legs from where it had been bunched across her hips.\n     He is unzipping his outfit as well, revealing formal wear of his\n     own.  He stuffs the suits into his gear pack, removing only...\n\n     ...her evening bag and shoes.  Then lifting both packs, he...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Um...\n\n     ...FLINGS them into the black ocean.  Gone.\n\n                               GIN\n                     ...I wouldn't do that.\n\n     So he turns.  She looks really stunned.  And scared.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Excuse me?\n\n                               GIN\n                     Well...I saw our suction things.\n                     Lying...over...there?\n\n     She points.  To where no suction things are lying.\n\n                               GIN (a mouse)\n                     ...so I put 'em in my pack?\n\n     His eyes WIDEN.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Or maybe.  I put 'em there.\n\n     And points.  To where they are.\n\n     She tilts her head.  Gives him a great smile.  Is he enraged?  His\n     dry grin says, not hardly.\n\n                               MAC\n                     I like a quick study.\n\n     Then again.  You can never tell.\n\n     EXT. FREIGHTER DECK - NIGHT\n\n     Expansive barely-lit deck under a canopy of stars.  A silver-haired\n     couple in immaculate evening attire stroll alone, he is humming to\n     barely-audible dance music from a distant lounge.  She clings to\n     his arm, it is romantic.  Until they reach the railing where he\n     turns, and says something quietly in German...\n\n     She stiffens.  Pulls her arm away from his.  She sneers coldly,\n     calls him a name in German, and he UNLOADS on her, a barrage of\n     German-language INVECTIVE that would melt a tank.  She absorbs the\n     abuse without flinching, turns toward the rail, HAWKS and...\n\n     ...SPITS over the side.  Strides away from him.  He watches her go.\n     Then...\n\n     ...SPITS over the side himself.  And follows her.\n\n     Half a beat.\n\n     Mac's head APPEARS above the rail.  Just where they spit.  Not a\n     mark on him.\n\n     INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Our old German couple are DANCING wonderfully in each other's arms\n     Inspiring.  PAN a dozen really old couples dancing to the three-\n     piece Filipino ensemble, until we come to...\n\n     Gin and Mac spinning slowly, flawlessly, their eyes telling the\n     surrounding geezers that they are very much in love.

CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\n     Our couple moving down the softly-lit hallway, past the burnished\n     doors of luxury suites.  Her arms wrapped around one of his, their\n     bodies close together.\n\n                               MAC\n                     ...well, I would ask what you're\n                     doing with the rest of your life.\n                     But that's your own bloody affair,\n                     isn't it?\n\n     She sighs.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Yeh.  Anyway, before you get too\n                     choked up on the farewell.  I feel\n                     I owe you a confession.\n\n     He glances down.  Really?  Really.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Time has come to tell you.  What\n                     business.  I'm actually in.\n\n     He thinks about this.

DECK - NIGHT\n\n     Mac leads her along the empty moonlit deck to...\n\n     ...the BOWSPRIT, a long, narrow platform, ringed by a flimsy rail,\n     it juts far out above a churning sea.  The whipping of the wind\n     makes it seem all the more precarious.\n\n                               MAC\n                     It only looks dangerous...\n\n     Holds out his hand.

She puts her hand in his, and they hop\n     UP to the platform.  Walk its length to the very end.  He turns\n     now, leans casually against the fragile railing.  They are inches\n     apart.\n\n                               MAC\n                     More intimate.

Unmarked warehouses, alleyways\n     teeming with food stalls.  HEAR a motorcycle approach, and see...\n\n     ...Gin driving, Mac sits behind her.  Going real fast, maybe she's\n     showing off, we FOLLOW them DOWN a blind alley, as she smoothly\n     WHEELS them into...\n\n     ...an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She climbs off, he doesn't.  As Gin\n     goes to work the controls, Mac sees a cat curled in the corner,\n     mewing softly.\n\n                               GIN\n                     That's Madame Chiang Kaishek, she's\n                     my bud.

Gin paces a little,\n     hugging herself.  Her features tense.\n\n                               MAC (gently)\n                     Tired?\n\n     She blinks up.  He is straddling the bike.  Smiling at her.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I have a lot on my mind.\n\n     Ah.

She\n     sags against the wall, closing her eyes, as...\n\n     ...they JOLT to a stop.  She PULLS the heavy LEVER, and the door\n     SLIDES noisily open, to reveal...\n\n     ...a gigantic LOFT.  She flicks on a dim light, but we see only\n     part of the cavernous space.  She strolls, Madame Chiang trotting\n     along behind.  Mac follows, looking around, then down to see...\n\n     ...a pile of MAIL, cables, packages.  The unopened MAILING TUBE we\n     saw in the Hancock Tower penthouse.  He crouches, lifts the tube in\n     his hands...\n\n                                    GIN (O.S.)\n                     You wanna buy a Vermeer?\n\n                                    MAC\n                     Rather steal it.\n\n                                    GIN (O.S.)\n                     Been there, done that.\n\n     He nods to himself.  Guess so.  He rises to see her framed against\n     the gaping starlit opening of a huge LOADING DOOR.  The twinkling\n     island lies below.  But here, Gin stares down at...\n\n     ...an elaborate architectural MODEL.  Fifteen feet across, it\n     features an imposing yellow, pagoda-roofed BUILDING, built into\n     the side of a model MOUNTAIN.  Formal gardens, fountains, tiny\n     Kuomintang flags.  Stretching away from the building, a large\n     portion of the CITY, with shops and alleyways elaborately detailed.\n     As Mac joins her...\n\n                               GIN\n                     National Palace Museum, Taipei,\n                     Taiwan.  Repository of four\n                     thousand years of Chinese culture...\n\n     He bends to lift UP the detachable roof.  All the rooms are\n     detailed within, down to exhibit cases.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Works of gold, bronze, jade, onyx,\n                     pots and scrolls, paintings and\n                     porcelains and lacquer work.  Every\n                     treasure the Kuomintang could loot\n                     before the Reds took over.\n                               (beat)\n                     Ever rob the place?\n\n                               MAC\n                     No.  If memory serves.\n\n     She takes him by the hand, and leads him toward the gaping doorway,\n     walking straight toward it...\n\n                               GIN\n                     You need to eat something, or\n                     are you ready for sex?\n\n     And just at the edge of it...\n\n                               MAC (torn)\n                     The options seem so limited.\n\n     They jump THROUGH the opening.  And VANISH.\n\n     Our ANGLE closes on the doorway, to see OUT now, sitting like a\n     jewel against the hillside...\n\n     ...the NATIONAL PALACE MUSEUM, looking exactly like the model.  The\n     town spread out beyond.  Just as in the model.  And now we TILT\n     sharply DOWN to see...\n\n     ...a loading PLATFORM, suspended above the island, only a few feet\n     below our opening.  Like a balcony without a railing.  Mac and Gin\n     already sinking down onto a waiting futon.\n\n     Looks like he's made his pick.  Among limited options.\n\n     INT. LOFT - SUNRISE\n\n     CLOSE on the MODEL MUSEUM in early light.  Propped against it, the\n     unrolled Vermeer.  Pinned to the painting, a note we can't read.  In\n     the B.G., HEAR what sounds like the rattling of a SUBWAY TRAIN,\n     which runs a short distance and STOPS.  We TILT ANGLE now, to\n     see...\n\n     ...through the sunlit opening of the loading door.  Mac's head\n     APPEARS, peeking up over the lip.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Ginny...?\n\n     LOST in another brief subway rumble.  He lightly VAULTS up through\n     the doorway.  Looks around, no Gin.  Goes to the model.  Lifts the\n     note pinned to the Vermeer...\n\n                               MAC (reads)\n                     This lovely parting gift can be\n                     yours.  If the price is right.\n\n     Stumped.  Not in his cultural database.  He looks at the model, to\n     see that the stretch of city between museum and mountain has been\n     lifted away, revealing...\n\n     ...an underground RAILWAY TUNNEL between the two.  Mac examines the\n     tiny train, the tracks, the winding route.  From the side walls,\n     well above the tracks, huge VENTILATION PIPES open onto the tunnel.\n     Starting at the museum end, they are labeled VENT #1, and so on.\n     There are five.  The last one shortly before...\n\n     ...the mountain.  Where a cavernous opening is labeled BARRACKS.\n     Tiny toy soldiers kneel on a landing, rifles in position to shoot\n     at the oncoming train.  And as Mac studies this curiously...\n\n     ...the nearby SUBWAY RATTLES the walls once more.  Sounds like it's\n     in the room, somehow.  Mac rises.  Saunters across the loft, and we\n     see for the first time the enormity of this space.  Suddenly, the\n     floor ends, and we are looking down nearly thirty feet onto...\n\n     ...a spacious HANGAR, outfitted with 150 feet of RAILWAY TRACK, at\n     the far end of which sits a full-sited TRAIN CAR, exactly like the\n     one in the model.  And just below us...\n\n     ...Gin crouches on a concave platform of corrugated metal, eighteen\n     feet above the track.  She holds a remote control device, which she\n     uses to REV the train's engine, far down the line.  She looks\n     really tense.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Good morning.\n\n     She startles slightly.  Shuts OFF the train's engine.  As she looks\n     up to him now, the silence is noticeable.  He crouches down, only a\n     foot or so above her...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Quite a parting gift.  I would\n                     have settled for roses.\n\n                               GIN\n                     It's a joke.  You know, a joke?\n                     People who have a sense of humor\n                     make them?\n\n     He's clueless.  But smiling.\n\n                               GIN\n                     You're rich, go buy an American,\n                     have him fill you in on the culture.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Ah.  American culture.  Well,\n                     that is a joke.\n\n     He leans down.  Strokes her hair very gently.\n\n                               MAC (murmurs)\n                     Relax.  It's only eight billion\n                     dollars.\n\n     She looks up into his eyes.  But she can't smile.\n\n                               MAC (softly)\n                     Your Vermeer?  I like this View Of\n                     Delft better than the larger one.\n                     The sky is more emotionally rendered.\n\n     Staring in his eyes.  And just as softly back...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Nice.  When a sky is that.\n\n     He holds the look.  Very strong and very gentle...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Is it easier now? Not pretending.\n\n     Is it?\n\n                               MAC\n                     Not pretending you're an innocent.\n                     Not pretending you...like me.\n\n     No answer.  Effortlessly, he hops down to join her.  Never losing\n     eye contact.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Here's a tip from an old-timer.\n                     Never forget who you are...\n\n     Settles next to her.  Bodies touching.\n\n                               MAC\n                     It gives you someone to be.  When\n                     you stop pretending.\n\n     Okay?  She nods, slowly.  Her eyes moving over his face.  Maybe\n     more feelings going through her than she can sort out.\n\n                               MAC (still soft)\n                     So.  Our train runs from the museum,\n                     through an underground tunnel.  To\n                     a mountain.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Because the museum displays 10,000\n                     relics at any given moment.  But\n                     there are 60 times that many, stored\n                     in the mountain.\n\n     This overwhelms.  Even Mac.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Which is why it's guarded.  By an\n                     army.\n\n     She is unfastening the small pack at her feet...\n\n                               GIN\n                     The train shuttles relics to and\n                     from storage.  It looks exactly\n                     like that.\n\n     So Mac looks down the line.  At the train car.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I've been down the air ducts four\n                     times.  The train always has two\n                     armed guards.  Always travels between\n                     32 and 36 miles per hour.  Relics\n                     don't like to be jostled too much.\n\n                               MAC (all business now)\n                     Your model has five vents.\n\n                               GIN\n                     We go down the first.  Back up the\n                     third, if you're lucky.  If not, we\n                     have to get out by the fourth.\n\n                               MAC (simply)\n                     Then we will.\n\n     She pulls from the pack four thick DISCS, each about eight inches\n     in diameter, each with a toggle switch and a wrist loop.  She\n     starts to put two of them on...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Electromagnets, incredibly powerful.\n                     This switch is on-off.\n\n     He gestures at the train, the track, the hangar...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Seems like overkill.

Wish me luck...\n\n     CLICKS the remote, the train LEAP5 forward, 36 MPH never seemed so\n     fast!  She has a split-second to LEAP down, the train SAILS beneath\n     her, Gin's feet GRAZE the back end of the platform at the rear of\n     the car, she SWIPES DESPERATELY with the magnets, can't connect,\n     and is THROWN into a ROLL along the side of the tracks.\n\n     She's UP on her knees, watching the train SLAM into the massive\n     blue PADS at the end of the track.  She is bruised, shaken, but\n     most of all, really worried and really pissed.\n\n                               MAC (quietly)\n                     Jump sooner.\n\n     She pulls out the remote...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Be my fucking guest.\n\n     The train ROCKETS backward, straight PAST where she kneels, to\n     BRAKE at the start of the track once more.  She nods up to Mac,\n     who is strapping on his magnets.  He crouches, nods, ready.  And\n     the train...\n\n     ...BLASTS toward him, he counts, JUMPS, and SLAMS ONTO the ROOF of\n     the train, which PLOWS into the heavy padding, FLINGING him twenty\n     feet like a rag doll to land in a HEAP.\n\n     He lies still.  Then blinks, surprised he's alive.  HEARS a rich\n     whiskey LAUGHTER down the track.\n\n                               MAC\n                     I'm too old for this shit!\n\n     And as he pulls himself up.  She is staring at him, from her\n     knees...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Know a dude named Wiley Coyote?\n\n     ...with what can only be described as love.\n\n                               GIN (softly)\n                     Forget it.\n\n     EXT.

CLOSE\n     now, as a cab pulls up, a couple emerges...\n\n     She is first.  Chanel suit with an extremely short skirt, revealing\n     endless legs.  She helps him from the taxi, a white-haired geezer\n     who seems well past 90, fumbling with his walking stick, and making\n     quick, erratic, bird-like glances in every direction.\n\n     She takes his arm for support.  Murmurs in his ear...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Isn't it easier now?  Not pretending?\n\n     Gives him a full-tongue KISS in the ear, which has bystanders\n     noticing.  Starts to help him up the stairs, still whispering\n     close...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Five years, you won't need\n                     make-up.\n\n     In answer he GRABS her ass, and she YELPS with delight, attract-\n     ing attention all around.

As Mac tries to crawl under the rope to pursue\n     coins...\n\n     ...the guard STOPS him with a firm hand, pointing at the pidgen-\n     English sign.  Meanwhile, calmly, very slowly...\n\n     ...Gin crouches down to retrieve coins, the short skirt riding\n     recklessly high on her upper thighs.  The two remaining guards\n     hurry to help her.  Mac's guard, bystanders, all transfixed by the\n     marginal preservation of her modesty.  Noticing the eye-lines all\n     around, she confides to the nearest guard...\n\n                               GIN (in Mandarin, helpful)\n                     Those are the coins.

CLOSE on him now, manipulating a glide point DEVICE on\n     the side of the watch, and we RACK FOCUS to see...\n\n     ...one coin.  Inside the rope.  Move.\n\n     As Mac checks to see all eyes are elsewhere, he guides the coin's\n     slide slowly, inexorably, to...\n\n     ...ATTACH itself magnetically.  To the steel pedestal.  Beneath the\n     Bone's case.  As it does, Mac's watch BEEPS slightly, as we CLOSE\n     on it to see...\n\n     ...DATA flickering across its face.\n\n                               MAC (old guy voice)\n                     Amanda!

Gin\n     looking down at her bowl, she's barely touched her meal...\n\n                               GIN\n                     ...no, I don't think that way.\n\n     Glances up.

Is denial.\n\n     She's studying him as he eats.  Since he's not looking at her,\n     Gin's eyes are thoughtful, appraising.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Be real.  you could never see\n                     yourself...you know, quitting the\n                     game.

Before the wonderful smile.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Why, Ginger.  This is so sudden.\n\n     She cuts him a hard look.  Not funny.\n\n     INT. MUSEUM - DAY\n\n     Late afternoon, the place has closed.  Four armed GUARDS,\n     accompanied by a museum OFFICIAL, push a large DOLLY across the\n     hardwood floor, heels clicking, wheels rumbling softly, into...\n\n     ...the room we've seen.  The dolly stops by the display case of the\n     priceless oracle Bone.  The four guards position themselves around\n     the triple-paned bulletproof case.  It will be a bitch to lift.\n\n     The official has a key.  He inserts this into the lock of the\n     titanium frame which holds the case to the steel pedestal.  And\n     as it CLICKS, we...\n\n     SMASH CUT TO...\n\n     INT. NOODLE SHOP - DAY\n\n     Mac's arm rising with noodle-laden chopsticks, the wristwatch\n     BEEPING softly.  He drops the chopsticks, rising in one fluid\n     motion as Gin does the same, throwing some bills on the table,\n     he leads her...\n\n     ...OUT the door, INTO the street, step OFF the curb, turn, DROP\n     flat on his back, SLIDE DOWN the gutter, Gin following a split-\n     second behind...\n\n     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK\n\n     A train car stands, pulled up to a loading dock.  Two SOLDIERS with\n     assault rifles on the train's rear platform, waiting.  Along one\n     side of the tracks, a gravel roadway.  An open air Jeep-type\n     military vehicle stands empty.  One of our soldiers speaks into a\n     walkie-talkie, watching a huge steel DOOR at the entrance to the\n     loading dock, which...\n\n     ...OPENS now.  Through it come the four armed museum guards,\n     surrounding the dolly which carries the Bone's massive bulletproof\n     display case.  The official is with them, and hands paperwork to\n     one of the waiting soldiers, as the museum guards LIFT the case,\n     and carry it onto the train.\n\n     INT. TUNNEL SHAFT\n\n     An empty stretch of dimly-lit track, somewhere down the line.\n     Silent.  PAN up, way up, to...\n\n     ...the shadows of a huge air vent.  Must be vent #1, because two\n     FIGURES are crouched there, as close as lovers.  Even we can barely\n     make them out, until we CLOSE to hear the hushed...\n\n                               GIN (strapping on a backpack)\n                     ...way we can use those in here.\n                     I thought I was in charge of\n                     this operat...\n\n                               MAC\n                     You're in charge of ego and worrying.\n                     I'm in charge of keeping you alive.\n\n     He is holding something dull gray and small.  It looks like a trun-\n     cated nerf football with one end pointed and the other cut blunt.\n\n                               MAC\n                     These are plasma jet.  All the\n                     force is directed forward, instead\n                     of dissipating in a sphere like a\n                     grenade.\n\n     He has four of these.  Gives her three.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I don't need th...\n\n                               MAC (whispers)\n                     Shut up.\n\n     He reaches out, gently...\n\n                               MAC\n                     You don't trust me, you won't get\n                     through this.\n\n     Touches her face.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Try to adjust to that for three\n                     more days.

One more whisper...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Something.  To look forward to.\n\n     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK\n\n     The museum guards are back on the landing with the official.  Our\n     two soldiers stand facing them from the rear platform of the train\n     car, as...\n\n     The train RUMBLES to life.  Ready to go.\n\n     INT. MUSEUM\n\n     Two guards arrive with a hand truck to carry off the empty\n     pedestal, which once supported the Bone's case.  One tilts the top\n     of the pedestal back, supporting its weight, as the other stoops to\n     lift the base, and...\n\n     ...stops.  He sees the coin.  Oddly flat against the pedestal's\n     shaft.  He kneels, tries to lift the coin, but the magnet HOLDS it\n     fast.  He looks up to his companion.  Then...\n\n     ...PEELS the coin free, the other guard reaches for it, the first\n     guard YANKS it away, and it FLIES from his hand, INTO the wall, and\n     drops.  As the guards go to look, the coin's back has come away.\n     Revealing...\n\n     ...electronics.\n\n     INT. TUNNEL LOADING DOCK\n\n     An ALARM SHRIEKS at a deafening level.  Five museum GUARDS BURST\n     through the doorway, LEAP from the landing, pile into the Jeep, and\n     BLAST OFF down the gravel roadway after the departed train.\n\n     INT. BARRACKS ENTRANCE\n\n     A much larger landing at the other end of the tunnel, facing back\n     the opposite way.  The ALARM SCREAMS here, too, and massive steel\n     doors CLANG open, as 25 SOLDIERS with assault rifles SWARM out onto\n     the landing, taking up sharpshooter positions, weapons pointing\n     back up the track.\n\n     INT. AIR VENT #1\n\n     Mac and Gin crouched in the vent, high above the track, gas masks\n     dangle around their necks, magnet paddles from their wrists,\n     various objects from their belt loops.  The alarm ECHOES,\n     absolutely EAR-SPLITTING.  She leans to shout in his ear...\n\n                               GIN\n                     WE HAVE TO ABORT!\n\n     Above the siren, we can now hear the TRAIN coming...\n\n                               MAC\n                     HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MAKE A CAREER\n                     OF THIS, IF YOU CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE\n                     INCONVENIENCE?\n\n     The train LOUDER, closer, the alarm BLARING...\n\n                               GIN\n                     THEY'VE GOT AN ARMY DOWN TH...\n\n                               MAC\n                     I can do this.\n\n     Quietly.  Straight in her eyes.  The train ROARS into view, FLASHES\n     beneath them, as he GRABS her wrist and...\n\n     ...JUMPS, HURTLING DOWN, both STRIKING the empty rear platform,\n     Gin slipping off, but he HOLDS her fast, SWIPING with his magnet\n     which...\n\n     ...CLANKS hard, LOCKS solid.  He PULLS her onto the platform,\n     she looks dazed, clinging to him, he tugs her gas mask into place,\n     slips on his own, and...\n\n     ...FITS a magnetic DEVICE from his belt loop ONTO the door\n     lock, SPINS a dial on the device, which POPS the lack OPEN,\n     Mac BURSTING...\n\n     ...THROUGH the door, lobbing a GAS GRENADE at the startled guards,\n     who try to whirl and FIRE through the fog of red smoke, two wild\n     SHOTS above the rolling Mac, and they are felled by the gas where\n     they stand.  Gin races in, falling on her butt, as the car ROCKS\n     along the track.  Points OUT the window...\n\n                               GIN (through mask)\n                     THERE'S THE NUMBER TWO VENT, ONLY\n                     45 SECONDS TO THE THIRD!\n\n     Scrambling to her feet, Mac wheeling toward the Bone.\n\n                               GIN (through mask)\n                     TEST THE CASE!\n\n     He THROWS a handful of coins at the glass case, and purple UV BEAMS\n     ARC from the glass to FRY the coins in midair.  Mac pulls a dull\n     rectangle the size of a cigar box from Gin's backpack, as we\n     SMASH CUT to...\n\n     INT. TUNNEL\n\n     The Jeep BLASTING after the train at crazy speed, the four non-\n     drivers with weapons at the ready...\n\n     INT. BARRACKS LANDING\n\n     TROOPS FILL the platform, and have spilled onto the tracks, enough\n     weapons to dust Butch and Sundance.\n\n     INT. TRAIN\n\n     Mac operating the cigar box which is actually a customized\n     OSCILLOSCOPE, with countless KNOBS and a SCREEN which displays\n     WAVE PATTERNS.  The machine is emitting SHRILL whistling TONES\n     that cut through even the siren.\n\n                               GIN (through mask)\n                     TAKE IT TO 30 AND CLIMB!\n\n     Mac SPINS the dials and two overhead light bulbs BLOW.  The glass\n     case housing a fire ax SHATTERS.  The Bone's case is untouched.\n\n     SMASH CUT to...\n\n     INT. TUNNEL\n\n     WITH the Jeep, BOMBING around a curve to SEE the train at last.  WE\n     OPEN FIRE, accelerating after the train with everything we've got,\n     gravel FLYING like shrapnel, and up ahead...\n\n     ...the train's windows BLOW OUT, the tunnel SHOWERED with glass\n     fragments.  SMASH CUT...\n\n     INT. TRAIN\n\n     Mac JUICING the box, the deafening TONE competing with the sirens,\n     the gunshots, Gin SHRIEKING as she points through a blasted-out\n     window...\n\n                               GIN (through mask)\n                     THIRD VENT GONE!\n\n     And the Bone's case EXPLODES, Gin WHIRLING away to protect her\n     face, as we SMASH CUT to...\n\n     INT. TUNNEL\n\n     The Jeep now ALONGSIDE the rear platform of the train.  The driver\n     fighting to hold it steady, as...\n\n     ...the guards begin to CLAMBER over the side, GRASPING for the\n     platform's rails, one goes DOWN screaming onto the tracks, but two\n     MAKE IT, then a third, they BURST...\n\n     ...INTO the train to see...\n\n     Nothing.  Two groggy, half-conscious soldiers.  Discarded gas\n     masks, oscilloscope.  No Mac.  No Gin.  And inside the shattered\n     case...\n\n     A chicken bone.  The pack-rat strikes again.\n\n     INT. TUNNEL\n\n     Mac and Gin FLATTENED to the side of the train above the window\n     line, held fast by their magnets.  We are on the opposite side from\n     the gravel path, so the train screens us from the jeep.  SHOUTING\n     above the din...\n\n                               GIN\n                     THERE'S THE FOURTH!\n\n     Up ahead an AIR VENT looms, we are HURTLING toward it.

As we STREAK toward the VENT, Gin lifts her gun,\n     SHOOTS at it, a cable-attached PROJECTILE EXPLODING toward the\n     target, OPENING in mid-flight to a three-pronged HOOK, which...\n\n     ...FALLS just SHORT, the hook tumbling to CLANG on the tracks, as\n     Mac...\n\n     ...FIRES his, the projectile EXPLODING, the hook OPENING and...\n\n     ...BITES into the wall, only four feet from the vent, its cable\n     stretching back to the gun in Mac's hand, we're almost there, and\n     Mac slips the pistol...\n\n     ...INTO Gin's free hand.\n\n                               GIN\n                     WHAT ABOUT YOU?\n\n                               MAC\n                     ALLOW US A MOMENT OF CHIVALRY.\n\n     Their eyes meet.

Do you know how\n                     filthy this place is?\n\n     Shows her dirty fingers as proof.\n\n                               SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     Madam, no one is supp...\n\n                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     I'm looking for dress pumps, I'll\n                     need eight pairs.\n\n     Oh.\n\n                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     Unless you're too busy to help me.\n\n                               SALESMAN (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     Well, no, I...\n\n                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     Come to think of it, I need some\n                     dresses for evening...\n\n     Lifts the Halliburton case, slings her pack over her shoulder,\n     strides to the doorway.  See the crowded upscale boutique...\n\n                               GIN (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     Are you coming?\n\n     Out she goes.  And he follows.  Maybe he's on commission.\n\n     INT. VENT - DAY\n\n     Mac, very much alive, somewhat the worse for wear, crawling through\n     a darkened pipe on his belly, toward...\n\n     ...a grating.  Light filters through.  Reaching the screen, he\n     squints through it.  Can't see shit.  Listens.  Nothing that rises\n     above an ambient wooshing of air in the duct.  He grasps the wires,\n     pushes, and...\n\n     ...FALLS straight THROUGH, tumbling ten feet to CRASH LAND in a\n     heap.  HEAR feminine SCREAMS before we look up to...\n\n     ...three young WOMEN trying on lingerie, being attended by an older\n     SALESWOMAN.  The girls are half-naked and as Mac rises, one THROWS\n     a red lace TEDDY in his face.  He peels it off, and still holding\n     the garment, calmly tells the saleswoman...\n\n                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     It's all right, the security cameras\n                     behind the mirrors are working again.\n\n     At which the customers SHRIEK, cover themselves all the more, and\n     begin screaming at the poor saleswoman.  During which...\n\n                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     Well.  If everything is in order...\n\n     All four women.  Look at him.\n\n     EXT. LINGERIE SHOP, SHIN KONG MALL - SUNSET\n\n     CLOSE on an entrance, just as Mac comes...\n\n     ...FLYING THROUGH, propelled by two sizeable SECURITY GUARDS, once\n     again landing in pieces.  It's a long day.  As Mac clears his head,\n     they stand at the doorway with folded arms.  Hoping he wants some\n     more.\n\n                               MAC\n                     WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY IS THIS?  IN\n                     BRITAIN, A MAN CAN TRY ON LINGERIE\n                     WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS DIGNITY!\n\n     The bruisers look at each other.  No habla Espanol.\n\n     EXT. KAOHSHING HARBOR, TAIWAN - DUSK\n\n     A super TUGBOAT, engines RUMBLING, ready to pull out.  A woman\n     paces the deck.  Every time we see her, she seems more tightly\n     wrapped.  At last...\n\n     ...here he comes, stepping briskly from the taxi, striding up the\n     gangway, pulling from inside his coat...\n\n     ...the red lace teddy.  He drapes it over her face, and she pulls\n     it away, steps into his arms...\n\n     ...her kiss is urgent.  Real.  HOLD on the look in her eyes.  What\n     is she thinking?\n\n     He strokes her hair, gently.  Then, goes to look into the\n     Halliburton case, which stands by the rail.  As he crouches.  As he\n     looks at the Bone...\n\n     She is watching him.  An intensity to her gaze.  More feeling than\n     she is comfortable with, which...\n\n     ...disappears completely, as he turns to her.  And when he mimes\n     FLINGING the case into the sea...\n\n     She laughs.\n\n     EXT. STATUE SQUARE, HONG KONG - DAY\n\n     CLOSE on a British Petroleum BILLBOARD with a huge DIGITAL CLOCK,\n     counting down by seconds...JUNE 29, 1997, 11:32 A.M. - 1 DAY, 12\n     HOURS, 27 MINUTES, 48 SECONDS TO:  REUNION WITH CHINA!\n\n     PAN to an AERIAL VIEW of...\n\n     Hong Kong's bustling STATUE SQUARE, the hub of countless feeder\n     streets and alleyways, as we ROAM to a SERIES OF SHOTS...\n\n     ...billboards everywhere.  Western businesses that announce WE'LL\n     STILL BE HERE FOR YOU.  Others, primarily British, sending\n     farewells, gratitude for past patronage.  China-sponsored\n     depictions of happy Hong Kong and Chinese citizens, proclaim ONE\n     COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS.\n\n     ...moving vans, people pushing carts of belongings, shop signs\n     advertising blowout inventory clearance sales.  Traffic beyond\n     gridlock.  The human ant colony.\n\n     ...incredibly long queues in front of post offices, American\n     Express, the imposing glass and steel skyscraper called the HONG\n     KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK BUILDING.\n\n     ...large groups of uniformed CHINESE SOLDIERS in the streets.  More\n     orderly DEMONSTRATION by anti-China PROTESTERS, their signs say\n     MORE DEMOCRACY and FREE HONG KONG, their numbers watched by Chinese\n     soldiers, who in turn are watched by British soldiers.\n\n     CLOSE on the square now.  A couple at a sidewalk vendor.  Mac is\n     purchasing a t-shirt.  Gin dutifully lifts her arms, and Mac slips\n     the garment over her head.  It says CHINA GOT HONG KONG, AND ALL I\n     GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT.\n\n     He regards her thoughtfully, and she turns, modeling for him as if\n     wearing a Givenchy original.  He approves, lifts the Halliburton\n     case, and they move on, strolling, chatting until Mac...\n\n     ...bumps HARD into a Chinese SOLDIER, both men REELING with the\n     impact.  The soldier carries an identical HALLIBURTON CASE, and the\n     two men set their cases down side by side, as Mac steps forward...\n\n                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     FUCKING HELL!  WATCH WHERE\n                     YOU'RE GOING, MAN!\n\n     No one notices, no one cares.  Gin tugs on Mac's arm, don't get\n     involved, dear.  Mac reluctantly steps back.  The soldier glares at\n     him.  Then, bends and picks up...\n\n     ...Mac's case.  A parting epithet in Mandarin, and the soldier\n     starts off.  Watching him, Mac unobtrusively fingers a concealed...\n\n     ...PISTOL, ready for action.  But keeps watching, as within a few\n     yards, the soldier...\n\n     ...stops.  Opens the case.  Checks out the Oracle Bone, right there\n     in the middle of the square.  Mac and Gin watching across the\n     distance, with hair-trigger keenness.  At last the soldier CLOSES\n     the case...\n\n     ...walks back to us.\n\n                               SOLDIER (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     I believe I took your case.\n\n     Handing it to Mac, he leans forward, and in low, aecented\n     English...\n\n                               SOLDIER\n                     21 Old Peak Road.  In 45 minutes.\n\n     Picks up his own case.  And is gone.\n\n     EXT. MANSION, VICTORIA PEAK - DAY\n\n     A vintage Aston Martin pulls up to a spectacular gated MANSION.\n     Sparkling white, it is a blend of Edwardian and Regency.  Gin is\n     driving, speaks into the voice box, and the gate swings open.  As\n     they pull up the crushed rock driveway...\n\n     ...a BUTLER appears, as British as the architecture.  Climbing from\n     the car, Mac has the Halliburton case.\n\n                               BUTLER\n                     Will you please come this way?\n\n     And leads them around the side of the house.  They walk slowly, a\n     distance behind the butler, taking everything in.\n\n                               MAC\n                     I like this.\n\n     His voice is strong, calm.  No hint of a smile.\n\n                               GIN\n                     You like wha...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Not being told what the fuck\n                     we're doing.\n\n     She looks equally serious.  Just more tense.\n\n                               GIN\n                     You're on a 'need to know' basis.\n                     You'll get each step in time to\n                     execute, I thought you agreed to\n                     those condit...\n\n                               MAC (quietly)\n                     I like your not trusting me.\n                     Because it frees me to do\n                     the same.\n\n     They come upon the spacious GROUNDS behind the mansion.  A\n     breathtaking view down the slope of Victoria Peak to Hong Kong and\n     the harbor.  Kowloon across the water.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I trust you.  I only need to...\n\n                               MAC\n                     ...remain in control.\n\n     They pass a towering row of perfect ROSEBUSHES.  Mac SNAPS OFF a\n     giant blossom.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Which is a sign of weakness.\n\n     And hands it to her.  Their eyes meet.\n\n                               MAC\n                     I like that, too.\n\n     At the edge of the garden, above the commanding view, a luncheon\n     TABLE has been set.  Spread with delcacies.  Two SERVANTS attend,\n     also British.\n\n     Only the host is seated.  He does not rise.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Colonel\n\n     Col. Qiu glances up from his meal.  Green PLA uniform, absurdly\n     decorated, wraparound Gautier sunglasses.  We recognize him as the\n     man who took Gin's call in his Mercedes in Tienanmen Square.  The\n     man who accompanied the poor Minister of Finance to the ophthal-\n     mologist.\n\n                               QIU\n                     You look lovely, Ginger.  Is\n                     the rose for me?\n\n                               GIN\n                     Of course.\n\n     And leans prettily.  To fasten it in the buttonhole of his lapel.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Col. Qiu Lai Chuen, this is\n                     Andrew MacDougal.\n\n     Hearing his real name, Mac cuts her a look.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Real names here, darling.  The\n                     Colonel and I have every incentive\n                     to keep each other's secrets.\n\n     And she sits.  Close to Qiu.  Mac looks around at the property,\n     the view.\n\n                               QIU\n                     Like the place, Andy?\n\n                               MAC\n                     Please.  Mr. MacDougal will do.\n\n     The Colonel smiles.  First time.  Like an alligator.  Mac notices\n     that the tablecloth is actually...\n\n     ...a Union Jack.  He fingers the flag.\n\n                               QIU\n                     This way.  Doesn't matter if we\n                     spill.\n\n                               MAC\n                     My sentiments exactly.\n\n     He sits.\n\n                               QIU\n                     This place was a gift.  From\n                     its former owner.  A Brit whose\n                     business will now happily continue\n                     to function.  Perhaps...even expand.\n\n                               MAC (spreading his napkin)\n                     Planning to spend much time here?\n\n                               QIU\n                     Tho it has required many sacrifices.\n\n                               GIN\n                     The Colonel has divorced his\n                     wife.  To facilitate the necessary\n                     entertaining of Western women.\n\n                               QIU\n                     Tho some are more entertaining\n                     than others.\n\n     And runs the back of his knuckles up the length of Gin's bare arm.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Colonel.  You are touching the woman\n                     I love...\n\n     Which brings Qiu's eyes over.  Really?\n\n                               MAC\n                     From time to time.\n\n     And pulls up the Halliburton case.  Handing it across the table.\n     As Qiu takes the case in his lap, opens it...\n\n                               QIU\n                     You're a Scot.  Would you like\n                     some 25-year-old Macallan?\n\n                               MAC\n                     Sure, I'll take a case.\n\n     Qiu glances across the lawn to the butler, who stands behind the\n     bar trolley.  As the drinks are prepared, the Colonel studies the\n     Bone.\n\n                               GIN\n                     The Colonel told his Minister\n                     of Culture that he could mount\n                     a surgical raid to liberate this\n                     treasure from Taiwan.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Ah.  How much was the Minister\n                     told the raid would cost?\n\n                               QIU (not looking up)\n                     Counting equipment, personnel,\n                     bribes, an even fifty million\n                     American.  All in.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Which you can now keep.\n\n     The drinks arrive.\n\n                               QIU\n                     He would have paid twice that.\n                     But my needs are modest.\n\n     And lifts from beneath the table, a leather POUCH.\n\n                               QIU\n                     Unlike.  The woman you love.\n                     From time to time.\n\n     Drops it into Gin's lap.  She opens the pouch to reveal...\n\n     ...goggles.  Like one would wear in a tanning salon.  Only these\n     are flesh-colored with one small hole in the center of each lens.\n     Slightly larger than the size of a pupil.\n\n     She slips them on.  A bright smile.\n\n                               GIN\n                     How do I look, honey?\n\n     And Mac smiles.  In return.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Like a woman.  Of mystery.\n\n     INT. SUITE, PENINSULA HOTEL - LATE NIGHT\n\n     Glass doors open WIDE to a terrace which overlooks Kowloon, the\n     harbor, Hong Kong Island beyond.  More lights than stars in heaven.\n     And speaking of heaven...\n\n     ...the SOUNDS of lovemaking are fierce, feral, an urgent rhythm,\n     part comic, part wondrous, and mostly, arousing enough to make us\n     PAN TO...\n\n     ...lovemaking in silhouette.  This is the lovemaking of tigers,\n     mesmerizing to watch, ferocious enough to inspire envy, and\n     somehow...\n\n     ...tender enough.  To suggest real love.\n\n     LATER...Mac and Gin sit before the open terrace.  There is wine and\n     food and abandoned clothing all around them.  She has her pack\n     drawn near.  And Qiu's leather pouch.  She removes the goggles...\n\n     This is the moment.\n\n                               GIN\n                     In the Hong Kong and Shanghai\n                     Bank Building.  Is a room with\n                     two computers.  One for you.\n                     And one for me.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Glad I have a function, here.\n\n                               GIN\n                     The room is a vault on the 14th\n                     floor.  Access codes to that room\n                     are changed daily, computer pass-\n                     words on the hour, but...\n\n     But.  She is electric, more alive than he's ever seen her.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Four men in the world.  Don't need\n                     codes.  Their retinas will scan to\n                     unlock everything.

Times Square looks deserted New\n     Year's Eve compared to this carnival CRUSH of humanity, rock and\n     rolling as if reunion with China was the doorway to Paradise.\n\n     Singing, chanting, screaming, dancing, music and booze everywhere,\n     firecrackers exploding, soldiers and civilians, tycoons and\n     hookers, tourists and peddlers and Party members and homeless,\n     going absolutely nuts.\n\n     Who knows.  Could be the last party.  Ever.\n\n     WHIP PAN to the crowded plaza in front of the towering glass-and-\n     steel headquarters of the HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK.\n\n     ZOOM to focus on our smashing couple in evening wear, Gin with a\n     large beaded shoulder bag.  Mac presents an invitation to a PLA\n     soldier, who admits them into...\n\n     INT. PUBLIC LOBBY, HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI BANK\n\n     ...a VIP party going full blast in the lobby of this truly\n     breathtaking structure.  A central ATRIUM rises 47 floors, creating\n     a soaring clear core, around which the offices and working spaces\n     are ringed.  The view straight up is interrupted only at three\n     well-spaced levels, where thick CANOPIES of glass, stitched\n     together with spidery skeletons of steel, SPAN the open core.\n     Mac looks up...\n\n     ...at the balcony railings surrounding the atrium, the revelers\n     have been granted access to the lower five floors.  Above these,\n     all is empty.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Nice of the Colonel to provide an\n                     invitation...\n\n     She is guiding him toward one of the multiple hors d'oeuvre\n     stations.  Half the celebrants seem to be armed PLA soldiers, many\n     with rifles slung boldly across their shoulders.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Well, I promised him a bonus.\n                     Five million.

They step away from the mob\n     toward a potted plant near the wall, and Mac...\n\n     ...drops his snacks with a SPLAT.  Shit.  Bending to clean the\n     mess, he slips from his waistband a flat CIRCUIT BOARD with a\n     bank logo and a three-pronged plug.  In a single motion, he plugs\n     it INTO a socket concealed by the pot, scoops up his canapes,\n     and we CUT TO...\n\n     INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM\n\n     Three SECURITY OFFICERS blink, as ALL FIFTY monitor screens go\n     HAYWIRE at once.  The images compressed to a blur of lines between\n     a series of diagonal SLACK BARS that slash across the screens.  The\n     way your TV acts when the horizontal hold goes out.  They can't\n     believe it.\n\n     Stumped, they start slamming buttons, flipping switches, jabbering\n     to each other.  Now the images begin to ROLL vertically, as if in\n     response to their attempts at adjustment.\n\n     Welcome to the world of high tech.\n\n     INT. ELEVATOR BANK\n\n     Mac and Gin wait with a party of older Brits, who've had plenty\n     to drink and are carrying more.  Two armed soldiers flank the\n     elevators.  A car arrives.  As the Brits enter...\n\n                               MAC (politely)\n                     We'll take the next one.\n\n     Waiting, calmly.  Mac smiles at a soldier.\n\n                               MAC (subtitled Mandarin)\n                     What time tomorrow do the tanks\n                     roll in?\n\n     The guy LAUGHS.  An elevator arrives.  Gin sipping champagne as\n     they enter.\n\n     The doors CLOSE.  They are alone.  The panel has floors 1 through\n     5 lit.  The other numbers, 6-10 and 16-47, are dark.  There are NO\n     numbers 11-15.\n\n     Mac pulls from his pocket a small flat DEVICE, not much thicker\n     than a credit card, with a window and a series of LED lights\n     on its face.  He fits it into a SLOT beside a black glass PLATE\n     on the elevator panel.  Immediately, the LEDs scramble, all RED,\n     numbers FLASH across the card's window, as the device begins\n     to lock on the elevator code.  In sequence, the LEDs turn GREEN,\n     and...\n\n     ...the glass plate LIGHTS, announcing in Kanji and English...ACCES\n     GRANTED TO FLOORS 11, 12, 14, 15.  Mac presses the lit number 14.\n\n     The elevator RISES.  He looks over at her.  She is tight enough\n     to snap.  We can feel her heart racing from here.\n\n                               MAC\n                     So all that time, sitting at your\n                     computers.  All the research, the\n                     access codes your job allowed you\n                     to steal, floor plans, schematics...\n                     setting up all your bank accounts...\n\n     She looks irritated.  He is smiling, gently.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Years of work, comes down to....\n                               (checks his watch)\n                     ...six minutes.  Don't be\n                     nervous.  Easy come, easy go.\n\n     She looks away.  The elevator stops.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Your share prob'ly works out\n                     to, what?  Dollar and a quarter\n                     an hour?\n\n     Me laughs.  The door opens.  She is pissed off.\n\n                               GIN\n                     What's your point?\n\n                               MAC (very real)\n                     That I like you, Ginger.\n\n     Now they're staring at each other.  An open elevator door.  An\n     empty dim hallway.  They see only each other.\n\n                               MAC\n                     The dedication, the skill,\n                     the guts...\n\n     He holds out the crook of his arm.  As a gentleman escorts a lady.\n\n                               MAC\n                     I'm going to see you get\n                     everything you deserve.\n\n     Her eyes flicker on that.  So he grins...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Woman.  If you can't have\n                     fun, right now.  You're in\n                     the wrong business.\n\n     She looks in his eyes.  Her body seems to relax, just a little.\n     She takes his arm.\n\n     INT. 14TH FLOOR\n\n     CLOSE on a KEYPAD.  Next to it, a mirrored PLATE with two\n     APERTURES, set apart the distance of human eyes.  Gin's goggled\n     face DROPS into frame, reflected in the mirrored surface.  She\n     fits her eyes to the apertures...\n\n                               GIN (whispers)\n                     Open.  Sesame.\n\n     A red scanning light APPEARS.  Tracks vertically.  BEEPS.  Tracks\n     horizontally.  And from somewhere...\n\n     ...a soft CLICK.  PULL BACK now, to see...\n\n     They stand at what seems the door to a BANK VAULT.  Round,\n     gigantic, heavy steel.  Bolts eyerywhere.  Mac reaches to GRASP\n     the handle, and...\n\n     CLANG.  The door swings OPEN.  They stare at the inner sanctum...\n\n     ...a windowless ROOM.  Dim, eerie fluorescence.  A blast of white\n     noise from the elaborate air-cooling system.  Two large MAINFRAME\n     COMPUTERS face each other from opposite walls, desks and work\n     stations with PC monitors filling the space between.  As Mac closes\n     the vault door behind them...\n\n     ...Gin goes quickly to the smaller mainframe.  Pulls the high-\n     resolution monitor around on its adjustable arm.  The screensaver\n     displays Guernsey cows swimming among tropical fish.  She hits a\n     key.  The screen saver replaced by, WELCOME.  AUTHORIZATION MODE\n     PLEASE.  Two boxes for PASSWORD and SCAN.  She hits SCAN.  A\n     plastic shield RISES, revealing...\n\n     ...the mirrored PLATE, the tiny APERTURES.  Gin leans to fit her\n     goggled eyes in place.  The red scanning light.  Vertical track.\n     BEEP.  Horizontal track.  And the monitor announces...WELCOME\n     MINISTER FEIHONG.  Gin takes off the goggles, and...\n\n     ...THROWS them across the room to Mac at the larger mainframe.  As\n     he repeats the scanning process, Gin is loading the precious CD-ROM\n     into her mainframe's driver.  Watches the screen...\n\n                               GIN\n                     Uploading.  And you've got...\n                     two minutes, fifty seconds.\n\n     WITH Mac now.  Typing the words CONTROL PANEL.  The screen now\n     shows icons for time setting, and he clicks his mouse to create a\n     CLOCK in the center of the screen, labeled LOCAL TIME, and reading\n     11:57:19, changing with each second that passes...\n\n                               MAC\n                     So let's see.

The British clock is 4 seconds FAST, the Chinese\n     clock 4 seconds SLOW.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Playing God here, Ginger.

She's rummaging on a nearby desk, finds a\n     LETTER OPENER.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Don't panic, now, there's no rush...\n\n                               GIN\n                     We can't leave it IN THERE, it's\n                     got all our accounts, everything\n                     that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!\n\n     She's fitting the letter opener INTO the narrow slot above the lid\n     of the driver.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Easy with that, there's no ru...\n\n     WHOOP!

Really scared.\n\n                               GIN\n                     We can't help it, we...we've\n                     gotta...\n\n     He stares at her.  In one motion, he SNATCHES a stapler from the\n     desk and SMASHES the driver with all his strength.\n\n     It pops open.  Calmly, he plucks her CD from the tray.  She mouths\n     a barely audible...\n\n                               GIN\n                     What a guy.\n\n     But just as she's about to bolt...he holds up one hand.  Slips\n     another CD from his pocket.  We see the words KENNY G.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Was wondering where to leave\n                     this...\n\n     Pops it IN the drive.  SLAMS it shut.\n\n                               MAC (quietly)\n                     Time to go.\n\n     INT. CORRIDOR\n\n     Mac and Gin RUNNING full tilt through the siren BLARE, turning a\n     corner to see ahead...\n\n     ...the balcony railing, the building's empty central CORE.  Mac\n     BOLTS straight TOWARD it, Gin sprinting to follow, lungs pounding,\n     they reach the railing, looking DOWN to see...\n\n     Hysteria, unimaginable chaos.  Soldiers, black-tie partygoers,\n     SCRAMBLING in all directions, looking to his left Mac sees...\n\n     ...the bank of ELEVATORS, soldiers POURING in, some cars already\n     RISING, fourth floor, fifth.  Now he looks directly BELOW, where...\n\n     ...soldiers are POUNDING up the metal service staircase, the front\n     rank almost at the third floor.  In the lobby, some faces look up\n     to see us, but no one is shooting.\n\n                               GIN\n                     They don't know we're the\n                     bad guys.\n\n     He PLUNGES his hand into her shoulder bag...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Time they find out.\n\n     Pulls OUT two PLASMA GRENADES, and FLINGS one toward the elevator\n     cables three floors down and it...\n\n     ...EXPLODES in a horrifying FIREBALL, causing PANDEMONIUM in the\n     lobby below, the elevator cables BLOWN AWAY, cars PLUNGING, the\n     yellow smoke momentarily screening us from the soldiers far below,\n     and Mac HURLS the second grenade...\n\n     ...STRAIGHT DOWN and the fireball WIPES OUT the staircase, a huge\n     section of ninth floor landing RAINING down on the lobby.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Okay.  How do we get down?\n\n                               MAC\n                     Down?  I never liked down.\n\n     Grabs her hand and they RACE to the staircase, as smoke BILLOWS\n     everywhere below.  UP they go, two stairs at a time, the lowest\n     glass-and-spiderweb-steel CANOPY is three floors above us, the\n     cacophany of SHOUTS below is like an amplified insane asylum.\n\n     He is dragging her now, up, up, BULLETS are flying blind through\n     the smoke, CHEWING up metal and glass all around us, up, up, and\n     as the smoke at last clears, they have reached...\n\n     ...the canopy floor.  They can see the army down below.  Clutching\n     her hand, Mac leads her OVER the railing, ONTO the canopy itself,\n     and together they RUN...\n\n     ...straight ACROSS the heavy glass toward the far side of the\n     building, like space-walking above the throng 150 feet below,\n     BULLETS now TRACING their path from beneath, SLAMMING OFF the\n     underside of the bulletproof canopy, Gin SHRIEKING with fright\n     as they go.  We see ahead...\n\n     ...three EXECUTIVE ELEVATORS beginning to climb the far wall.\n     These are glass-enclosed tubes, all filled with soldiers, the car\n     in the lead already at the tenth floor.  Mac keeps running straight\n     TOWARD them.\n\n                               GIN (out of breath)\n                     WE'VE GOT ONE MORE GRENADE!\n\n                               MAC (not)\n                     SAVE IT FOR A RAINY DAY!\n\n     They make it to the edge of the canopy, the lead elevator only two\n     floors below them.  We can see the soldiers through the glass.  Mac\n     GRASPS her hand, and as the car nears our level...\n\n                               MAC\n                     You can do this.\n\n     They LEAP across five feet of open air to...\n\n     ...LAND squarely on the car's metal roof, Mac WRAPPING his free arm\n     AROUND the cable, and UP we go.  The ant colony below us receding\n     fast.\n\n     Gin is hanging onto the cable, petrified.  Mac is looking up toward\n     the roof.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Okay, now what?\n\n                               MAC (absently)\n                     Shut up.  You're on a 'need-to-\n                     know' basis.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Mac, I'm sorry.\n\n     He looks at her.  Just now, she seems more miserable than afraid.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Turns out, I'm a screw-up.\n\n     He doesn't smile.  Passing the third canopy.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Well.  Something to be said for\n                     being self-aware.\n\n     Looks back up.  Forty-first floor.  Six to go.\n\n                               MAC\n                     May I have the last grenade, dear.\n                     It's about to rain.\n\n     She blinks.  Huh?  So he reaches into her bag, pulls out the\n     grenade, and THROWS it...\n\n     ...STRAIGHT up.  The roof above them EXPLODES in a FIREBALL, and\n     SHIELDS her body against the wall of their shaft, as a huge SECTION\n     of roof comes RAINING down.  We watch as it...\n\n     ...CRASHES through the upper canopy, TONS of roof and glass\n     PLUNGING to...\n\n     ...BLAST through the middle canopy, everyone below SCRAMBLING for\n     shelter, as the whole shebang...\n\n     ...EXPLODES through the lowest canopy.  Gin can only GAPE at the\n     incredible display.  Mouthing a silent WOW.\n\n     They've passed the second canopy, thirty-sixth floor.  Still\n     climbing.  The other two elevators maybe five floors below us.\n\n                               MAC\n                     You see, banking will be more\n                     democratic under China.\n\n     She looks to him.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Well.  No more glass ceiling.\n\n     The elevator car has STOPPED.  We are at the roof.  The soldiers\n     are in the car beneath our feet, nowhere to get out.  Above our\n     heads.\n\n     ...the last few feet of elevator cable.  And starry sky, where our\n     patch of roof used to be.\n\n                               MAC\n                     How refreshing.  The night air.\n\n     He begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable.  At the top, he\n     reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof,\n     GRABS it, LUNGES with his free hand, and...\n\n     ...DANGLING 47 floors, he pulls himself UP, swings ONTO the roof.\n     Reaches back down.  She is only twelve feet below him.  Frozen with\n     fear.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I can't do this.\n\n                               MAC\n                     You can.  If I say so.\n\n     She stares up at his eyes.  He smiles.\n\n                               MAC\n                     If you stay.  You'll have to pay\n                     for the damage...\n\n     She looks down at the mess below.\n\n     And starts to climb the cable.  Not so easy in a ball gown, but the\n     adrenaline is pumping.  Gets to the top.  Here's the hard part.\n     One hand reaches out...\n\n     ...GRABS his.  She lets GO.  And she is DANGLING in space.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Now that split.  Did we say\n                     60-40?\n\n     And with all his strength, hauls her up onto...\n\n     ...the roof.  Two-thirds of it remain.  At the far edge, a gigantic\n     MAINTENANCE CRANE, itself two stories high.  But between here and\n     the crane...\n\n     ...a HELICOPTER.  Big and beautifUl and empty.  She looks like\n     she's seen God.  Mac starts to jog toward it, she runs to follow\n     but sees him go...\n\n     ...straight PAST the chopper.\n\n                               GIN\n                     HEY!\n\n     He turns back.\n\n     She points to the copter.  It's over here.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Got the keys?\n\n     Oh.\n\n                               GIN\n                     I thought you could...hot-wire\n                     stuff?\n\n     Guess not.\n\n                               MAC\n                     They fix those things so you\n                     can't steal them...\n\n     And keeps walking.  Toward the monster CRANE.\n\n                               MAC\n                     These, they're not so worried.\n\n     Moving fast, he points off to his right.  Her eyes follow a\n     long CABLE, leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof,\n     attaching by a huge HOOK to a massive WRECKING BALL.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Go grab that hook.\n\n     He reaches the crane's cab.  Turns back to see she hasn't moved.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Let me rephrase that.  Run\n                     and grab that hook.  Or die...\n\n     Got it?  She takes off running.  He hops IN the cab.  PUSHES the\n     start button.  It rumbles to life.  Tests some levers...\n\n                               GIN (O.S.)\n                     SHIT!  DON'T DO THAT!\n\n     He turns to see that he's tightened the cable, pulling her ball six\n     feet in the AIR.

Up ahead...\n\n     ...Tsimshatsui Station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag,\n     leaning casually against a pole.

A blinding MOVE, the gun straight at his head,\n     Mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we...\n\n     WHIP PAN to see.  Half a dozen, everywhere, but none too close.\n     They REACT, pull their weapons, but it's a stand-off.  BACK TO...\n         \n     Two people. Alone in the universe.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Step onto the car, keep the\n                     pistol trained on my face.\n\n     She hesitates.  Does as he says.  Passengers are screaming,\n     cringing, bolting for other cars.  Our world is FROZEN.  His hands\n     raised...\n\n                               MAC\n                     Seems I was wrong.\n\n     Gentle smile.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Entrapment.  Is what robbers.\n                     Do to cops, huh?\n\n     Her eyes are flooding.  The gun is trembling.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Twenty seconds.  Shoot me in the\n                     shoulder, it'll slow them down.\n\n     Her pistol is shaking like she has palsy.  Tears are on her cheeks.\n\n                               GIN\n                     Oughta shoot you in the face.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Come on, you can do it, if I sa...\n\n                               GIN\n                     No way.  Not anymore.\n\n     She sobs.  She can't stand this.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Ten seconds, hold on.\n\n                               GIN\n                     When do I see you?\n\n     There is no answer.  There are no words.\n\n     The doors HISS SHUT.  She stares, training her pistol on him\n     through the glass, his hands reaching back to hold off the agents,\n     and the train...\n\n     PULLS away.  An instant to pick up speed, and it ROARS into a\n     tunnel.  Gone.\n\n     Mac stands motionless as ALL HELL breaks loose around him, AGENTS\n     rushing to his side, Mac shaking his head, calmly...\n         \n     Still staring after the train.\n\n                               MAC\n                     Airport.  Changing at Mongkok\n                     Station, we can cut her off.\n\n     Walkie-talkies WHIP out.  These guys are the same the world over.\n     We begin to CRANE UP...\n\n                               MAC\n                     She might lose the wig, be looking\n                     brunette or blonde, navy pants suit...\n\n                               AGENT\n                     I think Yaumatei changes for the\n                     airport, and it's closer.\n\n     Keep PULLING UP, an AERIAL VIEW now, too high to see their faces...\n\n                               MAC (O.S.)\n                     I think you're wrong, but cover it.\n                     You got maybe four minutes.\n\n     HIGHER still, the mob below an ant colony...\n\n                               MAC (O.S., calmly)\n                     No problem.  She's trapped.\n\n     But as the crowd parts.  We can make out one lone man...\n\n     Staring after.  What has gone.\n\n\n\n     FADE TO BLACK.
