EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING\n</b>\n          CLOSE ON: A \"Have A Nice Day\" HAPPY FACE PIN. STEAM rises\n          past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING.\n          We PULL BACK and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE\n          worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but amazingly not far from his\n          physical prime--body chiseled, built like a truck. Handsome\n          too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his face.\n          Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian\n          tea leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup .\n\n<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING\n</b>\n          The apartment is expensive but not quite luxurious. Terrific\n          New York view from the window. Blake lives well, if alone. He\n          sits on the couch with his cup of, tea, puts his feet up. Hits\n          the remote, turns the big screen TV on. The news:\n\n<b>          ANCHORWOMAN\n</b>          --addressing the United Nations today,\n          the President expressed his concern over\n          the increasingly intense territorial\n          disputes in both Asia and the Middle\n          East.\n          CUT TO: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES--\n\n<b>          PRESIDENT\n</b>          The sound of a bullet at one end of the\n          world echoes across the ocean to the\n          other end. Armed conflict is not self\n          contained in its respective region--the\n          consequences reverberate through every\n          nation across the world and therefore\n          must be avoided at all costs.\n          CUT BACK TO: The Anchorwoman--\n\n<b>          ANCHORWOMAN\n</b>          While the President's position was clear,\n          he did not comment on whether or not he\n          would order Dr. Manhattan into action\n          should the situation continue to\n          escalate.\n          CUT TO: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN--a man, at least he\n          appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage\n          shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads\n          straight for him.\n\n<b>          (CONTINUED)\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          2.\n</b>\n<b>          CONTINUED:\n</b>          With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan stops the missile in\n          its flight--frozen in mid-air--inches from his face.\n          With another wave, Dr. Manhattan DETONATES the missile. Dr.\n          Manhattan disappears in the EXPLOSION . but once the\n          smoke clears, we see he's still there. Unscathed--\n          --Blake snorts at the stock footage, changes the channel--\n          CRASH!--The FRONT DOOR EXPLODES, splintered by a KICK; Blake\n          jumps up, immediately at the ready--\n          --when we see the INTRUDER'S FEET entering. Slowly. Blake\n          sees the Intruder's face, though we never do--we only see\n          that he's dressed in ALL BLACK, including GLOVES and a KNIT\n          HAT. A look of recognition comes over Blake.\n\n<b>          BLAKE\n</b>          Just a matter of time, I suppose.\n          With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from\n          under his cup, sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The\n          Intruder BATS IT out of the air with even quicker reflexes,\n          but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL with a SILENCER\n          from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He's a pro\n          . but so is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot\n          off, the Intruder is already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out\n          of Blake's hand--\n          --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder\n          drops the gun. Blake fights. Not like an old man, but like\n          the trained killer he is. But the Intruder is much, much\n          faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with an elbow to\n          the head.\n          Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake\n          up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great\n          New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in\n          the eye\n          . and starts laughing. Hysterical.\n\n<b>          BLAKE (CONT'D)\n</b>          I always thought I knew the punchline.\n          But I guess the joke's on me now.\n          He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard Blake a moment--\n          --then, with incredible strength, he LIFTS BLAKE OVER HIS\n          HEAD AND THROWS BLAKE THROUGH THE WINDOW. Blake never makes a\n          sound as he plummets to the sidewalk.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          3.\n</b>\n<b>          EXT. STREET - EVENING\n</b>\n          CLOSE ON: Blake's dead body. His eyes are wide open, not in\n          fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his\n          head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the\n          sidewalk by his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood\n          DRIPS on it\n          . when the pin is WASHED AWAY.\n\n<b>          EXT. STREET - LATER (TIME CUT)\n</b>\n          A SHOPKEEPER has his HOSE out, spraying off the blood from\n          the sidewalk. Blake's body is gone, a CHALK OUTLINE in its\n          place. A COP comes running up to the Shopkeeper.\n\n<b>          COP 1\n</b>          Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!\n\n<b>          SHOPKEEPER\n</b>          It's been over four hours, I got a\n          business to run--\n          As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as\n          the water carries it to a DRAIN--\n          --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV\n          as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it.\n          We never see his face. We move from his POV--\n          --to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at\n          the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still\n          arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow\n          tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG.\n          Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse\n          the magazines and periodicals, most of which have\n          inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere\n          currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads \"War?\", The\n          New York Times: \"China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese\n          Waters,\" The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President\n          with Dr. Manhattan: \"What Me Worry?\"\n          The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers.\n\n<b>          NEWS VENDOR\n</b>          (re: headlines)\n          Depressing ain't it?\n\n<b>          MAN\n</b>          But good for business, right?\n\n<b>          (CONTINUED)\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          4.\n</b>\n<b>          CONTINUED:\n</b>\n<b>          NEWS VENDOR\n</b>          Yeah.

We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW--\n\n<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n          --inside the apartment, where DET. GALLAGHER (older, jaded)\n          and DET.

Fine to ponder this.\n\n<b>          EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING\n</b>\n          Outside Blake's apartment building. It's later now, the news\n          stand is closed, businesses closed, people gone.\n          We move into someone's POV. The person stares up at the\n          broken window of Blake's apartment, now covered with PLASTIC\n\n<b>          SHEETING.\n</b>\n<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.)\n</b>          Rorschach's Journal, October 12th.\n          Earlier today I came across what appeared\n          to be a suicide. It was later learned to\n          be a homicide. Someone's time was up.\n          Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his\n          pocket--the happy face pin. We realize that this was the\n          person whose POV we were in earlier.\n\n<b>          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)\n</b>          I discovered a clue. Something I\n          recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly\n          . I heard my own clock ticking.\n          We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time--\n          RORSCHACH (roar-shock)--a masked vigilante who wears a trench\n          coat, fedora, and a silver-white MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS\n          moving about, creating shifting, doubled PATTERNS like a\n          Rorschach test. Scary looking.\n          Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and\n          FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches\n          itself through Blake's broken window. Pressing RETRACT,\n          Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          6.\n</b>\n<b>          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT\n</b>\n          With a grunt, Rorschach pulls himself past the plastic\n          sheeting, through the window, and into Blake's apartment. He\n          investigates, silent. He sees the same things that the cops\n          saw . . but he notices the speakers by the TV. Notices one\n          of the speaker covers is ever so slightly askew.\n          Rorschach pulls the speaker cover off and discovers that the\n          speaker was hollow. (The Intruder clearly took Blake's gun\n          and put the cover back on when he left. Why?)\n\n<b>          INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT\n</b>\n          Blake's clothing hangs in military rows. Rorschach runs his\n          fingers along the wall-seams. He pauses, presses on the\n          hanger BAR, which SLIDES BACK to reveal a RED BUTTON.\n          Pressing it, the BACK WALL of the closet SLIDES OPEN,\n          revealing a SECRET COMPARTMENT. On the wall is an old FRAMED\n          PHOTO of EIGHT PEOPLE IN COSTUMES, from the 60s. Included in\n          this photo is a young Edward Blake--Blake wasn't a spook--he\n          was a superhero.\n          WEAPONS of all kinds adorn the walls in here. TEAR-GAS,\n          GRENADES, RIFLES, PISTOLS--if it can kill you Blake's got it.\n          But that's not what draws Rorschach's attention.\n          Hanging on the back wall, dead center, is a more current\n          COSTUME. Black leather armor, gloves, boots. Hanging over it\n          all like a vacant, grinning face--a black leather MASK.\n          Rorschach stares. Framed nearby is the FRONT PAGE OF THE\n          BOSTON GLOBE. The headline reads \"The Comedian Gets Last\n          Laugh On Moloch.\" Underneath is a photo of Blake dressed in\n          the costume Rorschach was staring at--Blake was a superhero\n          called the Comedian. In the photo, Blake holds a supervillian\n          named MOLOCH prisoner. (We'll meet Moloch later.)\n          On the same page is a smaller photo of a group of\n          superheroes. Rorschach is in the photo, as is Dr. Manhattan,\n          as is the Comedian. (As are DAN DREIBERG, ADRIAN VEIDT, and\n          LAURIE JUPITER, all of whom we'll be meeting soon). The\n          caption below reads: \"The New Watchmen.\"\n          Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open. He quickly\n          closes the secret hatch.\n\n<b>          INT.

Watch the door.\n          Cop 1 pulls his gun, going through the motions rather than\n          being concerned. He then enters the bedroom.\n          Cop 2 stands guard, nervous From the bedroom:\n\n<b>          COP 1 (O.S.) (CONT'D)\n</b>          Clear!

The Cop's face goes slack with childish terror. He goes\n          to yell but Rorschach raises two fingers, \"Shhh\"--\n          The fingers JAB INTO THE COP'S WINDPIPE. The cop HISSES and\n          falls silently as Rorschach brushes past him like a whisper.\n\n<b>          HOLLIS (O.S.)\n</b>          See, the Comedian thought he had it all\n          worked out.\n\n<b>          INT.

I don't.\n          Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life.\n          His fighting style has changed. Dan's newfound brutality is\n          informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach. About\n          justice. About life.\n          But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with\n          ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so\n          focused on his goal.

Out of tricks, out\n          of time, he searches his belt for something, anything, and\n          finds one last OWL-WING. The WINGS SNAP OUT. Desperate, he\n\n<b>          FLICKS IT AT ADRIAN--\n</b>          Who merely SNATCHES the owl-Wing out of the air.
