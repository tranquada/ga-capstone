EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING\n\n          CLOSE ON: A \"Have A Nice Day\" HAPPY FACE PIN. STEAM rises\n          past the pin. We hear a KETTLE BOILING.\n          We PULL BACK and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a ROBE\n          worn by EDWARD BLAKE, 63, but amazingly not far from his\n          physical prime--body chiseled, built like a truck. Handsome\n          too, save the LONG SCAR running down the side of his face.\n          Blake removes the kettle from the stove. He scoops some Asian\n          tea leaves from a can, dumps them in a cup .\n\n          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING\n\n          The apartment is expensive but not quite luxurious. Terrific\n          New York view from the window. Blake lives well, if alone. He\n          sits on the couch with his cup of, tea, puts his feet up. Hits\n          the remote, turns the big screen TV on. The news:\n\n          ANCHORWOMAN\n          --addressing the United Nations today,\n          the President expressed his concern over\n          the increasingly intense territorial\n          disputes in both Asia and the Middle\n          East.\n          CUT TO: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES--\n\n          PRESIDENT\n          The sound of a bullet at one end of the\n          world echoes across the ocean to the\n          other end. Armed conflict is not self\n          contained in its respective region--the\n          consequences reverberate through every\n          nation across the world and therefore\n          must be avoided at all costs.\n          CUT BACK TO: The Anchorwoman--\n\n          ANCHORWOMAN\n          While the President's position was clear,\n          he did not comment on whether or not he\n          would order Dr. Manhattan into action\n          should the situation continue to\n          escalate.\n          CUT TO: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN--a man, at least he\n          appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage\n          shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads\n          straight for him.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          With a wave of his hand, Dr. Manhattan stops the missile in\n          its flight--frozen in mid-air--inches from his face.\n          With another wave, Dr. Manhattan DETONATES the missile. Dr.\n          Manhattan disappears in the EXPLOSION . but once the\n          smoke clears, we see he's still there. Unscathed--\n          --Blake snorts at the stock footage, changes the channel--\n          CRASH!--The FRONT DOOR EXPLODES, splintered by a KICK; Blake\n          jumps up, immediately at the ready--\n          --when we see the INTRUDER'S FEET entering. Slowly. Blake\n          sees the Intruder's face, though we never do--we only see\n          that he's dressed in ALL BLACK, including GLOVES and a KNIT\n          HAT. A look of recognition comes over Blake.\n\n          BLAKE\n          Just a matter of time, I suppose.\n          With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from\n          under his cup, sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The\n          Intruder BATS IT out of the air with even quicker reflexes,\n          but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL with a SILENCER\n          from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He's a pro\n          . but so is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot\n          off, the Intruder is already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out\n          of Blake's hand--\n          --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder\n          drops the gun. Blake fights. Not like an old man, but like\n          the trained killer he is. But the Intruder is much, much\n          faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with an elbow to\n          the head.\n          Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake\n          up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great\n          New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in\n          the eye\n          . and starts laughing. Hysterical.\n\n          BLAKE (CONT'D)\n          I always thought I knew the punchline.\n          But I guess the joke's on me now.\n          He laughs. The INTRUDER seems to regard Blake a moment--\n          --then, with incredible strength, he LIFTS BLAKE OVER HIS\n          HEAD AND THROWS BLAKE THROUGH THE WINDOW. Blake never makes a\n          sound as he plummets to the sidewalk.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3.\n\n          EXT. STREET - EVENING\n\n          CLOSE ON: Blake's dead body. His eyes are wide open, not in\n          fear, but in resignation. As BLOOD starts to POOL behind his\n          head, we move to the happy face pin Blake wore, now on the\n          sidewalk by his neck. We slowly ZOOM IN on the pin as blood\n          DRIPS on it\n          . when the pin is WASHED AWAY.\n\n          EXT. STREET - LATER (TIME CUT)\n\n          A SHOPKEEPER has his HOSE out, spraying off the blood from\n          the sidewalk. Blake's body is gone, a CHALK OUTLINE in its\n          place. A COP comes running up to the Shopkeeper.\n\n          COP 1\n          Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!\n\n          SHOPKEEPER\n          It's been over four hours, I got a\n          business to run--\n          As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as\n          the water carries it to a DRAIN--\n          --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV\n          as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it.\n          We never see his face. We move from his POV--\n          --to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at\n          the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still\n          arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow\n          tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG.\n          Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse\n          the magazines and periodicals, most of which have\n          inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere\n          currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads \"War?\", The\n          New York Times: \"China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese\n          Waters,\" The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President\n          with Dr. Manhattan: \"What Me Worry?\"\n          The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers.\n\n          NEWS VENDOR\n          (re: headlines)\n          Depressing ain't it?\n\n          MAN\n          But good for business, right?\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          4.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          NEWS VENDOR\n          Yeah.

We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW--\n\n          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          --inside the apartment, where DET. GALLAGHER (older, jaded)\n          and DET.

FINE\n          Edward Blake--63 years old, six-two, 225.\n          A solid 225, guy was built like a\n          linebacker.

Fine to ponder this.\n\n          EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING\n\n          Outside Blake's apartment building. It's later now, the news\n          stand is closed, businesses closed, people gone.\n          We move into someone's POV. The person stares up at the\n          broken window of Blake's apartment, now covered with PLASTIC\n\n          SHEETING.\n\n          RORSCHACH (V.0.)\n          Rorschach's Journal, October 12th.\n          Earlier today I came across what appeared\n          to be a suicide. It was later learned to\n          be a homicide. Someone's time was up.\n          Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his\n          pocket--the happy face pin. We realize that this was the\n          person whose POV we were in earlier.\n\n          RORSCHACH (V.0.) (CONT'D)\n          I discovered a clue. Something I\n          recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly\n          . I heard my own clock ticking.\n          We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time--\n          RORSCHACH (roar-shock)--a masked vigilante who wears a trench\n          coat, fedora, and a silver-white MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS\n          moving about, creating shifting, doubled PATTERNS like a\n          Rorschach test. Scary looking.\n          Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and\n          FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches\n          itself through Blake's broken window. Pressing RETRACT,\n          Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          6.\n\n          INT. EDWARD BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\n          With a grunt, Rorschach pulls himself past the plastic\n          sheeting, through the window, and into Blake's apartment. He\n          investigates, silent. He sees the same things that the cops\n          saw . . but he notices the speakers by the TV. Notices one\n          of the speaker covers is ever so slightly askew.\n          Rorschach pulls the speaker cover off and discovers that the\n          speaker was hollow. (The Intruder clearly took Blake's gun\n          and put the cover back on when he left. Why?)\n\n          INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT\n\n          Blake's clothing hangs in military rows. Rorschach runs his\n          fingers along the wall-seams. He pauses, presses on the\n          hanger BAR, which SLIDES BACK to reveal a RED BUTTON.\n          Pressing it, the BACK WALL of the closet SLIDES OPEN,\n          revealing a SECRET COMPARTMENT. On the wall is an old FRAMED\n          PHOTO of EIGHT PEOPLE IN COSTUMES, from the 60s. Included in\n          this photo is a young Edward Blake--Blake wasn't a spook--he\n          was a superhero.\n          WEAPONS of all kinds adorn the walls in here. TEAR-GAS,\n          GRENADES, RIFLES, PISTOLS--if it can kill you Blake's got it.\n          But that's not what draws Rorschach's attention.\n          Hanging on the back wall, dead center, is a more current\n          COSTUME. Black leather armor, gloves, boots. Hanging over it\n          all like a vacant, grinning face--a black leather MASK.\n          Rorschach stares. Framed nearby is the FRONT PAGE OF THE\n          BOSTON GLOBE. The headline reads \"The Comedian Gets Last\n          Laugh On Moloch.\" Underneath is a photo of Blake dressed in\n          the costume Rorschach was staring at--Blake was a superhero\n          called the Comedian. In the photo, Blake holds a supervillian\n          named MOLOCH prisoner. (We'll meet Moloch later.)\n          On the same page is a smaller photo of a group of\n          superheroes. Rorschach is in the photo, as is Dr. Manhattan,\n          as is the Comedian. (As are DAN DREIBERG, ADRIAN VEIDT, and\n          LAURIE JUPITER, all of whom we'll be meeting soon). The\n          caption below reads: \"The New Watchmen.\"\n          Suddenly, Rorschach hears the front door open. He quickly\n          closes the secret hatch.\n\n          INT. BLAKE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Two uniformed COPS stand in the doorway.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          7.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          COP 1\n          You sure it wasn't the wind?\n\n          COP 2\n          Nah, I definitely heard something.\n\n          COP 1\n          I tell ya, I'd rather do traffic duty\n          than be posted at a crime scene all\n          night. Watch the door.\n          Cop 1 pulls his gun, going through the motions rather than\n          being concerned. He then enters the bedroom.\n          Cop 2 stands guard, nervous From the bedroom:\n\n          COP 1 (O.S.) (CONT'D)\n          Clear! I'm checking the other rooms.\n          Cop 2 relaxes a bit, turns--\n          --and comes face to \"face\" with Rorschach, standing inches\n          away. The Cop's face goes slack with childish terror. He goes\n          to yell but Rorschach raises two fingers, \"Shhh\"--\n          The fingers JAB INTO THE COP'S WINDPIPE. The cop HISSES and\n          falls silently as Rorschach brushes past him like a whisper.\n\n          HOLLIS (O.S.)\n          See, the Comedian thought he had it all\n          worked out.\n\n          INT. HOLLIS MASON'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING\n\n          CLOSE ON: A FRAMED PHOTO of the first Watchmen--identical to\n          the old one in Blake's closet.

There's a strong familiarity between the two but\n          at the same time, Dan is wary.\n\n          DAN\n          You were on the news.

With some\n          difficulty, Dan PULLS OPEN the HINGED BOOKSHELF with a RUSTY\n          CREAK. STEEL STAIRS lead down into the dark.\n\n          INT.

No-one has been down here for years. In the center\n          of the space, an OVAL VEHICLE the size of a subway car is\n          covered by a dusty TARP--the Owl-Ship.\n\n          DAN\n          How did it happen?\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          12\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          RORSCHACH\n          Murder.

Kill the Comedian?\n          Ridiculous.\n\n          DAN\n          You're right. I heard he was working for\n          the government. Maybe it was a political\n          killing.\n\n          RORSCHACH\n          Maybe.

The man\n          wasn't exactly endearing. Just because\n          something happened to him doesn't mean it\n          involves us.\n\n          RORSCHACH\n          One of our own has been murdered.

Dan glances at his old costume hanging.\n\n          INT. SLEAZY MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\n          The kind of room you rent by the hour. Or the minute even.

Then takes his\n          UNIFORM off like he can't wait. The Hooker gets on top of him-\n          --when the DOOR FLIES OFF THE HINGES. Rorschach steps in,\n          yanks the Hooker off--\n          --the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which\n          Rorschach dodges. Rorschach GRABS the guy's arm, then KICKS\n          the Officer on the side of his KNEE, tearing the joint to\n          shreds. The Officer cries out in pain, falls to the floor--\n          Rorschach nails him in the head with a BLACK JACK, knocking\n          him out.\n          The Hooker screams. Rorschach grabs her by the hair and SLAMS\n          her face into the wall.\n\n          RORSCHACH\n          Quiet, whore.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          14.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          Nose broken and bleeding, the Hooker quiets to a whimper.\n          Rorschach takes the officer's uniform and ID.

A game of chicken.\n          She reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office.\n          Once she's gone, Dan's glare disappears, replaced by\n          nervousness. Because he's not sure if Adrian will see him--\n          it's been a long time. He glances at the SECURITY GUARDS\n          eyeing him. Finally, the Assistant returns.\n\n          ASSISTANT\n          Go on in, Mr. Dreiberg.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          15.\n\n          INT.

Adrian sees Dan\n          approaching, smiles wide. He holds up a finger, telling Dan\n          to hold on a sec. Dan nods, takes a seat on the couch.

Kovacs was captured\n          last night and charged with the murder of\n          Edgar Jacobi, formerly known as the\n          supervillain Moloch. Moloch was found\n          shot in the head at point blank range.\n          Both Dan and Laurie stop what they're doing, eyes fixed on\n          the TV: They see Rorschach, unmasked, IN SHACKLES.\n\n          ANCHORWOMAN (CONT'D)\n          Inside the decrepit apartment, police\n          discovered stacks of right-wing\n          literature, including several years of\n          back issues of the ultra-conservative\n          publication, \"The New Frontiersman.\" We\n          asked \"New Frontiersman\" editor, Hector\n          Godfrey, for comment.\n          CUT TO: A clip of the EDITOR being interviewed.

Calling him \"son of a whore.\" Rorschach\n          just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his\n          face. Suddenly, Rorschach's face changes.

The front door is KICKED OPEN, smashing the lock.\n          Rorschach moves between a line of headless MANNEQUINS. In one\n          corner rests an old WOOD-BURNING STOVE. Rorschach peers\n          inside, removes a BLACKENED scrap of UNDERWEAR. It's\n          decorated with little hearts and bears.\n\n          RORSCHACH (V.0.)\n          I knew the girl was here. But when I\n          searched the place I found nothing.\n\n          INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)\n\n          Rorschach enters the kitchen. Out the window, the DOGS are\n          fighting. Rorschach opens a cupboard, where a line of KNIVES,\n          CLEAVERS and a HACKSAW hang on hooks. Outside, the snarling\n          dogs get LOUDER.\n          Slowly now, Rorschach's gaze moves from the knives . to\n          the counter. He runs his gloved finger along RED STAINED,\n          DEEP-CUT GROOVES in a THICK WOODEN CHOPPING BLOCK. Blood. His\n          gaze continues out the window\n\n          RORSCHACH (V.0.)\n          And then I found her.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          69.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          . to the dogs, still fighting over the BONE, which we now\n          recognize as a small, HUMAN FEMUR--that of the little girl.\n          Rorschach clenches his hands in fury, his fists tremble\n          and suddenly, he relaxes. Calms.\n          Rorschach slowly turns to the cupboard. He reaches for a\n          large CLEAVER .\n\n          EXT. HOUSE - LATER (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)\n\n          The CHILD MOLESTER, greasy and fat, walks past the now-silent\n          fence.\n\n           RORSCHACH (V.0.)\n           It was dark when the murderer got back.\n           As dark as it gets.\n\n          INT.

The SECOND DOG SMASHES INTO HIM\n          FROM A SECOND WINDOW. His gun goes flying. He scrambles\n          backward against the stove.\n          FROM BEHIND, Rorschach CUFFS THE MAN'S WRIST TO THE STOVE.\n          When the Child Molester sees that \"face,\" he loses his\n          bladder.

Where's your evidence?\n          Rorschach calmly points to body of the dog.

Warm\n          blood splashed my face. It was Walter\n          Kovacs who screamed, who closed his eyes--\n          it was Rorschach who opened them again.\n          The silence reels out\n          RORSCHACH (cont'd)\n          You see, Doctor. God didn't kill that\n          little girl, fate didn't butcher her and\n          destiny didn't feed her to those dogs. If\n          God saw what any of us did that night, he\n          didn't seem to mind. From then on, I\n          knew. God doesn't make the world this\n          way. We do.\n          The Psychiatrist rises shakily. He crosses to the GUARD.\n\n          PSYCHIATRIST\n          I can't help him.\n\n          INT. PRISON COMMISSARY - EVENING\n\n          The Mess hall is PACKED, hundreds of INMATES eat dinner.\n          Rorschach enters.

A HUGE\n          PRISONER moves in behind him. He whispers:\n\n          PRISONER\n          Hey, Rorschach. You're pretty famous,\n          right? Y'know, I'm pretty famous too.\n          Maybe I can give you my autograph.\n          The Prisoner slides a SHIV from his sleeve\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          71.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          Rorschach doesn't register this.

The man SHRIEKS like a FIRE WHISTLE and\n          CRASHES TO THE GROUND. The Guards DESCEND on Rorschach.\n          Rorschach is calm as he's dragged away. As the injured man's\n          screams fall away to weak, bubbling hitches, the room once\n          again goes silent. Rorschach eyes the fearful, hateful eyes\n          of the room, marking each one. And in the silence he speaks,\n          his icy voice carrying easily.\n\n          RORSCHACH\n          None of you understand. I'm not locked up\n          in here with you.\n          Rorschach is placidly dragged off INTO DARKNESS\n\n          RORSCHACH (CONT'D)\n          You're locked up in here with me.\n\n          INT.

He's the only one with the\n          finances to create an entire company for\n          the sole purpose of setting up Dr.\n          Manhattan. And Adrian was directly\n          involved in arranging that broadcast.

And now that\n          our work is finished, and we finally get\n          to go home, I can say that it was all\n          worth it.

I don't\n          know, I just couldn't stay mad. It\n          just happened--\n          Laurie kisses her mother's teary cheek.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          121.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          LAURIE\n          Mom. People's lives take them strange\n          places. You never did anything wrong by\n          me.\n          Sally jumps as a CLICK/WHIR SOUND comes from a BOOKCASE.\n\n          SALLY\n          What the hell is that?\n\n          LAURIE\n          Oh that's Dan. Home from \"work.\"\n          The bookcase SLIDES ASIDE and a blond DAN enters from the\n          secret ELEVATOR. He is trim and confident, cheeks flushed\n          with color. Buttoning up his shirt, he spots Sally.\n\n          DAN\n          Oh hi.\n\n          SALLY\n          Hello, Dan. Excuse me, I should clean up.\n          Sally wipes her runny make-up, goes to the bathroom.\n          Dan and Laurie embrace, kiss.\n\n          LAURIE\n          Any bad guys last night?\n\n          DAN\n          There are always bad guys. Even in\n          today's world.\n          Slow, Laurie turns to the window. Looks out at the New York\n          skyline being rebuilt.\n\n          LAURIE\n          Dan.\n\n          DAN\n          Hmm?\n\n          LAURIE\n          Will it be alright? The world, I mean.\n          He puts his arm around her shoulder.\n\n          DAN\n          As long as no-one ever finds out that\n          Adrian was behind it all, the public will\n          think ion is still up there, watching.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          122.\n\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n\n          DAN (CONT'D)\n          The threat remains, and everything should\n          be fine.\n\n          LAURIE\n          Yeah.
