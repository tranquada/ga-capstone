STRATTON OAKMONT II - BULLPEN - LATER THAT DAY            70\r\n\r\n     Bustling with activity. Jordan enters, crosses toward\r\n     his office. Off to the side of the bullpen, he notices\r\n     three dozen YOUNG MEN in business suits.

At the end of the                    *\r\n           day all they really want is for me                  *\r\n           to cooperate - that's it.                           *\r\n           See, apparently, I know so much                     *\r\n           about what's going on in the stock                  *\r\n           market that I could save the                        *\r\n           government years of heartache. But                  *\r\n           it get's even better... You see,                    *\r\n           if I cooperate I'll only have to                    *\r\n           serve four short years and any                      *\r\n           fine I'd have to pay wouldn't be                    *\r\n           due til after I serve my sentence.                  *\r\n           We'll still have plenty of money                    *\r\n           left over. The only thing that I                    *\r\n           was kind of upset about was the                     *\r\n           fact that I might have to give                      *\r\n           them information about my friends.                  *\r\n\r\n                         NAOMI                                 *\r\n           Like you said, \"There's no friends                  *\r\n           on Wall Street\".                                    *\r\n\r\n                         JORDAN                                *\r\n           But there's a silver lining to                      *\r\n           that too...
