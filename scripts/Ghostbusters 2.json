EAST 77TH STREET - DAY\n\nA car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is\nhaving a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.\nDANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full\nbags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The\n\nbuilding superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to\nnotice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDANA\n\t\t\t\t (exasperated)\n\t\t\tFrank, do you think you could give me a hand\n\t\t\twith these bags?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\tI'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.

Surprised by the movement, she reaches\nfor the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even\nfurther.  Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps\nrolling down the street at ever increasing speed.\n\nSIDEWALK\n\nDana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians\nfor help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy\nswerves and continues unchecked.\n\nINTERSECTION\n\nCars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races\ntoward the corner.\n\nDANA\n\nShe puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.\n\nEXT.

Yes, it could happen, but do you\n\t\t\tthink anybody wants to read a book about it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMILTON\n\t\t\tWell, I think it's important for people to know\n\t\t\tthat the world is in danger.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\n\t\t\tOkay, so can you tell us when it's going to\n\t\t\thappen or do we have to buy the book?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMILTON\n\t\t\tI predict that the world will end at the\n\t\t\tstroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVENKMAN\n\t\t\tThis year?  That's cutting it a little close,\n\t\t\tisn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of\n\t\t\tview, the book just came out, right?  So you're\n\t\t\tnot even looking at the paperback release for\n\t\t\tmaybe a year.  And it's going to be at least\n\t\t\tanother year after that if the thing has\n\t\t\tmovie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.\n\t\t\tYou would have been better off predicting 1992\n\t\t\tor even '94 just to be safe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMILTON\n\t\t\t\t (irritated)\n\t\t\tThis is not just some money-making scheme!
