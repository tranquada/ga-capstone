A bit trampled and\r\n           busted and covered in ice, but it's\r\n           home. It's our home.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          They swoop past a gathered crowd on the battered bleachers as\r\n          Snotlout dunks the sheep in his basket. Eret joins the race\r\n          atop Skullcrusher.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          They fly past Hiccup and Toothless, who are steadily hoisting\r\n          a palette of timber and supplies onto a rooftop where workers\r\n          are rebuilding the damaged houses.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Hiccup then turns his attention to a massive statue of\r\n          Stoick, presently under construction.

Oh, even more so!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He looks to the horizon, scanning it from east to west to\r\n          ensure that no trouble is approaching.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Astrid and Stormfly buzz past him playfully, coaxing him to\r\n          join the game.

Toothless looks back with a\r\n          gummy smile.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>           HICCUP (V.O.)\r\n</b>           You see, we have something they\r\n           don't.

As they\r\n          approach, Toothless bounces Hiccup into the air, allowing him\r\n          to dunk the black sheep into Astrid's basket. They reunite on\r\n          the other side.
