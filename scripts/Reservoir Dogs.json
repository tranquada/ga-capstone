Unless a patrol\n                 car is cruising that street, at\n                 that particular moment, you got\n                 four minutes before they can\n                 realistically respond.  In one\n                 minute there were seventeen blue\n                 boys out there.

With the exception of\n                 Eddie and myself, who you already\n                 know, you'll be using aliases.\n                 Under no circumstances are you to\n                 tell one another your real name or\n                 anything else about yourself.\n                 That includes where you're from,\n                 your wife's name, where you\n                 might've done time, about a bank\n                 in St. Petersburg you might've\n                 robbed.  You guys don't say shit\n                 about who you are, where you been\n                 or what you've done.  Only thing\n                 you guys can talk about is what\n                 you're going to do.  This way the\n                 only ones who know who the members\n                 of the team are are Eddie and\n                 myself.  And that's the way I like\n                 it.  Because in the unlikely event\n                 of one of you getting apprehended\n                 by the cops, not that I expect\n                 that to happen - it most\n                 definitely should not happen - it\n                 hasn't happened, you don't have\n                 anything to deal with.  You don't\n                 know any names.  You know my name,\n                 you know Eddie's name.  That I\n                 don't care about.  You gotta prove\n                 it.  I ain't worried.  Besides,\n                 this way you gotta trust me.  I\n                 like that.  I set this up and\n                 picked the men I wanted for it.\n                 None of you came to me, I\n                 approached all of you.  I know\n                 you.

If you get a customer\n                 or an employee who thinks he's\n                 Charles Bronson, take the butt of\n                 your gun and smash their nose in.\n                 Drops 'em right to the floor.\n                 Everyone jumps, he falls down,\n                 screaming, blood squirts out his\n                 nose.
