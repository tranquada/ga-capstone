UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING\n\n       Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a\n       breakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,\n       MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,\n       and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and\n       are enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a\n       small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and\n       involved story about Madonna.\n\n                              MR. PINK \n                 \"Like a Virgin\" is all about a\n                 girl who digs a guy with a big\n                 dick.  The whole song is a\n                 metaphor for big dicks.\n\n                              MR. BLUE\n                 No it's not.  It's about a girl\n                 who is very vulnerable and she's\n                 been fucked over a few times.\n                 Then she meets some guy who's\n                 really sensitive--\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 --Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.\n                 Tell that bullshit to the\n                 tourists.\n\n                              JOE\n                         (looking through his\n                          address book)\n                 Toby...who the fuck is Toby?\n                 Toby...Toby...think...think...\n                 think...\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 It's not about a nice girl who\n                 meets a sensitive boy.  Now\n                 granted that's what \"True Blue\" is\n                 about, no argument about that.\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 Which one is \"True Blue?\"\n\n                              NICE GUY EDDIE\n                 You don't remember \"True Blue?\"\n                 That was a big ass hit for\n                 Madonna.  Shit, I don't even\n                 follow this Tops In Pops shit, and\n                 I've at least heard of \"True\n                 Blue.\"\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 Look, asshole, I didn't say I\n                 ain't heard of it.  All I asked\n                 was how does it go?  Excuse me\n                 for not being the world's biggest\n                 Madonna fan.\n\n                              MR. BROWN\n                 I hate Madonna.\n\n                              MR. BLUE\n                 I like her early stuff.  You know,\n                 \"Lucky Star,\" \"Borderline\" - but\n                 once she got into her \"Papa Don't\n                 Preach\" phase, I don't know, I\n                 tuned out.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Hey, fuck all that, I'm\n                 making a point here.  You're gonna\n                 make me lose my train\n                 of thought.\n\n                              JOE\n                 Oh fuck, Toby's that little china\n                 girl.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 What's that?\n\n                              JOE\n                 I found this old address book in a\n                 jacket I ain't worn in a coon's\n                 age.  Toby what?  What the fuck\n                 was her last name?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Where was I?\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 You said \"True Blue\" was about a\n                 nice girl who finds a sensitive\n                 fella.  But \"Like a Virgin\" was a\n                 metaphor for big dicks.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Let me tell ya what \"Like a\n                 Virgin\"'s about.  It's about some\n                 cooze who's a regular fuck\n                 machine.\n                 I mean all the time, morning, day,\n                 night, afternoon, dick, dick,\n                 dick, dick, dick,\n                 dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,\n                 dick.\n\n                              MR. BLUE\n                 How many dicks was that?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 A lot.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Then one day she meets a John\n                 Holmes motherfucker, and it's\n                 like, whoa baby.  This mother\n                 fucker's like Charles Bronson in\n                 \"The Great Escape.\"  He's diggin\n                 tunnels.  Now she's gettin this\n                 serious dick action, she's feelin\n                 something she ain't felt since\n                 forever.  Pain.\n\n                              JOE\n                 Chew?  Toby Chew?  No.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 It hurts.  It hurts her.  It\n                 shouldn't hurt.  Her pussy should\n                 be Bubble-Yum by now.  But when\n                 this cat fucks her, it hurts.  It\n                 hurts like the first time.  The\n                 pain is reminding a fuck machine\n                 what is was like to be a virgin.\n                 Hence, \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\n       The fellas crack up.\n\n                              JOE\n                 Wong?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Fuck you, wrong.  I'm right!  What\n                 the fuck do you know about it\n                 anyway?  You're still listening to\n                 Jerry-fucking-Vale.\n\n                              JOE\n                 Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You\n                 know, like the Chinese name?\n\n       Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.  They\n       fight, but they're not really mad at each other.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Give me this fucking thing.\n\n                              JOE\n                 What the fuck do you think you're\n                 doin?  Give me my book back!\n\n                              MR.

WHITE\n                 Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna\n                 have to keep it.\n\n                              MR. BLONDE\n                 Joe, you want me to shoot him for\n                 you?\n\n                              MR.

PINK\n                 Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?\n\n                              NICE GUY EDDIE\n                 Can you believe the songs they\n                 been playin?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 No, I can't.  You know what I\n                 heard the other day?  \"Heartbeat -\n                 It's Lovebeat,\" by little Tony\n                 DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.\n                 I haven't heard that since I was\n                 in fifth fuckin grade.\n\n                              NICE GUY EDDIE\n                 When I was coming down here, I was\n                 playin it.  And \"The Night the\n                 Lights Went Out in Georgia\" came\n                 on.  Now I ain't heard that song\n                 since it was big, but when it was\n                 big, I heard it a million-\n                 trillion times.  I'm listening to\n                 it this morning, and this was the\n                 first time I ever realized that\n                 the lady singing the song, was the\n                 one who killed Andy.\n\n                              MR. BLUE\n                 You didn't know Vicki Lawrence\n                 killed the guy?\n\n                              NICE GUY EDDIE\n                 I thought the cheatin wife shot\n                 Andy.\n\n                              MR. BLONDE\n                 They say it in the song.\n\n                              NICE GUY EDDIE\n                 I know, I heard it.  I musta zoned\n                 out whenever that part came on\n                 before.  I thought when she said\n                 that little sister stuff, she was\n                 talkin about her sister- in-law,\n                 the cheatin wife.\n\n                              JOE\n                 No, she did it.  She killed the\n                 cheatin wife, too.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 You know the part in \"Gypsies,\n                 Tramps and Theives,\" when she says\n                 \"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew\n                 what he'd done?\"  I could never\n                 figure out what he did.\n\n       The table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table.\n       She has the check, and a pot of coffee.\n\n                              WAITRESS\n                 Can I get anybody more\n                 coffee.\n\n                              JOE\n                 No, we're gonna be hittin it.\n                 I'll take care of the check.\n\n       She hands the bill to him.\n\n                              WAITRESS\n                 Here ya go.  Please pay at the\n                 register, if you wouldn't mind.\n\n                              JOE\n                 Sure thing.\n\n                              WAITRESS\n                 You guys have a wonderful day.\n\n       They all mutter equivalents.

WHITE\n                 I don't believe in it.\n\n                              NICE GUY EDDIE\n                 You don't believe in tipping?\n\n                              MR.

She don't\n                 make enough money, she can quit.\n\n       Everybody laughs.\n\n                              NICE GUY EDDIE\n                 I don't even know a Jew who'd have\n                 the balls to say that.  So let's\n                 get this straight. You never ever\n                 tip?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 I don't tip because society says I\n                 gotta.  I tip when somebody\n                 deserves a tip.  When somebody\n                 really puts forth an effort, they\n                 deserve a little something extra.\n                 But this tipping automatically,\n                 that shit's for the birds.  As far\n                 as I'm concerned, they're just\n                 doin their job.\n\n                              MR. BLUE\n                 Our girl was nice.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Our girl was okay.  She didn't do\n                 anything special.\n\n                              MR. BLONDE\n                 What's something special, take ya\n                 in the kitchen and suck your dick?\n\n       They all laugh.\n\n                              NICE GUY EDDIE\n                 I'd go over twelve percent for\n                 that.\n\n                              MR.

When I order coffee,  I\n                 want it filled six times.\n\n                              MR. BLONDE\n                 What if she's too busy?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 The words \"too busy\" shouldn't be\n                 in a waitress's vocabulary.\n\n                              NICE GUY EDDIE\n                 Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last\n                 thing you need is another cup of\n                 coffee.\n\n       They all laugh.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 These ladies aren't starvin to\n                 death.  They make minimum wage.\n                 When I worked for minimum wage, I\n                 wasn't lucky enough to have a job\n                 that society deemed tipworthy.\n\n                              NICE GUY EDDIE\n                 Ahh, now we're getting down to it.\n                 It's not just that he's a cheap\n                 bastard--\n\n                              MR.

But no, society\n                 says tip these guys over here, but\n                 not those guys over there.  That's\n                 bullshit.\n\n                              MR.

BROWN\n                 These people are taxed on the tips\n                 they make.  When you stiff 'em,\n                 you cost them money.\n\n                              MR.

It's\n                 the one jab basically any woman\n                 can get, and make a living on.\n                 The reason is because of tips.\n\n                              MR.

But that ain't\n                 my fault.  it would appear that\n                 waitresses are just one of the\n                 many groups the government fucks\n                 in the ass on a regular basis.\n                 You show me a paper says the\n                 government shouldn't do that, I'll\n                 sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll\n                 vote for it.  But what I won't do\n                 is play ball.  And this non-\n                 college bullshit you're telling\n                 me, I got two words for that:\n                 \"Learn to fuckin type.\"  Cause if\n                 you're expecting me to help out\n                 with the rent, you're in for a big\n                 fuckin surprise.\n\n                              MR.

ORANGE\n                 Larry, I'm so scared, would you\n                 please hold me.\n\n       Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.\n       Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                         (whispering)\n                 Go ahead and be scared, you've\n                 been brave enough for one day.  I\n                 want you to just relax now.\n                 You're not gonna die, you're gonna\n                 be fine.  When Joe gets here,\n                 he'll make ya a hundred percent\n                 again.\n\n       Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He's\n       still holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his\n       friend.\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 Look, I don't wanna be a fly in\n                 the ointment, but if help doesn't\n                 come soon, I gotta see a doctor.\n                 I don't give a fuck about jail, I\n                 just don't wanna die.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 You're not gonna fucking die, all\n                 right?\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 I wasn't born yesterday.  I'm\n                 hurt, and I'm hurt bad.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 It's not good...\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 Hey, bless your heart for what\n                 you're trying to do.  I was\n                 panicking for a moment, but I've\n                 got my senses back now.  The\n                 situation is, I'm shot in the\n                 belly.  And without medical\n                 attention, I'm gonna die.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 I can' take you to a hospital.\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 Fuck jail!  I don't give a shit\n                 about jail.  But I can't die.  You\n                 don't have to take me in.  Just\n                 drive me up to the front, drop me\n                 on the sidewalk.  I'll take care\n                 of myself.  I won't tell them\n                 anything.  I swear to fucking god,\n                 I won't tell 'em anything.  Look\n                 in my eyes, look right in my eyes.\n                         (Mr. White does)\n                 I-won't-tell-them-anything.\n                 You'll be safe.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Lie back down, and try to--\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 I'm going to die!   I need a\n                 doctor!  I'm begging you,\n                 take me to a doctor.\n       \n       Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from\n       his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 Take me to a doctor, take me to a\n                 doctor, please.\n\n       Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.\n       Pink steps inside.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Was that a fucking set-up or what?\n\n       Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.\n\n       Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Gun shot.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Oh that's just fucking great!\n                 Where's Brown?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Dead.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Goddamn, goddamn!  How did he die?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 How the fuck do you think?  The\n                 cops shot him.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Oh this is bad, this is so bad.\n                         (referring to Mr.\n                          Orange)\n                 Is it bad?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 As opposed to good?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 This is so fucked up.  Somebody\n                 fucked us big time.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 You really think we were set up?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 You even doubt it?  I don't think\n                 we got set up, I know we got set\n                 up!  I mean really, seriously,\n                 where did all those cops come\n                 from, huh?  One minute they're not\n                 there, the next minute\n                 they're there.  I didn't hear any\n                 sirens.  The alarm went off, okay.\n                 Okay, when an alarm goes off, you\n                 got an average of four minutes\n                 response time.  Unless a patrol\n                 car is cruising that street, at\n                 that particular moment, you got\n                 four minutes before they can\n                 realistically respond.  In one\n                 minute there were seventeen blue\n                 boys out there.  All loaded for\n                 bear, all knowing exactly what the\n                 fuck they were doing, and they\n                 were all just there!  Remember\n                 that second wave that showed up in\n                 the cars? Those were the ones\n                 responding to the alarm.  but\n                 those other motherfuckers were\n                 already there, they were waiting\n                 for us.\n                         (pause)\n                 You haven't thought about this?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 I haven't had a chance to think.\n                 First I was just trying to get the\n                 fuck outta there.  And after we\n                 got away, I've just been dealin\n                 with him.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Well, you better start thinking\n                 about it.  Cause I, sure as fuck,\n                 am thinking about it.  In fact,\n                 that's all I'm thinking about.  I\n                 came this close to just driving\n                 off.  Whoever set us up, knows\n                 about this place.  There could've\n                 been cops sitting here waiting for\n                 me.  For all we know, there's\n                 cops, driving fast, on their way\n                 here now.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Let's go in the other room...\n\n       The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We\n       move past it, and see down a hall.\n\n5      INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY\n\n       At the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door\n       is partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is\n       obscured, but Mr. White is in view.\n\n                              MR. PINK (OS)\n                 What the fuck am I doing here?  I\n                 felt funny about this job right\n                 off.  As soon as I felt it I\n                 should said \"No thank you\", and\n                 walked.  But I never fucking\n                 listen.  Every time I ever got\n                 burned buying weed, I always knew\n                 the guy wasn't right.  I just felt\n                 it.  But I wanted to believe him.\n                 If he's not lyin to me, and it\n                 really is Thai stick, then whoa\n                 baby.  But it's never Thai stick.\n                 and I always said if I felt that\n                 way about a job, I'd walk.  And I\n                 did, and I didn't, because of\n                 fuckin money!\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 What's done is done, I need you\n                 cool.  Are you cool?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 I'm cool.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Splash some water on your face.\n                 Take a breather.\n\n       We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on\n       his face.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 I'm gonna get me my smokes.\n\n       Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and\n       OUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards\n       us, bent over the sink.  Then he grabs a towels, and dries\n       his face.  Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of\n       Chesterfields in his hand.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Want a smoke?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Why not?\n\n       The two men light up.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Okay, let's go through what\n                 happened.  We're in the place,\n                 everything's going fine.  Then the\n                 alarm gets tripped.  I turn around\n                 and all these cops are outside.\n                 You're right, it was like, bam!  I\n                 blink my eyes are they're there.\n                 Everybody starts going apeshit.\n                 Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all\n                 the--\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 --That's not correct.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 What's wrong with it?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 The cops didn't show up after the\n                 alarm went off.  They didn't show\n                 till after Mr. Blonde started\n                 shooting everyone.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 As soon as I heard the alarm, I\n                 saw the cops.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 I'm telling ya, it wasn't that\n                 soon.  They didn't let their\n                 presence be known until after Mr.\n                 Blonde went off.  I'm not sayin\n                 they weren't there, I'm sayin they\n                 were there.  But they didn't move\n                 in till Mr. Blonde became a\n                 madman.  That's how I know we were\n                 set up.  You can see that,\n                 can't you, Mr. White?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Look, enough of this \"Mr White\"\n                 shit--\n\n                              MR.

I sure as hell\n                 ain't gonna tell ya\n                 mine.\n\n                              MR.

If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he\n       just knocks them down.  We DOLLY at the same speed, right\n       along side of him.\n\n       FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.

The\n       man and woman CRASH to the ground.\n\n       Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car\n       that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over\n       him.\n\n\n7      INT.

PINK\n                 Could you believe Mr. Blonde?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 That was one of the most insane\n                 fucking things I've ever seen.\n                 Why the fuck would Joe hire\n                 somebody like that?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 I don't wanna kill anybody.  But\n                 if I gotta get out that door, and\n                 you're standing in my way, one way\n                 of the other, you're gettin outta\n                 my way.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 That's the way I look at it.  A\n                 choice between doin ten years, and\n                 takin out some stupid\n                 motherfucker, ain't no choice at\n                 all.  But I ain't no madman\n                 either.  What the fuck was Joe\n                 thinkin?  You can't work with a\n                 guy like that.  That mother-\n                 fucker's unstable.  What do you\n                 think?  Do you think he panicked,\n                 or ya think he's just trigger-\n                 happy?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 I think he's a sick fuckin maniac!\n                 We're awful goddamn lucky he\n                 didn't tag us, when\n                 he shot up the place.  I came this\n                 fucking close--\n                         (hold up two fingers\n                          and makes a tiny\n                          space between them)\n                 --to taking his ass out myself.\n                 Everybody panics.  When things get\n                 tense, everybody panics.\n                 Everybody.  I don't care what your\n                 name is, you can't help it.  It's\n                 human nature.  But ya panic on the\n                 inside.\n                 Ya panic in your head.  Ya give\n                 yourself a couple a seconds of\n                 panic, then you get a grip and\n                 deal with the situation.  What you\n                 don't do, is shoot up the place\n                 and kill everybody.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 What you're supposed to do is act\n                 like a fuckin professional.  A\n                 psychopath is not a professional.\n                 You can't work with a psychopath,\n                 'cause ya don't know what those\n                 sick assholes are gonna do next.\n                 I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do\n                 you think that black girl was?\n                 Twenty, maybe twenty-one?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Did ya see what happened to\n                 anybody else?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the\n                 car and Mr. Brown floored it.\n                 After that, I don't know what went\n                 down.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 At that point it became every man\n                 for himself.  As far as Mr. Blonde\n                 or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't\n                 got the foggiest.  Once\n                 I got out, I never looked back.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 What do you think?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 What do I think?  I think the cops\n                 caught them, or killed 'em.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Not even a chance they punched\n                 through?  You found a hole.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Yeah, and that was a fucking\n                 miracle.  But if they did get\n                 away, where the fuck are they?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 You don't think it's possible, one\n                 of them got ahold of the diamonds\n                 and pulled a--\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Nope.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 How can you be so sure?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 I got the diamonds.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Where?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 I got 'em, all right?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Where?  Are they out in the car?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 No, they're not in the car.  No, I\n                 don't have them on me.  Ya wanna\n                 go with me and get 'em?  Yes, we\n                 can go right now.  But first\n                 listen to what I'm telling you.\n                 We were fuckin set up!  Somebody\n                 is in league with the cops.  We\n                 got a Judas in our midst.  And I'm\n                 thinkin we should have our fuckin\n                 heads examined for waiting around\n                 here.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 That was the plan, we meet here.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Then where is everybody?  I say\n                 the plan became null and void once\n                 we found out we got a rat in the\n                 house.  We ain't got the slightest\n                 fuckin idea what happened to Mr.\n                 Blonde or Mr. Blue.  They could\n                 both be dead\n                 or arrested.  They could be\n                 sweatin 'em, down at the station\n                 house right now.  Yeah they don't\n                 know the names, but they can sing\n                 about this place.\n                 I mean, that could be happening\n                 right now.  As we speak, the cops\n                 could be in their cars, drivin\n                 here this minute.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 What?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Two jobs back, it was a four man\n                 job, we discovered one of the team\n                 was an undercover cop.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 No shit?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Thank god, we discovered in time.\n                 We hadda forget the whole fuckin\n                 thing.  Just walked away from it.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 So who's the rat this time?  Mr.\n                 Blue?  Mr. Blonde?  Joe?  It's\n                 Joe's show, he set this whole\n                 thing up.  Maybe he set it up to\n                 set it up.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 I don't buy it.  Me and Joe go\n                 back a long time.  I can tell ya\n                 straight up, Joe definitely didn't\n                 have anything to do with this\n                 bullshit.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Oh, you and Joe go back a long\n                 time.  I known Joe since I was a\n                 kid.  But me saying Joe definitely\n                 couldn't have done it is\n                 ridiculous.  I can say I\n                 definitely didn't do it, cause I\n                 know what I did or didn't do.  But\n                 I can't definitely say that about\n                 anybody else, 'cause I don't\n                 definitely know.  For all I know,\n                 you're the rat.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 For all I know, you're the rat.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Now you're using your head. For\n                 all we know, he's the rat.\n\n       Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White's\n       expression changes.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Jesus Christ!\n\n\n11     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n       They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious.  The\n       CAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him\n       first.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Is he dead?\n\n       Mr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse\n       on Mr. Orange's neck.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 So, is he dead or what?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 He ain't dead.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 So what is it?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 I think he's just passed out.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 He scared the fuckin shit outta\n                 me.  I thought he was dead fer\n                 sure.\n\n       Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 He will be dead fer sure, if we\n                 don't get him to a hospital.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 We can't take him to a hospital.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Without medical attention, this\n                 man won't live through the night.\n                 That bullet in his belly is my\n                 fault.  Now while that might not\n                 mean jack shit to you, it means a\n                 helluva lot to me.  And I'm not\n                 gonna just sit around and watch\n                 him die.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Well, first things first, staying\n                 here's goofy.  We gotta book up.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 So what do you suggest, we go to a\n                 hotel?  We got a guy who's shot in\n                 the belly, he can't walk, he\n                 bleeds like a stuck pig, and when\n                 he's awake, he screams in pain.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 You gotta idea, spit it out.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Joe could help him.  If we can get\n                 in touch with Joe, Joe could get\n                 him to a doctor, Joe could get a\n                 doctor to come and see him.\n\n       During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a \n       C.U. of Mr. White.\n\n                              MR. PINK (OS)\n                 Assuming we can trust Joe, how we\n                 gonna get in touch with him?  He's\n                 supposed to be here, but he ain't,\n                 which is making me nervous about\n                 being here.  Even if Joe is\n                 on the up and up, he's probably\n                 not gonna be that happy with us.\n                 Joe planned a robbery, but he's\n                 got a blood bath on his hands now.\n                 Dead cops, dead robbers, dead\n                 civilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend\n                 to doubt he's gonna have a lot of\n                 sympathy for our plight.  If I was\n                 him, I'd try and put as much\n                 distance between me and this mess\n                 an humanly possible.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Before you got here, Mr. Orange\n                 was askin me to take him to a\n                 hospital.  Now I don't like\n                 turning him over to the cops, but\n                 if we don't, he's dead.  He begged\n                 me to do it.  I told him to hold\n                 off till Joe got here.\n\n                              MR. PINK (OS)\n                 Well Joe ain't gettin here.  We're\n                 on our own.  Now, I don't know a\n                 goddamn body who can help him, so\n                 if you know somebody, call 'em.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 I don't know anybody.\n\n                              MR. PINK (OS)\n                 Well, I guess we drop him off at\n                 the hospital.  Since he don't know\n                 nothin about us, I say it's his\n                 decision.\n\n\n       MR. WHITE'S POV:\n\n       C.U. OF MR. PINK.\n\n                              MR. WHITE (OS)\n                 Well, he knows a little about me.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 You didn't tell him your name, did\n                 ya?\n\n                              MR. WHITE (OS)\n                 I told him my first name, and\n                 where I'm from.\n\n       There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,\n       then he SCREAMS:\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Why!\n\n                              MR. WHITE (OS)\n                 I told him where I was from a few\n                 days ago.  It was just a casual\n                 conversation.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 And what was tellin him your name\n                 when you weren't supposed to?\n\n                              MR. WHITE (OS)\n                 He asked.\n\n       Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.\n\n                              MR. WHITE (OS)\n                 We had just gotten away from the\n                 cops.  He just got shot.  It was\n                 my fuckin fault he got shot.  He's\n                 a fuckin bloody mess - he's\n                 screaming.  I swear to god, I\n                 thought we was gonna die right\n                 then and there.  I'm tryin to\n                 comfort him, telling him not to\n                 worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm\n                 gonna take care of him.  And he\n                 asked me what my name was.  I\n                 mean, the man was dyin in my arms.\n                 What the fuck was I supposed to\n                 tell him, \"Sorry, I can't give out\n                 that information, it's against the\n                 rules.  I don't trust you\n                 enough.\"?  Maybe I shoulda, but I\n                 couldn't.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Oh, I don't doubt is was quite\n                 beautiful--\n\n                              MR.

PINK\n                 One question: Do they have a sheet\n                 on you, where you told him you're\n                 from?\n\n                              MR.

I mean, I\n                 was worried about mug shot\n                 possibilities already.

That's it right,\n                 you didn't tell him anything else\n                 that could narrow down the\n                 selection?\n\n                              MR.

They go at each other like a couple of\n       alley cats.\n\n       As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:\n\n                               MR. WHITE\n\n                 You little motherfucker!\n\n       Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Ya wanna fuck with me?!

I didn't create\n                 this situation,  I'm just dealin\n                 with it.  You're acting like a\n                 first-year fuckin thief.  I'm\n                 actin like a professional.  They\n                 get him, they can get you, they\n                 get you, they get closer to me,\n                 and that can't happen.  And you,\n                 you motherfucker, are looking at\n                 me like it's my fault.  I didn't\n                 tell him my name.  I didn't tell\n                 him where I was from.  I didn't\n                 tell him what I knew better than\n                 to tell him.  Fuck, fifteen\n                 minutes ago, you almost told me\n                 your name.  You, buddy, are stuck\n                 in a situation you created.  So if\n                 you wanna throw bad looks\n                 somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.\n\n       Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 So if you wanna shoot somebody,\n                 put that gun in your mouth and\n                 shoot yourself.\n\n       Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:\n\n                              VOICE (OS)\n                 You kids don't play so rough.\n                 Somebody's gonna start crying.\n\n\n12     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE\n\n       The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.\n\n       Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke\n       and eating a hot dog.\n\n                              MR.

What\n                 happened?\n\n       Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter\n       and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the\n       place out.\n\n       He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he\n       just eats his hot dog and sips his coke.\n\n       This is making Pink and White nervous as hell.  But Mr.\n       Pink tries to talk through it.\n\n       We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.\n\n                              MR.

He's\n                 still alive, but won't be for\n                 long.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Enough!

BLONDE\n                 So, talk.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 We think we got a rat in the\n                 house.\n\n                              MR.

BLONDE\n                 Nobody's going anywhere.\n\n       Silence takes over the room.  Mr. Blonde stops moving.\n\n       After a few beats the silence is broken.\n\n                              MR.

We can\n                 give you a lot of legitimate jobs.\n                 Put you on the rotation at Long\n                 Beach as a dock worker.\n\n                              VIC\n                 I don't wanna lift crates.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 You don't hafta lift shit.

I call up Matthews, the\n                 foreman, tell him he's got a new\n                 guy.  You're on the schedule.

TRAIN STATION - NIGHT\n\n       Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous.\n       Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt.  Freddy\n       sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket,\n       looking at pieces of paper stapled together.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 What's this?\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 It's a scene.

To do this job you\n                 got to be a great actor.  You got\n                 to be naturalistic.  You got to be\n                 naturalistic as hell.  If you\n                 ain't a great actor you're a bad\n                 actor, and bad acting is bull shit\n                 in this job.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                         (referring to the\n                          papers)\n                 But what is this?\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 It's a amusing anecdote about a\n                 drug deal.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 What?\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 Something funny that happened to\n                 you while you were doing a job.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 I gotta memorize all this shit?\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 It's like a joke.  You remember\n                 what's important, and the rest you\n                 make your own.  The only way to\n                 make it your own is to keep sayin\n                 it, and sayin it, and sayin it,\n                 and sayin it, and sayin it.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 I can do that.\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 The things you gotta remember are\n                 the details.  It's the details\n                 that sell your story.  Now this\n                 story takes place in this men's\n                 room.  So you gotta know the\n                 details about this men's room.\n                 You gotta know they got a blower\n                 instead of a towel to dry your\n                 hands.  You gotta know the stalls\n                 ain't got no doors.  You gotta\n                 know whether they got liquid or\n                 powdered soap, whether they got\n                 hot water or not, 'cause if you do\n                 your job when you tell your story,\n                 everybody should believe it.  And\n                 if you tell your story to somebody\n                 who's actually taken a piss in\n                 this men's room, and you get one\n                 detail they remember right,\n                 they'll swear by you.\n\n\n29     INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n       Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,\n       rehearsing the anecdote.  He's reading it pretty good, but\n       he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a\n       while he stumbles over his words.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 ...this was during the Los Angeles\n                 marijuana drought of '86.  I still\n                 had a connection.  Which was\n                 insane, 'cause you couldn't get\n                 weed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway,\n                 I had a connection with this\n                 hippie chick up in Santa Cruz.\n                 All and my friends knew it.  And\n                 they'd give me a call and say,\n                 \"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you\n                 think you could buy me some too?\"\n                 They knew I smoked, so they'd ask\n                 me to buy a little for them when I\n                 was buyin.  But it got to be\n                 everytime I bought some weed, I\n                 was buyin for four or five\n                 different people.  Finally I said,\n                 \"Fuck this shit.\"  I'm makin this\n                 bitch rich.  She didn't have to do\n                 jack shit, she never even had to\n                 meet these people.  I was fuckin\n                 doin all the work.  So I got\n                 together with her and told her,\n                 \"Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm\n                 comin through for everybody, and\n                 nobody's comin through for me.\n                 So, either I'm gonna tell all my\n                 friends to find their own source,\n                 or you give me a bunch of weed,\n                 I'll sell it to them, give you the\n                 money, minus ten percent, and I\n                 get my pot for free.\"  So, I did\n                 if for awhile...\n\n       Freddy exits frame\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n\n30     EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n       Another empty frame, except obviously outside.  Freddy\n       enters frame from the same direction he exited in the\n       previous scene, finishing his sentence.  When we move to a\n       wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to\n       Holdaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of\n       his beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he\n       performs his story.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 ...but then that got to be a pain\n                 in the ass.  People called me on\n                 the phone all the fuckin time.  I\n                 couldn't rent a fuckin tape\n                 without six phone calls\n                 interrupting me.  \"Hey, Freddy,\n                 when's the next time you're gettin\n                 some?\"  \"Motherfucker, I'm tryin\n                 to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have\n                 some, I'll let you know.\"  And\n                 then these rinky-dink pot heads\n                 come by--there's my friends and\n                 everything, but still.  I got all\n                 my shit laid out in sixty dollar\n                 bags.  Well, they don't want sixty\n                 dollars worth.  They want ten\n                 dollars worth.  Breaking it up is\n                 a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I\n                 don't even know how much ten\n                 dollars worth is.  \"Well, fuck,\n                 man, I don't want that much\n                 around.  If I have that much\n                 around I'll smoke it.\"  \"Hey, if\n                 you guys can't control your\n                 smokin, that's not my problem.\n                 You motherfuckers been smokin for\n                 five years, be a adult about it.\"\n                 Finally I just told my connection,\n                 count me out.  But as it turns\n                 out, I'm the best guy she had, and\n                 she depended alot on my business.\n                 But I was still sick to death of\n                 it.  And she's trying to talk me\n                 into not quitin.\n                 Now this was a very weird\n                 situation, 'cause I don't know if\n                 you remember back in '86, there\n                 was a major fuckin drought.\n                 Nobody and anything.  People were\n                 livin on resin and smokin the wood\n                 in their pipes for months.  And\n                 this chick had a bunch, and was\n                 beggin me to sell it.  So I told\n                 her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot\n                 Man anymore.  But I would take a\n                 little bit and sell it to my\n                 close, close, close friends.  She\n                 agreed to that, and said we'd keep\n                 the same arrangement as before,\n                 ten percent and free pot for me,\n                 as long as I helped her out that\n                 weekend.  She had a brick of weed\n                 she was sellin, and she didn't\n                 want to go to the buy alone...\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n\n31     INT.

In\n                 one of daddy's clubs there was\n                 this black cocktail waitress named\n                 Elois.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Elois?\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Yeah, Elois. E and Lois.  We\n                 called her Lady E.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Where was she from, Compton?\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 No.  She was from Ladora Heights.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 The black Beverly Hills.  I knew\n                 this lady from Ladora Heights\n                 once.\n                         (in a stuck up black\n                          female voice)\n                 \"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's\n                 the black Beverly Hills.\"\n                              EDDIE\n                 It's not the black Beverly Hills,\n                 it's the black Palos Verdes.\n                 Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a\n                 man-eater-upper.  I bet every guy\n                 who's ever met her has jacked off\n                 to her at least once.  You know\n                 who she looked like?  Christie\n                 Love.  'Member that TV show \"Get\n                 Christie Love\"?  She was a black\n                 female cop.  She always used to\n                 say \"You're under arrest, sugar.\"\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 I was in the sixth grade when that\n                 show was on.  I totally dug it.\n                 What the fuck was the name of the\n                 chick who played Christie\n                 Love?\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Pam Grier.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier\n                 was the other one.  Pan Grier made\n                 the movies.  Christie Love was\n                 like a Pam Grier TV show, without\n                 Pam Grier.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 What the fuck was that chick's\n                 name?  Oh this is just great, I'm\n                 totally fuckin tortured now.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Well, whoever she was, Elois\n                 looked like her.  So one night I\n                 walk into the club, and no Elois.\n                 Now the bartender was a wetback,\n                 he was a friend of mine, his name\n                 was Carlos.\n                 So I asked him \"Hey, Carlos,\n                 where's Lady E tonight?\"  Well\n                 apparently Lady E was married to\n                 this real piece of dog shit.  I\n                 mean a real animal.  And\n                 apparently he would so things to\n                 her.\n\n                              FREDDY\n\n                 Do things?  What would he do?  You\n                 mean like beat her up?\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Nobody knows for sure what he did.\n                 We just know he did something.\n                 Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.\n                 And waits for the next time this\n                 bag of shit gets drunk.  So one\n                 night the guy gets drunk and\n                 passes out on the couch.  So while\n                 the guy's\n                 inebriated, she strips him naked.\n                 Then she takes some crazy glue and\n                 glues his dick to his belly.\n\n       The car reacts to how horrible that would be.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 I'm dead fuckin serious.  She put\n                 some on his dick and some on his\n                 belly, then stuck 'em together.\n                 The paramedics had to come and cut\n                 it loose.\n\n       The car reacts badly.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Jesus Christ!\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 You can do some crazy things with\n                 it.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 I don't know what he did to her,\n                 but she got even.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Was he all pissed off?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 How would you feel if you had to\n                 do a handstand every time you took\n                 a piss.\n\n       The car laughs.\n\n\n42     EXT.

With the exception of\n                 Eddie and myself, who you already\n                 know, you'll be using aliases.\n                 Under no circumstances are you to\n                 tell one another your real name or\n                 anything else about yourself.\n                 That includes where you're from,\n                 your wife's name, where you\n                 might've done time, about a bank\n                 in St. Petersburg you might've\n                 robbed.  You guys don't say shit\n                 about who you are, where you been\n                 or what you've done.  Only thing\n                 you guys can talk about is what\n                 you're going to do.  This way the\n                 only ones who know who the members\n                 of the team are are Eddie and\n                 myself.  And that's the way I like\n                 it.  Because in the unlikely event\n                 of one of you getting apprehended\n                 by the cops, not that I expect\n                 that to happen - it most\n                 definitely should not happen - it\n                 hasn't happened, you don't have\n                 anything to deal with.  You don't\n                 know any names.  You know my name,\n                 you know Eddie's name.  That I\n                 don't care about.  You gotta prove\n                 it.  I ain't worried.  Besides,\n                 this way you gotta trust me.  I\n                 like that.  I set this up and\n                 picked the men I wanted for it.\n                 None of you came to me, I\n                 approached all of you.  I know\n                 you.  I know your work, I know\n                 your reputation.  I know you as\n                 men.

Okay, let me\n                 introduce everybody to everybody.\n                 But once again, at the risk of\n                 being redundant, if I even think I\n                 hear somebody telling or referring\n                 to somebody by their Christian\n                 name...\n                         (Joe searches for the\n                          right words)\n                 ...you won't want to be you.\n                 Okay, quickly.\n                         (pointing at the men\n                          as he gives them a\n                          name)\n                 Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,\n                 Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr.\n                 Pink.\n\n                              MR.

So tell me,\n                 Mr. White, if you think \"Mr. Pink\"\n                 is no big deal, you wanna trade?\n\n                              JOE\n                 Nobody's trading with anybody!\n                 Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin\n                 city counsel meeting!

So\n                 what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Jesus Christ, Joe.  Fuckin forget\n                 it.  This is beneath me.

BLEACHERS - DAY\n\n       Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty\n       little league baseball field.\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 Okay, we're gonna station men\n                 across the street from Karina's\n                 Fine Jewelry.  But their orders\n                 will be not to move in unless the\n                 robbery gets out of control.  You\n                 gotta make sure they don't have to\n                 move in.  You're inside to make\n                 sure that everything goes\n                 according to Hoyle.  We have men\n                 set up a block away from the\n                 warehouse rendezvous.  They got\n                 complete visibility of the\n                 exterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot\n                 shows up, we'll see it.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 What's your visibility of the\n                 interior?\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 We can't see shit on the inside.\n                 And we can't risk gettin any\n                 closer for fear they'll spot us.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 This is bullshit, Jim.  I get all\n                 the fuckin danger of having you\n                 guys in my back pocket but none of\n                 the safety.\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 What's the matter, Newendyke?  Job\n                 too tough for ya?  No one lied to\n                 you.  You always knew we'd hang\n                 back until Joe Cabot showed up.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 Oh this is great.  You ain't\n                 giving me no fuckin protection\n                 whatsoever.  But you are giving me\n                 an attitude.\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 Since when does an undercover cop\n                 have protection?  Freddy, you came\n                 into this thing with your eyes\n                 wide open, so don't start screamin\n                 blind man now.  I understand\n                 you're nervous.  I wish the\n                 warehouse had more visible\n                 windows, but it doesn't.  We have\n                 to make do with the cards we're\n                 dealt.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.\n                 I'm just remarking on how shitty\n                 the situation is!\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 I don't mean to be harsh with ya,\n                 but I've found tough love works\n                 best in these situations.  We have\n                 to get Joe Cabot in the company of\n                 the thieves and in the same\n                 vicinity as the loot.\n                 We don't care about these other\n                 bastards.  We're willing to offer\n                 them good deals to testify against\n                 Cabot.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 Isn't this risk unorthodox?\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 What?\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 Letting them go ahead with the\n                 robbery?\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 The whole idea behind this\n                 operation is to catch Joe Cabot\n                 red-handed.  We bust these hired\n                 hands, we ain't accomplished shit.\n                 Letting them go through with the\n                 heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs\n                 are very clean.  We got people\n                 surrounding the perimeter.  We got\n                 a guy and a gal on the inside\n                 posing as a couple shopping for\n                 rings.  We could replace the\n                 employees with cops, but we'd run\n                 the risk of tipping 'em off.\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 That's out.  They know the faces\n                 of who works what shift.\n\n                              HOLDAWAY\n                 These guys are professionals.\n                 We're professionals.  It's a risk,\n                 but I think it's a calculated\n                 risk.\n\n\n45     EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY\n\n       We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.\n\n       CUSTOMERS coming and going.  STORE CLERKS waiting on\n       customers through the windows.\n\n       While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.\n       White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.\n\n                              MR.

I don't let anybody come in\n                 or go out.\n\n                              MR. WHITE (VO)\n                 Mr. Brown?\n\n                              FREDDY (VO)\n                 Mr. Brown stays in the car.  He's\n                 parked across the street till I\n                 give him the signal, then he pulls\n                 up in front of the store.\n\n                              MR. WHITE (VO)\n                 Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?\n\n                              FREDDY (VO)\n                 Crowd control.  They handle\n                 customers and employees in the\n                 display area.\n\n\n46     INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY\n\n       Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street\n       from the jewelry store, staking it out.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Myself and Mr. Pink?\n\n                              FREDDY\n                 You two take the manager in the\n                 back and make him give you the\n                 diamonds.  We're there for those\n                 stones, period.  Since no display\n                 cases are being fucked with, no\n                 alarms should go off.  We're out\n                 of there in two minutes, not one\n                 second longer.  What if the\n                 manager won't give up the\n                 diamonds?\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 When you're dealing with a store\n                 like this, they're insured up the\n                 ass.  They're not supposed to give\n                 you and resistance\n                 whatsoever.  If you get a customer\n                 or an employee who thinks he's\n                 Charles Bronson, take the butt of\n                 your gun and smash their nose in.\n                 Drops 'em right to the floor.\n                 Everyone jumps, he falls down,\n                 screaming, blood squirts out his\n                 nose.  Freaks everybody out.\n                 Nobody says fuckin shit after\n                 that.  You might get some bitch\n                 talk shit to ya.  But give her a\n                 look, like you're gonna smash her\n                 in the face next.  Watch her shut\n                 the fuck up.  Now if it's a\n                 manager, that's a different story.\n                 The managers know better than to\n                 fuck around.  So if one's givin\n                 you static, he probably thinks\n                 he's a real cowboy.  So what you\n                 gotta do is break that son-of-a-\n                 bitch in two.  If you wanna know\n                 something and he won't tell you,\n                 cut off one of his fingers.  The\n                 little one.  Then you tell 'im his\n                 thumb's next.  After that he'll\n                 tell ya if he wears ladies\n                 underwear.  I'm hungry, let's get\n                 a taco.\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n\n47     EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n       It's the moment of the robbery.

He RUNS to the\n       end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.\n\n       FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the\n       patrol car.\n\n       Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.\n       White's ambush in shock.\n\n       Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.\n\n                              MR. BROWN\n                 Mr. Orange?  You're Mr. Orange,\n                 aren't you?\n\n       By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown\n       is dead.\n\n       Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Is he dead?\n\n       Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.\n\n                              MR.

Snap out of it!\n\n       Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as\n       he RUNS.\n\n       They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.\n\n       A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.\n\n       Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car.  He points\n       his jun at her.\n\n                              MR.

WHITE\n                 The situation as hand isn't that\n                 fuckin satchel.  You and Joe have\n                 a responsibility to your men.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Hey, it's the best I could do.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 The man is fucking dying.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll\n                 take care of him.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 He needs a doctor, not a fuckin\n                 nurse.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Ask me how many doctors I called.\n                 You wanna embarrass yourself, ask\n                 me how many doctors I called.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Obviously not enough.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Fuck you! You gotta little black\n                 book, then whip is out.  If not,\n                 listen how it is.  I called three\n                 doctors and couldn't get through\n                 to shit.  Now, time being a\n                 factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet\n                 broad, helluva broad, and a\n                 registered nurse.  Told her a\n                 bullshit story, upside:  she said\n                 bring him to her apartment.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 If he dies I'm holding you\n                 personally responsible.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Fuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you\n                 wanna play that way.  I am\n                 personally leaving myself\n                 vulnerable with this Bonnie\n                 situation.  I don't think she'll\n                 call the cops, but I don't know\n                 for sure.  But me being too nice-\n                 a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk\n                 it.  But no fuckin more.\n                         (he grabs his\n                          portable phone)\n                 I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin\n                 her to forget it.  You take care\n                 of your friend, you know so much\n                 about it.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 Goddamnit, will you guys grow up!\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 I don't need to grow up, my\n                 friend.  I am a grown up.  I'm\n                 being responsible, I'm taking care\n                 of business.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 Cut the shit!  I don't think you\n                 called anybody except some cooze\n                 you once fucked, who happens to\n                 wear orthopedic shoes.  And I\n                 don't think that's good enough\n                 care for a gut-shot man.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Yeah, well I don't give a flying\n                 fuck what you think!\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                         (to Mr. White)\n                 Look, he's not sayin this bitch is\n                 gonna operate on him.  She's gonna\n                 give him better attention than we\n                 can until we can get a doctor.\n                 Nobody's forgotten about doctors.\n                 Joe'll get one in a snap.  This is\n                 something we're doing in the\n                 meantime.  I think both of you are\n                 actin like a couple of assholes.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Yeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I\n                 leave myself wide open, and I'm an\n                 asshole.\n\n\n50     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n       MEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and\n       Mr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks.\n\n       We see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,\n       shot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a\n       bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding\n       his wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the\n       shot.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 What the fuck happened here?\n\n       Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                         (to Mr. Orange)\n                 What happened?\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                         (very weakly)\n                 Blonde went crazy.  He slashed the\n                 cop's face, cut off his ear and\n                 was gonna burn him alive.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                         (yelling)\n                 Who cares what he was gonna do to\n                 this fuckin pig?\n\n       Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and\n       the chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him\n       once more.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                         (to Mr. Orange)\n                 You were saying he went crazy?\n                 Something like that?  Worse or\n                 better?\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.\n                 He was gonna kill the cop and me.\n                 And when you guys walked through\n                 the door, he was gonna blow you to\n                 hell and make off with the\n                 diamonds.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                         (to Eddie)\n                 Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?\n                 That sick piece of shit was a\n                 stone cold psycho.\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                         (to Eddie)\n                 You could've asked the cop, if you\n                 didn't just kill him.  He talked\n                 about what he was going to do when\n                 he was slicing him up.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 I don't buy it.  It doesn't make\n                 sense.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                 It makes perfect fuckin sense to\n                 me.  Eddie, you didn't see how he\n                 acted during the job, we did.\n\n       Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.\n\n                              MR. PINK\n                 He's right about the ear, it's\n                 hacked off.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                         (to Mr. Orange)\n                 Let me say this out loud, just to\n                 get it straight in my mind.\n                 According to you, Mr. Blonde was\n                 gonna kill you.  Then when we came\n                 back, kill us, grab the diamonds,\n                 and scram.  That's your story?\n                 I'm correct about that, right?\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 Eddie, you can believe me or not\n                 believe me, but it's the truth.  I\n                 swear on my mother's eternal soul\n                 that's what happened.\n\n       The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.\n\n       There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange\n       has said.  Finally:\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 You're a fuckin liar.  Now why\n                 don't you drop the fuckin fairy\n                 tale and tell me what really\n                 happened?\n\n                              MR. WHITE (OS)\n                 He told you what really happened.\n                 You just can't deal with it.\n\n                              MR. ORANGE (OS)\n                 Okay, you're right, I'm lying.\n                 Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm\n                 not above pullin a fast one.  Get\n                 rid of Blonde, we share his split\n                 - no, scratch that, I shot him\n                 'cause I didn't like his hair\n                 style.  I didn't like his shoes\n                 either.  If it has just been his\n                 hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,\n                 let him live.  But hair and\n                 footwear together, he's a goner.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 The man you killed was just\n                 released from prison.  He got\n                 caught at a company warehouse full\n                 of hot items.  He could've walked\n                 away.  All he had to do was say my\n                 dad's name.  But instead he shut\n                 his mouth and did his time.  He\n                 did four years for us, and he did\n                 'em like a man.  And we were very\n                 grateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're\n                 tellin me this very good friend of\n                 mine, who did four years for my\n                 father, who in four years never\n                 made a deal, no matter what they\n                 dangled in front of him, you're\n                 telling me that now, that now this\n                 man is free, and we're making good\n                 on our commitment to him, he's\n                 just gonna decide, right out of\n                 the fuckin blue, to rip us off?\n\n       Silence.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me\n                 what really happened?\n\n                              VOICE (OS)\n                 Why?  It'll just be more bullshit.\n\n       Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing\n       in the warehouse doorway.  He walks into the room.\n\n                              JOE\n                         (pointing to Mr.\n                          Orange)\n                 This man set us up.\n\n       CAMERA does a 360 around the men.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know\n                 what's happening.\n\n                              JOE\n                 That's okay, Eddie, I do.\n\n                              MR.

But he seemed like a\n                 good kid, and I was impatient and\n                 greedy and all the things that\n                 fuck you up.\n\n                              MR.

I ignored it before,\n                 but not no more.\n\n       He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.\n\n       Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.\n\n       Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of\n       firearms.\n\n       Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.\n\n                              EDDIE\n                 Have you lost your fucking mind?\n                 Put your gun down!\n\n       Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.\n\n                              MR.

Repeat, if you kill that\n                 man, you die next!\n\n       We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.\n\n\n       MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY\n\n       Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.\n\n       Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange.  Not taking his eyes off\n       him.\n\n       Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to\n       start firing any minute.\n\n       Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.\n       White.\n\n       Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.\n\n       Nobody says nothing.\n\n\n       FOUR SHOT\n\n       of guys ready for violence.  Mr. Pink in the B.G.\n\n                              MR.

Joe brings his\n       hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.\n\n       Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the\n       chest.\n\n       Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.\n\n       The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.\n\n       Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.\n\n       Joe's dead.\n\n       Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest\n       heaving.  The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.\n\n       Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,\n       not moving.\n\n       Mr. Pink is standing motionless.  Finally he grabs the\n       satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.\n\n       We hear outside a CAR START.  Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN\n       yells out:\n\n                              POLICE FORCE (OS)\n                 Freeze! Get out of the car and lie\n                 face down on the ground!\n\n                              MR. PINK (OS)\n                 Don't shoot!\n\n       We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,\n       MEN RUNNING to the warehouse.\n\n       While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand\n       but FALLS DOWN.  He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange\n       lies.\n\n       He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and\n       stroking his brow.\n\n                              MR. WHITE\n                         (with much effort)\n                 Sorry, kid.  Looks like we're\n                 gonna do a little time.\n\n       Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an\n       effort:\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 I'm a cop.\n\n       Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's\n       brow.\n\n                              MR. ORANGE\n                 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.\n\n       Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.\n       Orange's eyes.\n\n       The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.\n\n       The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside.  We don't see\n       anything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.\n\n                              POLICE FORCE (OS)\n                 Freeze, motherfucker!  Drop your\n                 fucking gun!\n       \n       Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.\n\n       BANG\n\n       We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.\n\n       Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.\n\n\n\n\n\nReservoir Dogs\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Quentin Tarantino\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:47.469241"}
