He's just about finished, when he notices the CUT-\r\n          OUT of his sister's engagement photo.\r\n                         \r\n          He tries placing it in the open bag, but it is immediately\r\n          clear that the photo is two inches to long. He tries putting\r\n          it on an angle, but that doesn't help.\r\n                         \r\n                          RYAN\r\n           Huh.\r\n                         \r\n          Ryan centers the cut-out again and tries to ZIP around it,\r\n          but he can't get the zipper around the HEADS of the photo.\r\n          For a moment, it almost seems like he's assaulting their tiny\r\n          head with the zipper handle. Doesn't help.\r\n                         \r\n          A moment of silent frustration.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n           35.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         THE ROLL-AWAY\r\n                         \r\n          Being pulled through an airport. The little heads of Ryan's\r\n          sister and her fiance are poking out the top of the bag. The\r\n          two zippers have been closed on either side of them as though\r\n          they were tiny passengers peeking out the sunroof.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

He's not thrilled by the public affection.

Recently, I've\r\n           been thinking that maybe I needed\r\n           to empty the bag before I knew what\r\n           to put back in.\r\n                         \r\n          And now they kiss. It's notably different from their previous\r\n          kisses. Now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people\r\n          kiss in the first place.\r\n                         \r\n          Then, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. The\r\n          motor has stopped. Ryan and Alex look back to find the\r\n          software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk.\r\n                         \r\n                          SOFTWARE DUDE\r\n           Hey...
