Gorgeous George raises his\n     eyebrows.\n\n20   INT. HORSE BOX, PIKEY CAMP -- DAY\n\n     The two fighters start pacing. It looks a bit ridiculous,\n     Micky is dwarfed by comparison. Gorgeous George takes a\n     swipe: it was an .impressive punch, but Micky is a quick littl\n     bastard and sidesteps. Micky does nothing to retaliate; his\n     hands are still by his,side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n20   CONTINUED:\n\n\n\n\n     Gorgeous George lunges out and grabs Micky by the throat and\n     groin, picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him\n     against the car door. All eyes are on Micky for a second or\n     two, then he rises and appears little bothered by this, he\n     gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again, hardly\n     even looking at the big man.\n\n                          GORGEOUS GEORGE\n\n              You want to stay down my friend, I\n              promise you, you want to stay down.\n     Micky ignores this and continues to pace, the big fella grabs\n     him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable\n     door. There is a terrible noise.\n\n\n\n\n                          GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D)\n\n              Now you fucking stay down boy or you\n              won't be coming up next time.\n     It appears as though this is going to get messy and any humour\n     that might have been around has now evaporated. Micky raises\n     his head there is still no damage to speak of. All of a\n     sudden he starts jumping up and down like he's warming up,\n     throwing a few shadow punches, taking off his shirt. This\n     reveals a heavily tattooed and scarred torso, and underneath\n     these embellishments is a physique that warrants some respect.\n\n                          GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D)\n\n              This is sick.

Gorgeous George moves in\n     for the coup de grace, Micky spins on his feet and catches\n     the big man under the jaw.\n\n     CUT TO BLACK\n\n     FADE IN: We see Gorgeous George lying on the floor with a\n     head the size of a water melon.

Vin looks uncomfortable. Another door is\n      opened and a man brings out Lincoln.

I am sure\n                you've heard one or two of those\n                stories. For example, did you hear\n                about the three black fellas that\n                did a very bad thing, however they\n                made some effort to redeem that very\n                bad thing, so the governor saw fit\n                not to kill em. He thought it would\n                be a more advantageous concept to\n                let them kill each other and let the\n                survivor live to tell the tale.\n                That way everybody wins, well, all\n                except the two that died of course.\n      We look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives\n      sitting provocatively. Tyrone rushes for one of the blades\n      grabs it and runs at Vin, Vin sidesteps and Tyrone keeps\n      running straight into the arms of Errol who raises his gun\n      at the last moment. Tyrone slides the blade into Errol 's\n      ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone. The bullet\n      passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat . Vin,\n      Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just\n      happened .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n111   CONTINUED:    (2)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   BAD BOY LINCOLN      ,\n\n                    Grab it.\n\n\n\n\n                                   SOL\n\n                    What?\n\n\n\n\n                                VINNY\n\n                    The gun you prick.\n      Sol goes for one, and Vin goes for the other.\n\n112   INT.

WAREHOUSE\n\n      Micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse.\n      He approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of\n      encouragement and counter shouts. He's wearing a pair of\n      semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt with grease marks\n      down the front. Turkish walks behind him, Micky still looks\n      bored. He climbs into the ring. Then from the same door as\n      the one through Micky came out walks a larger character with\n      a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a\n      frying pan: HORACE 'GOOD NIGHT1 ANDERSON.\n\n                            THE REFF\n\n                Alright lads no eye gouging no biting.\n                Do your worst. Back to your corners.\n\n\n\n      We drift again into Micky's pov, his world is becoming more\n      and more surreal. He can faintly hear Turkish whispering\n      words to him, but he's not really listening. A bell comes\n      from somewhere, and Micky instinctively walks to the center\n      of the ring. \"Good night\" is already there, they pace one\n      another for a second or two, Micky avoids a punch or two and\n      then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white,\n      Micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and BANG\n      it shakes \"good night\" to his core, all goes quiet. We go\n      to super slow motion: his knees buckle and \"good night\" is\n      in trouble. Micky maintains a frown as he watches his\n      opponent's knees threaten to betray him. The crowd tries to\n      digest what is happening. After a period of silence reality\n      dawns. Brick Top mouths the words in silence.\"Don1t go down\n      you fucker\". The crowd wants Micky to finish the job. But\n      common sense reins back the coup de grace. \"Good night\"\n      eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward,\n      after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious\n      onslaught.\n\n\n\n\n                            TURKISH\n\n                I don't like the look of this Tommy,\n                bring the van up to the back door.\n      This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few\n      seconds). We go in the mind of poor Micky. We break the\n      music just as it's starting to look dangerous... The bell\n      goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner. Turkish pulls him\n      back to his corner.\n\n                            TURKISH (CONT'D)\n\n               They are on ya. You got to hurt him\n               Micky. Otherwise we are\n               rumbled.... you hear me Micky? Do\n               -something, it looks like it' s rigged.\n      Micky goes out again his hands are low, BANG there is a flash\n      of white as Micky goes down in the dirt. Dust rises from\n      where he fell. He gets up quickly, his hands are still low,\n      BANG he goes down again, in no time he's up.\n\n\n\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n120   CONTINUED:    -\n\n      BANG: he hits the ground again and this time when he hits\n      the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s\n      made out of water. He falls through the water like he's\n      sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues\n      to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now Micky 1). When Micky\n      1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin\n      kidney punches from Good Night, he's winded and only semi-\n      conscious (this is Micky 2). Micky 1 makes the effort to\n      swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he\n      can't get through. Micky 2 takes more punishment in the\n      ring, as Micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the\n      underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces\n      Micky 1 down again. Micky 1 looks up again and sees how\n      much trouble Micky 2 ' s in the ring. Micky 1 is panicking\n      now, he's running out of oxygen and Micky 2's being beaten,\n      Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom\n      of his feet he looks up. and sees Micky 2 being smashed to\n      hell, his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through\n      the floor. And as the latter falls through, Micky 1 manages\n      to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate\n      the surface. The punch continues its trajectory and has the\n      power to fell a red blooded rhino.... it catches \"Good Night\"\n      on the jaw and it's good night for \"Good Night\" it's unlikely\n      that he'll awake in the next hour. Dear oh dear everybody\n      is in trouble.\n\n\n\n      Again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties.\n\n                               TURKISH (CONT'D)\n\n                   Tommy get the van.\n\n\n\n\n                               TOMMY\n\n                   I have it, it's waiting.\n      Turkish jumps into the ring and grabs Micky.\n\n                               TURKISH\n\n                   We are off Micky, hold tight, and\n                   move quickly. ,\n      Turkish pulls Micky away. It's not as hard as it might be\n      trying to get out, because the crowd seems to have found its\n      own disputes, chairs start to fly. Brick Top's boys are\n      frustrated in the mayhem. Brick Top calmly dials into his\n      mobile telephone. It rings.\n\n                                                                     1\n\n\n121   EXT.

Brick Top opens the door as\n      he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers\n      as FOUR MEN (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in\n      the place of his driver. They both have sawed-off shotguns\n      and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken.\n      The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the\n      dirt.\n\n                                                                       :\n\n\n122   INT.

I can see the\n                 stone.\n      Hands at the point of entry stops. Vinny hops over to the\n      stone and picks it up. Tony lets the dog stand but keeps a\n      grip oh the collar. The dog is relieved to be semi-liberated.\n      Hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare.\n\n                             HANDS\n\n                 Well let's see it.\n      Vinny holds it up. There's a sense of relief. He then throws\n      the stone, it cuts through the air. And the dog seeing\n      .another projectile runs to intercept it. There's a pause\n      while all now focus again on the dog. This is digested\n      literally and mentally. The dog recognizes all the attention\n      it's receiving. And goes through the motions of swallowing\n      it. Hands attempts an approach. The dog understandably\n      feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides\n      emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window\n      launches itself out of it.\n\n      FADE TO BLACK\n\n\n      FADE UP\n\n\n124   EXT.
