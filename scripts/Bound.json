Eyes closed, she lets out a long \"Ahh.\"\n\n               Violet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky returns to \n               the bed.\n\n               She holds the beer to Violet's lips and tilts the can, \n               watching Violet's throat as she drinks.\n\n               Violet's eyes open.\n\n<b>                                     VIOLET\n</b>                         ...
