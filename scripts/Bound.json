It \n               is a woman's closet.\n\n                                     CORKY (V.O.)\n                         You planned this whole thing, didn't \n                         you?\n\n                                     CAESAR (V.O.)\n                         Where's the fucking money?\n\n               We glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to \n               feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to \n               the racks of high heels.\n\n                                     VIOLET (V.O.)\n                         We make our own choices, we pay our \n                         own prices.\n\n                                     CAESAR (V.O.)\n                         All part of the business.\n\n                                     VIOLET (V.O.)\n                         All part of the business.\n\n                                     CORKY (V.O.)\n                         What choice?\n\n               We slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and \n               reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black \n               Dr. Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope.\n\n                                     VIOLET (V.O.)\n                         I want out.\n\n               We move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, \n               lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling \n               tightly around her wrists.\n\n               The crack at the bottom of the door lights her face.  She is \n               gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her \n               forehead.  Her name is CORKY.\n\n                                     VIOLET (V.O.)\n                         Like a part of me.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

She is a lesbian and wants people to know it.\n\n               As the doors begin to slide shut, a woman yells.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Wait!  Hold the elevator.\n\n               Corky pushes the \"open\" button.  A couple steps into the \n               elevator.  His name is CAESAR, a middle-aged Italian, wearing \n               an expensive suit and sunglasses.\n\n               She is VIOLET; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in \n               your mouth.\n\n               She hears it again, a guttural sound.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         Thanks again for this opportunity, \n                         Mr. Bianchinni.  Goodbye.\n\n               She hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall.\n\n               As she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against \n               the wall.\n\n               The man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally \n               it swells --\n\n                                                           DISSOLVING INTO:\n\n               INT.

Whenever something broke he \n                         would open it up, tinker with it and \n                         it would work.  His hands were magic.\n\n               She looks at Corky's hands cupped around the mug.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Yeah ...

I'm just here to get laid \n                         or drunk and hopefully both.\n\n               Corky gets off the stool.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         Thanks for the beer.\n\n               Looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back \n               tables.  Through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance \n               to Violet.\n\n               The woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket.\n\n               Smiling, Corky slides into the chair beside her.  There is \n               no one smoother.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         Hi.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Hello.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         You know ...  that outfit would look \n                         great on my bedroom floor.\n\n               The woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the shoulder.\n\n               She turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a woman \n               in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket.  She is more wide \n               than fat.\n\n                                     WOMAN COP\n                         Hey, Jesse.

A service \n               revolver is clipped to her belt.\n\n               She squints at Corky, her head nodding in recognition.\n\n                                     WOMAN COP\n                         Wait, I know you.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         I don't think so.\n\n                                     WOMAN COP\n                         I didn't know you were out.\n\n               Corky smiles at the woman in black.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         When you get tired of Cagney and \n                         Lacey, come find me.\n\n               She heads for the exit.\n\n               EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT \n\n               The neighborhood would be politely described as \"rough.\" \n               Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered \n               street.\n\n               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               It is a hole but it is home.\n\n               Corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a \n               beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons \n               from the radio.\n\n               We see the ceiling, a circle of light hovering over the small \n               desk lamp.  We move in on the spot, which slowly fills up \n               the screen until there is nothing but the white light.\n\n               Suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a \n               swath across the ceiling.\n\n               MATCH CUT TO:\n\n               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY  \n\n               Corky is painting the ceiling.  The folk ballad has become \n               an angry Riot Grrrl anthem.\n\n               She is working hard, the roller sucking back and forth.  \n               Sweat covers her face.\n\n               Dropping the roller down, she reloads it in the tray when \n               the phone rings.  She stops and answers it.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         Hello?  Oh, hi, Mr. Bianchinni ...  \n                         yes, everything is going fine.  I \n                         got the tub drain all cleaned out.\n\n               She listens for a moment.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         What apartment?\n\n               She glances at the main wall.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         All right, all right, I guess I could \n                         take a look.  Yeah, you're welcome, \n                         goodbye.\n\n               She hangs up and looks again at the wall, feeling...  curious.\n\n               INT.  HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Corky knocks and after a moment Violet opens the door.  She \n               seems surprised.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would \n                         call you.

CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Violet leads her through the apartment.  It is expensively \n               furnished with very masculine tastes; a lot of gray and black \n               leather.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         I was doing some dishes and just as \n                         I pulled the stopper my earring fell \n                         in.\n\n               Corky looks at her blankly.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         It's one of my favorites.  That's \n                         why I got upset.  I know it probably \n                         seems ridiculous to you.\n\n               An eyebrow goes up.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         I'm sorry, look, forget it.

Is it that sink?\n\n               Violet nods.\n\n               She opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel \n               locks from her back pocket.  The teeth of the channel locks \n               open and bite onto the pressure nut.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         Do you have a pot or a bucket?\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Sure.\n\n               She hands one down to her.  Corky slides it under the curved \n               pipe.\n\n               As she works, Corky feels herself staring at Violet, at the \n               hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs.\n\n               Water begins to trickle into the pan.\n\n               The nut slides loose and Corky tips the trap.  Water splashes \n               into the pan with a soft metal \"tink.\"\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Did you find it?\n\n               Corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring.\n\n               Violet screams, a huge smile on her face, half-falling as \n               she tries to hug Corky.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         I can't believe it!  You did it!\n\n               Corky leans back under and replaces the trap.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Thank you so much.

I did it.\n\n               Corky checks the drain by running the water.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         If you won't take money, how about a \n                         drink?  It's getting late.  You can't \n                         work all night.\n\n               Corky eyes her for a moment.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         Okay, one drink.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         What do you want?\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         A beer?\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         A beer.

EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               It is dark now.  Corky is standing above the paint tray that \n               has skinned over.  She picks up the brush.  It is dry with \n               paint.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         Shit.\n\n               She throws the brush across the room.\n\n               EXT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\n               A green-and-white street sign juts in the foreground of \n               Caesar's upscale apartment building.\n\n               The sign reads: \"FRANKLIN STREET.\"\n\n               EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n               The rusty Chevy glides to a stop in a parking space near the \n               service entrance.  In its payload is a boxed bathroom vanity \n               and sink.\n\n               Corky climbs out of the cab and into the back, unhooking the \n               bungee cords that hold down the boxes.\n\n               She looks up as a black Lincoln Town Car screeches into a \n               spot not far from her truck.  THREE SERIOUS-LOOKING MEN get \n               out, leading a fourth, Shelly.\n\n               He is the only one who seems to notice Corky.\n\n               They enter the building, the door closing behind them.\n\n               INT.  BATHROOM - DAY\n\n               Corky's legs jut out from the old wicker vanity as she \n               finishes detaching its anchors and pipe work.\n\n               She stands, giving it a yank and pulling it away from the \n               wall, when voices begin to filter in from the next-door \n               apartment.\n\n               She listens - a rising string of warbling sobs drowned out \n               by an angry voice.\n\n                                     ANGRY VOICE\n                         Shut the fuck up!

Where the fuck is it?!\n\n               We begin to close in on Corky as she listens to each thud, \n               watching something that disturbs her.\n\n                                     ANGRY VOICE\n                         You shit!  You piece of shit!\n\n               With each thud the water in the toilet shimmers like a struck \n               cymbal.  As we move closer, the sound swells until --\n\n                                                              MATCH CUT TO:\n\n               INT.  CAESAR'S BATHROOM DAY\n\n               Where blood splatters the toilet, heavy drops hitting the \n               water and spreading like inverted mushroom clouds.\n\n                                     ANGRY VOICE\n                         Did that hurt?  News flash, fucko: \n                         I'm just getting started.\n\n               The angry voice belongs to JOHNNIE MARZZONE.  Shelly is \n               kneeling in front of the toilet, hands tied behind his back \n               with electrical wire.\n\n               Johnnie Marzzone is a flashy young man in Armani slacks, \n               silk shirt and silver-tipped cowboy boots.  His tie is tucked \n               in, as if torture were a fine-dining experience.\n\n               Caesar and two other men are crammed in the small bathroom.\n\n                                     JOHNNIE\n                         You got nerve trying to fuck us!  \n                         Nobody fucks me!  Nobody fucks my \n                         father!  Nobody!

CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Like Corky, Violet can hear the beating.  She is trying to \n               block it out but cannot.\n\n               Standing at the bar, she runs the blender, grinding ice cubes, \n               trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom.\n\n               The bathroom door opens.\n\n                                     JOHNNIE\n                         Prick!  I can go all night!  All \n                         night!\n\n               Caesar steps out, shutting the door, masking the sounds behind \n               him.  Violet moves toward him.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Caesar, I'm leaving.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one \n                         of the good towels.\n\n               The door opens again as someone else steps out.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Caesar, I'm serious.

Over his shoulder she sees MICKEY MALNANO \n               in the hallway, staring at her.\n\n               He is an older man, hair graying, built like a fireplug.  \n               Sinewy mass strains at his Brooks Brothers suit.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Now why don't you go watch some TV \n                         or something?\n\n                                     MICKEY\n                         Are you okay, Violet?\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Mickey, why is Johnnie here?

Sure.\n\n               He goes to the kitchen.\n\n               Mickey moves closer to Violet, lifting her chin the way a \n               father would do to his little girl.\n\n                                     MICKEY\n                         You shouldn't have to see this.  Why \n                         don't you get out of here?

I'll handle \n                         Caesar.  You just get out of here, \n                         okay?\n\n               She smiles.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Thanks, Mickey.\n\n               Caesar returns from the kitchen.  He is holding a pair of \n               tin snips.  Mickey takes them.\n\n                                     MICKEY\n                         Thanks, C.

BATHROOM - DAY\n\n               Mickey takes off his coat and hands it to a large man named \n               LOU.  He slaps Johnnie on the back.\n\n                                     MICKEY\n                         Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay.\n\n               Johnnie hits Shelly once more.\n\n                                     JOHNNIE\n                         Prick.\n\n               Johnnie checks his hair in the mirror, carefully.  Then he \n               begins putting on the rings he had removed for the beating.\n\n               Mickey kneels down next to Shelly's ear and motions to Lou, \n               who lifts Shelly's bound arms.\n\n                                     MICKEY\n                         Shelly, I'm going to ask you ten \n                         times.

Where is our money?\n\n               Shelly whimpers, red-faced and sobbing.  There is a sick \n               crunch and Shelly howls into his gag as his pinky finger \n               bounces to the floor amid the expensive leather footwear.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Aw ...

Both women stand apart in \n               silence.\n\n               Violet seems on the verge of saying something but doesn't \n               know how to start.

But it \n                         wasn't even about me, it was about \n                         Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had.  \n                         That's how they are.

He could \n                         have run at any time, but he didn't \n                         because he didn't want out.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         Sounds like he wanted to get caught.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Maybe he did.  He would brag to me \n                         all the time.  He was never afraid \n                         of Caesar because he didn't know \n                         him.  Not like I do.\n\n               Two men sit down near them, laughing.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Caesar lives for these moments.  He \n                         tells me it's just the business, but \n                         I know it's more than that.  He likes \n                         it.  The violence.  I'll catch him \n                         in the bathroom mirror touching his \n                         scars.  He says they remind him who \n                         he his.  They're all like that.  \n                         Except maybe Mickey.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         Mickey?\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         He's the part of the business that \n                         the rest of them pretend to be.  \n                         |But Mickey doesn't like it like \n                         they do.

PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n               Caesar is on his knees, searching under the seats of Johnnie's \n               Mercedes.  Unable to find the money, he is ready to snap.\n\n               From the main doors, Corky slips out of the building.  Hiding \n               behind a column, she sees Violet and Caesar across the lot.\n\n               Corky moves behind the parked cars, the gun squeezed in her \n               hand.\n\n               Violet edges away, on the verge of running, looking toward \n               the busy street.\n\n               Standing, Caesar pounds on the car.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Fuck!

EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Corky turns to the wall.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         I know, Violet.  I know.\n\n               Her fingers gently touch the wall as we travel up and over, \n               where we see they are actually touching the wall in the exact \n               same place.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         It's why I'm still here.\n\n               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Suddenly, Violet hears Caesar.\n\n                                     CAESAR (V.O.)\n                         Violet?\n\n               As he opens the door, she slams down the phone.\n\n               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               The line cuts off.\n\n               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Fear and panic paralyze Violet as Caesar drops everything, \n               grabbing for his gun.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Who was that?\n\n               He levels the gun at her.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Who the fuck was that?\n\n               She stands and be rushes at her, grabbing her by the throat.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Was that Mickey?  Did you call Mickey?  \n                         Did you?!\n\n               She shakes her head and he throws her on the bed.  The gun \n               aimed at her, he picks up the phone and --\n\n               Hits the redial.\n\n               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Unsure of what happened, Corky hears the phone ring and \n               answers it on reflex.\n\n               Listening, she waits.\n\n               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Caesar listens, waiting as long as he can.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Mickey?  Is that you?\n\n               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Corky hangs up, jumping away from the wall.\n\n               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Caesar hits the redial again.\n\n               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Panicking, Corkydoesn't answer it, but as it rings very loud \n               in the empty apartment, she realizes her mistake.\n\n               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Turning slowly toward the wall, Caesar hears the phone ringing \n               in the empty apartment.\n\n               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Corky rips the plug out of the wall.\n\n               INT.

EMPTY APARTMENT\n\n               Corky hears Violet scream and that does it.  Gun in hand, \n               she flies at the door.\n\n               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The door to the empty apartment slams shut and Caesar, hearing \n               it, starts to run --\n\n               But Violet reaches out, catching his ankle, sending him \n               crashing to the dresser.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Run!  Just run!\n\n               INT HALL - NIGHT\n\n               The door to Caesar's apartment is locked.  Corky falls to \n               one knee, whipping two lock picks from her earlobe.\n\n               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Caesar raises the gun to pistol-whip Violet and she screams.\n\n               INT.  HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Working the lock, Corky hears Violet's scream cut off.\n\n               She feels the tumblers click, and rotates the cylinder.\n\n               A shadow stirs under the crack of the door as she hears \n               something that sounds like footsteps.  Corky freezes.\n\n               Corky presses down low against the door beneath the peephole.\n\n               She can almost feel Caesar beyond the door, but grits her \n               teeth and turns the doorknob.\n\n               INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               The door cracks open and Corky slips in, gun-first.  As she \n               moves into the room, we see Caesar behind her.\n\n               He puts his gun to her head.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Drop the fucking gun or die!\n\n               Corky hesitates.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Drop it!\n\n               She does.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Turn around.\n\n               Rising from her crouch, she turns and he recognizes her.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         You!?  Holy fucking Christ!  You \n                         gotta be kidding me!\n\n               He starts to laugh when she strikes --\n\n               Knocking the gun, she punches him, slamming him back against \n               the door as --\n\n               She twists, diving, grabbing her gun, just as --\n\n               He steps and kicks her full in the face.\n\n               INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT\n\n               Still unconscious, Corky's head jerks, reacting to the kick.  \n               We see the dried blood caked to her check where his kick \n               split the skin.  She is again swimming toward consciousness.\n\n               We hear water splash, her face flinching as we move closer, \n               the sounds and voices echoing.\n\n                                     CESAR (V.O.)\n                         Wake up!

Mickey.\n\n               He sees the phone, where he dropped it, lying off the hook.\n\n               The door buzzer rings again, more insistently.  Corky sees \n               him momentarily unnerved.\n\n               He looks back at her.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         I said where --\n\n               He starts to cut and Corky screams --\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         No!

He pulls out his gun \n               and aims it at Corky.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         I promised I would kill you.\n\n               He cocks it.\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         You can't kill me yet.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Why?\n\n                                     CORKY\n                         I could be lying.\n\n               His hand start to shake with ftustration.  He is beginning \n               to hate this woman more than he ever hated Johnnie.\n\n               Taking a deep breath, he eases back the hammer.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         You're going to wish to God you hadn't \n                         done that.\n\n               He kicks her again, snapping her head back.\n\n               After he leaves, Violet looks over and sees Corky lying \n               unconscious.\n\n               INT.

BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               With another towel, he gags Corky and drags her into the \n               closet.  In her pocket, he finds the key.\n\n               He closes the doors, then hangs up the phone.\n\n               Grunting, he hauls Violet up over his shoulder --\n\n               When there is a knock on the door.\n\n               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Carrying Violet, he hurries to the kitchen, where he throws \n               Corky's gun into the freezer.  Mickey is banging on the door \n               as Caesar heads for the bathroom.\n\n               INT.

LOBBY - NIGHT\n\n               Violet smashes through the door, but instead of turning to \n               the main doors, she runs straight for the elevators.\n\n               She pounds the button and waits.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Come on.

When he doesn't see Violet, he turns to the sound of \n               the elevator --\n\n               And catches a glimpse of her as the doors close.\n\n                                     CAESAR\n                         Oh, you bitch.

STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n\n               Sweat pouring off him, Caesar climbs the stairs.\n\n               INT.  HALL - NIGHT\n\n               The elevator opens, Violet bolts out.  She runs down the \n               hall, past the empty apartment, back to her door.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Corky?\n\n               INT.

EMPTY APARTMENT\n\n               Gun ready, Caesar throws open the door.\n\n               Spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but --\n\n               The money is gone.\n\n               Leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the \n               drip trail of the plastic bag.\n\n               The tracks lead to the bathroom.\n\n               Caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of \n               money next to Corky's empty boots.\n\n               Over his shoulder we see Corky already swinging a massive \n               pipe wrench.\n\n               At the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground \n               as --\n\n               The doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch.\n\n               Before he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down \n               on his arm.\n\n               He screams as the gun hits the floor.\n\n               She kicks it, sending it skidding, hydroplaning across the \n               paint pool to the other side, leaving a jet trail of white \n               swirls and spirals on the wood floor.\n\n               They fight, Corky raining blows onto his back and flailing \n               arm until --\n\n               He catches her foot, flipping her as he clambers up.\n\n               Scrambling across the paint, slipping, crawling for the gun \n               when --\n\n               Violet bursts in, pointing the gun from the freezer.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         Stop!\n\n               Caesar, on hands and knees, looks at her, then at his gun \n               still out of reach.\n\n                                     VIOLET\n                         It's over, Caesar.

Another doubles him over as blood speckles the \n               pool of paint.\n\n               She empties the gun into him.
