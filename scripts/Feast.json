DESERT -- DAY\n\n               The white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. There's not a \n               cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill.\n\n               Far in the distance, a MEDIUM SIZED FLAT-BED TRUCK makes its \n               way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. Two VULTURES \n               perched on a barren tree watch the intruders.\n\n               EXT. DESERT -- DAY\n\n               The truck screeches to a dusty stop. Three men in matching \n               coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: CHIEF (42, stocky, \n               weary), LANKY (32, withered) and COLLEGE BOY (23, clean cut \n               and naive).\n\n               Chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth \n               before them.\n\n                                     CHIEF\n                         This is it.\n\n                                     LANKY\n                         Why did it have to be these caves...\n\n                                     COLLEGE BOY\n                         Is something wrong?\n\n                                     LANKY\n                              (to College Boy)\n                         Don't mind me, buddy.

The cops had him pinned down \n                         and began to move in.

A \n               group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, \n               CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams.\n\n               MEAN GREEN (35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched \n               a thousand craps) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around \n               her neck.

One pulls out a \n               tambourine, drums the beat for KUM BI YA. The rest join in \n               the victorious chant as they watch the three men hop in their \n               truck and peel away.\n\n                                     BEARDED CAMERAMAN\n                         Hey, man, that was righteous, but I \n                         need a shot with the sign up.\n\n               At the end of the human chain, an earthy woman, FUZZY, moves \n               to hang a GREENPEACE sign. Mean Green strokes the cave wall.\n\n                                     MEAN GREEN\n                         We saved you today, ol' gal.\n\n               Fuzzy hammers the sign in, but hits too hard, causing a breach \n               in the rock wall.\n\n                                     FUZZY\n                         Oh, fuck!\n\n                                     MEAN GREEN\n                         Sister, why do you always swing for \n                         the fences?\n\n                                     FUZZY\n                              (eyeing breach)\n                         It's okay, but I... I think I see \n                         something in there... something shiny.\n\n               Fuzzy puts her face up to the hole for a closer look. The \n               rest of the hippie-chain moves in closer.\n\n                                     FUZZY\n                         Oh my, it looks like diamonds!\n\n               CHOMP! A set of giant, ravenous teeth bite into Fuzzy's skull. \n               Blood SPLATTERS on the hippies.\n\n               Bearded Cameraman jumps to pull Fuzzy from the breach.\n\n               Fuzzy's body is YANKED into the hole. The group tumbles \n               forward.\n\n               Mean Green tries to stop herself from sliding, but can't.\n\n               One by one, the hippies are being dragged to their death.\n\n               Ripping, tearing, and howling echoes off the walls.\n\n               Bearded Cameraman stumbles back. Mean Green spots him.\n\n                                     MEAN GREEN\n                         Give me the keys!!!\n\n               Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing \n               both his arms.\n\n               Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She \n               HAMMERS at the chain around her waist.\n\n               Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she \n               BREAKS the chain, popping herself free.\n\n               She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her \n               fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening. \n               She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!\n\n               Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness. \n               The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light. \n               As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK...\n\n                                                              CUT TO BLACK:\n\n               SUPERIMPOSED: BASED ON A TRUE STORY\n\n               The title SHATTERS...\n\n               INT.

Hissing, Sister Beast #1 charges as well.\n\n               Heroine pumps and fires. BOOM! Sister Beast spins, avoiding \n               the shot. Now too close, Heroine jams the Beast in the mouth \n               with the gun, knocking her back.\n\n               Sister Beast #1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm.\n\n               Heroine bats her away.

He's forced to wait \n               for Heroine to get out of the water.\n\n               The second she does, he jams the cord into the water.\n\n               ZAP! The conductive water sizzles. Sister Beast #1 and Sister \n               Beast #2 lock up and crash. ELECTROCUTION.

Teen lurches back, dropping back down the shaft.\n\n               Tuffy slams the keg door shut.

The wooden walls go up in flame.\n\n               Para, on a side table, reaches out and grabs Boss Man's .38 \n               from the floor.\n\n               The second peanut barrel is released. It sails outside the \n               breach, but it doesn't explode. Nevertheless, the Beasts \n               stay far away.\n\n               Teen Beast madly rips floor boards away, moving towards Para's \n               table. Teen Beast bursts through the floor, knocking Para to \n               the floor.\n\n               Para crawls to his fallen wheelchair. Teen Beast spots him, \n               moves in to feed.\n\n               Para points his seat back at the scattered .38 bullets and \n               flips the armrest switch. SNAP! The bullets jump to the power \n               magnet. Para yanks one free, loads the pistol and turns just \n               as Teen Beast strikes...\n\n               POP! The shot hits Teen Beast in the eye, sending him back \n               down the hole in the floor.\n\n               Heroine and Bartender move in. When Teen Beast sticks his \n               head out of the hole again, they thrust both their shotguns \n               into each ear.\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                         Now!\n\n               BLAM-BLAM!

BAR -- MOMENTS LATER\n\n               The second barrel comes to a stop a good distance from the \n               bar. Suddenly, the top is knocked off. Trampy sticks her \n               head out.\n\n               Seeing no trouble, she emerges, dizzy as hell, and races for \n               the nearby BEER TRUCK.\n\n               INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Papa and Momma Beast both charge the bar. The third peanut \n               barrel is released. It sails for them, but they dive out of \n               the way.\n\n               KABLOOM! It takes out the rest of the wall. Fire and smoke \n               fills the place.\n\n               Adulterer douses Momma Beast with booze as Beer Guy nails \n               her with a lit Molotov cocktail.\n\n               WHOOSH!

The shotgun butt knocks out Papa's front teeth. Tuffy \n               raises the weapon again, staring down at the monster that \n               killed her child, but Papa Beast gets an arm free to knock \n               away her fatal blow.\n\n               Bartender wrenches Papa Beast's arm with all his might. With \n               her hair stuck in Papa Beast's claw, Tuffy is pulled face to \n               face with the beast. She squirms as he chomps at her, but \n               with no front teeth, he can't do immediate damage.\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                         I can't hold him!!!\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                         Do something!!!\n\n               Tuffy reaches back and shoves her fist into Papa Beast's \n               mouth, jamming it down his throat. He instantly gags, sucking \n               for air.\n\n               Papa Beast struggles to get free, but the others hold tight.\n\n               Papa Beast's body begins to quiver from a lack of oxygen.\n\n               His eyes widen, face to face with Tuffy.\n\n                                     TUFFY\n                         CHOKE ON IT!!!\n\n               With one last lunge, Papa Beast shakes, his life drifting \n               away. His eyes turn black as his body goes limp. Tuffy pulls \n               out her arm from his throat.\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                         God...\n\n                                     BOZO\n                         I need to get your number.\n\n               Tuffy shakes her wet arm dry. As the group pulls away, Papa \n               Beast is still pinned to the wall with the deer antlers dug \n               into the wood.\n\n               Heroine turns to Grandma and Grandpa, offering a hand.\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                         Come on, I'll help you.\n\n                                     GRANDPA\n                         No thank you, we're content.\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                         I'm not leaving anyone behind.\n\n                                     GRANDMA\n                         Maybe next time, dear.\n\n               Heroine swallows and nods. HONK-HONK-HONK! Just outside the \n               breached wall, the beer truck pulls up.\n\n               EXT. BAR -- CONTINUOUS\n\n               The beer truck screeches to a halt. Trampy's at the wheel, \n               waving the group over. With the bar burning, a thick layer \n               of SMOKE blankets the entire area.\n\n               The people amass at the opening, but Heroine stops them from \n               advancing. The group stares the dark night. Silent.\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                         She's still out here.\n\n               Heroine eyes the truck, seeing something she likes.\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                         Stay put.\n\n               She creeps out alone.\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                         Where are you... come on...\n\n               Nothing.

Come on!\n\n               From the smoke, a smoldering Momma Beast charges like a bull.\n\n               At the truck, Heroine opens the back doors and dives in, \n               leaving the doors open. Momma Beast gives chase, entering \n               the back.\n\n               INSIDE TRUCK\n\n               Heroine is deep into the truck as Momma Beast enters. She \n               advances, hissing.\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                         Come and get me you blood-chugging \n                         CUNT!\n\n               Momma howls and charges. Heroine slides out the side keg \n               door, locking it behind her. Before Momma can see the trap, \n               Beer Guy slam closed the rear doors.\n\n               OUTSIDE TRUCK\n\n               Beer Guy latches it. Trampy comes around the truck.\n\n                                     TRAMPY\n                         You got her?

Let's blow this thing!\n\n               The others move into action. Beer Guy takes off his shirt \n               and shoves it into the fuel tank. Adulterer and Bozo, with \n               Para riding piggyback, help. They use the Molotov cocktails \n               to make a fuel trail leading away from the truck.\n\n                                     BEER GUY\n                         When this lights, run like hell.\n\n               About fifteen yards away from the truck. Bozo throws his \n               silver-plated American Eagle lighter to Heroine.\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                              (catching lighter)\n                         Here we go...\n\n               Then, a noise: EOCH-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK! EOCK-OCK-OCK!\n\n               A deafening pattern of sound erupts from within the truck.\n\n               It's Momma Beast. Again and again.\n\n                                     TUFFY\n                         What is that?\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                         She's calling for help.\n\n               Heroine drops the lighter onto the fuel. It races for the \n               truck. When feet away, COUSIN BEAST lands, stomping out the \n               fire with his foot.\n\n                                     BOZO\n                         The fan has officially been buried \n                         in the shit.\n\n               Instantly, another beast, AUNT BEAST, lands on the top of \n               the truck. These Beasts are like the others, but stripped. \n               The group gasps. Trampy backs away.\n\n                                     TRAMPY\n                         We have to run --\n\n               BURST! Trampy's rib cage is ripped from her body. The culprit, \n               UNCLE BEAST, stands behind her. Her organs drop like a box \n               of vegetables. Cousin Beast lets out a high-pitched roar. \n               From atop the truck, the rear doors are ripped open. Momma \n               Beast emerges.\n\n                                     HEROINE\n                         Get to your cars!!!\n\n               The Beasts spring into action, chasing the group.\n\n               Bozo, with Para on his back, sprints for his car. Aunt Beast \n               RIPS Para from Bozo's back.\n\n                                     BOZO\n                         Motherfucker!

Suddenly, \n               the sunlight starts to FADE.

The manhole cover shakes, something \n               is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but \n               Adulterer holds her at bay.\n\n                                     ADULTERER\n                         It's a trap!\n\n               At a standstill, the group looks around for options.

The strike cuts the chain at her ankle. The manhole \n               cover POPS off and a Beast claw sinks into Adulterer.\n\n               The darkness covers the manhole. Momma Beast rises, hoisting \n               Adulterer's blood dripping body from the ground.\n\n                                     ADULTERER\n                              (gurgling blood)\n                         Run!!!\n\n               Heroine scoops up her child, moving away from Momma Beast.\n\n               Tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store \n               front. As Adulterer's blood flows, Momma Beast drags him \n               towards her main prey. \n\n               A blanket of darkness leads Momma Beast, overtaking the \n               survivors.
