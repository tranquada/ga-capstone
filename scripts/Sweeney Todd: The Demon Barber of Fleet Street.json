It is the sound of a woman humming. He looks up to\r\n     see...\r\n\r\n     JOHANNA, a 16-year-old girl with golden hair, beautiful and\r\n     hauntingly sad. She sits at her window above, behind bars,\r\n     humming to herself as she does needlepoint.\r\n\r\n     Anthony watches her, absolutely mesmerized.\r\n\r\n     Johanna notices a Bird Seller passing. He carries a long,\r\n     wooden pole with little bird cages attached.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JOHANNA\r\n</b>               Green finch and linnet bird,\r\n               Nightingale, blackbird,\r\n               How is it you sing?\r\n               How can you jubilate,\r\n               Sitting in cages,\r\n               Never taking wing?\r\n               Outside the sky waits,\r\n               Beckoning, beckoning,\r\n               Just beyond the bars.\r\n               How can you remain,\r\n               Staring at the rain,\r\n               Maddened by the stars?\r\n               How is it you sing\r\n               Anything?\r\n               How is it you sing?\r\n\r\n     Then ... she sees Anthony on the sidewalk below.\r\n\r\n     Music continues.

Paternal and warm, he smiles\r\n     and beckons to Anthony.\r\n\r\n     Anthony hesitates, unsure. The Judge beckons again.
