Following this \n                         Ellie is seen swimming furiously against \n                         the giant waves.

With his \n                         foot he slowly moves it over to her, \n                         and Ellie's foot is seen pushing it \n                         back, whereupon Peter viciously kicks \n                         it over to her side again. Next we see \n                         Ellie glaring at him, picking up her \n                         bag, and standing on the seat depositing \n                         it on the rack overhead. But just then \n                         the bus starts forward with a lurch \n                         which unbalances her, and she falls \n                         backward right in Peter's lap. Their \n                         noses almost touch. Their eyes meet, \n                         and they glare at each other hostilely. \n                         Ellie quickly scrambles off and gets \n                         back in her seat, turning her back on \n                         him.\n<b>                                      \n</b><b>                         PETER\n</b><b>                                     \n</b>                         (amused)\n<b>                                     \n</b>                         Next time you drop in, bring your folks.\n<b> \n</b><b>                                                              \n</b>                         This dissolves to a COUNTRY ROAD, and \n                         the bus sways perilously as it speeds \n                         through the night, following which the \n                         view dissolves to the INTERIOR of the \n                         BUS, revealing Peter slumped in his \n                         seat, his hat drawn over his eyes. Ellie \n                         has her head thrown back, trying to \n                         sleep.

She reaches for it on the rack, \n                         Peter watching her, amused.\n<b>                                      \n</b>                         The scene dissolves to the outside of \n                         the REST STATION with several passengers \n                         walking briskly back and forth. The \n                         place is dimly lit by one or two lamp-posts, \n                         and Peter can be seen leaning against \n                         one of these posts, smoking a cigarette. \n                         The scene moving in, a close view of \n                         Peter shows him stealing a glance in \n                         the direction of Ellie. And a view, \n                         from his angle, reveals Ellie in the \n                         shadow of the bus, her bag at her feet. \n                         She slowly turns her head toward Peter \n                         and then quickly averts it.\n<b>                                      \n</b>                         PETER (seen close) speculates about \n                         her. He glances around the place, and \n                         the scene moves about, following his \n                         gaze. It takes in the other passengers, \n                         all obviously poor and uncultured. The \n                         moving view reaches Ellie. The contrast \n                         is perceptible. Thereupon, we see Peter \n                         reacting with comprehension: No doubt \n                         about it! She doesn't belong with these \n                         passengers. Then suddenly he sees something \n                         which startles him, and we see what \n                         it is: Directly in back of her, the \n                         young hoodlum passenger slyly lifts \n                         her overnight bag from the ground and \n                         starts running with it. Ellie is oblivious \n                         of his actions.

She has her head thrown \n                         back in an effort to sleep, but the \n                         fat man, his hands clasped over his \n                         protruding stomach, snores disgustingly, \n                         and the rumble of the flying bus accompanies \n                         him. Suddenly the bus careens, the fat \n                         man falls against Ellie, and she awakens \n                         with a start and pushes him back. The \n                         fat man's snoring goes on uninterrupted, \n                         and Ellie relaxes again; but in a few \n                         seconds the procedure is repeated, and \n                         Ellie is beside herself. She looks around \n                         for somewhere to flee.\n<b>                                      \n</b>                         PETER, seated in back of her, in his \n                         customary slumped position, opens his \n                         eyes slightly. It is apparent he has \n                         been watching her for some time, for \n                         he grins at her discomfiture. Ellie's \n                         head turns in his direction and the \n                         grin leaves Peter's face. He shuts his \n                         eyes and pretends to be asleep. Ellie \n                         glances at Peter to make certain he \n                         is asleep. The fat man falls against \n                         her again and it is all she can stand. \n                         She starts to rise. Peter sees her coming \n                         and deliberately puts his hand on the \n                         seat next to him, still pretending to \n                         be asleep. Just as Ellie starts to sit, \n                         she notices his hand and is embarrassed. \n                         Gingerly she picks up his limp hand \n                         and places it on his knee. She then \n                         slides into the seat, sighing with relief, \n                         whereupon Peter opens his eyes and is \n                         amused. Slowly his head turns\u0097and he \n                         scrutinizes her, soberly and appraisingly. \n                         Ellie slowly turns her head for a glimpse \n                         of Peter\u0097and is startled to find him \n                         gazing at her. She turns forward, her \n                         jaw set forbiddingly.\n<b>                                      \n</b>                         The scene dissolves to the view of a \n                         ROAD. It is dawn, and in the distance, \n                         against the horizon, the bus, a mere \n                         speck, makes its lone way over the deserted \n                         country. This dissolves to a large SIGN, \n                         reading \"JACKSONVILLE,\" and then into \n                         the BUS affording a close view of ELLIE \n                         and PETER. They are both asleep, her \n                         head resting comfortably on his shoulder, \n                         Peter's topcoat thrown over her. Then \n                         the view draws back.

I'll give you my address \n                         and you can get in touch with me the \n                         minute you get to New York.\n<b>                                      \n</b><b>                         PETER\n</b><b>                                     \n</b>                         (furious)\n<b>                                     \n</b>                         Never mind.

Peter \n                         is in his seat, reading a magazine, \n                         while Ellie enters hurriedly from the \n                         rear door and starts forward. As she \n                         approaches Peter, she hesitates a second, \n                         and deliberately passes him, plunking \n                         herself into a seat in the opposite \n                         aisle. Peter turns just as she gets \n                         seated. He glances at her indifferently.\n<b> \n</b><b>                                                              \n</b>                         A close view shows Ellie seated next \n                         to a man who sits reading a newspaper \n                         which covers his face. Her eyes are \n                         fixed forward, her lips set adamantly. \n                         A close-up of the MAN next to Ellie \n                         makes it plain that he is a typical \n                         drummer.[3] At the moment he is absorbed \n                         in a serial story, but suddenly he becomes \n                         aware of something at his feet, and \n                         without lowering the newspaper, his \n                         gaze slowly shifts downward. At this, \n                         the view moves down until it reaches \n                         Ellie's trim ankles. Her feet beat a \n                         regular tattoo on the floor; her extreme \n                         agitation is evident. The view moves \n                         back slowly, taking in Ellie's shapely \n                         leg as far as the knee. Then we see \n                         ELLIE and the DRUMMER as his gaze is \n                         still fixed on her leg. Slowly his face \n                         breaks into a lascivious grin, he lowers \n                         his paper, and turns for a scrutiny \n                         of her face. What he sees apparently \n                         delights him, for he drops his paper \n                         completely\u0097and smiles broadly.\n<b>                                      \n</b><b>                         DRUMMER\n</b><b>                                     \n</b>                         Hi, sister\u0097All alone?

But \n                         Dyke is gone, and she turns and glances \n                         thoughtfully in the direction of the \n                         cabin. Then slowly the corners of her \n                         mouth screw up in an attitude of cynicism. \n                         So that's it, is it!

Peter, attracted, \n                         turns, and over Peter's shoulder we \n                         see the parade starting.

The scene \n                         dissolves to ANDREWS' STUDY, where a \n                         butler stands in front of Andrews who \n                         is seated at his desk.\n<b>                                      \n</b><b>                         ? 318 ?\n</b><b>                                     \n</b><b>                         ANDREWS\n</b><b>                                     \n</b>                         Show him in.\n<b>                                     \n</b>                         The Butler leaving, a close view shows \n                         ANDREWS reaching over and snapping on \n                         a dictograph concealed somewhere on \n                         his desk.

The orchestra is playing \n                         Mendelssohn's Wedding March. The lawn \n                         is crowded with guests. In the background \n                         we see the autogyro idling. A closer \n                         view shows a small platform, serving \n                         as an altar. Over it there is an arbor \n                         of roses. Back of the altar stands a \n                         minister, ready. A reverse view reveals \n                         a long, narrow, carpeted pathway leading \n                         to the house. Both sides are lined with \n                         guests, who are murmuring excitedly. \n                         At the moment, King Westley and his \n                         best man are marching solemnly toward \n                         the altar. Back of the altar we see \n                         a high platform upon which are several \n                         newsreel men who are grinding their \n                         cameras.\n<b>                                      \n</b>                         The guests, of whom close glimpses are \n                         caught, are now peering over each other's \n                         shoulders. King and his best man have \n                         reached the altar, and the music of \n                         the wedding march comes to a stop. The \n                         orchestra leader is looking around, \n                         apparently waiting for a signal.
