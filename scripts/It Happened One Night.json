Then, as viewed \n                         from his position at the cabin door, \n                         Ellie appears standing on the rail; \n                         and with a professional dive, she leaps \n                         into the water.\n                                      \n                         A full view of the DECK reveals the \n                         crew and the officers scurrying around, \n                         several of them shouting: \"Somebody \n                         overboard!\"\n                                      \n                         ANDREWS\n                                     \n                         It's my daughter!

Following this \n                         Ellie is seen swimming furiously against \n                         the giant waves. Next she appears as \n                         a small speck in the distance, while \n                         half a dozen of the crew are swimming \n                         in pursuit.\n                                      \n                         At the SIDE OF THE YACHT one of the \n                         boats has already been lowered, and \n                         two men jump in and grab the oars. The \n                         men seem to be gaining on Ellie. In \n                         the distance several small motor boats \n                         are anchored, and over the sides of \n                         the boats their owners are fishing. \n                         Ellie seems to be headed in their direction.\n \n                                                              \n                         One of the motor boats appears closer. \n                         A middle-aged man sits on the stern, \n                         holding lazily to his line, his feet \n                         dangling in the water as the boat is \n                         tossed around by the turbulent waves. \n                         ELLIE is then again seen swimming. She \n                         looks back, and the next scene shows \n                         the men rowing toward her, and gaining \n                         on her. Thereupon we see Ellie ducking \n                         under the water.\n                                      \n                         ? 216 ?\n                                     \n                         The middle-aged fisherman is suddenly \n                         startled by Ellie's face which appears \n                         from under water, right between his \n                         legs. Ellie puts her finger up to her \n                         lips, warning him to shush, and he is \n                         too dumb-founded to say anything. As \n                         the pursuing boats come near, Ellie \n                         ducks under the water again and the \n                         boats scoot right by the fisherman. \n                         Then Ellie's head bobs up; she peers \n                         ahead of her, and seeing that her pursuers \n                         have passed her, she smiles victoriously.\n \n                                                              \n                         ELLIE\n                                     \n                         (to the fisherman)\n                                     \n                         Thanks.\n                                     \n                         (and she starts swimming toward shore)\n \n                                                              \n                         The scene dissolves to the DECK of the \n                         YACHT as Ellie's pursuers clamber aboard, \n                         Andrews waiting for them.\n                                      \n                         A MAN\n                                     \n                         Sorry, sir.

This is a \"maybe they \n                         do.\"\n                                      \n                         He plops into the seat, the other passengers \n                         around them heaving a sigh of relief. \n                         Ellie flashes him a devastating look \n                         and deliberately turns her back on him. \n                         But Peter suddenly looks down toward \n                         the floor, following which a close-up \n                         AT THEIR FEET reveals that Ellie's bag \n                         on the floor annoys Peter. With his \n                         foot he slowly moves it over to her, \n                         and Ellie's foot is seen pushing it \n                         back, whereupon Peter viciously kicks \n                         it over to her side again. Next we see \n                         Ellie glaring at him, picking up her \n                         bag, and standing on the seat depositing \n                         it on the rack overhead. But just then \n                         the bus starts forward with a lurch \n                         which unbalances her, and she falls \n                         backward right in Peter's lap. Their \n                         noses almost touch. Their eyes meet, \n                         and they glare at each other hostilely. \n                         Ellie quickly scrambles off and gets \n                         back in her seat, turning her back on \n                         him.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (amused)\n                                     \n                         Next time you drop in, bring your folks.\n \n                                                              \n                         This dissolves to a COUNTRY ROAD, and \n                         the bus sways perilously as it speeds \n                         through the night, following which the \n                         view dissolves to the INTERIOR of the \n                         BUS, revealing Peter slumped in his \n                         seat, his hat drawn over his eyes. Ellie \n                         has her head thrown back, trying to \n                         sleep. But the swaying bus causes her \n                         head to roll from side to side uncomfortably, \n                         and finally she gives up.\n                                      \n                         ELLIE\n                                     \n                         (an order)\n                                     \n                         Tell that man not to drive so fast.\n \n                                                              \n                         (at which Peter just cocks his head \n                         slightly)\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         Are you talking to me?\n                                     \n                         ELLIE\n                                     \n                         Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.\n \n                                                              \n                         Peter stares at her a moment, resenting \n                         her officious manner.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (pleasantly)\n                                     \n                         Okay.\n                                     \n                         And much to her surprise, he sighs deeply \n                         and relaxes to his former position, \n                         shutting his eyes. She glares at him \n                         crushingly.\n                                      \n                         The scene dissolves to another view \n                         of the BUS, disclosing the driver, and \n                         suddenly the bus comes to a stop.\n \n                                                              \n                         ? 225 ?\n                                     \n                         DRIVER\n                                     \n                         (sticking his head in to face the passengers)\n \n                                                              \n                         Rest station! Ten minutes!\n                                     \n                         The view draws back as some of the passengers \n                         rise. The men stretch their legs, and \n                         the women straighten out their skirts. \n                         A close view of Peter and Ellie then \n                         shows her rising. Peter accommodatingly \n                         shoves his feet aside for her to pass, \n                         and Ellie starts up the aisle. But she \n                         suddenly stops; looks back, first at \n                         her bag and then at Peter; decides to \n                         take her bag with her, and returns to \n                         take it. She reaches for it on the rack, \n                         Peter watching her, amused.\n                                      \n                         The scene dissolves to the outside of \n                         the REST STATION with several passengers \n                         walking briskly back and forth. The \n                         place is dimly lit by one or two lamp-posts, \n                         and Peter can be seen leaning against \n                         one of these posts, smoking a cigarette. \n                         The scene moving in, a close view of \n                         Peter shows him stealing a glance in \n                         the direction of Ellie. And a view, \n                         from his angle, reveals Ellie in the \n                         shadow of the bus, her bag at her feet. \n                         She slowly turns her head toward Peter \n                         and then quickly averts it.\n                                      \n                         PETER (seen close) speculates about \n                         her. He glances around the place, and \n                         the scene moves about, following his \n                         gaze. It takes in the other passengers, \n                         all obviously poor and uncultured. The \n                         moving view reaches Ellie. The contrast \n                         is perceptible. Thereupon, we see Peter \n                         reacting with comprehension: No doubt \n                         about it! She doesn't belong with these \n                         passengers. Then suddenly he sees something \n                         which startles him, and we see what \n                         it is: Directly in back of her, the \n                         young hoodlum passenger slyly lifts \n                         her overnight bag from the ground and \n                         starts running with it. Ellie is oblivious \n                         of his actions. PETER springs forward.\n \n                                                              \n                         Ellie sees Peter coming toward her and \n                         is perceptibly startled. But Peter whizzes \n                         by her, and this amazes her even more. \n                         She shrugs her shoulders, perplexed, \n                         and resumes her smoking. In a few seconds \n                         Peter returns, puffing breathlessly.\n \n                                                              \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         He got away.

A close view then \n                         shows her standing uncertainly for a \n                         moment, speculating whether to cross \n                         over his legs to get her place by the \n                         window. Peter feels her presence by \n                         his side and glances up. She tosses \n                         her head and plants herself in the seat \n                         in front of him, vacated by the young \n                         man who stole her bag. Peter takes the \n                         affront with a shrug and slides over \n                         gratefully to the coveted spot near \n                         the window.\n                                      \n                         The scene dissolves to a close view \n                         of Ellie and a recently arrived fat \n                         man next to her. She has her head thrown \n                         back in an effort to sleep, but the \n                         fat man, his hands clasped over his \n                         protruding stomach, snores disgustingly, \n                         and the rumble of the flying bus accompanies \n                         him. Suddenly the bus careens, the fat \n                         man falls against Ellie, and she awakens \n                         with a start and pushes him back. The \n                         fat man's snoring goes on uninterrupted, \n                         and Ellie relaxes again; but in a few \n                         seconds the procedure is repeated, and \n                         Ellie is beside herself. She looks around \n                         for somewhere to flee.\n                                      \n                         PETER, seated in back of her, in his \n                         customary slumped position, opens his \n                         eyes slightly. It is apparent he has \n                         been watching her for some time, for \n                         he grins at her discomfiture. Ellie's \n                         head turns in his direction and the \n                         grin leaves Peter's face. He shuts his \n                         eyes and pretends to be asleep. Ellie \n                         glances at Peter to make certain he \n                         is asleep. The fat man falls against \n                         her again and it is all she can stand. \n                         She starts to rise. Peter sees her coming \n                         and deliberately puts his hand on the \n                         seat next to him, still pretending to \n                         be asleep. Just as Ellie starts to sit, \n                         she notices his hand and is embarrassed. \n                         Gingerly she picks up his limp hand \n                         and places it on his knee. She then \n                         slides into the seat, sighing with relief, \n                         whereupon Peter opens his eyes and is \n                         amused. Slowly his head turns\u0097and he \n                         scrutinizes her, soberly and appraisingly. \n                         Ellie slowly turns her head for a glimpse \n                         of Peter\u0097and is startled to find him \n                         gazing at her. She turns forward, her \n                         jaw set forbiddingly.\n                                      \n                         The scene dissolves to the view of a \n                         ROAD. It is dawn, and in the distance, \n                         against the horizon, the bus, a mere \n                         speck, makes its lone way over the deserted \n                         country. This dissolves to a large SIGN, \n                         reading \"JACKSONVILLE,\" and then into \n                         the BUS affording a close view of ELLIE \n                         and PETER. They are both asleep, her \n                         head resting comfortably on his shoulder, \n                         Peter's topcoat thrown over her. Then \n                         the view draws back. The bus is empty \n                         except for Ellie and Peter, the last \n                         few passengers are just leaving.\n                                      \n                         PETER's eyes slowly open.

Peter \n                         is in his seat, reading a magazine, \n                         while Ellie enters hurriedly from the \n                         rear door and starts forward. As she \n                         approaches Peter, she hesitates a second, \n                         and deliberately passes him, plunking \n                         herself into a seat in the opposite \n                         aisle. Peter turns just as she gets \n                         seated. He glances at her indifferently.\n \n                                                              \n                         A close view shows Ellie seated next \n                         to a man who sits reading a newspaper \n                         which covers his face. Her eyes are \n                         fixed forward, her lips set adamantly. \n                         A close-up of the MAN next to Ellie \n                         makes it plain that he is a typical \n                         drummer.[3] At the moment he is absorbed \n                         in a serial story, but suddenly he becomes \n                         aware of something at his feet, and \n                         without lowering the newspaper, his \n                         gaze slowly shifts downward. At this, \n                         the view moves down until it reaches \n                         Ellie's trim ankles. Her feet beat a \n                         regular tattoo on the floor; her extreme \n                         agitation is evident. The view moves \n                         back slowly, taking in Ellie's shapely \n                         leg as far as the knee. Then we see \n                         ELLIE and the DRUMMER as his gaze is \n                         still fixed on her leg. Slowly his face \n                         breaks into a lascivious grin, he lowers \n                         his paper, and turns for a scrutiny \n                         of her face. What he sees apparently \n                         delights him, for he drops his paper \n                         completely\u0097and smiles broadly.\n                                      \n                         DRUMMER\n                                     \n                         Hi, sister\u0097All alone?

With an independent toss \n                         of her head, Ellie turns and also enters \n                         the bus, but through the rear door.\n \n                                                              \n                         The scene dissolves to DYKE'S AUTO CAMP. \n                         Ellie stands alone on the porch of a \n                         small bungalow, sheltered from the rain. \n                         Over her head is a sign reading:\n                                      \n                         OFFICE-Dyke Auto Co.\u0097P. D. Dyke, Prop.\n \n                                                              \n                         She looks about her restlessly, giving \n                         the impression that she has been waiting \n                         for someone. Suddenly she is attracted \n                         by something and gazes in its direction. \n                         Then, as seen by Ellie in a long view, \n                         there appears, about twenty yards away, \n                         a small cabin, lighted on the inside; \n                         and from it Peter emerges accompanied \n                         by a man\u0097presumably Mr. Dyke. We cannot \n                         hear what is being said; from their \n                         movements, however, it is apparent that \n                         an exchange of money is taking place. \n                         Dyke waves his hand in departure and \n                         starts toward Ellie. At the same time, \n                         Peter calls to her:\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (shouting)\n                                     \n                         Hey!

Now she is hurrying \n                         across the open space. En route she \n                         passes Dyke.\n                                      \n                         DYKE\n                                     \n                         (as they pass)\n                                     \n                         Good evening.

But \n                         Dyke is gone, and she turns and glances \n                         thoughtfully in the direction of the \n                         cabin. Then slowly the corners of her \n                         mouth screw up in an attitude of cynicism. \n                         So that's it, is it! He has given her \n                         no previous evidence of being \"on the \n                         make\"; yet now, with the first opportunity\u0097. \n                         Her thoughts, however, are interrupted \n                         by Peter's voice:\n                                      \n                         PETER'S VOICE\n                                     \n                         Well, Brat\u0097what do you say!\n                                     \n                         ? 240 ?\n                                     \n                         As she doesn't stir, there appears a \n                         close-up view of PETER standing in the \n                         doorway of the cabin, looking toward \n                         Ellie.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (impatiently)\n                                     \n                         Come on!

Then, \n                         tossing her head defiantly, with her \n                         lips set grimly, she starts toward the \n                         cabin until she reaches it, stops in \n                         the doorway and peers in. As she does \n                         this, there is a view of the inside \n                         of the CABIN, as seen by her at the \n                         door. Except for two cots on either \n                         side of the room, a few sticks of cane \n                         furniture, a small table upon which \n                         stands an oil burner for cooking, the \n                         place is barren. At the moment Peter \n                         is attaching a clothes line across the \n                         center of the room. His suitcase is \n                         already open. And now Ellie steps inside, \n                         surveying the place contemptuously. \n                         But Peter, with his back to her, is \n                         oblivious of her presence; and as he \n                         works, he hums his favorite melody. \n                         Ellie finally breaks the silence.\n \n                                                              \n                         ELLIE\n                                     \n                         (sarcastically)\n                                     \n                         Darn clever, these Armenians.\n                                     \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (seen close as he turns)\n                                     \n                         Yeah.

The downpour has not abated \n                         one bit, and the heavy raindrops clatter \n                         against the window pane in a sort of \n                         challenge to Ellie, whose jaw drops. \n                         She turns slowly back to the room, and \n                         as she does so her eyes light on the \n                         cot. It looks most inviting; after all, \n                         she hasn't had any rest for two nights. \n                         She falls on the cot again, her shoulders \n                         sagging wearily. Following this, the \n                         view reveals both sides of the blanket. \n                         Peter is already in his pajamas.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         Still with me, Brat?\n                                     \n                         (there is no answer from Ellie)\n                                     \n                         Don't be a sucker.

The situation \n                         is delicate and dangerous; the room \n                         is atingle with sex. He turns his gaze \n                         toward the blanket.

She holds her head high and \n                         struggles valiantly to maintain as much \n                         dignity as she can muster under the \n                         circumstances. Then in the cabin, at \n                         the window, Peter watching Ellie, chuckles \n                         at her, shaking his head in amusement. \n                         He starts toward the table, and the \n                         scene cuts to a moving view outside\n \n                                                              \n                         ? 250 ?\n                                     \n                         the cabins, with Ellie walking past \n                         several cottages on her way to the showers. \n                         Several people stop to stare at her \n                         until she reaches her destination. There \n                         are two wooden shacks adjoining, each \n                         having a sign on them; one reads, \"Showers\u0097Men\"\u0097the \n                         other, \"Showers\u0097Women.\" In front of \n                         the women's shower there are several \n                         unappetizing-looking fat women waiting, \n                         and with them is a small girl. Ellie \n                         crosses over to the women's shower and \n                         disappears inside, the waiting women \n                         staring at her, puzzled. A moment elapses \n                         and Ellie backs out, being pushed by \n                         a woman, part of whose naked body is \n                         visible, and whose voice is heard in \n                         protest:\n                                      \n                         WOMAN\n                                     \n                         Can't a body have some privacy around \n                         here?\n                                      \n                         The women who are waiting chuckle at \n                         Ellie's embarrassment as she stands \n                         aside. They certainly are making a monkey \n                         out of her decorum. The little girl \n                         keeps eyeing Ellie, fascinated.\n                                      \n                         LITTLE GIRL\n                                     \n                         (pointing)\n                                     \n                         Don't she look funny, Mama?\n                                     \n                         Ellie, wheeling on the little girl, \n                         crushes her with a devastating look, \n                         so that the little girl cringes against \n                         her mother's skirt. Ellie goes to the \n                         end of the line to await her turn, following \n                         which close-ups show the LITTLE GIRL \n                         slowly turning her head to look at Ellie, \n                         and ELLIE noticing the little girl staring \n                         at her, whereupon Ellie sticks her tongue \n                         out at her. And, in a scene which includes \n                         both, the little girl retaliates by \n                         sticking her tongue out also.\n                                      \n                         This dissolves to a view of ELLIE coming \n                         out of the showers. At the same time \n                         Shapeley comes out of the men's shower, \n                         and upon seeing Ellie, his face lights \n                         up.\n                                      \n                         SHAPELEY\n                                     \n                         Hello, sister.\n                                     \n                         Ellie ignores him, and walks toward \n                         her cabin. But Shapeley falls into step \n                         with her.\n                                      \n                         SHAPELEY\n                                     \n                         Sorry about last night.

Thereupon \n                         PETER is seen again as his lip curls \n                         up a little jealously; he returns to \n                         the cabin, following which we again \n                         see Ellie and Shapeley walking. He notices \n                         the robe she is wearing, and he looks \n                         down toward her feet, the view moving \n                         down to show Ellie's legs and feet. \n                         The pajama legs are seen protruding \n                         below the robe, the cuffs of which she \n                         has turned up.

He stares long \n                         and absorbedly at the picture. Then \n                         slowly he turns his head toward the \n                         rear of the bus, and the view following \n                         his gaze passes a group of men singing \n                         \"The Man On the Flying Trapeze.\" They \n                         are huddled together, and accompanied \n                         by a man who plays a guitar. Then the \n                         view continues moving until it reaches \n                         Peter and Ellie who join in the song, \n                         and a close-up of ELLIE shows her eyes \n                         sparkling as she sings gaily.\n                                      \n                         SHAPELEY looks back at Ellie, and apparently \n                         comes to the conclusion that his suspicions \n                         are correct, for he quickly folds the \n                         newspaper, casting a surreptitious glance \n                         around to make certain he is not being \n                         watched.

Then a close view of ELLIE \n                         appears, and at the moment she looks \n                         far removed from the spoiled, pampered, \n                         self-reliant brat of Alexander Andrews. \n                         Instead, she is a helpless baby, clinging \n                         to Peter's protective wing. She'd be \n                         ever so grateful right now for a little \n                         civility on his part, for a little tenderness \n                         and understanding, and she glances over \n                         at him, hopefully. PETER, however, stares \n                         up at the stars, dreamily; and we then \n                         see ELLIE turning away from him, disappointed. \n                         Still, the minute Ellie turns her head, \n                         Peter looks at her out of the corner \n                         of his eye, and it's a long and steady \n                         gaze. Then suddenly he gets an idea \n                         and rises. He finds his topcoat and \n                         goes to her.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         Might get chilly later on.\n                                     \n                         (he spreads it over her)\n                                     \n                         Better use this.\n                                     \n                         As he bends down to tuck her in, their \n                         faces are seen in close proximity. Ellie, \n                         tremulous and fearful, has her eyes \n                         peeled on him. The situation is imminent \n                         with danger; anything is likely to happen \n                         at this moment; and she is frightened \n                         and expectant\u0097she knows how weak she \n                         would be, if he suddenly crushed her \n                         in his arms. Peter avoids her gaze. \n                         He, too, is a bit shaky. The temptation \n                         is there and his resistance is waning. \n                         He tucks her in and quickly turns away. \n                         Ellie's eyes, however, never leave him. \n                         Immediate danger has vanished, and it \n                         leaves her a little regretful.\n                                      \n                         A close view of PETER, as he walks over \n                         to a rock and sits down, shows him nervously \n                         taking out a cigarette and lighting \n                         it.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         You've had a lot of men crazy about \n                         you, haven't you?\n                                      \n                         ELLIE doesn't respond. She has the scrutinizing, \n                         speculative look of a girl who feels \n                         herself falling in love with someone \n                         who is practically a stranger to her, \n                         as a result of which she is\n                                      \n                         ? 278 ?\n                                     \n                         frightened. Then a wider view includes \n                         both of them and we see that Peter, \n                         too, fights valiantly against a mounting \n                         interest in this girl, who epitomizes \n                         everything he dislikes. He creates the \n                         impression in the following scene that \n                         in his analysis of her he is trying \n                         to dissuade himself from something he \n                         is bound to regret.

Peter removes several things \n                         from his suitcase and lays them on the \n                         bed. There is a strained silence between \n                         them, as both are lost in their own \n                         thoughts. A close view of PETER as he \n                         putters abstractedly with the contents \n                         of his bag creates the impression that \n                         he empties it tonight rather ruefully. \n                         It somehow spells finis to their adventure.\n \n                                                              \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (strangely)\n                                     \n                         Tomorrow morning, you'll be in the arms \n                         of your husband.\n                                      \n                         ELLIE (seen close) turns away from the \n                         window and looks at Peter.

The noise of the tacking \n                         attracts Ellie's attention, and Ellie \n                         (again seen close) turns and looks toward \n                         Peter.\n                                      \n                         ELLIE\n                                     \n                         Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?\n \n                                                              \n                         PETER'S VOICE\n                                     \n                         Yep!

All \n                         is quiet for a moment as Ellie's head \n                         rests on his breast, while Peter struggles \n                         with an overwhelming urge to pour out \n                         his heart to her.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (scarcely audible)\n                                     \n                         Better go back to your bed.\n                                     \n                         There is a lengthy pause, neither of \n                         them stirs. Then Ellie slowly raises \n                         her tear-stained face and gets to her \n                         feet.\n                                      \n                         ELLIE\n                                     \n                         (whispering)\n                                     \n                         I'm sorry.\n                                     \n                         She turns and disappears behind the \n                         blanket. Peter remains motionless. Then \n                         a close view shows Ellie, as she gets \n                         into bed, sobbing quietly. She hides \n                         her face in the pillow to suppress her \n                         sobs. It is the first time in her life \n                         that she has been so deeply hurt. A \n                         close view next shows Peter reaching \n                         over for a cigarette, which he lights. \n                         All his movements are thoughtful, meditative. \n                         He leans back and stares at the ceiling, \n                         until we see only the cigarette in his \n                         mouth as it emits slowly rising puffs \n                         of smoke. This dissolving, the cigarette \n                         is seen to be burnt three quarters down, \n                         a long, frail ash hanging perilously \n                         on. Peter is then seen as he removes \n                         the cigarette from his mouth and crushes \n                         it in a tray. He leans back on the pillow \n                         and for a moment he is quiet. Then glancing \n                         over in Ellie's direction, he calls \n                         to her:\n                                      \n                         ? 294 ?\n                                     \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (softly calling)\n                                     \n                         Hey, Brat\u0097!\n                                     \n                         (a pause)\n                                     \n                         Did you mean that? Would you really \n                         go?\n                                      \n                         (he waits for a response, but none comes. \n                         He tries again)\n                                      \n                         Hey, Brat\u0097\n                                     \n                         He listens\u0097all is quiet. He slips his \n                         covers off and crosses to the blanket, \n                         and peers over it. She is asleep. Her \n                         tear-stained face rests on the pillow, \n                         her arm extends over her head. It is \n                         a childlike posture.\n                                      \n                         PETER is watching her tenderly. He speculates \n                         whether to awaken her and decides against \n                         it. He starts away. Peter tiptoes around \n                         the room for a few moments, deep in \n                         thought. Then as an idea which he has \n                         been turning over in his mind begins \n                         to take form, he hastily begins dressing.\n \n                                                              \n                         The scene dissolving, Peter is seen \n                         completely clothed and starting for \n                         the door when he thinks of something. \n                         He turns back, grabs his suitcase, stops \n                         to throw a kiss to Ellie, and goes out \n                         into the night. Thereupon the scene \n                         wipes off, disclosing a Gas Station \n                         along the road at night. Here Peter \n                         is talking to a station attendant.\n \n                                                              \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         All I'm asking is enough gas to get \n                         me to New York.

He \n                         is accompanied by King Westley\u0097Henderson\u0097Lovington, \n                         and a police inspector.\n                                      \n                         HENDERSON\n                                     \n                         I knew she was safe.\n                                     \n                         LOVINGTON\n                                     \n                         (sighing)\n                                     \n                         Certainly gave us a run for our money.\n \n                                                              \n                         (but Andrews is too overwhelmed with \n                         joy to listen to any of this)\n                                      \n                         ANDREWS\n                                     \n                         (anxiously)\n                                     \n                         Can't you get them to go any faster?\n \n                                                              \n                         (at this the Inspector leans over to \n                         talk to chauffeur)\n                                      \n                         This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter \n                         at the wheel of his car. His high spirits \n                         find expression in his efforts to sing.\n \n                                                              \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (singing)\n                                     \n                         \"I found a million dollar baby\u0097\"\n                                     \n                         He is interrupted by the song of a meadowlark, \n                         whistling its strange melody. Peter \n                         listens to it a second time, then answers \n                         its call by imitating it. The meadowlark \n                         whistles again, and peter is highly \n                         amused.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (waving his hand\u0097to the meadowlark)\n \n                                                              \n                         Okay, pal.

Peter glances back, \n                         and as the sirens come nearer, he pulls \n                         over to the side of the road. There \n                         follows a full view of the ROAD, with \n                         peter in the foreground at the side \n                         as the police cavalcade whizzes by accompanied \n                         by the shrieking sirens. Thereupon PETER \n                         (seen close) gets an idea.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (to his Ford)\n                                     \n                         Come on, Dobbin, old boy.

It outdistances \n                         him, however, and we see PETER in the \n                         Ford pressing his body forward to help \n                         the car make time. His foot pushes the \n                         accelerator down to the floor. But the \n                         police cars are now out of sight, and \n                         Peter gives up.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (seen close; to the car\u0097with exaggerated \n                         dramatics)\n                                      \n                         Dobbin, me lad. You failed muh.

Several yokels look on. The limousine \n                         and motor cycles are at the curb. And \n                         now, in a closer view, at the DOOR the \n                         policeman on guard steps aside as the \n                         door opens and Ellie, her father, and \n                         King Westley emerge. King has his arm \n                         around her. The moment they appear in \n                         the doorway, cameras click and several \n                         reporters surround them.\n                                      \n                         REPORTERS\n                                     \n                         Will you make a statement Miss Andrews? \n                         Was it an exciting experience?

He is, however, \n                         as before, in excellent form, and is \n                         singing lustily. Suddenly, however, \n                         his eyes widen and he pulls on his brake; \n                         the car screeches and moans\u0097and comes \n                         to a stop.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         Take it easy, Dobbin. Remember your \n                         blood pressure.\n                                      \n                         We find Peter directly in front of a \n                         slow moving freight train. Several hoboes \n                         stick their heads out of a car, and \n                         Peter waves to them. The hoboes look \n                         puzzled for a minute and then wave back. \n                         The view then swings over to an opening \n                         between the cars affording a flash of \n                         the police parade on the other side, \n                         apparently on its way back.\n                                      \n                         PETER amuses himself by talking to an \n                         old flagman.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         Better get that toy train out of here. \n                         I'm in a hurry.\n                                      \n                         The Flagman grins at him in reply. By \n                         this time the last car is in sight, \n                         and Peter gets all set to move. He stops, \n                         however, to wave to a couple of brakemen \n                         on the rear platform.\n                                      \n                         In the meantime, the motorcycles have \n                         started forward, and the sirens begin \n                         their low, moaning wail. Peter, attracted, \n                         turns, and over Peter's shoulder we \n                         see the parade starting. As the limousine\n \n                                                              \n                         ? 305 ?\n                                     \n                         passes, we get a glimpse of the inside. \n                         Ellie lies back on King Westley's shoulder. \n                         He has his arm around her as they pass \n                         out of sight. Thereupon a close view \n                         of PETER shows him reacting to what \n                         he saw. He turns his head quickly to \n                         stare at the disappearing car, a look \n                         of astonishment and bewilderment in \n                         his eyes. Slowly he turns his head forward, \n                         staring ahead of him blankly; he can't \n                         quite make it out. Then gradually the \n                         significance of it all strikes him\u0097and \n                         his mouth curls up bitterly.\n                                      \n                         The scene wiping off, a series of NEWSPAPER \n                         HEADLINES come into view:\n                                      \n                         \"ELLEN ANDREWS RETURNS HOME.\"\n                                     \n                         \"MARRIAGE HALTED BY FATHER TO BE RESUMED\"\n \n                                                              \n                         \"ELLEN ANDREWS AND AVIATOR TO HAVE CHURCH \n                         WEDDING\"\n                                      \n                         \"LOVE TRIUMPHS AGAIN\"\n                                     \n                         \"PARENTAL OBJECTION REMOVED IN FAVOR \n                         OF LOVERS\"\n                                      \n                         \"CANNOT THWART LOVE SAYS FATHER OF ELLEN \n                         ANDREWS\"\n                                      \n                         \"GLAD TO BE HOME SAYS ELLEN\"\n                                     \n                         This dissolves to the anteroom of a \n                         NEWSPAPER OFFICE.

The title over the picture \n                         reads: \"Where they met.\" The second \n                         picture shows them in the cockpit of \n                         a plane, the heading reading: \"Where \n                         they romanced.\" The next picture is \n                         of a small frame house with a shingle \n                         on it reading: \"Justice of the Peace.\" \n                         Over the photograph is a caption: \"Where \n                         they were married.\" The next picture \n                         is of the Andrews Yacht, and the title \n                         reads: \"Where she was taken.\" Finally, \n                         the view moves down to the bottom of \n                         the page to a picture of Ellie and King, \n                         with her father between them, in front \n                         of Sheriff's office. Caption reads: \n                         \"Where love triumphed.\" Over these pictures \n                         the phone bell has been ringing.\n                                      \n                         And now PETER is seen staring, expressionless, \n                         at the newspaper. Suddenly he becomes \n                         conscious of the phone ringing; he looks \n                         up\u0097then goes to it.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (into the phone)\n                                     \n                         Hello . . .

May \n                         be gone several weeks. Thought perhaps \n                         you'd like to get this thing settled.\n \n                                                              \n                         This cuts to the HOTEL ROOM where PETER \n                         is at the phone.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking \n                         in on your jamboree . . . Just between \n                         you and me\u0097those things give me a stiff \n                         pain.\n                                      \n                         ANDREWS\n                                     \n                         (seen in his office)\n                                     \n                         You needn't see anybody. You can come \n                         directly to my study. I'd appreciate \n                         it very much if\u0097\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (at his phone)\n                                     \n                         No\u0097no. What the deuce do I want to\u0097\n \n                                                              \n                         His eyes fall on something, and there \n                         follows a close view of a tabloid newspaper, \n                         featuring the heading: \"Love Triumphant\" \n                         and containing the pictures of Ellie \n                         and King. The view then moves down to \n                         feature headline reading \"Groom to Land \n                         on Bride's Lawn.\"\n                                      \n                         \"King Westley plans to drop in an autogyro \n                         on the lawn of Andrews estate . . .\"\n \n                                                              \n                         Peter's mouth screws up disdainfully.\n \n                                                              \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (into the phone)\n                                     \n                         Yeah, wait a minute. Maybe I will come \n                         over. I'd like to get a load of that \n                         three-ring circus you're pulling. I \n                         want to see what love looks like when \n                         it's triumphant. I haven't had a good \n                         laugh in a week.\n                                      \n                         (he is still at the phone as the scene \n                         dissolves)\n                                      \n                         Then the LAWN of the ANDREWS ESTATE \n                         dissolves in. It is now filled with \n                         guests, who wander around, chattering \n                         gaily. The orchestra plays. A captain \n                         of waiters in the foreground instructs \n                         his men.\n                                      \n                         CAPTAIN\n                                     \n                         I want everything to be just so. When \n                         the ceremony starts, you stand on the \n                         side\u0097still . No moving around\u0097no talking, \n                         comprenez ?\n                                      \n                         The view cuts to a ROADWAY leading to \n                         the estate, and Peter is seen driving \n                         up in his Ford and squeezing in between \n                         two Rolls-Royces. The uniformed chauffeurs \n                         glare at him. But Peter springs nonchalantly \n                         out of his car.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (blithely, as he passes them)\n                                     \n                         Keep your eye on my car when you're \n                         backing up, you guys.\n                                      \n                         And as he goes, the chauffeurs look \n                         at each other, surprised. The scene \n                         dissolves to ANDREWS' STUDY, where a \n                         butler stands in front of Andrews who \n                         is seated at his desk.\n                                      \n                         ? 318 ?\n                                     \n                         ANDREWS\n                                     \n                         Show him in.\n                                     \n                         The Butler leaving, a close view shows \n                         ANDREWS reaching over and snapping on \n                         a dictograph concealed somewhere on \n                         his desk. The office coming into view \n                         again, we see Andrews rising and awaiting \n                         Peter's entrance. After a moment Peter \n                         comes in, removes his soft felt hat, \n                         and tucks it under his arm.\n                                      \n                         ANDREWS\n                                     \n                         Mr. Warne?\n                                     \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         Yeah.\n                                     \n                         ANDREWS\n                                     \n                         Come in. Sit down.\n                                     \n                         Peter advances into the room, looking \n                         around curiously. His air is frigid, \n                         contemptuous as Andrews studies him, \n                         and he makes no move to sit. Andrews \n                         waves to a chair and sits down himself. \n                         Peter flops into the nearest chair.\n \n                                                              \n                         ANDREWS\n                                     \n                         (seen close with Peter; after a pause)\n \n                                                              \n                         I was surprised to get your note. My \n                         daughter hadn't told me anything about \n                         you. About your helping her.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         That's typical of your daughter.

She \n                         thinks you're entitled to anything you \n                         can get.\n                                      \n                         PETER\n                                     \n                         (bitterly)\n                                     \n                         Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet \n                         of her!

The orchestra is playing \n                         Mendelssohn's Wedding March. The lawn \n                         is crowded with guests. In the background \n                         we see the autogyro idling. A closer \n                         view shows a small platform, serving \n                         as an altar. Over it there is an arbor \n                         of roses. Back of the altar stands a \n                         minister, ready. A reverse view reveals \n                         a long, narrow, carpeted pathway leading \n                         to the house. Both sides are lined with \n                         guests, who are murmuring excitedly. \n                         At the moment, King Westley and his \n                         best man are marching solemnly toward \n                         the altar. Back of the altar we see \n                         a high platform upon which are several \n                         newsreel men who are grinding their \n                         cameras.\n                                      \n                         The guests, of whom close glimpses are \n                         caught, are now peering over each other's \n                         shoulders. King and his best man have \n                         reached the altar, and the music of \n                         the wedding march comes to a stop. The \n                         orchestra leader is looking around, \n                         apparently waiting for a signal. At \n                         the DOOR of the HOUSE a very \"prissy\" \n                         middle-aged man waves his handkerchief \n                         and nods his head to the orchestra leader. \n                         The orchestra leader acknowledges the \n                         signal by nodding his head\u0097turns to \n                         his men\u0097waves his baton, and the orchestra \n                         starts playing, \"Here Comes the Bride.\"\u0097The \n                         guests whisper to each other excitedly. \n                         A great deal of stirring takes place.\n \n                                                              \n                         The door of the house slowly opens\u0097and \n                         a parade of small flower girls emerges. \n                         They march, taking each step carefully, \n                         while they strew flowers along the path. \n                         They are well out of the way when Ellie, \n                         on the arm of her father, appears in \n                         the doorway. A view of the guests shows \n                         that they cannot contain themselves. \n                         Murmurs of \"Here she comes,\" and \"Doesn't \n                         she look beautiful?\" are heard.
