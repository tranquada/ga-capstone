SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          Malee stands outside Mr. Farmer's office, staring at the SIGN\n          UP SHEET on his door. After a beat, she lifts her pen to\n          sign her name. Before she writes it, she stops, quickly\n          turns around and walks away.\n          \n          After a beat, Malee returns to the sign up sheet and starts\n          writing her name. Halfway through, she stops, scratches out\n          her name and walks off.\n          \n          We remain on the sign up sheet. After a few seconds, Malee's\n          hand enters the shot and writes in her name.\n          \n          INT.
