GOTHIC CHURCH  10:00 A.M.  ST. PATRICK'S DAY\n</b>\n<b>               DOWNTOWN BOSTON\n</b>\n               As we open we see the inside of an enormous church. A young \n               looking PRIEST in his mid-thirties is finishing the delivery \n               of the Lord\u0092s Prayer. In the back of the church, in the last \n               pew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor.\n\n               They do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace \n               when told, but they pray. They grip and rub their rosaries. \n               They mutter their words in Latin.\n\n               CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (mid-twenties) are shrouded in \n               thick waist length navy P-coats, worn leather boots and the \n               hungry clothes of the poor. The boys heads are shaved and \n               they have facial hair.\n\n<b>                                     MONSIGNOR\n</b>                              (dismissing young \n                              priest)\n                         Thank you Father Macklepenny, for \n                         coming all the way across town to be \n                         our guest speaker today. I hope you \n                         found our little parish to your \n                         liking.\n\n               Macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular \n               priests of the church. The MacManus brothers suddenly stand, \n               as all others remain seated. Each church goer between them \n               and the aisle shifts his/her position to allow the boys \n               passage, as if on command. The two turn and begin to stride \n               for the alter, eyes down, determined.\n\n<b>                                     ANNABELLE MACMANUS (V.O.)\n</b>                              (thick Irish accent)\n                         They've never been like anyone else. \n                         From the moment they were born, of \n                         the same womb, on the same day, they \n                         just had their own way, my boys did. \n                         And I always knew that one day they \n                         would do something of true greatness. \n                         I just never expected they would \n                         bring about such a... such a \n                         reckoning.\n\n               The MacManus brothers are fraternal twins. As Annabelle \n               MacManus speaks, Macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the \n               congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks \n               this out of the ordinary.\n\n               The monsignor begins his sermon. Macklepenny rises to stop \n               the boys from this disgraceful disturbance.\n\n               The elder clergyman finds Macklepenny's arm, keeping him \n               seated while shaking his head. Macklepenny's confusion gives \n               way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar, \n               brush by the six seated priests, and approach the enormous \n               crucifix.\n\n               They both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of Christ. \n               They rise and as abruptly as they came, they turn and head \n               back down the aisle for the front door. They stop at the \n               rear of the church, turning to listen to the sermon.\n\n<b>                                     MONSIGNOR\n</b>                              (loud, authoritative)\n                         ...and I am reminded of this holy \n                         day of the sad story of Kitty \n                         Geneviese. This poor soul cried out \n                         time and time again for help but no \n                         person answered her calls. Though \n                         many saw, not one so much as called. \n                         Her assailant wiped the bloody knife \n                         off on her lifeless little body. \n                         They watched as he simply walked \n                         away. Nobody wanted to get involved. \n                         Nobody wanted to take a stand... We \n                         must fear evil men and deal with \n                         them accordingly but what we must \n                         truly guard against, what we must \n                         fear most\n                              (beat)\n                         Is the indifference of good men.\n\n               The MacManuses turn and walk out the door.\n\n<b>               EXT. CHURCH STEPS  SUNNY MORNING\n</b>\n               The boys put on their dark glasses and pause at the top of \n               the steps to light up their cigarettes. They both roll their \n               cigarette butts along their tongues and screw them into their \n               lips. In this unique way they light up, seemingly oblivious \n               to their synchronicity and mimic.\n\n<b>                                     CONNOR\n</b>                              (Irish accent)\n                         I do believe the Monsignor finally \n                         got a point.\n\n<b>                                     MURPHY\n</b>                              (Irish accent)\n                         Aye.\n\n               They leave.\n\n<b>               INT.

SAME DAY\n</b>\n               Murphy, wearing a white blood soaked smock and apron stands \n               around the corner of the entrance to the loading dock. He \n               grips a gigantic, bloody slab of meat and smirks. Connor \n               flips his cigarette out the loading dock and passes his \n               brother's hiding place. He notices the workers have stopped, \n               and are looking at him.\n\n<b>                                     CONNOR\n</b>                         What?\n\n               Murphy slaps Connor square in the face with the bloody slab.\n\n               Connor's face is caked with blood as he stands stunned. He \n               then leaps on Murphy, sending him into a pile of nearby \n               hamburger. He grabs a large cow tongue from a nearby heap \n               and begins slapping Murphy in the face with it as they both \n               laugh and the workers cheer.\n\n               Their boss, McGERKIN approaches with a very large woman.\n\n               Her head is clean-shaven.

He is impeccably dressed in a deep \n               red suit. He is smiling, confident as he walks. He is a very \n               good-looking, slender man.\n\n               He looks intently, for a moment, at four uniformed officers.\n\n               They approach two dead bodies, laying next to a dented green \n               dumpster with half the paint job scraped off.\n\n               One man, IVAN CHECKOV, lays on his stomach, closer to the \n               dumpster than the other. The ass of his pants has been burnt \n               out and a large cotton bandage is in its place.\n\n               The other, VLADDY, has a blood soaked bandage around his \n               head and is on his stomach as well. There are hundreds of \n               pieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere. Three plain-\n               clothed homicide detectives, DUFFY, DOLLY and GREENLY hover \n               close to the bodies. Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY, an \n               obvious rookie, give his over-confident theory of what took \n               place.\n\n               The chief is about to interrupt them, but Smecker holds him \n               back with a smile.

Ivan positions Connor on his knees before \n               the toilet, which is open to the room. Checkov puts his foot \n               on Connor's head and proceeds, as he struggles, to hand cuff \n               him to the old toilet.

Murphy screams\n\n<b>               EXT. ALLEY  MORNING\n</b>\n               (slo-mo) Checkov begins to laugh heartily.

His gun goes off, punching a hole in the dumpster near \n               the bottom. Vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns \n               to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits.\n\n               Connor lands squarely on Vladdy's back. His gun discharges \n               firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. He is \n               savagely crushed against the ground. Connor bounces off and \n               hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious.\n\n               Murphy takes his hands from his head. There is dead silence.\n\n               He runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks \n               his vital signs. He seems okay.

They stand on the \n               sidewalk and light smokes. They are in their regular garb; \n               thick naval P-coats, jeans and leather boots. They each carry \n               a mid-sized, black, duffle bag. They are serious and business-\n               like. They scan the Plaza Hotel from across the street.

The \n               other gives a one word Russian response. They boys look at \n               each other. As the elevator climbs, their eyes focus.\n\n               The door opens. As the men exit the elevator, each face is \n               seen individually, all are victims from Smecker's crime scene.\n\n               The elevator goes up half a floor. They hit the stop button \n               and rummage in their bags. They suit up; black gloves and \n               black masks. They strap on four 9mm. pistols with silencers, \n               in shoulder holsters, one under each arm. Connor takes a \n               large coil of black rope and drapes it around himself. He \n               looks at Murphy and at the rope in his bag. Murphy is too \n               excited to argue.\n\n<b>                                     MURPHY\n</b>                         You and your fucking rope.\n\n               He puts it on.

An occasional \n               insult is thrown as feet kick and fists fly. They begin to \n               get tangled in their own rope. The seam of the duct breaks \n               and a tangled mess of rope and MacManuses pour out.\n\n<b>               INT.

The rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt, \n               hanging them upside down, back to back about six feet above \n               the floor. They are turning in circles. The boss is balled \n               up in the fetal position on the floor. The shocked Russians \n               say only a word or two in panic before the MacManus brothers \n               react, reaching for their guns.

Taking four shots apiece.\n\n               There are eight dead Russians. Chests explode as they fall \n               back on the couch in a loose circle. One victims is blasted \n               over the couch.\n\n               They notice the fat man directly beneath them. Murphy grabs \n               his Rambo knife, reaches up and cuts the rope. They land in\n\n               a heap, scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his \n               knees.

(Slo-mo) Choral music starts with \n               Latin script being read in the background. They take their \n               rosaries out. They slowly walk around, mumbling prayers as \n               they care for the dead. They gently turn over the bodies \n               that were on their stomachs. They brush the hair back from \n               the victims faces. They place pennies in the eyes of al the \n               corpses. When they finish their ritual, they pull off their \n               masks and look at each other. They start to grin and look \n               around.

Murphy sees his \n               opportunity, pulls the cue ball from the table, and rolls it \n               silently across the carpet toward Rocco.\n\n               Connor fires with his left hand and as the casing ejects \n               from the gun he catches it in mid air and makes the sign of \n               the cross. Rocco is on his back, the man is straddling him.\n\n               They both have each others throats and are trying to strangle \n               one another. When the ball is within arms reach, Rocco slams \n               his hand down on it and knocks his assailant in the skull.\n\n               He straddles him and begins to mercilessly beat his face in \n               with the cue ball, yelling \"You sick fuck!\"\n\n               He finally stops, gets up, runs toward the boys, and throws \n               an exhausted punch at Connor who just lays Roc down on the \n               pool table and says, \"Nicely done, boy\". Murphy tends to \n               Roc.

They grope each \n               other and Smecker cleverly avoids any contact with his crotch. \n               Smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and \n               seductively touch himself. Geno stands over him, straddling \n               Smecker's hips as he undoes his pants. Suddenly, Smecker \n               grabs both of Geno's ankles and has him locked in position. \n               He repeatedly kicks Geno in the balls from his lying position \n               on the floor.

He thoughtlessly blows Chappy away as he passes \n               his position and runs down a long hallway. He turns a corner \n               and points his gun at the Mafioso cohort but pauses.\n\n               He is already sitting with his throat cut.

They are gently placing \n               pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the \n               prayer. As they speak, Il Duce watches. He then begins to \n               whisper the prayer right along with them. Their words match \n               up perfectly. He leans against the wall, holsters his guns, \n               and withdraws a cigarette.\n\n               He rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips.\n\n               The boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. They react \n               instantly. Still kneeling they each point a nickel-plated 45 \n               toward The Duke. They turn in time to see the light from the \n               match illuminate his face. Il Duce pauses then he strides \n               into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the \n               prayer.\n\n               He stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the \n               prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their \n               father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he \n               looks down to the upturned faces of his sons.
