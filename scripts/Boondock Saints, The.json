GOTHIC CHURCH  10:00 A.M.  ST. PATRICK'S DAY\n\n               DOWNTOWN BOSTON\n\n               As we open we see the inside of an enormous church. A young \n               looking PRIEST in his mid-thirties is finishing the delivery \n               of the Lord\u0092s Prayer. In the back of the church, in the last \n               pew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor.\n\n               They do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace \n               when told, but they pray. They grip and rub their rosaries. \n               They mutter their words in Latin.\n\n               CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (mid-twenties) are shrouded in \n               thick waist length navy P-coats, worn leather boots and the \n               hungry clothes of the poor. The boys heads are shaved and \n               they have facial hair.\n\n                                     MONSIGNOR\n                              (dismissing young \n                              priest)\n                         Thank you Father Macklepenny, for \n                         coming all the way across town to be \n                         our guest speaker today. I hope you \n                         found our little parish to your \n                         liking.\n\n               Macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular \n               priests of the church. The MacManus brothers suddenly stand, \n               as all others remain seated. Each church goer between them \n               and the aisle shifts his/her position to allow the boys \n               passage, as if on command. The two turn and begin to stride \n               for the alter, eyes down, determined.\n\n                                     ANNABELLE MACMANUS (V.O.)\n                              (thick Irish accent)\n                         They've never been like anyone else. \n                         From the moment they were born, of \n                         the same womb, on the same day, they \n                         just had their own way, my boys did. \n                         And I always knew that one day they \n                         would do something of true greatness. \n                         I just never expected they would \n                         bring about such a... such a \n                         reckoning.\n\n               The MacManus brothers are fraternal twins. As Annabelle \n               MacManus speaks, Macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the \n               congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks \n               this out of the ordinary.\n\n               The monsignor begins his sermon. Macklepenny rises to stop \n               the boys from this disgraceful disturbance.\n\n               The elder clergyman finds Macklepenny's arm, keeping him \n               seated while shaking his head. Macklepenny's confusion gives \n               way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar, \n               brush by the six seated priests, and approach the enormous \n               crucifix.\n\n               They both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of Christ. \n               They rise and as abruptly as they came, they turn and head \n               back down the aisle for the front door. They stop at the \n               rear of the church, turning to listen to the sermon.\n\n                                     MONSIGNOR\n                              (loud, authoritative)\n                         ...and I am reminded of this holy \n                         day of the sad story of Kitty \n                         Geneviese. This poor soul cried out \n                         time and time again for help but no \n                         person answered her calls. Though \n                         many saw, not one so much as called. \n                         Her assailant wiped the bloody knife \n                         off on her lifeless little body. \n                         They watched as he simply walked \n                         away. Nobody wanted to get involved. \n                         Nobody wanted to take a stand... We \n                         must fear evil men and deal with \n                         them accordingly but what we must \n                         truly guard against, what we must \n                         fear most\n                              (beat)\n                         Is the indifference of good men.\n\n               The MacManuses turn and walk out the door.\n\n               EXT. CHURCH STEPS  SUNNY MORNING\n\n               The boys put on their dark glasses and pause at the top of \n               the steps to light up their cigarettes. They both roll their \n               cigarette butts along their tongues and screw them into their \n               lips. In this unique way they light up, seemingly oblivious \n               to their synchronicity and mimic.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                              (Irish accent)\n                         I do believe the Monsignor finally \n                         got a point.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                              (Irish accent)\n                         Aye.\n\n               They leave.\n\n               INT. NOLAND'S MEAT PACKING PLANT  4:00 P.M.  SAME DAY\n\n               Murphy, wearing a white blood soaked smock and apron stands \n               around the corner of the entrance to the loading dock. He \n               grips a gigantic, bloody slab of meat and smirks. Connor \n               flips his cigarette out the loading dock and passes his \n               brother's hiding place. He notices the workers have stopped, \n               and are looking at him.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         What?\n\n               Murphy slaps Connor square in the face with the bloody slab.\n\n               Connor's face is caked with blood as he stands stunned. He \n               then leaps on Murphy, sending him into a pile of nearby \n               hamburger. He grabs a large cow tongue from a nearby heap \n               and begins slapping Murphy in the face with it as they both \n               laugh and the workers cheer.\n\n               Their boss, McGERKIN approaches with a very large woman.\n\n               Her head is clean-shaven. The two are still laughing, out of \n               breath, they turn.\n\n                                     MCGERKIN\n                         Boys this is Rose, Baum, Gurtle... \n                         Gurtle.\n\n                                     ROZ\n                         Rozengurtle Baumgartner.\n\n                                     MCGERKIN\n                         You'll be training her today, and do \n                         a good job.\n\n                                     BOTH BOYS\n                         Aye.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                              (wipes hand and extends \n                              it)\n                         Pleased ta meet ya Rozie.\n\n               She points to a tattoo on her neck that reads untouched by \n               man.\n\n                                     ROZ\n                         I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by \n                         men.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                              (taken aback)\n                         Okay then... let's get ya started.\n\n               Connor exits with Roz.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Christ, that's the largest woman \n                         I've ever seen.\n\n                                     MCGERKIN\n                         It's self-imposed affirmative action. \n                         If we hire big, fat, angry lesbians, \n                         then the leftist groups representing \n                         big, fat angry lesbians, won't think \n                         we're violating their rights.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Well, how politically correct you \n                         are.

The two naked, \n               hysterical boys fumble for the phone, flailing on their \n               stomachs in the field of ice.

AN ALLEY  MORNING\n\n               PAUL SMECKER, F.B.I. agent, is lead by the Boston Chief of \n               Police through a jungle of ravenous reporters, police lines \n               and uniformed officers. He is impeccably dressed in a deep \n               red suit. He is smiling, confident as he walks. He is a very \n               good-looking, slender man.\n\n               He looks intently, for a moment, at four uniformed officers.\n\n               They approach two dead bodies, laying next to a dented green \n               dumpster with half the paint job scraped off.\n\n               One man, IVAN CHECKOV, lays on his stomach, closer to the \n               dumpster than the other. The ass of his pants has been burnt \n               out and a large cotton bandage is in its place.\n\n               The other, VLADDY, has a blood soaked bandage around his \n               head and is on his stomach as well. There are hundreds of \n               pieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere. Three plain-\n               clothed homicide detectives, DUFFY, DOLLY and GREENLY hover \n               close to the bodies. Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY, an \n               obvious rookie, give his over-confident theory of what took \n               place.\n\n               The chief is about to interrupt them, but Smecker holds him \n               back with a smile. The two wait and watch in a position, \n               where the unsuspecting detectives have their backs to them.\n\n                                     GREENLY\n                              (thick Boston accent)\n                         ...so these guys are just kickin' \n                         the shit out of each other. This guy \n                              (points to Vladdy)\n                         Picks up an old kitchen sink that \n                         some one threw out and crushes this \n                         guy \n                              (Checkov)\n                         With it. All right, so it makes a \n                         big bang and alerts their friend, \n                         who's standin' look out around the \n                         corner. So he comes over and gets \n                         into it with this guy, \n                              (Vladdy)\n                         He's angry at him, right? They get \n                         into an altercation in which the \n                         look out guy crushes this guy by \n                         jumpin on him. And look at the damage \n                         here.\n                              (Vladdy)\n                         I mean this guy's fuckin' hamburger \n                         man. His spine is crushed. He's all \n                         twisted and shit. That guy had to be \n                         one big mother fucker. Huge, 3-400 \n                         pounds, fuckin huge.\n\n               Smecker listens.\n\n               The Chief is embarrassed.\n\n                                     GREELY\n                         Or, okay. Check this out. Say these \n                         two don't even know the huge guy. \n                         They're just staggerin' home from a \n                         bar this morning, still all fucked \n                         up from St. Patty's last night. So \n                         they figure they'll take a short cut \n                         down the alley and this big mother \n                         fucker, he's just waitin'. And what \n                         could be more perfect for strong arm \n                         robbery? Two drunk guys all bandaged \n                         up. They're already injured for Christ \n                         sakes. He takes a blunt object and \n                         whacks the guy with the bandage on \n                         his head, right? Cause he's smart. \n                         He knows the guy with the bandage on \n                         his ass, he ain't going nowhere. \n                         Matter of fact, this guy's probably \n                         helping his friend with the rectal \n                         problem along. They're limping around \n                         like a couple of decrepit old broads. \n                         So once this guy's out of the picture\n                              (denotes Vladdy)\n                         this poor asshole, he tries to run. \n                         But look how far he gets fore the \n                         huge bastard catches up with him. \n                         Only a few yards. And what does he \n                         do? He gets creative. He picks up a \n                         sink and crushes the poor mother-\n                         fucker. Then, he ain't done yet. He \n                         comes over here, jumps on this guy's \n                         back and crushes him to death.\n                              (Vladdy)\n                         He steals their shit and beats it! \n                         Thanks for comin' out!\n                              (beat)\n                         And look at this print...\n\n               Greenly points out a large foot print on Vladdy's back.\n\n               Some detectives nod in agreement.

The choir song \"Agnus dei\" overtakes. He begins to \n               investigate. He kneels at the bodies for a moment then stares \n               at the opposite brick wall. He picks up a piece of porcelain \n               and scrapes it with his thumb.\n\n               He quickly cocks his head toward the sky and begins to chuckle \n               as he says Jesus Christ, under his breath. He brushes some \n               paraffin on each of the dead men's hands. Duffy and Dolly \n               watch defiantly. They start to smile at one another as they \n               collectively realize his homosexuality.

Two nuns in the corner console a third, whose robes \n               are ripped and face is beaten. A woman toward the end of the \n               hall is so badly beaten she is unrecognizable.\n\n               As the song builds to a more harrowing chorus, a man enters.\n\n               His clothes suggest he's a pimp. He is not injured. He looks \n               around as he stands, perturbed, at the end of the hall.\n\n               He reaches over and grabs the beat up woman by the hair and \n               begins to drag her out. She is kicking and screaming from \n               the floor, grabbing at his wrists as he hauls her away.\n\n               (Slo-mo) The boys, instantly furious, stand and begin to go \n               toward the action, but Connor's legs give out on him and he \n               falls to the floor. Connor, still trying to go after the \n               pimp, crawls towards him.

All we \n                         know is what we found out from their \n                         neighbors. And the general consensus \n                         is that they're... angels.\n                              (pause)\n                         But angels don't kill and we got two \n                         bodies in the morgue that look like \n                         they've been...\n\n               Smecker looks to Greenly.

All the \n               officers are seated with their backs to them. Smecker and \n               the brothers make eye contact. He knows who they are. They \n               don't interrupt Greenly.\n\n                                     GREENLY\n                         But if you want to beat your head \n                         against a wall, then here's what you \n                         look for.

Mitchell enters \n               with coffee for them. He shakes their hands and says he really \n               respects what they did. Surprised, they thank him.

Just then, three large Russians in \n               suits enter. The obvious leader, CHECKOV, stands in front \n               with VLADDY behind one of Checkov's shoulders, with another \n               guy behind the other shoulder. They mean business. The \n               laughter fades.\n\n                                     CHECKOV\n                              (thick Russian accent)\n                         I am Ivan Checkov.

I would never drink \n                         that sewage. Especially with you \n                         people. You are fools.\n\n               Checkov slaps the beer to the floor.\n\n                                     CHECKOV\n                         This is no game!

He's had enough.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                              (standing between the \n                              two brothers)\n                         Hey, there Boris.

He is quickly down and \n               out. Connor and Murphy's faces turn to stone as they speak \n               the next few lines in flawless fluent Russian with English \n               subtitles.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         \"Now, that wasn't too polite, was \n                         it?\"\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         \"I'm afraid we can't let that one \n                         go, Ivan.\"\n\n               Checkov is completely taken aback. All the Irish are fairly \n               impressed as well.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         I don't think Ma would mind.\n\n               They clink the glasses together, throw back the Hennessey, \n               ball up the thick glasses in their fists, drop to one knee \n               and both deliver a devastating blow to each of Checkov's \n               quads. Murphy on the left, Connor on the right. He's down \n               for the count, writhing on the floor.\n\n               The boy's each take a Russian guy and start fighting as the \n               others start kicking and spitting on Checkov. This is a bar \n               brawl, lots of punches don't connect. Connor dismantles his \n               man quickly. Murphy is still fighting as all the Irish try \n               to jump in and help Murphy but Connor goes into psycho mode, \n               pushing them all back.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Let the boy go. He knows what the \n                         fuck he's doing!\n\n               They all back off and start to cheer him on. Murphy and Vladdy \n               are ripping each other apart. Vladdy backs him against a \n               wall and pulls back, exhausted, for one good punch. Murphy \n               reaches up behind his head with both hands and pulls two \n               bottles of wine from a wall rack. He swings them toward each \n               other with Vladdy's head as the mid-point. The bottles \n               haphazardly connect, one on each side of his head. He crumples \n               to the ground in an explosion of glass and wine.\n\n               There is shock and silence.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Nicely done, boy!\n\n               INT. MCGINTY'S PUB  NIGHT  A FEW MINUTES LATER\n\n               They have Ivan Checkov tied down to the bar on his stomach.\n\n               Connor stands with an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips \n               next to Ivan. He pours Hennessey all over Checkov's buttocks.\n\n               They all cheer. Ivan's face is battered as Rocco wakes and \n               approaches. He punches Checkov in the face in complete rage.\n\n               Two friends subdue him as all chuckle.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Now, like my fine brother says, on \n                         St. Patty's everyone's Irish. And \n                         this piece of shit is about to be \n                         initiated.\n\n               As they cheer, Connor lights up his smoke and tosses the \n               match on Ivan's butt.\n\n               The Hennessey is instantly ablaze and Checkov is screaming \n               and wiggling in horror. Some just stand there stunned, but \n               most of the remaining onlookers leap to Ivan's aid. They \n               furiously pat him out and turn on Connor.\n\n                                     FRIEND #1\n                         Are ya tryin' ta kill him, ya fuck?\n\n               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY NEXT MORNING\n\n               Connor and Murphy, fairly beat up, sit up on their beds.\n\n               They wear tattered bathrobes and boxer shorts. They put their \n               feet down into their leather boots. The boys examine the \n               extent of one another's injuries and reflect on their \n               hangovers. They both laugh and grab their heads in pain.\n\n               Boom! The door breaks open and in hobbles Checkov and Vladdy, \n               guns drawn. Checkov is all beat up and the ass of his pants \n               is burnt out. A bulky bandage covers his buttocks. Vladdy \n               has a large bandage around his head. The boys stand in \n               surprise.\n\n               Ivan smashes Connor in the forehead with his gun, sending \n               blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor. Murphy \n               helplessly yells his brother's name as he is brought to his \n               knees by Vladdy. Ivan positions Connor on his knees before \n               the toilet, which is open to the room. Checkov puts his foot \n               on Connor's head and proceeds, as he struggles, to hand cuff \n               him to the old toilet. So now Connor is bleeding and hugging \n               the commode with his hands cuffed behind the bowl base.\n\n                                     CHECKOV\n                              (almost whispering)\n                         I was going to kill you. But I'm \n                         not... I'm going to kill your brother. \n                         I'm going to take him down to the \n                         dumpster and I'm going to shoot him \n                         in the head. Then I'm going to throw \n                         his dead body in the garbage.\n                              (looks at this watch)\n                         Trash guys are coming in 10 minutes, \n                         gotta go.\n\n               Checkov walks towards the door and says \"let's go\" to Vladdy.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         It was just a bar fight. You guys \n                         are fuckin' pussies!\n\n               Vladdy pulls him to his feet and leads him away following \n               Checkov.\n\n               Connor, blood running from his face, listens to absolute \n               silence for just a moment. Suddenly his face reads the gravity \n               of the situation. In a split second he turns into an animal. \n               He's yelling, pulling, tugging and growling.\n\n               His body is a whirlwind of motion. The skin on his wrists \n               bleeds profusely.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY  MORNING\n\n               Vladdy and Checkov lead Murphy out back into the alley.\n\n               Murphy is on his knees next to the dumpster. Checkov has his \n               gun to the boy's head. He acts like he's going to pull the \n               trigger, but he stops. Vladdy is standing twenty feet away \n               with his back to them keeping a look out, gun in hand.\n\n               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT.  MORNING\n\n               Connor becomes so venomous, that he pulls the entire toilet \n               right out of the floor.\n\n               INT. TO EXT.  MACMANUS' TENEMENT  LOADING DOORS  MORNING\n\n               (slo-mo) Connor steps out onto the sill of the huge, open \n               loading doors. He is five stories up. His muscles ripple \n               with the weight of the toilet. His face is barbaric.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY  MORNING\n\n               From his kneeling position, Murphy can see his brother perched \n               50 feet overhead. He does not let his face betray him.\n\n                                     CHECKOV\n                         I hope your conscience is clear, \n                         Irishman.\n\n               EXT. MACMANUS' TENEMENT  LOADING DOORS  MORNING\n\n               (slo-mo) Connor bends his knees and heaves the toilet upward \n               and swings one arm directly beneath it. He is no longer \n               tethered around the basin. He holds it at a cocked angle.\n\n               The heavy porcelain tank cover slips off the toilet.\n\n               He tosses the toilet in a left and outwardly trajectory, \n               then he jumps off the sill to the right. He is sailing through \n               the air about twenty feet behind, and to the right of the \n               toilet, cuffed hands above his head, robe up like a cape \n               behind him. Murphy screams\n\n               EXT. ALLEY  MORNING\n\n               (slo-mo) Checkov begins to laugh heartily. The tank top lands \n               pristinely on a garbage bag just behind Murphy. Ivan's look \n               turns to one of terror. Bam! He is crushed by the toilet. \n               Boom! His gun goes off, punching a hole in the dumpster near \n               the bottom. Vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns \n               to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits.\n\n               Connor lands squarely on Vladdy's back. His gun discharges \n               firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. He is \n               savagely crushed against the ground. Connor bounces off and \n               hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious.\n\n               Murphy takes his hands from his head. There is dead silence.\n\n               He runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks \n               his vital signs. He seems okay. Vladdy, still alive, slowly \n               crawls for his gun, inadvertently covering his own bullet \n               casing. Murphy goes over, picks up the tank cover and clubs \n               the man to death with two hard and fast blows, then throws \n               it up and behind him. It lands in the dumpster with a \n               resonating boom.\n\n               Murphy quickly takes everything from the scene; guns, money, \n               wallets, watches and a pager. He shoves it in a garbage bag \n               and throws Connor over his shoulder and runs out of the alley.\n\n               BACK TO PRESENT. INT. BOSTON POLICE STATION INTERROGATION \n               ROOM  AFTERNOON\n\n               Smecker stares astounded at Connor and Murphy. The boys \n               examine Smecker for a reaction. He slowly builds to a chuckle. \n               The brothers join in.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                              (gathering himself)\n\n                         So, how is it that you guys are fluent \n                         in Russian?\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         We paid attention in school.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         Know any other languages?\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Aye.

BOSTON POLICE STATION  FRONT STEPS  EARLY EVENING\n\n               The police chief is standing on the front steps of the police \n               station making a statement to the ravenous press: cameras \n               and pushy reporters. Agent Smecker stands slightly behind \n               him.\n\n               Rocco stands amidst the sea of reporters as the chief begins.\n\n                                     CHIEF\n                         This is our official statement. The \n                         MacManus brothers are not being \n                         charged with a crime. It was a clean-\n                         cut case of self defense. We have \n                         thanked them for their cooperation \n                         and we thank you, the media, for \n                         your tireless pursuit of the truth.\n\n               The press is ablaze with questions. Smecker turns and walks \n               down the precinct steps, passing Rocco, who carries a bunch \n               of folded clothes, and heads for the police station. Smecker \n               glances in Rocco's direction, barely noticing the man who \n               has already passed him.\n\n               INT. MACMANUS' CELLS  EARLY EVENING\n\n               Rocco approaches the wide open cell as Chaffey and Mitchell \n               play cards with the brothers. Happy to see each other the \n               boys and Rocco embrace. He hands them their clothes.\n\n               INT. MACMANUS' CELL  NIGHT\n\n               The boys are in a tight cell with a bed on each side. They \n               are in their own clothes now. The brothers are fast asleep.\n\n               Suddenly, they lurch forward, throwing their chests out, \n               lips tight, still asleep.\n\n               INT. POLICE STATION BATHROOM  NIGHT.\n\n               An officer turns on the faucet of a sink and begins to wash \n               his hands. We go down to the pipes beneath the porcelain \n               basin. An old leak seeps water through a crack in the floor.\n\n               INT. MACMANUS' CELL  NIGHT\n\n               A water leak starts on the ceiling. It drips faster and \n               faster. The water begins to follow a water damaged crack \n               along the ceiling. It slowly spreads in two directions.\n\n               The brothers struggle for air in their sleep. Then slowly, \n               and at the same time, they each reach up one arm apiece and \n               simultaneously curl their hands as if grabbing something.\n\n               Their straining faces are brought from darkness to light as \n               they sit up quickly, face to the ceiling.\n\n               Their eyes open wide and they each draw their first breath \n               as drops of the creeping water land on their foreheads.\n\n               They look at each other across the room in shock as the drips \n               of water still fall between them.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Destroy all that which is evil...\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         ...so that which is good may flourish\n\n               INT. MANMANUS' CELL  NEXT MORNING\n\n               Murphy and Connor sleep. Murphy awakes to a beep, beep, beep.\n\n               He removes Checkov's pager from the pocket of his bathrobe.\n\n               INT. PRECINCT OFFICE  MORNING\n\n               Connor and Murphy enter as Greenly, Dolly, Duffy, Chaffey \n               and Mitchell are having coffee and donuts. They greet each \n               other warmly. Connor grabs a pen and walks to the hallway.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Be right back...\n\n                                     DUFFY\n                         We would be honored, sir, if you \n                         would join us peasants, in a donut.\n\n               Duffy hands Murphy a jelly donut and a cup of coffee as Dolly \n               spreads a copy of the Boston Globe in front of Murphy. The \n               headlines read \"The Saints of South Boston.\" All the \n               detectives chuckle as Murphy is momentarily absorbed. He \n               takes the paper.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Saints?  \n                              (beat)\n                         I will not accept this pizzle until \n                         my feet have been properly anointed.\n\n               They laugh.\n\n               INT. PRECINCT OFFICE  MORNING\n\n               Connor cradles the receiver of a pay phone between his cheek \n               and shoulder. He pockets the pager. As the phone rings, he \n               readies his pen. The other end of the line picks up and a \n               thick Russian accent instantly begins speaking. Connor \n               responds by speaking a few words in Russian before he realizes \n               it's a recorded message. He begins writing. He hangs up the \n               phone and smiles as he lights up a cigarette.\n\n               INT. POPPA JOE YAKAVETTA'S OFFICE  DAY. A.K.A. THE JOKE.\n\n               Rocco, still sporting a shiner, enters an office. There are \n               papers everywhere and it is a cluttered mess of telephones, \n               filing cabinets, lamps and chairs. Rocco clutches a brown \n               paper bag as if it is made of gold. POPPA JOE YAKAVETTA, \n               Rocco's boss, is on the phone. He is in his late forties.\n\n               He's always comfortably dressed; sleeves rolled up, collar \n               unbuttoned.\n\n               VINCENZO LIPAZZI swaggers across the office to Rocco. He is \n               in his late thirties. He goes out of his way to look like \n               Elvis; open shirt, gold chains and medallions. He is \n               overweight and has a bouffant hairdo, accompanied by Elvis \n               shades. Vincenzo flips a half dollar in his hand constantly.\n\n               Rocco and Vincenzo hate each other. Yakavetta talks on the \n               phone.\n\n                                     VINCENZO\n                              (hushed)\n                         Well, it's the funny man. Give it \n                         here, package boy.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                              (a bit defiant)\n                         Joey Bevo said it was important. \n                         Said I had to give it to him myself.\n\n                                     VINCENZO\n                              (snatching the package)\n                         Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the \n                         fuck down!\n\n               Rocco obeys like an angry child. Vincenzo puts it in front \n               of Yakavetta. He sits on a filing cabinet and flips his coin. \n               Vincenzo giggles and whispers as he pokes fun at Rocco.\n\n               The two of them resemble kids behind the teacher's back.\n\n                                     VINCENZO\n                              (hushed)\n                         I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee \n                         Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Fuck you Vincenzo.\n\n                                     VINCENZO\n                              (hushed)\n                         Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         I caught your show down at the velvet \n                         room at the Holiday Inn, loved it \n                         when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.\n\n               Vincenzo's face drops he gets up and starts walking toward \n               Rocco. Roc points at him from a seated position. He's scared.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Hey, hey, hey...\n\n               Suddenly Yakavetta jumps to a standing position. He yells.\n\n                                     YAKAVETTA\n                         Fuck you! I could snap my fingers \n                         and have you dead in four hours, \n                         rotting in a truck off of Boyleston! \n                         You insignificant little fuck! I \n                         always get my fuckin' money!\n\n               He slams the phone down. Rocco and Vincenzo are shocked but \n               try to look composed.\n\n                                     YAKAVETTA\n                         Fuckin' 90's are killin' me. I \n                         shouldn't a done that. You're not \n                         supposed to tell a guy you're gonna \n                         kill him anymore. I gotta tip-toe \n                         through the tulips with these \n                         assholes. I prance. I'm a prancer. \n                         It's what I do... sucked all the fun \n                         right out of this job.\n\n               As he speaks he unwraps the wax paper in the bag. Rocco looks \n               over his shoulder. It's a sandwich. He's embarrassed.\n\n               Vincenzo smirks at him.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?\n\n                                     YAKAVETTA\n                         Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.\n\n               Rocco starts for the door. Vincenzo begins whispering in \n               Yakavetta's ear.\n\n                                     YAKAVETTA\n                         Hey, Rocco, wait.

The two have just had sex and Reuben is far more \n               excited about it than Smecker.\n\n               Reuben pants and gestures that it was a wonderful experience.\n\n               Smecker watches TV.\n\n               Reuben reaches over and affectionately places a hand on \n               Smecker's chest.

Greenly \n               stands directly outside an open door at the hall's end. A \n               steady flow of detectives and forensics filter in and out.\n\n               Smecker halts before Greenly and looks straight into his \n               eyes.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                              (intrigued)\n                         He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?\n\n                                     GREENLY\n                         Why do you always disrespect me like \n                         that?\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         Respect is earned, Greenly, never \n                         given.

PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT\n\n               Smecker and Greenly walk into a large sunken living room \n               with high ceilings. There is a huge white shaped pit couch \n               in the center with seven dead bodies draped across it. All \n               the bodies have been turned so they are either seated or on \n               their backs and bright new pennies have been place in their \n               eyes. There is one corpse directly in the middle of the living \n               room, making eight. This victim (THE FAT MAN) is overweight \n               and is lying in debris made up of sheet rock and broken wood \n               which spreads thinly for a five foot radius around him.\n\n               The victims' body positions are in a circle with the fat man \n               as the hub. Smecker is instantly engulfed. The regular \n               homicide detectives are on hand with their I.D.s hanging out \n               of their breast pockets. They see Smecker and back off.\n\n               Duffy wears an especially loud tie. Smecker lights up a smoke. \n               He circles around and sees another body behind the couch, \n               which makes nine. The victim is on his back, with pennies \n               stuck in his eyes.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         How many bodies, Greenly?\n\n                                     GREENLY\n                              (still Dejected)\n                         Eight.\n\n\n               Smecker's eyes widen as he turns to Greenly.\n\n                                     GREENLY\n                              (catching himself)\n                         No!

In Greek and Roman mythology \n                         when you died you would have to pay \n                         the toll to Charon, the boatman who \n                         ferried you across to the gates of \n                         judgment.

PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT\n\n               Smecker is chain smoking. His clothes appear unkempt. His \n               eyes show emotion at every new found clue. The detectives \n               watch closely. He is hunched over the body of the fat man \n               probing his wounds with his gloved fingers. Greenly has re-\n               entered. He defiantly holds a cup of coffee but is too \n               intimidated to interrupt Smecker.

What did \n                         they do to make two such identical \n                         wounds? Did one guy put him on his \n                         knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up \n                         and shoot him again the same way? \n                         No. Two men of similar height dropped \n                         this guy down, each put some iron to \n                         his head and boom!

The angles \n                         are too extreme. A guy holding two \n                         guns to the back of your head is \n                         gonna shoot straight ahead. He \n                         wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes \n                         no sense. Besides, you telling me \n                         one guy came in here and killed eight \n                         men with eight extremely well aimed \n                         shots in just a few seconds?

That James \n                         Bond shit never happens in real life. \n                         Professionals don't do that. So we've \n                         got this up here, which has novice \n                         written all over it. And all this \n                         down here that's simply a perfect \n                         textbook assassination. So here's \n                         our two possibilities. We either \n                         have rank amateurs that got lucky or \n                         consummate professionals that fucked \n                         up.\n\n               The detectives nod in agreement.

Smecker mixes himself \n               a gin and tonic on the other side. He is calming down now \n               and going back into cool mode. He starts to tuck his clothes \n               back in and fix his hair. He leans over the bar and sips his \n               drink. The three detectives lean in.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         With the exception of my coffee boy, \n                         you Boston detectives are starting \n                         to show signs of intelligence. So, I \n                         am going to make you privy to some \n                         information that you would not \n                         normally be. These men are all Russian \n                         mob. Not like those two peons in the \n                         alley the other day. These guys are \n                         all syndicate bosses and underbosses. \n                         I have a dossier on every man in \n                         this room. Since the Iron Curtain \n                         has gone down, the Russian syndicates \n                         have started to come here. And in \n                         the spirit of Glasnost the Soviets \n                         have opened their borders to the \n                         mafia. But the Italians, they're not \n                         convinced that the grounds in mother \n                         Russia are fertile enough for \n                         organized crime yet. So they ain't \n                         ready to commit. The Russians are \n                         coming here anyway. They are \n                         unwelcome. What we have here, \n                         gentlemen, is possibly the beginning \n                         of the first international mob war... \n                         unless I've totally missed something.\n\n               All their faces read the gravity of the situation.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         Now, what is this going to look like \n                         to those who do not know what I just \n                         told you?\n\n                                     DUFFY\n                         It's gonna look like the bad guys \n                         are killing each other.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         And is there an American, shit is \n                         there a man seated among us that \n                         hasn't thought about it many times, \n                         let's just put them all on an island, \n                         give them guns and let them kill \n                         each other. This is our wet dream \n                         come true.

He storms out to his small, \n               round, living room table at which the boys are seated. He is \n               wearing a white, polyester shirt with gold trim that is a \n               uniform of some kind for perhaps a chain of restaurants. It \n               is unbuttoned all the way down and his white t-shirt is \n               hanging out. He is wearing a name tag that reads \"Jaffar\".\n\n               He is upset. He slams down a chair across from the brothers \n               who are sitting there cleaning guns and silencers. All the \n               accouterments of death are sprawled before them.

They stand on the \n               sidewalk and light smokes. They are in their regular garb; \n               thick naval P-coats, jeans and leather boots. They each carry \n               a mid-sized, black, duffle bag. They are serious and business-\n               like. They scan the Plaza Hotel from across the street. The \n               elite exit and enter the hotel. Connor glances at his pocket \n               watch. It's 8:45.\n\n               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  ELEVATOR  NIGHT\n\n               They enter. They look ahead, stone-faced, as the elevator \n               climbs.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Nervous?\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         A bit.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Me, too.\n\n               The elevator stops at the lobby level. Nine, well-dressed \n               men enter. Their faces are not shown. The boys move to the \n               back wall.\n\n               One guy says something quickly to another in Russian. The \n               other gives a one word Russian response. They boys look at \n               each other. As the elevator climbs, their eyes focus.\n\n               The door opens. As the men exit the elevator, each face is \n               seen individually, all are victims from Smecker's crime scene.\n\n               The elevator goes up half a floor. They hit the stop button \n               and rummage in their bags. They suit up; black gloves and \n               black masks. They strap on four 9mm. pistols with silencers, \n               in shoulder holsters, one under each arm. Connor takes a \n               large coil of black rope and drapes it around himself. He \n               looks at Murphy and at the rope in his bag. Murphy is too \n               excited to argue.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         You and your fucking rope.\n\n               He puts it on. They drop to their knees, making the sign of \n               the cross. Then, up through the ceiling they go.\n\n               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  ELEVATOR SHAFT  NIGHT\n\n               They stand on top of the elevator before a long air shaft.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                              (smiling)\n                         See.

PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT\n\n               They start crawling with Connor in front and Murphy behind.\n\n               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT\n\n               The plump boss is standing in the middle of the sunken living \n               room.\n\n               His eight Russian comrades are around him seated on the U-\n               shaped pit couch. They speak Russian, but no subtitles are \n               seen. The fat man yells. He's mad about something.\n\n               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT\n\n               Connor is taking lots of random turns, left and right. He is \n               starting to look a bit confused.\n\n               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT\n\n               The fat man is really yelling at them now. He is screaming \n               and pointing at each man.\n\n               They seem to be taking it seriously.\n\n               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT\n\n               Their brows are drenched with sweat. Murphy crawls up next \n               to Connor. There is only enough room for the two to lie on \n               their sides facing each other.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Where the fuck are you going?\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         We'll find it.

Must weigh \n                         30 pounds.\n\n               Murphy takes off the rope.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         We're doing some serious shit here. \n                         Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Asshole!?

Fuck you!\n\n               Connor grabs Murphy's shirt.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         No, fuck you!\n\n               The boys get into a close quarters battle. An occasional \n               insult is thrown as feet kick and fists fly. They begin to \n               get tangled in their own rope. The seam of the duct breaks \n               and a tangled mess of rope and MacManuses pour out.\n\n               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT\n\n               They crash through the ceiling right above the fat man's \n               head. The rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt, \n               hanging them upside down, back to back about six feet above \n               the floor. They are turning in circles. The boss is balled \n               up in the fetal position on the floor. The shocked Russians \n               say only a word or two in panic before the MacManus brothers \n               react, reaching for their guns. The Russians start to reach \n               for their guns. It's too late. The boys draw and fire as \n               they spin. Taking four shots apiece.\n\n               There are eight dead Russians. Chests explode as they fall \n               back on the couch in a loose circle. One victims is blasted \n               over the couch.\n\n               They notice the fat man directly beneath them. Murphy grabs \n               his Rambo knife, reaches up and cuts the rope. They land in\n\n               a heap, scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his \n               knees. They each put a gun to the back of his head and recite \n               this prayer in perfect unison.\n\n                                     BOTH\n                         And shepherds we shall be. For thee, \n                         my Lord, for thee. Power hath \n                         descended forth from thy hand that \n                         our feet may swiftly carry out thy \n                         command. So we shall flow a river \n                         forth to thee and teeming with souls \n                         shall it ever be. E nomini patri, et \n                         Fili e spiritu sancti.\n\n               With the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and \n               go to black and white. (Slo-mo) Choral music starts with \n               Latin script being read in the background. They take their \n               rosaries out. They slowly walk around, mumbling prayers as \n               they care for the dead. They gently turn over the bodies \n               that were on their stomachs. They brush the hair back from \n               the victims faces. They place pennies in the eyes of al the \n               corpses. When they finish their ritual, they pull off their \n               masks and look at each other. They start to grin and look \n               around. They work each other into a healthy chuckle.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                              (looks up)\n                         That was some good fuckin' rope.\n\n               They both laugh.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         That was way easier than I thought.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Aye.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         On TV ya always get that asshole \n                         that jumps behind the couch.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for \n                         ten minutes.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Oh, we're good man.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Yes, we are.\n\n               They are already striding for a suitcase full of money.\n\n               Murphy picks up a wad of bills.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         I love our new job.\n\n               Just then, there's a knock at the door. They snap into action. \n               They stand at each side of the double doors, looking through \n               the peepholes. They see Rocco on the other side dressed as a \n               hotel employee. He wears a polyester shirt with gold trim \n               and a name tag that reads Jaffar. He has a good cart in front \n               of him.\n\n               They look at each other and grin. Murphy nods. As they open \n               the door, Murphy grabs the food cart and pulls it in.\n\n               Connor seizes the mortified Rocco and pulls him in, slamming \n               the door shut behind him. They run, dragging him and then \n               throw him in the midst of the bodies. They put their guns \n               right in his face.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Oh, God! Don't kill me!

ALLEY BEHIND SIN BIN  NIGHT\n\n               Rocco, Connor and Murphy are looking very serious as they \n               smoke outside the rear door, in the alley. A drug dealer in \n               a hooded Boston Bruins jacket emerges from the opposing alley.\n\n               He stops a 13 year-old kid. The kid is scared as the drug \n               dealer slaps him. The kid give him money and the drug dealer \n               stuffs a small baggie in the boy's shirt. He lets him go and \n               withdraws into the alley.\n\n               As the boys and Rocco watch this from the opposing alley, \n               they begin to head for them, but Vincenzo's car pulls up \n               across the street. Rocco stops the boys and denotes Vincenzo.\n\n               The boys head in the front door. Rocco moves back into the \n               alley.\n\n               INT.  SIN BIN  NIGHT\n\n               Vincenzo enters and shuffles past the bar where the brothers \n               stand. He walks through a bead curtain at the back of the \n               busy porno house. The boys follow him.\n\n               INT.  SIN BIN  HALLWAY  NIGHT\n\n               They go to the back, open the exit door and let Rocco in.\n\n               The three wind down long dark hallways with Rocco leading \n               the way until they reach a green door. The boys stand, side \n               by side, directly in front of it. Rocco is just behind them.\n\n               The three pull identical 9mm.'s and the boys pull on their \n               masks. Rocco puts on a mask that he made from a dock worker's \n               cotton hat. He looks ridiculous.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Okay Roc, this is...\n\n               He turns and is instantly taken with laughter at Rocco's \n               appearance. Connor turns, and has the same reaction.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         What?

SIN BIN  SMALL ROOM  NIGHT\n\n               They burst into the room, climb up a few steps and are in a \n               small round room with a couch in it. A topless dancer sits, \n               smoking and drinking coffee, on the couch in front of three \n               big black steel doors with money slots in them. Rocco seizes \n               her, puts a hand over her mouth and a gun to her head.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Which one is he in?\n\n               She points to the middle door.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                              (takes his hand off \n                              her mouth)\n                         What's his routine?\n\n                                     DANCER\n                         H... h... he jerks off in there. \n                         Th... then he puts money through the \n                         slot and I raise the door.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         How?\n\n               She points to an orange button.

SIN BIN  CENTER BOOTH  NIGHT\n\n               We see the fuzzy reflection of a cheap porno movie being \n               reflected in Vincenzo's Elvis style sunglasses. He is shaking \n               as he masturbates.\n\n                                     VINCENZO\n                              (grunting, muttering)\n                         Don't you talk to me like that, you \n                         dirty little... give it to daddy... \n                         give it ta da King... garbage mouth, \n                         garbage mouth.\n\n               INT.

He \n               still holds the terrified, crying dancer.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Oh man. He is some sicko.\n\n               They back up and focus on the money slot. A hundred dollar \n               bill comes through. Connor gives it to the dancer.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         You've earned this.\n\n               The boys begin to recite their prayer. Rocco is smiling and \n               excited, he still hangs on to the now hyperventilating dancer.\n\n               They press the button. The door goes straight up. Vincenzo \n               has one moment of shock before the MacManuses decimate him \n               through the glass with silenced bullets. The glass silently \n               spiders and begins to fall in spots. His chest explodes, \n               sputtering medallions and bits of gold chain inside the booth.\n\n               The dancer faints and Rocco lays her down gently.\n\n               The boys step down in the boot and begin their ritual.\n\n               Rocco watches intently, intrigued. They finish and turn around \n               to see Rocco is immersed in grabbing one of the unconscious \n               dancer's breasts. They pull up their masks.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         What the fuck are you doing?\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         I-I'll tip her.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         We've teamed up with a sex offender.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         So, when are you getting a plastic \n                         fuck doll?\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         All right.

Murphy looks through \n               left peep hole, Connor the right. Smiles spread across their \n               faces and they look at each other. They switch and each looks \n               through the other guy's peep hole.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         What?

Evil man, dead \n                         man.\n\n               Rocco gets serious and nods his head. Connor replaces the \n               clip in his gun and hands it to Rocco. Murphy does the same.\n\n               He stands with one in each hand, aiming one gun at each door.\n\n               The boys both place a finger on the appropriate orange \n               buttons, as Rocco slowly cocks his head back. With wide eyes \n               he thrusts his head forward. The doors fly up. Rocco fires \n               both guns yelling \"Yeah, take it, take it!\" Both the drug \n               dealer from outside and the pimp from the emergency room are \n               destroyed. Rocco then crosses his arms and fires two more \n               shots from each gun. On the opposing walls of each booth two \n               identical bullet holes appear.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Wyatt-fuckin'-Earp, man!\n\n               INT.

RITZY RESTAURANT BATHROOM  NIGHT\n\n               An old man appears to look at himself in the mirror of an \n               empty but very upper class bathroom. His eyes are very glazed \n               over. He puts a large leather case on the counter near the \n               sinks. A red and white blind stick hangs off his right \n               forearm.\n\n               Yakavetta enters, crosses behind him and stands next to him.\n\n               AUGUSTUS (72 years) sniffs the air.

His hands are cuffed before him with a chain linking \n               his hands and feet. A guard is pulling the cart through the \n               prison to the parole board room by a long chain. The cons \n               have their mirrors out to get a better look. His face is in \n               shadow as he bows his head.\n\n               A metal cage is lowered around him from the ceiling. The \n               parole board looks him over.

He is the Picasso \n                         of assassins, kid. He plants hair \n                         samples, blood. Puts skin under \n                         fingernails.

He puts a suitcase on the bed.\n\n               He walks over to the window. He slowly puts his hand outside \n               and watches the sun bounce off it. Tears begin to flow from \n               beneath his glasses as he breaks down. He begins to take off \n               his clothes as he weeps, casting them aside.\n\n               EXT.

A man exits the house and walks across the sprawling \n               front lawn. Rocco leans over and says How ya doin', man?\n\n               The man doesn't respond and sits in the passenger seat.\n\n               During the following scenes we FLASHCUT between bits of \n               Rocco's experience that night to the coffee house and catch \n               bits of dialogue as he explains.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         The guy never says a fuckin' word to \n                         me.

We hear the sound of Sega video \n               games being played. He pulls out two pistols with silencers \n               and walk.\n\n               He disappears into the living room. Two white flashes and \n               the sounds of silencers. A hookerish looking mom enters frame \n               in the B.G. in the kitchen. She is talking on the phone. She \n               disappears from view. The man reappears and walks to the \n               kitchen. A white flash and the sounds of silencer.\n\n               He walks right down the hall and halts right in front of us \n               and listens. He goes into the room the wiseguys had entered.\n\n               We hear a second of male voices in protest. Two flashes of \n               light and the sounds of silencers. A dog is heard barking.\n\n               The man reappears in the hall and walks to its end, through \n               the kitchen. He opens a pair of sliding doors and steps out \n               of our view. A flash of white light and the sound of a \n               silencer.\n\n               EXT.

Connor turns on the \n               gas stove and slams a new clothing iron down on the burner. \n               He has wrapped the cord around the handle so it won't burn. \n               They have all ripped their clothes haphazardly and have made \n               tourniquets to nurse their wounds.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Who the fuck was he, Rocco?

Two guys will hold a third \n               down and force a wadded up pillow case in his mouth, as they \n               burn him\n\n               EXT.

He looks out to the street and sees a forensics \n               technician kneeling before a new, gray Ford Taurus riddled \n               with bullet holes. The man marks a sea of different-sized \n               bullet casings that stretch for thirty-five feet down the \n               sidewalk. He circles two blood stains on the side walk with \n               orange chalk.\n\n               Smecker turns and looks at the front of the house. It is \n               peppered with bullet holes, all seemingly concentrated on \n               the front stoop area. Men try to lift blood samples off the \n               white paint around the door.

Five mafiosos sit around a poker \n               table in front of time. Two men are playing pool to their \n               left. Rocco quickly scans the room.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         All of them.\n\n               They begin firing.

They are side by side and leaning back.\n\n               Rocco fires and the men under the table skip around as they \n               are riddled with bullets. Smecker's mimicking hands follow \n               him perfectly with each shot. The boys and Rocco demask.\n\n               Rocco goes around to all the bodies and looks earnestly at \n               each one, as Connor and Murphy pick up bullet casings.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Shit!...

As the door \n               swings open, Rocco tries to angle a gun around to shoot the \n               man who is opening it. But as soon as the man sees his hand, \n               bam! he comes down on it with the towel rack. Rocco pulls \n               back in pain dropping his other gun but the gun fires, as \n               the man's blow connects. The shot pierces his stomach and \n               sends him against the wall. He holds his abdomen in pain.\n\n               There is a moment of recognition between the man and Rocco.\n\n               Rocco is terrified as the man dives on him and they begin \n               fighting. Murphy jumps to help, but Connor pulls him back.\n\n               They both stand in front of the pool table about thirty feet \n               from Rocco.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Let the boy go!\n\n               He is now being choked, as he glares at them in disbelief.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         C'mon Roc!\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         Now, one of these guys is a real \n                         sicko.

He wanted \n                         him to suffer, to feel every second \n                         of a painful death.\n\n               As Rocco is wrestling and punching on the floor.

A man \n               who has been shot starts to regain consciousness. Connor \n               turns his back to shoot him (slo-mo). Murphy sees his \n               opportunity, pulls the cue ball from the table, and rolls it \n               silently across the carpet toward Rocco.\n\n               Connor fires with his left hand and as the casing ejects \n               from the gun he catches it in mid air and makes the sign of \n               the cross. Rocco is on his back, the man is straddling him.\n\n               They both have each others throats and are trying to strangle \n               one another. When the ball is within arms reach, Rocco slams \n               his hand down on it and knocks his assailant in the skull.\n\n               He straddles him and begins to mercilessly beat his face in \n               with the cue ball, yelling \"You sick fuck!\"\n\n               He finally stops, gets up, runs toward the boys, and throws \n               an exhausted punch at Connor who just lays Roc down on the \n               pool table and says, \"Nicely done, boy\". Murphy tends to \n               Roc. Connor checks out the man and seems surprised.\n\n               Murphy takes the bloody cue ball from Rocco's hand and \n               polishes it off on his jacket, making sure Connor cannot \n               see. He replaces it perfectly on the table. Smecker now stands \n               in front of the table with the cue shining in the background.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         I've never seen wounds like these \n                         before, but whatever he used on this \n                         guy, it was a blunt object and they \n                         took it with them.\n\n               Smecker exits to the left as Greenly enters from the right, \n               following Smecker out. He walks by the table furiously \n               scribbling in his notebook. Connor, Murphy and Rocco exit \n               the room, pennies in the eyes of all the corpses in the \n               background. Rocco holds two duffle bags full of poker money.\n\n               Greenly stops, picks up the cue ball and looks at the dead \n               man. He shakes his head and says, \"Nah\".\n\n               EXT.  SUBURBAN \"BEAVER CLEAVER\" TYPE HOUSE  FRONT LAWN  DAY\n\n               Smecker stands in the middle of the front lawn. His hair is \n               a mess. He's chain-smoking. His clothes are disheveled.\n\n               His eyes are psychotic. He points to the parked Taurus as \n               six men in dark suits appear in a fuzzy, out-of-focus shot.\n\n               They line up shoulder to shoulder on the sidewalk.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         They exited out the front door.

SUBURBANK \"BEAVER CLEAVER\" TYPE HOUSE  SIDEWALK  DAY\n\n               (Slo-mo) Two black leather boots slowly walk up the sidewalk \n               and stop in front of the new, gray Ford Taurus then turn \n               toward the house. Il Duce removes a white balloon filled \n               with a few ounces of fluid from the pocket of his black trench \n               coat. He throws it on the walk, the blood splatters. He picks \n               up the remnants of the balloon and puts them back in his \n               pocket and stands there waiting, looking at the house.\n\n               EXT.  SUBURBAN \"BEAVER CLEAVER\" TYPE HOUSE  FRONT STOOP  DAY\n\n               The boys come out, Rocco in the middle and slightly ahead of \n               them. They look out to the walk, stunned.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         Now they are staring at six guys \n                         with guns drawn. It was a fucking \n                         ambush.\n\n               Our three heroes stand, their jaws dropping as their point \n               of view reveals the Il Duce, standing alone, his hands folded \n               in front of him.\n\n               Suddenly, he throws open his trench coat to reveal a special \n               leather vest beneath. Six guns, all different, are holstered \n               on the front of it: three on each side extend from just below \n               his collar bones to his abdomen. Connor and Murphy don't \n               hesitate. They each draw one of their now unsilenced guns \n               from their shoulder holsters and aim, one arm over each of \n               Rocco's shoulders. The Duke draws his top two weapons and \n               aims.\n\n                                     SMECKER\n                         And this was a fucking bomb dropping \n                         in Beaver Cleaverville! For a few \n                         seconds this place was Armageddon! \n                         There was a fire fight!\n\n               They all start shooting at once. The noise is deafening.\n\n               The Taurus is being pierced and the front of the house is \n               splintering as it is riddled with bullets. Smecker is still \n               in the middle, hands raised to the heavens, turning circles.\n\n               Rocco's pinky finger gets shot off, sending blood splattering \n               against the house. He dives in the bushes reeling. He pulls \n               a gun and starts firing.\n\n               Murphy catches a bullet in the arm and dives for the bushes \n               as well. Il Duce with lightening speed, drops the guns and \n               pulls the next two down as he walks to his right about ten \n               feet. He commences firing and the casings hit the sidewalk, \n               all different calibers and sizes are dropping down the walk.\n\n               It's him and Connor and nobody is backing down. They both \n               grind their teeth as they fire rapidly at each other. At the \n               same moment, The Duke gets hit in the arm and Connor takes a \n               bullet in the leg. The firing ceases for a moment.\n\n               Connor remains steady and Il Duce looks down at his arm and \n               his own blood splattered on the sidewalk.\n\n                                     IL DUCE\n                         No!... No! No!...\n\n               He drops the guns and pulls the last two as he moves to the \n               right. He fires with wrath as he screams the word No over \n               and over. Rocco and Murphy return fire from the bushes yelling \n               and swearing, as Connor does the same from his position on \n               the stoop.\n\n               The Duke turns and runs, leaving a sea of casings, and guns \n               that extend for 35 feet down the walk. There are also two \n               blood stains.\n\n               In a frenzy the boys and Rocco get up and withdraw some spray \n               bottles from their bags. The begin spraying all their own \n               blood stains on the stoop and the front of the white house.\n\n               They then pick up their things and run off.\n\n               EXT.

He raises his \n               head and there he sees Rocco's pinky finger lying undiscovered \n               in the bushes.

He has just hooked \n               into the F.B.I.'s computer network with his authorization \n               code. He is disgusted as he puts on surgical gloves and finger \n               prints the severed finger onto a scanner. He waits for a \n               moment.

He is \n               opening a new pack of cigarettes. He is surprised when he \n               sees Smecker at the other end of the block. He follows the \n               stumbling agent, fumbling for his gun.\n\n               EXT.  STREET IN FRONT OF CHURCH  EARLY MORNING\n\n               Paul sees a church and reflects for a moment before crossing \n               the street and going in, Rocco a safe distance behind.\n\n               INT.  CHURCH  EARLY MORNING\n\n               Connor and Murphy are at prayer in the back of the church.\n\n               It is mostly empty because of the early hour.\n\n               Connor looks up and sees Smecker and Rocco way up in the \n               front. His eyes are ablaze. He is up and walking and does \n               not bother Murphy, who remains penitent. There are two \n               confessional booths with a priest booth in the middle.\n\n               Smecker goes in the booth on the far left. Rocco tries the \n               door, it's locked. A middle-aged PRIEST slips a key in the \n               priests booth and opens the door. Rocco shoves him in and \n               goes in behind him. Connor has quickened his pace. He tries \n               both doors. They're locked. He goes into the confessional on \n               the right.\n\n               INT.

CHURCH  CONNOR'S CONFESSIONAL  EARLY MORNING\n\n               Connor is furiously working his fingers through the lattice \n               work to open the slider to the priest's booth from his side.\n\n               INT.  CHURCH  PRIEST'S BOOTH  EARLY MORNING\n\n               Rocco takes the priest and puts his face in front of the \n               slider to Smecker's booth, gun to the back of his head.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Don't do this my son.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Open it!\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Have you no fear of God?\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         That's who I'm doing this for, now \n                         open the fuckin' thing.\n\n               Connor gets the slider open. Rocco's long hair hangs just \n               inches from Connor's face. Connor puts his thumb and \n               forefinger through, desperately reaching for a lock of Rocco's \n               hair. Rocco jostles the priest and puts the gun hard to his \n               head.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         Father, I'll do you right here.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                              (slowly obey, \n                              whispering)\n                         God have mercy on my soul.\n\n               Rocco starts to move the priest aside and put his gun to \n               Smecker's now open slider.\n\n               Just then Connor snags a piece of Rocco's hair and pulls him \n               back hard and fast by it, until his head slams into the \n               lattice work. Rocco grabs the priest back into position.\n\n               Connor grabs a nice wad of Rocco's hair with his left hand, \n               so that the side of Rocco's face is now pressed to the \n               lattice. Connor then puts a gun to Rocco's head.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                              (hard whisper)\n                         You little fuck. Let him go.

Down the dark basement halls there \n               is more gore. The boys and Rocco can be heard screaming from \n               a room in the basement. Yakavetta's voice is heard yelling \n               and in command.\n\n               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT\n\n               Connor, Murphy, and Rocco are all hand cuffed to chairs in \n               the seated position. Their clothes are ripped and they have \n               been beaten severely. Blood covers them. Rocco has been \n               uncuffed and two men hold his open hand up as Yakavetta puts \n               a pistol at the base of his remaining pinky finger. Several \n               other hold him down as he and the boys scream in tough \n               protest.\n\n                                     YAKAVETTA\n                              (yelling)\n                         You gonna tell me what's going on \n                         here?! Huh! You little fuck! Gimme \n                         some answers!\n\n               They all yell for him to fuck off. Although Rocco is \n               terrified, he is holding out. Yakavetta fires and Rocco's \n               finger is gone. The blood splatters on Connor's face. Rocco \n               screams in pain saying fuck you through his sobs. After re-\n               cuffing Rocco, Yakavetta and his goons exit.\n\n               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT HALL  NIGHT\n\n               Yakavetta is in the hall with four men.

YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT\n\n               He walks back into the room. He saunters up to Rocco very \n               nonchalantly and shoots him in the chest. His chair is blown \n               back to the floor. The boys are screaming and crying as \n               Yakavetta walks out.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                              (struggles to talk)\n                         You guys?\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                              (crying)\n                         We're here brother.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         You gotta keep going.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                              (sobbing)\n                         We'll keep going, Roc.\n\n                                     ROCCO\n                         You'll make it outta here.

YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT\n\n               Murphy has scootched his chair in front of Connor's. He has \n               his back to Connor.\n\n               He stretches his neck over and bites at the collar of his p-\n               coat. He gathers as much of the material in his mouth as he \n               can. He starts to yell, \"Do it!\" but it is muffled.\n\n               Connor, still sobbing, begins to kick his brother's left \n               hand repeatedly. He turns it into a bloody piece of broken \n               meat as Murphy screams through the shirt. Finally, it is \n\n               broken enough and Murphy pulls it through the cuff.\n\n               He stands and breaks the chair into pieces and grabs the \n               sharpest piece. Hojo enters and Murphy shoves the sharp stick \n               up through the bottom of his chin into his head. He drags \n               him around the room yelling mumbo jumbo into his face as \n               Connor jumps up and down in his chair in rage, wanting a \n               piece of the action.\n\n               Murphy throws the man down and Connor proceeds to viciously \n               kick his dead body. The two have turned into barbarians.\n\n               Murphy removes the man's two guns, shiny nickel-plated 45s.\n\n               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S FRONT FOYER  NIGHT\n\n               There is a knock at the door. Geno jumps with fright and \n               then looks out the peep hole. He sees a well-formed pair of \n               woman's breasts in a cheap dress. He opens the door. A \n               stunning blonde stands before him. She looks like a hooker.\n\n               She wears a short, hot pink dress and a white scarf around \n               her neck, as well as six inch platform heels.\n\n                                     SMECKER AS WOMAN\n                         Joey Bevo sent me over.

YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  NIGHT\n\n               He takes Smecker into a small bathroom adjoining the foyer.\n\n               They are instantly in the throws of passion. They grope each \n               other and Smecker cleverly avoids any contact with his crotch. \n               Smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and \n               seductively touch himself. Geno stands over him, straddling \n               Smecker's hips as he undoes his pants. Suddenly, Smecker \n               grabs both of Geno's ankles and has him locked in position. \n               He repeatedly kicks Geno in the balls from his lying position \n               on the floor. The guy falls on his back unconscious. Smecker \n               uses a silencer, shoots him in the head.\n\n               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  HALL  NIGHT\n\n               He starts to whisper, \"It's on now. It's on now. Too far.\" \n               as he walks down the hall, striding in his high heels, wig \n               back in place. He thoughtlessly blows Chappy away as he passes \n               his position and runs down a long hallway. He turns a corner \n               and points his gun at the Mafioso cohort but pauses.\n\n               He is already sitting with his throat cut. Smecker looks \n               puzzled as Il Duce withdraws from the shadows behind him.\n\n               The Duke pistol whips Smecker. He's out.\n\n               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT\n\n               Connor and Murphy are on their knees in front of Rocco, whom \n               they have sat back up in the chair. They are gently placing \n               pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the \n               prayer. As they speak, Il Duce watches. He then begins to \n               whisper the prayer right along with them. Their words match \n               up perfectly. He leans against the wall, holsters his guns, \n               and withdraws a cigarette.\n\n               He rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips.\n\n               The boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. They react \n               instantly. Still kneeling they each point a nickel-plated 45 \n               toward The Duke. They turn in time to see the light from the \n               match illuminate his face. Il Duce pauses then he strides \n               into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the \n               prayer.\n\n               He stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the \n               prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their \n               father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he \n               looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. He places a \n               hand on each of their cheeks.\n\n               INT.

COURTROOM  MORNING\n\n               The media, with their cameras and notebooks, are at the back \n               of the courtroom. Yakavetta is testifying on the stand. He \n               is cocky.

There are a pair of doors \n               that go to the outside hallway and a pair that go to the \n               inside courtroom. There is an armed guard directly inside \n               the courtroom, in front of the doors.\n\n               The door opens a crack and Connor waves the guard into the \n               foyer and starts talking to him. Then dad zaps him with a \n               stun gun. The guard is on the floor, incapacitated and \n               drooling as the boys handcuff him.\n\n               Connor pulls out a length of chain and drapes it through the \n               door handles that lead from the hall into the foyer. He locks \n               them in with a padlock.\n\n                                     FATHER\n                         How long do these put a man down \n                         for?\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Ten minutes.\n\n               The father zaps the incapacitated man a second time as he \n               lay.\n\n                                     FATHER\n                         Twenty is a bit better.\n\n               They suit up, Connor and Murphy in their usual masks and \n               gloves, Dad is already in his usual dark hat and glasses.\n\n               The boys start for the courtroom door but dad gently holds \n               them back. He takes a moment, then slowly removes his hat \n               and glasses. His sons look at one another and then remove \n               their masks. The three look into each others eyes for a \n               moment.\n\n               INT.  COURTROOM  DAY\n\n                                     JUDGE\n                         Due to the lack of hard evidence......\n\n               The three burst in, guns drawn, and are walking down the \n               aisle.\n\n                                     FATHER\n                         All media to the back! Drop the \n                         cameras! Drop 'em!\n\n               Terrified, they all obey. Connor and Murphy pull Yakavetta \n               from the witness booth by his hair and place him on his knees \n               just before the judge's bench. They face him toward the \n               occupants of the courtroom. The father walks up and motions \n               for the judge, who is now banging his gavel and shouting in \n               protest, to come off the stand.\n\n               As soon as he is within arms reach, dad takes him by the \n               collar and drags him down the aisle all the way to where the \n               media stands in horror. He turns and walks back down the \n               aisle.\n\n                                     FATHER\n                              (loudly)\n                         You people have been chosen to reveal \n                         our existence to the world. You will \n                         witness what happens here today and \n                         you will tell of it afterwards.\n\n               All eyes to the front.\n\n                                     YAKAVETTA\n                              (looking to his \n                              comrades)\n                         Fuckin' do something!\n\n               The father keeps them covered. He passes the front, he looks \n               and sees a VIRGINAL-LOOKING WOMAN with her head down crying \n               into her hands. She is on the left side. He gently tilts her \n               chin forward, her eyes fixated on a faded blue butterfly on \n               the back of his hand.\n\n                                     FATHER (WHISPERS)\n                              (whispers)\n                         You must watch dear. It'll all be \n                         over soon. \n                              (she obeys)\n\n               The father takes out a flask. He pours the booze on the judges \n               bench and set it ablaze. Fire alarms start to sound.\n\n               Connor and Murphy jump up on the lawyers' tables. Murphy on \n               the prosecution side, Connor on the defense. The father has \n               his sawed-off to the back of Yakavetta's head.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                              (yelling over the \n                              alarm)\n                         Now, you will receive us.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                              (yelling over the \n                              alarm)\n                         We do not ask for your poor or your \n                         hungry.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         We do not want your tired and sick.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         It is your corrupt we claim.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         It is your evil, who will be sought \n                         by us.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         With every breath we shall hunt them \n                         down.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         Each day we will spill their blood \n                         till it rains down from the skies.\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         Do not kill, do not rape, do not \n                         steal. These are principles which \n                         every man of every faith can embrace.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         These are not polite suggestions. \n                         They are codes of behavior and those \n                         that ignore them will pay the dearest \n                         cost.\n                              (points to Yakavetta)\n\n                                     MURPHY\n                         There are varying degrees of evil. \n                         We urge you lesser forms of filth\n                              (pointing to \n                              Yakavetta's people)\n                         Not to push the bounds and cross \n                         over into true corruption... into \n                         our domain.\n\n                                     CONNOR\n                         For if you do, there will come the \n                         day when you look behind you and see \n                         we three.

They approach Yakavetta \n               and stand on either side of their father. All three men hold \n               guns to his head and recite the prayer. As they speak, the \n               right side of the courtroom screams in protest. The left \n               watches in wide-eyed terror, although some men encourage \n               them to do it. The MacManus' read the prayer. They do not \n               falter as the flames rage behind them.\n\n               Yakavetta, accepting his fate, closing his eyes. Peacefully, \n               he does the sign of the cross. The all fire at once. The \n               room explodes in confusion. The three exit the back.\n\n               INT.  LONG CEMENT HALLWAY  SUBLEVEL OF COURTHOUSE\n\n               The MacManuses are all shackled and in blue jumpsuits of the \n               Boston lock-up facility with bags over their heads. Duffy is \n               in full uniform with a shotgun behind them. Smecker is leading \n               the prisoners down the hall. He flashes his F.B.I. \n               identification to every cop he encounters.\n\n               INT.  COURTHOUSE INSIDE GRANDE FOYER STEPS  DAY\n\n               The media is in a frenzy. Little bits of the story are known.\n\n               The people from the left and right sides of the courtroom \n               are yelling and pushing each other as cameras and microphones \n               try to pick up the news. Finally all the focus comes to the \n               virginal woman who had been sitting in the front row. All \n               lights, cameras and microphones are on her.\n\n                                     REPORTER 2 (V.O.)\n                         Yes!

Everyone, even \n               reporters are in it.
