METRO - NIGHT</b>\n\n     DEAN huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as PRATT\n     and JONES move through the cars searching for faces.\n\n     DEAN looks for an out. He sees an emergency stop handle.\n\n     He YANKS it forward. PASSENGERS yell. The brakes lock\n     and SCREECH. The train slows. Then stops.\n\n     DEAN opens the door.\n\n     And jumps. He looks around. Just black curved track in\n     either direction. He starts running.\n\n     Then he hears it.\n\n     The horrible SCREECHING of an approaching train.\n\n     Trapped.\n\n     On one side, the train he left. On the other, a wall.\n\n     He runs down the track with all that's left.\n\n     PRATT and JONES reach the open door and see the\n     oncoming train bearing down on DEAN. They duck in as\n     the train SWISHES by.\n\n     DEAN lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing\n     greasy ground as the train screeches over him.\n\n     Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric.\n\n     Then it's over. The train's gone. DEAN's alive.\n\n     He gets up to see PRATT and JONES leap to the tracks.\n\n<b>                        DEAN\n</b>               (under his breath)\n            I hate these guys.\n\n     Then he sees an \"EMERGENCY ACCESS\" sign beaming in the\n     darkness.

Grabbing a\n     towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from\n     everything he touched.\n\n     Exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as--\n\n     A NEIGHBORS DOOR OPENS.

DEAN leaps in. BRILL stomps on the gas\n     and tires screech. The Chevy hurtles through the\n     warehouse toward a shut garage door. BRILL clicks a\n     remote. The door rises.\n\n     OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - The Chevy roars outward,\n     screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined\n     with warehouses.\n\n     DEAN looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a\n     Saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.\n\n<b>                        BRILL\n</b>            Where's your gun?\n\n     They pass an area with no warehouses.

DEAN looks back again as the RIFLEMAN\n<b>     FIRES--\n</b>\n     The rear window EXPLODES. DEAN pops up and fires three\n     quick, well-placed rounds.\n\n     The Saturn swerves and drops back. BRILL's impressed.\n\n     DEAN looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an\n     iron cross-bar. BRILL, unfazed, pushes the Chevy faster.\n     Beam or no beam, he's going through.\n\n<b>                        BRILL\n</b>            Think we let out enough air?\n\n<b>                        DEAN\n</b>               (realizing)\n            Oh my God...\n\n     BRILL and DEAN hit the deck as the Chevy's hood scrapes\n     just under the beam. The windshield frame takes the\n     full impact. The beam slices through steel and glass,\n     decapitating the car. They emerge on the other side\n     minus roof and windows as--\n\n     --the Saturn SCREECH-STOPS inches from the beam and\n     debris. A MAN leaps out, shoulders his rifle and aims--\n\n     --but the Chevy disappears around a building.\n\n     <b>EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING</b>\n\n     A foggy morning.

The helicopter drops in closer as\n     BRILL swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70-\n     plus on flapping tires. A helicopter SHARP-SHOOTER aims\n     with an M-16.\n\n     A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the\n     Chevy's hood. The engine starts knocking.\n\n<b>                        BRILL\n</b>            These guys are incredibly persistent.\n\n<b>                        DEAN\n</b>            Tell me about it.\n\n     The road straightens. Up ahead, a tunnel.\n\n     More bullets slice the hood. Radiator fluid starts\n     hissing. The Chevy starts dying.\n\n     BRILL stomps the pedal, squeezing out every last kick\n     of horsepower.\n\n     Rubber flaps. Tires shred. Steam hisses. Bullets fly.\n\n     The helicopter swoops in lower and lower for the kill shot.\n\n     <b>INT.

The SHARP-\n     SHOOTER has the shot.\n\n     The Chevy reaches the tunnel's opening on sparking,\n     screeching wheel rims.\n\n     The helicopter pulls up, missing the hill by inches.\n\n     But not the power lines. The PILOT sees them too late.\n     The helicopter flies into a web of cables. The upper\n     rotor slices neatly off. The helicopter's body rockets\n     downward to the road where it bounces and skids like a\n     rock on water until it meets an oncoming semi-truck\n     head-on.\n\n<b>     BLAM!\n</b>\n     <b>EXT. INSIDE THE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS</b>\n\n     BRILL tries steering but metal wheels on concrete don't\n     work. The car shimmies like it's on ice.

Put me through\n            to Langley. Dick Marshal's office.\n\n     <b>INT. UNIVERSITY COFFEE SHOP - DAY</b>\n\n     A place packed with STUDENTS, computers and TEACHERS.\n     DEAN sits in a corner reading a magazine, but what he's\n     really watching is--\n\n     A WELL-DRESSED MAN at the counter, his back to DEAN,\n     ordering a cup of coffee.\n\n     The MAN glances at DEAN off the mirror behind the counter.\n\n     BRILL walks in and joins DEAN.\n\n<b>                        BRILL\n</b>            Albert's primed. We'll let him stew\n            for a day and then drop the tape.\n\n     BRILL looks over at the WELL-DRESSED MAN.\n\n<b>                        DEAN\n</b>            He came in four minutes ago.\n\n<b>                        BRILL\n</b>               (pause)\n            C'mon.\n\n     They're about to start for the front door when an\n     unmarked police car pulls up in front.\n\n     A rowdy group of FRAT BOYS flood in, loud and busy. By\n     the time they pass, BRILL and DEAN are gone.\n\n     The WELL-DRESSED MAN scans the coffee shop and sees the\n     back door swinging shut.\n\n     <b>EXT. STREET - DAY</b>\n\n     DEAN and BRILL run down the street, through an alley\n     and over a fence to another street. They slow as they\n     approach the parked Taurus. BRILL takes the wheel with\n     DEAN beside him.\n\n     They pull into traffic. Things look good, but then the\n     UNMARKED CAR and a SQUAD CAR scream up behind, lights\n     flashing.\n\n     <b>INT. TAURUS - CONTINUOUS</b>\n\n     BRILL dumps the car into low gear and the Taurus comes\n     alive.\n\n     <b>INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS</b>\n\n     A COP picks up the radio-mic.\n\n<b>                        COP\n</b>            One-Lincoln-Nine. In pursuit of two\n            suspects, one matching description\n            of Robert Dean, wanted in connection\n            with a homicide. Suspects northbound\n            on--\n\n     <b>EXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS</b>\n\n     Through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a\n     one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar\n     into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront. BRILL's at\n     his best, putting distance between himself and the cops\n     at every turn.\n\n     Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race\n     down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end.\n\n     BRILL slams into reverse. They screech backward, tires\n     smoking.\n\n     Too late. The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing\n     them in.\n\n     BRILL hits the brakes. He looks back at the dead-end\n     and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. BRILL\n     gives it everything. If they can get enough speed and\n     hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing\n     wall.\n\n<b>                        BRILL\n</b>            Feeling lucky?\n\n<b>                        DEAN\n</b>            Not particularly, no.\n\n     They hit the ramp full speed. The front end bottoms at\n     the Taurus bounces skyward. Tires clip the wall as the\n     car flips and smashes into a parked rail-car filled\n     with coal.\n\n     They aren't going anywhere.\n\n     Back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop.\n\n     A ROOKIE climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his\n     gun and nears...\n\n     Inside the Taurus, the windows are shattered. Steam\n     hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere.\n\n     DEAN shimmies out through a broken side window. He\n     barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so.\n\n     His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal,\n     which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.\n\n<b>                        DEAN\n</b>            Shit.\n               (to BRILL)\n            I'm stuck. Help me out.\n\n     He looks back to see that BRILL is hanging out the\n     driver's side, bleeding badly and covered in gas.\n\n<b>                        COP\n</b>               (on waist radio)\n            One-Lincoln-Nine, suspects TA'd\n            into a coal car at the Fullbright\n            rail-yards. Requesting back-up,\n            fire and ambulance.\n\n     An unmarked car with red-flashers races up the rail-\n     yard and stops. The ROOKIE turns as JONES and KRUG hop out.\n\n<b>                        JONES\n</b>               (flashing ID)\n            FBI. What do you got?\n\n<b>                        COP\n</b>            Two murder suspects. One's wounded,\n            the other's maybe dead.\n\n<b>                        JONES\n</b>            Thank you.\n\n     KRUG draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly\n     shoots the COP dead.\n\n<b>                        JONES\n</b>               (to KRUG)\n            Check inside.\n\n     DEAN is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to\n     dig himself out of the coal.\n\n     KRUG inspects the Taurus interior for anything of\n     interest. JONES scans the area.\n\n<b>                        KRUG\n</b>               (to BRILL as he searches.)\n            I hate doin' cops, I really do. You\n            I won't mind. Didn't mind that\n            Rachel Banks. Didn't mind doin' her\n            one bit.\n               (seeing DEAN's shoe)\n            Your lawyer friend buried over there?\n\n     BRILL can only gurgle blood. JONES pops the Taurus's\n     trunk had looks inside.\n\n     KRUG digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for\n     Dean. Then BRILL sees him--\n\n     BRILL's POV: DEAN down off the side of the coal-car,\n     lodged in the coal pile. He's safe, but not once KRUG\n     discovers he's not in the car.\n\n     BRILL pushes in the cigarette lighter.\n\n     JONES dumps everything from the Taurus into the\n     unmarked car. SIRENS suddenly fade in.\n\n     KRUG digs faster, looking for DEAN, as JONES approaches\n     with his pistol, clambering around for BRILL.\n\n<b>                        KRUG\n</b>            Fuck him, he's dead in two minutes.\n            Find Dean.\n\n     JONES starts to back out, just as the Taurus's\n     cigarette lighter pops out. BRILL grabs it.\n\n     KRUG eyes the glowing lighter. Then he eyes BRILL.\n\n     Shit.\n\n     BRILL ignites the gas. WA-WOOMFF!! A fireball explodes,\n     consuming all - the car, BRILL, KRUG. JONES is blown\n     off his feet from the concussion.\n\n<b>                        JONES\n</b>               (scrambling away)\n            Fuck--\n\n     JONES wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and\n     tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach.\n\n     DEAN watches from the shadows as flames incinerate\n     everything.\n\n<b>                        MARSHAL (V.O.)\n</b>            I just came from my office at\n            Langley.
