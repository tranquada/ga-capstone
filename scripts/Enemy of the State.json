SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK, SCENIC VIEW LOT - MORNING\n\n     Shenandoah mountains. A cold dawn. TWO BLACK TOWN CARS\n     sit side by side, facing a view of a farming valley below.\n\n     Two MEN in dark suits and long coats stand near the\n     cars, casually on the lookout. If we caught a glimpse\n     underneath the coat of the taller of the two, we'd see\n     that he was carrying a 9mm. Glock.\n\n     INT. BLACK TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n     In the backseat of the car sit HAMERSLEY and REYNOLDS,\n     each well-kept and in his early 50's.\n\n                        REYNOLDS\n            \"I know thy works and thy labour\n            and how thou canst not bear them\n            that are evil. And thou hast tried\n            them who say they are apostles and\n            hast found them to be liars\".\n            Revelations II.\n\n                        HAMERSLEY\n            What the hell does it mean?\n\n                        REYNOLDS\n            It means who's side are you on?\n\n                        HAMERSLEY\n            You didn't ask me to meet you 30\n            miles from my office for a Bible\n            study class.\n\n                        REYNOLDS\n            It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone\n            needs to swallow hard. No one,\n            including you, wants to be fingered\n            as the one obstructing efforts to\n            crack down on terrorism, and--\n\n                        HAMERSLEY\n            Fuck you.\n\n                        REYNOLDS\n            What?\n\n                        HAMERSLEY\n            I said fuck you.\n\n                        REYNOLDS\n            Is that anyway to talk to an old\n            school chum?\n\n                        HAMERSLEY\n            You're gonna finger me as soft on\n            terrorism?

American\n            buildings. Americans getting bombs\n            in the mail. What are we gonna do!?\n\n                        HAMERSLEY\n            We're not gonna hand you and your\n            band of lunatics the keys to the\n            kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in\n            Congress and write a law that\n            allows the NSA to point a camera\n            and a microphone at anything they\n            damn well feel like. And the next\n            time you have something to say to\n            me, we do it above-board, in my\n            office, like everyone else. Now get\n            outa my car, I've got a committee\n            meeting on the hill.\n\n     REYNOLDS regards HAMERSLEY a moment, then opens the car\n     door--\n\n     EXT. PARKWAY - MORNING\n\n     HAMERSLEY's car snakes down the twisting mountain road.\n\n     INT. HAMERSLEY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n     HAMERSLEY MAKES VERBAL NOTES concerning the Reynolds\n     meeting into his memo-recorder as he drives. He picks\n     up his cellular phone and punches in a number.\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n            Senator Albert's office--\n\n     The line goes dead.\n\n     HAMERSLEY tries again but can't get a dial tone. Then,\n     in the rear-view mirror, a BROWN SEDAN gains fast.\n     Whoever the guy is, he's flying. Then a man with a\n     rifle leans out the sedan's window. Aims.\n\n     HAMERSLEY flies into a blind curve. Tires SCREECH as he\n     rounds the bend to see\n\n     A PROPANE TRUCK. Blocking both lanes of the road.\n\n     HAMERSLEY's eyes widen. He stomps the brakes, SKIDS and\n     SLAMS into the truck. The EXPLOSION engulfs everything.\n     HAMERSLEY and the car are consumed. The pursuing sedan\n     slows to a stop. The men watch. The car's an inferno.\n\n     The MEN pull a 'U' and drive away.\n\n     INT. CRYSTAL CITY, VIRGINIA, TALL OFFICE BLDG. - DAY\n\n     A well-appointed big-city law office filled with\n     citations of merit and pictures of a wife and child.\n\n     ROBERT DEAN, a likable young lawyer, sits behind his\n     desk with his back to an OLDER MAN. He stares at a\n     commanding view of Washington, D.C. as he listens to a\n     tired, smoke and whiskey voice.\n\n                        OLDER MAN (L.T.)\n            I don't know how much longer we can\n            hold out, Mr. Dean.\n\n                        DEAN\n            I don't know, either, L.T.

DEAN stands in a ticket line with the other\n     PASSENGERS.\n\n                        RACHEL (V.O.)\n            The number twelve ferry to Glen\n            Burnie. Tuesdays or Fridays.\n\n     INT. FERRY - DAY\n\n     DEAN takes a seat. Across the deck is Seat 74. RACHEL\n     takes the seat and casually slides an envelope behind\n     it, her actions obscured by a bag she carries. The\n     ferry BLOWS its departure horn.\n\n                        RACHEL (V.O.)\n            The drop's behind Seat 74. I leave\n            something, he picks it up later.\n\n     The ferry churns water. RACHEL moves to a wind\n     protected seat, leaving Seat 74 empty. DEAN keeps watch\n     on the seat as he scans the paper.\n\n                        DEAN (V.O.)\n            Any idea what he looks like?\n\n                        RACHEL (V.O.)\n            My guess is male, somewhere in his\n            40's or 50's.\n\n     A MONTAGE of different people occupying Seat 74.\n\n     A middle-aged DRUNK passed out in the seat. A TEEN-AGED\n     boy with glasses chats with friends.\n\n                        RACHEL (V.O.)\n            Race, height, weight, you're on\n            your own.\n\n     An OLD LADY reads a book. She sees DEAN eyeing her and\n     smiles nervously. DEAN returns to his paper.\n\n                        RACHEL (V.O.)\n            Now I don't know how he's gonna\n            feel about someone tracking him\n            down. He's reclusive. I'm sure he\n            has his reasons.\n\n     DEAN's alone now. The ferry docks for the night. The\n     last passengers, TWO NUNS, disembark. DEAN rises to go.\n     Brill's a no-show.\n\n     INT. FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT\n\n     DEAN walks down the ramp. It's dark in the empty\n     terminal. Not the best place at this hour. Up ahead,\n     TWO MEN stand in the darkness, then kissing. Down\n     another hall, SOUNDS OF NEARING FOOTSTEPS. DEAN detours\n     into--\n\n     INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Empty. DEAN stands at a sink, water running. He glances\n     at the door. He splashes water on his face. Suddenly--\n\n     --DEAN's slammed forward, a silenced pistol is shoved\n     into his ear, pinning his face to the mirror.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Jesus! What?! You want money?!\n\n                        MAN\n            Shut the fuck up.\n\n     Hands frisk DEAN. Up and down the legs, behind the back\n     and chest. A wallet is removed, ID's looked at - then\n     returned. DEAN turns to see--\n\n     A MAN, early 50's. He sweeps a signal frequency locator\n     over DEAN's body. The needle reacts at DEAN's foot.\n\n                        MAN\n               (gesturing)\n            Your shoe.\n\n                        DEAN\n            My shoe?\n\n                        MAN\n            Gimme the shoe.\n\n     DEAN complies with the strange request as the MAN flips\n     out a knife.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Brill?\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            Brill's dead. He died of small pox\n            when he was two and he was buried\n            in a Kansas field.\n               (prying away DEAN's heel)\n            My name doesn't matter.\n\n     CLOSE ON DEAN's HEEL - a hollow compartment reveals a\n     miniature tracking device. The MAN removes it, then\n     returns the shoe.\n\n                        \"BRILL\" (CONT'D)\n            A tracker. Thousand yard range.\n            They're close.\n\n     The MAN reaches in a trash can, removes a potato-chip\n     bag, wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down\n     the toilet.\n\n                        \"BRILL\" (CONT'D)\n            C'mon.\n\n     \"BRILL\" goes through the window. DEAN eyes the window,\n     not sure. He eyes the door. Same feeling.\n\n     EXT. LOADING DECK - MOMENT LATER\n\n     DEAN crawls through the window to a loading dock.\n     \"BRILL\" motions him to follow as he moves off into the\n     shadows.\n\n     The sounds of the window OPENING behind them, followed\n     by FOOTSTEPS. \"BRILL\" shoves Dean behind a dumpster and\n     removes his gun as two men run by. The STEPS FADE.\n     \"BRILL\" looks. They're gone.\n\n     EXT. FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT\n\n     Establishing. A closed farmer's market by the terminal.\n     Several cars are parked. One's a cab. \"BRILL\" opens the\n     driver's door. DEAN grabs the front passenger door.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            No. In back like you're a customer.\n\n     INT. CAB - NIGHT\n\n     \"BRILL\" sits in the driver's seat, eyes flickering to\n     all views, as DEAN climbs in the back. \"BRILL\" flips on\n     the meter and guns into traffic.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            What happened?\n\n                        DEAN\n            It started with the information you\n            gave me on DePinto. After we talked,\n            he agreed to resign. Next, a phony\n            detective asked me about Daniel\n            Zavitz. Then an investigator\n            questioned me about an extortion\n            scheme they claimed Zavitz was\n            behind. The FBI started looking\n            into mob connections. A doctored\n            picture in the paper. Overnight,\n            I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank\n            accounts, everything gone.\n\n     \"BRILL\" eyes the mirror. A BLACK CHEVY appears several\n     car lengths behind.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            DePinto's dead.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Oh Jesus.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            They found him yesterday folded\n            neatly in a car trunk. What about\n            Zavitz?\n\n     \"BRILL\" starts to weave in and out of traffic. He looks\n     in the mirror - the Chevy's also weaving several cars\n     behind.\n\n                        DEAN\n            I don't know anything about Zavitz.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            You said he was behind an extortion\n            scheme.\n\n                        DEAN\n            They said he was behind an\n            extortion scheme.\n\n     \"BRILL\" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            And you were the last one to talk\n            to him.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Yes.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            What'd he say to you?\n\n                        DEAN\n            Nothing.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            What'd he give to you?\n\n                        DEAN\n            Nothing.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            Don't bullshit me, I can save your\n            life.\n\n                        DEAN\n            I'm telling you, I--\n\n     The ride from hell gets worse as \"BRILL\" screeches\n     another turn. The car ahead stops and \"BRILL\" screeches\n     past on two wheels.\n\n                        DEAN (CONT'D)\n            I just gave him my card.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            He didn't give you an address? He\n            didn't give you a phone number?\n\n                        DEAN\n            Nothing. Two nights later I was\n            robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.\n\n     \"BRILL\" takes an impossible left into another alley.\n     The Chevy follows. \"BRILL\"'s good. The guy in the\n     Chevy's better.\n\n                        DEAN (CONT'D)\n            Um...who's that?\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            Don't know. Did you check everywhere?\n            Maybe it was hidden in something.\n            Maybe there was someone else--\n\n                        DEAN\n            Someone else?\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n            Maybe you bumped into someone who\n            took it and you didn't even know.\n\n     The cab is rear-ended hard by the Chevy. Their necks\n     snap back from the force.\n\n                        \"BRILL\" (CONT'D)\n            Shit!\n\n     WHAM! They're hit again. \"BRILL\" pulls out a communicator.\n\n                        \"BRILL\" (CONT'D)\n            209 to anyone! I need some help here!\n\n                        DEAN\n            Who are you calling?!\n\n     WHACK! \"BRILL\" back-hands DEAN with his fist, knocking\n     him silly as WHAM!--the cab's rear-ended again.\n\n                        \"BRILL\"\n               (trying again)\n            This is 209! Does anyone copy?!\n\n     Then \"BRILL\" sees that the alley empties into a busy\n     street, then a bakery shop.\n\n     He slams the brakes. Tires screech smoke but it's no\n     use. The powerful Chevy pushes the cab, bumper to\n     bumper, toward the street. \"BRILL\" grips the wheel.\n     It's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross\n     traffic and--\n\n     BLAM! They're broad-sided by a delivery truck. The cab\n     is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire-\n     hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the\n     broken main.\n\n     DEAN slowly opens his eyes. Water pours in everywhere.\n     \"BRILL\" is sticking halfway through a window, not\n     moving. Seeing \"BRILL\"'s pistol, DEAN grabs it and\n     crawls from the wreckage.\n\n     EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n     DEAN climbs from the wreck as BYSTANDERS approach.\n\n                        WOMAN\n            Look out! He's got a gun!\n\n     They back away as DEAN gets to his feet and looks\n     around. Off to the side he sees the Chevy, waiting like\n     a coiled snake.\n\n     DEAN limps into the crowd. He rounds the corner to\n     ANOTHER STREET and now he's running with all he's got left.\n\n     INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/STUDY - NIGHT\n\n     STACY is at the desk looking at the latest edition of\n     the paper, which now has a photograph of DEAN and\n     RACHEL walking in the park from the day before.\n\n     The phone rings and STACY reaches for it...\n\n                        STACY\n               (into phone)\n            Hello?\n\n     INTERCUT WITH:\n\n     INT.

You know these people, I don't.\n\n                        BRILL\n            And you won't. Now move--\n\n                        DEAN\n            I'll pay you.\n\n                        BRILL\n               (taking out his pistol)\n            They froze your accounts. Get outa\n            my way.\n\n     DEAN continues blocking the door, maintaining calm even\n     as BRILL's pistol is pressed firmly to his forehead.\n\n                        DEAN\n            I've got a hundred-thousand dollars\n            in jewelry in a safe-deposit box\n            under a third party name.\n\n     BRILL looks at the ground. Torn.\n\n                        DEAN (CONT'D)\n            How many years have you been hiding\n            from them? How many years have you\n            been running?\n               (beat)\n            What'd they do to you?\n\n                        BRILL\n               (pause)\n            If you find something, chalk the\n            Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go\n            to Temperanceville. It's South of\n            Salisbury.\n               (giving DEAN his pistol)\n            And take this.\n\n     And with that, he's gone.\n\n     DEAN eyes the gun. He walks to the ledge, looking at\n     the city.\n\n     DEAN'S POV: Several vehicles quietly pull up to the\n     building. MEN storm out an move inside.\n\n     DEAN quickly backs away.\n\n     INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\n     DEAN races for the stairwell two steps at a time. He\n     hears the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING somewhere below.\n\n                        VOICE (O.S.)\n            303 to 301. Floor one secured.\n            Moving to two.\n\n     DEAN retreats upward, then he hears SOMEONE COMING DOWN.\n     Trapped. He opens the door on '3' and is about to run\n     when he sees a security camera directly above.\n\n     Grabbing a fire extinguisher, he pulls the pin. Spray\n     coats the lens. Then he yanks a FIRE ALARM. A HORN BLARES.\n\n     DEAN runs for the second stairwell when he sees JONES\n     stepping out. DEAN looks back at the stairwell he left.\n     That door's opening as well.\n\n     Trapped.\n\n     Using the extinguisher, DEAN smashes the glass door to\n     an office and goes inside. JONES starts to enter when a\n     shot rips into the wall, convincing him otherwise. He\n     retreats as the BLARING FIRE ALARM STOPS.\n\n     DEAN races through the suite of offices trying locked\n     door after locked door. Finally, one opens and he\n     rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself.\n\n     No lock.\n\n     He sees the MEN and they see him. He slides a desk\n     against the door, then backs away, pistol ready.\n\n                        JONES (O.S.)\n               (disturbingly calm)\n            Open the door, Mr. Dean. There's\n            nowhere to go. We'd just like to talk.\n\n     Seeing a phone, DEAN grabs it.\n\n     No tone. Just a RECORDING of Nancy Sinatra's song\n     \"These Boots are Made for Walking\".\n\n                        JONES (O.S.)\n            It'd be easier for all of us if you\n            just come out. Nothing'll happen.\n\n     DEAN heaves a coffee table up on the desk.\n\n                        JONES (O.S.)\n            It's quite hopeless what you're\n            doing, Mr. Dean.\n\n                        DEAN\n            I swear to God I'll shoot.\n\n                        JONES (O.S.)\n               (chuckling)\n            I think you might be over-reacting\n            there, Mr. Dean. We just want to talk.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Go ahead. I hear you fine.\n\n     The door pushes in--\n\n                        DEAN (CONT'D)\n            I said I'll shoot!\n\n     The door keeps pushing.\n\n     DEAN FIRES high.\n\n     The pushing stops.\n\n     Then DEAN hears the distant sound of SIRENS approaching.\n     DEAN rips off his sweater, takes out a lighter, and\n     sets the sweater on fire.\n\n     He throws it into a garbage can and tosses styrofoam\n     cups in on top of it.\n\n     The pushing starts again, but before DEAN can fire, a\n     small cylindrical device drops into the room.\n\n     A STUN GRENADE.\n\n     DEAN ducks as a BLINDING FLASH rocks the room.\n\n     The window is blown open. Smoke billows out. DEAN,\n     temporarily blinded and deaf, struggles to a ledge as\n     fire engines arrive.\n\n     INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Fire trucks, police cars and an ambulance arrive\n     beneath DEAN as HICKS watches from his van.\n\n                        HICKS\n            I don't fuckin' believe this!\n               (into radio-mic)\n            301 to all units. Everyone out! Now!\n            We'll take him at the hospital.\n\n     INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT\n\n     DEAN sits in back with a PARA-MEDIC, covered in soot,\n     breathing hard through an oxygen mask as the ambulance\n     WAILS and weaves through traffic. He looks through the\n     rear window to see--\n\n     TWO CARS FOLLOWING, keeping pace. Off to the side, RFK\n     Stadium is emptying, a Redskins game is over.\n\n     DEAN rips off the oxygen mask--\n\n                        DEAN\n            Tell him to stop the ambulance.\n\n                        PARAMEDIC\n            Whoa there, fella. Just take it easy.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Tell him to stop the ambulance.\n\n                        PARAMEDIC\n            Now you're a little shaken up, but\n            we're gonna get you on your feet in--\n\n     DEAN whips out his pistol and shoves it in the\n     PARAMEDIC's face--\n\n                        PARAMEDIC (CONT'D)\n               (to the driver)\n            --stop the ambulance.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Thank you.\n\n     EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n     The ambulance pulls over and the back doors fly open.\n     DEAN leaps out into the crowd.\n\n     The OTHER CARS pull over and PRATT and JONES exit. They\n     scan the area and see DEAN descending a stairwell\n     marked: METRO.\n\n     INT. METRO STATION PLATFORM - NIGHT\n\n     DEAN stands at the end of the crowded platform. PRATT\n     and JONES work through the CROWD as the train pulls in.\n     DEAN slides on board. The departure HORN sounds. JONES\n     and PRATT step on.\n\n     INT. METRO - NIGHT\n\n     DEAN huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as PRATT\n     and JONES move through the cars searching for faces.\n\n     DEAN looks for an out. He sees an emergency stop handle.\n\n     He YANKS it forward. PASSENGERS yell. The brakes lock\n     and SCREECH. The train slows. Then stops.\n\n     DEAN opens the door.\n\n     And jumps. He looks around. Just black curved track in\n     either direction. He starts running.\n\n     Then he hears it.\n\n     The horrible SCREECHING of an approaching train.\n\n     Trapped.\n\n     On one side, the train he left. On the other, a wall.\n\n     He runs down the track with all that's left.\n\n     PRATT and JONES reach the open door and see the\n     oncoming train bearing down on DEAN. They duck in as\n     the train SWISHES by.\n\n     DEAN lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing\n     greasy ground as the train screeches over him.\n\n     Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric.\n\n     Then it's over. The train's gone. DEAN's alive.\n\n     He gets up to see PRATT and JONES leap to the tracks.\n\n                        DEAN\n               (under his breath)\n            I hate these guys.\n\n     Then he sees an \"EMERGENCY ACCESS\" sign beaming in the\n     darkness. A God-send. DEAN runs for it.\n\n     EXT. METRO EMERGENCY ACCESS EXIT - NIGHT\n\n     PRATT and JONES fly out the door and into a park.\n\n     It's empty. Quiet.\n\n     No Dean anywhere.\n\n                        REYNOLDS (V.O.)\n            I'm confused about something. Maybe\n            you can help me out.\n\n     EXT. TERRACE - CONTINUOUS\n\n     The Lincoln Memorial is seen in the distance. REYNOLDS\n     has broken off PARTY GUESTS and paces in his tux, an\n     encrypted cellular phone pressed to his ear.\n\n                        REYNOLDS (CONT'D)\n            I sit on top of the greatest\n            intelligence gathering organization\n            in human history. Why can't I bring\n            in a man whose name is in the\n            fucking phonebook?!\n\n                        HICKS\n            He's clever.

I didn't realize\n            you were hoping to be transferred\n            to a weathership outside Greenland.\n\n                        HICKS\n            I just meant--\n\n                        REYNOLDS\n            I don't care if he's Solomon with\n            Saint Joseph sitting in his lap. I\n            want the tape and I want him. Now is--\n\n     A WAITER with a tray steps out onto the terrace...\n\n                        REYNOLDS (CONT'D)\n               (to the WAITER)\n            Yes?\n\n                        WAITER\n            Puffed cheese?\n\n                        REYNOLDS\n            No thank you.\n\n                        WAITER\n            I also have tiny pizzas and\n            mushrooms stuffed with--\n\n                        REYNOLDS\n            Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?\n\n                        WAITER\n            No.\n\n                        REYNOLDS\n            Then let's assume I don't.\n\n                        WAITER\n            Yes sir.\n\n     The WAITER goes back inside.\n\n                        REYNOLDS\n               (into phone)\n            Now is that clear?\n\n                        WAITER\n            Yes sir.\n\n     REYNOLDS disconnects, breathes deeply, and goes back to\n     the party.\n\n     EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n     DEAN watches from the shadows. It seems quiet. He's\n     about to move for the entrance when he sees--\n\n     A cigarette lighter flame-up inside a parked car. TWO\n     MEN sit inside, watching. DEAN retreats into the shadows.\n\n     EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT\n\n     Quiet. DEAN listens through the door and hears nothing.\n     He KNOCKS softly.\n\n     No reply.\n\n     He tries the doorknob. It opens.\n\n     INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     DEAN enters. The place is still.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Rachel?\n\n     No answer. DEAN drifts through the living room. A lamp\n     is knocked over on the floor. DEAN keeps moving into\n     the bedroom. He stops in the doorway - eyes fixed inside.\n\n     DEAN'S POV: RACHEL lies on her stomach, naked in bed.\n\n                        DEAN\n               (approaching)\n            Rachel?\n\n     She doesn't respond. He touches her.\n\n     Nothing.\n\n     He turns her over. Her face is frozen, eyes open, neck\n     purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Oh God--\n\n     DEAN wants to throw up but holds it down.\n\n     Then, under a night table, he sees a shirt. He grabs it.\n\n     DEAN'S POV: An oxford button-down. The inside collar is\n     stamped with a dry-cleaner's marker reading: R. DEAN.\n\n     Panic overtakes horror as DEAN quickly searches for\n     anything else of his that may have been planted inside\n     the apartment.\n\n     Under the bed - a cufflink.\n\n     In the bathroom - a hairbrush.\n\n     On the desk - documents with his name on them.\n\n     DEAN shoves everything into a garbage bag. Grabbing a\n     towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from\n     everything he touched.\n\n     Exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as--\n\n     A NEIGHBORS DOOR OPENS. A COUPLE stumbles out, laughing,\n     kissing...and noticing DEAN leaving Rachel's condo.\n\n     INT.

STREET - EARLY MORNING\n\n     Establishing. A quiet street in Dean's neighborhood.\n     Several REPORTERS are camped in Dean's driveway\n     entrance, sipping coffees. Farther down the street, a\n     JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE is parked. The driver waits and\n     watches.\n\n     EXT. BACKYARD - SAME TIME\n\n     DEAN sneaks between two large houses, ducking by\n     windows and scaling a fence. Somewhere a DOG BARKS a\n     warning as DEAN plows through a large hedge, entering\n     the backyard to his home.\n\n     INT.

The house is bugged.\n            So we gotta be quiet, okay?\n\n     STACY nods understanding. DEAN slowly removes his hand.\n\n                        DEAN (CONT'D)\n               (whispering)\n            Is Eric in school?\n\n                        STACY\n            Yes.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Has anyone been by?

I picked those\n            drapes.\n\n                        DEAN\n            I don't think anybody wants the\n            drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes\n            are okay.\n\n                        STACY\n            What happened to your head?\n\n                        DEAN\n            I was in a car chase and a small\n            explosion. Now listen to me: The\n            NSA is behind this. They think that\n            guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz,\n            they think Zavitz gave me a tape or\n            computer chip of some kind that\n            could be damaging to them. So\n            they're doing all these things\n            electronically. The bank records,\n            the surveillance. They're the ones\n            who broke into the house. Now I\n            know there's no reason to believe\n            me. But I love you. And I love our\n            son. So just believe me anyway.\n               (pause)\n            Please.\n\n     STACY gently touches his forehead where he's been cut...\n\n                        STACY\n            Does that hurt?\n\n                        DEAN\n            Well...yeah.\n\n                        STACY\n            Good.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Stacy--\n\n     She grabs him and kisses him. The kiss lasts a good\n     long time before STACY smacks him on the arm--\n\n                        STACY\n            I told you they could do this. I\n            told you they had this kind of\n            capability and that with this anti-\n            terrorism it would be just another--\n\n                        DEAN\n            Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the\n            best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.\n\n     She kisses him again.\n\n                        STACY\n            I'm sorry I didn't believe you.\n\n                        DEAN\n            That's okay.\n\n                        STACY\n            I opened the present you got me\n            from Harrison's.\n\n                        DEAN\n            You opened the thing?\n\n                        STACY\n            The lingerie.\n\n                        DEAN\n            That was for Christmas.\n\n                        STACY\n            I was missing you.\n\n                        DEAN\n            You're as bad as Eric.

An un-marked Trans-Am lags\n     behind, keeping reporters at bay.\n\n     Doors fling open. JONES and THREE MEN, all in plain\n     clothes, pistols and MAC-10 aimed at the Range Rover.\n\n     Nothing happens.\n\n     The MEN move closer--\n\n     JONES grabs the door and rips it open, revealing Dean's\n     PISS-FRIGHTENED NANNY behind the wheel in Dean's trench\n     coat and hat.\n\n     JONES YANKS her out, puts her hard to the ground, gun\n     jammed to her head, as other search the Range Rover for\n     Dean.\n\n     EXT.

BALTIMORE SHERATON - EVENING\n\n     PEDESTRIANS walk on the sidewalk. A MAN comes along and\n     drops a few letters in the corner mailbox.\n\n     From the other direction comes DEAN. Without stopping,\n     he casually slashes the mailbox with chalk.\n\n     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     DEAN's asleep. There's a SOFT SHUFFLING SOUND.

DEAN leaps in. BRILL stomps on the gas\n     and tires screech. The Chevy hurtles through the\n     warehouse toward a shut garage door. BRILL clicks a\n     remote. The door rises.\n\n     OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - The Chevy roars outward,\n     screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined\n     with warehouses.\n\n     DEAN looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a\n     Saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.\n\n                        BRILL\n            Where's your gun?\n\n     They pass an area with no warehouses.

DEAN looks back again as the RIFLEMAN\n     FIRES--\n\n     The rear window EXPLODES. DEAN pops up and fires three\n     quick, well-placed rounds.\n\n     The Saturn swerves and drops back. BRILL's impressed.\n\n     DEAN looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an\n     iron cross-bar. BRILL, unfazed, pushes the Chevy faster.\n     Beam or no beam, he's going through.\n\n                        BRILL\n            Think we let out enough air?\n\n                        DEAN\n               (realizing)\n            Oh my God...\n\n     BRILL and DEAN hit the deck as the Chevy's hood scrapes\n     just under the beam. The windshield frame takes the\n     full impact. The beam slices through steel and glass,\n     decapitating the car. They emerge on the other side\n     minus roof and windows as--\n\n     --the Saturn SCREECH-STOPS inches from the beam and\n     debris. A MAN leaps out, shoulders his rifle and aims--\n\n     --but the Chevy disappears around a building.\n\n     EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING\n\n     A foggy morning.

The helicopter drops in closer as\n     BRILL swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70-\n     plus on flapping tires. A helicopter SHARP-SHOOTER aims\n     with an M-16.\n\n     A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the\n     Chevy's hood.

By\n     the time they pass, BRILL and DEAN are gone.\n\n     The WELL-DRESSED MAN scans the coffee shop and sees the\n     back door swinging shut.\n\n     EXT. STREET - DAY\n\n     DEAN and BRILL run down the street, through an alley\n     and over a fence to another street. They slow as they\n     approach the parked Taurus. BRILL takes the wheel with\n     DEAN beside him.\n\n     They pull into traffic. Things look good, but then the\n     UNMARKED CAR and a SQUAD CAR scream up behind, lights\n     flashing.\n\n     INT. TAURUS - CONTINUOUS\n\n     BRILL dumps the car into low gear and the Taurus comes\n     alive.\n\n     INT.

BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a\n     one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar\n     into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront. BRILL's at\n     his best, putting distance between himself and the cops\n     at every turn.\n\n     Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race\n     down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end.\n\n     BRILL slams into reverse. They screech backward, tires\n     smoking.\n\n     Too late. The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing\n     them in.\n\n     BRILL hits the brakes. He looks back at the dead-end\n     and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. BRILL\n     gives it everything. If they can get enough speed and\n     hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing\n     wall.\n\n                        BRILL\n            Feeling lucky?\n\n                        DEAN\n            Not particularly, no.\n\n     They hit the ramp full speed. The front end bottoms at\n     the Taurus bounces skyward. Tires clip the wall as the\n     car flips and smashes into a parked rail-car filled\n     with coal.\n\n     They aren't going anywhere.\n\n     Back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop.\n\n     A ROOKIE climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his\n     gun and nears...\n\n     Inside the Taurus, the windows are shattered. Steam\n     hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere.\n\n     DEAN shimmies out through a broken side window. He\n     barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so.\n\n     His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal,\n     which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.\n\n                        DEAN\n            Shit.\n               (to BRILL)\n            I'm stuck. Help me out.\n\n     He looks back to see that BRILL is hanging out the\n     driver's side, bleeding badly and covered in gas.\n\n                        COP\n               (on waist radio)\n            One-Lincoln-Nine, suspects TA'd\n            into a coal car at the Fullbright\n            rail-yards. Requesting back-up,\n            fire and ambulance.\n\n     An unmarked car with red-flashers races up the rail-\n     yard and stops. The ROOKIE turns as JONES and KRUG hop out.\n\n                        JONES\n               (flashing ID)\n            FBI.

One's wounded,\n            the other's maybe dead.\n\n                        JONES\n            Thank you.\n\n     KRUG draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly\n     shoots the COP dead.\n\n                        JONES\n               (to KRUG)\n            Check inside.\n\n     DEAN is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to\n     dig himself out of the coal.\n\n     KRUG inspects the Taurus interior for anything of\n     interest. JONES scans the area.\n\n                        KRUG\n               (to BRILL as he searches.)\n            I hate doin' cops, I really do. You\n            I won't mind.

JONES pops the Taurus's\n     trunk had looks inside.\n\n     KRUG digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for\n     Dean. Then BRILL sees him--\n\n     BRILL's POV: DEAN down off the side of the coal-car,\n     lodged in the coal pile. He's safe, but not once KRUG\n     discovers he's not in the car.\n\n     BRILL pushes in the cigarette lighter.\n\n     JONES dumps everything from the Taurus into the\n     unmarked car. SIRENS suddenly fade in.\n\n     KRUG digs faster, looking for DEAN, as JONES approaches\n     with his pistol, clambering around for BRILL.\n\n                        KRUG\n            Fuck him, he's dead in two minutes.\n            Find Dean.\n\n     JONES starts to back out, just as the Taurus's\n     cigarette lighter pops out. BRILL grabs it.\n\n     KRUG eyes the glowing lighter. Then he eyes BRILL.\n\n     Shit.\n\n     BRILL ignites the gas. WA-WOOMFF!! A fireball explodes,\n     consuming all - the car, BRILL, KRUG. JONES is blown\n     off his feet from the concussion.\n\n                        JONES\n               (scrambling away)\n            Fuck--\n\n     JONES wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and\n     tosses it into the flames as the police cars approach.\n\n     DEAN watches from the shadows as flames incinerate\n     everything.\n\n                        MARSHAL (V.O.)\n            I just came from my office at\n            Langley.
