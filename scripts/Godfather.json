There is a moment's hesitation, and then the\n\tsimple words in white lettering:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  THE GODFATHER\n</b>\n\tWhile this remains, we hear: \"I believe in America.\"\n\tSuddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a\n\tman of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great\n\temotion.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n</b>\t\tAmerica has made my fortune.\n\n\tAs he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n</b>\t\tI raised my daughter in the American\n\t\tfashion; I gave her freedom, but\n\t\ttaught her never to dishonor her\n\t\tfamily.  She found a boy friend,\n\t\tnot an Italian.  She went to the\n\t\tmovies with him, stayed out late.\n\t\tTwo months ago he took her for a\n\t\tdrive, with another boy friend.\n\t\tThey made her drink whiskey and\n\t\tthen they tried to take advantage\n\t\tof her.  She resisted; she kept her\n\t\thonor.  So they beat her like an\n\t\tanimal.  When I went to the hospital\n\t\ther nose was broken, her jaw was\n\t\tshattered and held together by\n\t\twire, and she could not even weep\n\t\tbecause of the pain.\n\n\tHe can barely speak; he is weeping now.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n</b>\t\tI went to the Police like a good\n\t\tAmerican.  These two boys were\n\t\tarrested and brought to trial.  The\n\t\tjudge sentenced them to three years\n\t\tin prison, and suspended the\n\t\tsentence.  Suspended sentence!\n\t\tThey went free that very day.  I\n\t\tstood in the courtroom like a fool,\n\t\tand those bastards, they smiled at\n\t\tme.  Then I said to my wife, for\n\t\tJustice, we must go to The Godfather.\n\n\tBy now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office\n\tin his home.\n\n\tThe blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with\n\tpatterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the\n\tshoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small\n\ttable, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands\n\timpatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a\n\tglass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and\n\tvoices of many people outside.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tBonasera, we know each other for\n\t\tyears, but this is the first time\n\t\tyou come to me for help.  I don't\n\t\tremember the last time you invited\n\t\tme to your house for coffee...even\n\t\tthough our wives are friends.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n</b>\t\tWhat do you want of me?  I'll give\n\t\tyou anything you want, but do what\n\t\tI ask!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tAnd what is that Bonasera?\n\n\tBONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tNo.  You ask for too much.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n</b>\t\tI ask for Justice.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tThe Court gave you justice.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n</b>\t\tAn eye for an eye!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tBut your daughter is still alive.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n</b>\t\tThen make them suffer as she\n\t\tsuffers.  How much shall I pay you.\n\n\tBoth HAGEN and SONNY react.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tYou never think to protect yourself\n\t\twith real friends.  You think it's\n\t\tenough to be an American.  All\n\t\tright, the Police protects you,\n\t\tthere are Courts of Law, so you\n\t\tdon't need a friend like me.\n\t\tBut now you come to me and say Don\n\t\tCorleone, you must give me justice.\n\t\tAnd you don't ask in respect or\n\t\tfriendship.  And you don't think to\n\t\tcall me Godfather; instead you come\n\t\tto my house on the day my daughter\n\t\tis to be married and you ask me to\n\t\tdo murder...for money.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n</b>\t\tAmerica has been good to me...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tThen take the justice from the\n\t\tjudge, the bitter with the sweet,\n\t\tBonasera.  But if you come to me\n\t\twith your friendship, your loyalty,\n\t\tthen your enemies become my enemies,\n\t\tand then, believe me, they would\n\t\tfear you...\n\n\tSlowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n</b>\t\tBe my friend.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tGood.  From me you'll get Justice.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBONASERA\n</b>\t\tGodfather.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tSome day, and that day may never\n\t\tcome, I would like to call upon you\n\t\tto do me a service in return.\n\n<b>\tEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\n</b>\n\tA HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There\n\tare at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard\n\tand gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and\n\tcountless tables covered with food and wine.\n\n\tDON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a\n\tson: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of\n\tthe wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the\n\thands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the\n\tchildren, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry\n\twith them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked\n\tbread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.\n\n\tThe entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,\n\tMAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN\n\tand his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the\n\tbride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into\n\tthe pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tWhere's Michael?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSONNY\n</b>\t\tHe'll be here Pop, it's still early.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tThen the picture will wait for him.\n\n\tEveryone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves\n\tback to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the\n\tdirection of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns\n\tit.  Then he moves to his wife.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSONNY\n</b>\t\tSandra, watch the kids.  They're\n\t\trunning wild.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSANDRA\n</b>\t\tYou watch yourself.\n\n\tHAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine\n\tbarrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM\n\tcrooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is\n\tnext, straightens, and follows HAGEN.\n\n<b>\tEXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)\n</b>\n\tOutside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,\n\tworking together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out\n\tof the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers\n\tdown in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter\n\tcoming from the party in the distance.\n\n\tA MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.\n\n\tBARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the\n\twatchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to\n\tembrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.\n\n\tThe MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another\n\tnumber in the notebook.  A shiney new Cadillac with wooden\n\tbumpers.\n\n\tPETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping\n\tbellies with the ladies.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n</b>\t\tPaulie...wine...WINE.\n\n\tHe mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.\n\tPAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings\n\tit to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAULIE\n</b>\t\tYou look terrif on the floor!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLEMENZA\n</b>\t\tWhat are you, a dance judge?  Go do\n\t\tyour job; take a walk around the\n\t\tneighborhood... see everything is\n\t\tokay.\n\n\tPAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps\n\tback into the dance.\n\n\tThe MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another\n\tnumber in the notebook.\n\n\tTESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-\n\tOLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his\n\tenormous brown shoes.\n\n\tThe MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out\n\tof the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by\n\tCLEMENZA and PAULIE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSONNY\n</b>\t\tBuddy, this is a private party.\n\n\tThe MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the\n\tsedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.\n\tThe DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,\n\twithout saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the\n\tground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,\n\tand another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the\n\twalk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSONNY\n</b>\t\tGoddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.\n\n<b>\tINT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\n</b>\n\tDON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the\n\tdark study.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNAZORINE\n</b>\t\t...a fine boy from Sicily, captured\n\t\tby the American Army, and sent to\n\t\tNew Jersey as a prisoner of war...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tNazorine, my friend, tell me what I\n\t\tcan do.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNAZORINE\n</b>\t\tNow that the war is over, Enzo,\n\t\tthis boy is being repatriated to\n\t\tItaly.

In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one\n\tof her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,\n\twhere she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.\n\tCARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the\n\tbulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the\n\tthings hold.\n\n\tDiscreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCARLO\n</b>\t\t\t  (whispered)\n\t\tCut it out, Connie.\n\n\tThe purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,\n\tis fat with money.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPAULIE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tWhat do you think?

Soft light bathes the room\n\tfrom the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see\n\this face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably;\n\tmutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something\n\twet.\n\n\tHe wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.\n\tHe looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is\n\tfrightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on\n\this sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of\n\tblood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically,\n\tmoving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face\n\twith the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of\n\this bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy\n\ttendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle\n\tof blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and\n\tthe enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered\n\twith blood.\n\n\tWOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out.\n\tThen, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure\n\tterror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and\n\tknees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.\n\n<b>\tINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\n</b>\n\tCLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.

He\n\tis the only one on the street.  There are gay, twinkling\n\tChristmas decorations all over the building.  He walks,\n\tslowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.  He\n\thesitates, looks around.  This area is empty.  He checks the\n\taddress on a scrap of paper.  It is correct.

All that can be\n\theard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly\n\tMICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,\n\tsecurely asleep.

There are empty\n\tbooths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,\n\tand ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMCCLUSKEY\n</b>\t\tIs the Italian food good here?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLLOZZO\n</b>\t\tTry the veal; it's the finest in\n\t\tNew York.\n\n\tThe solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.\n\tThey watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three\n\tglasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLLOZZO\n</b>\t\tI am going to talk Italian to Mike.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMCCLUSKEY\n</b>\t\tSure, you two go right ahead; I'll\n\t\tconcentrate on my veal and my\n\t\tspaghetti.\n\n\tSOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening\n\tcarefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers\n\tin Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally\n\tbrings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.\n\tThen MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in\n\tItalian, accidentally lapses into English.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\t\t  (using English for emphasis)\n\t\tMost important...I want a sure\n\t\tguarantee that no more attempts\n\t\twill be made on my father's life.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLLOZZO\n</b>\t\tWhat guarantees can I give you?

Then he looks away and makes a distressed look\n\ton his face.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLLOZZO\n</b>\t\tWhat is it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tIs it all right if I go to the\n\t\tbathroom?\n\n\tSOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with\n\this dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's\n\tthigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMCCLUSKEY\n</b>\t\tI frisked him; I've frisked\n\t\tthousands of young punks; he's clean.\n\n\tHe looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;\n\tindicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods,\n\tindicating no one is there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSOLLOZZO\n</b>\t\tDon't take too long.\n\n\tMICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and\n\tdisappears inside.\n\n<b>\tINT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)\n</b>\n\tMICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very\n\thard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his\n\thands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.\n\tThen he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.\n\tSlowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he\n\tcannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is\n\tjust a few inches from the gun...he gropes\n\tsearchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.\n\n\tCLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he\n\tbreaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep\n\tbreath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some\n\tunexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately\n\twashes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.\n\n<b>\tINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\n</b>\n\tHe hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.\n\tMcCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO\n\tturns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at\n\tMICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues\n\tback to the table.  He sits down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n</b>\t\tNow I can talk.  I feel much better.\n\n\tThe MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now\n\the too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down\n\tcomfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton\n\this jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again\n\tbut MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear\n\thim.\n\n\tThe WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to\n\tspeak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away\n\tfrom him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts\n\tthe gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his\n\ttemple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's\n\thead blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the\n\tentire area.\n\n\tThe WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is\n\tsprayed and stained with blood.\n\n\tSOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he\n\tseems to hang in space suspended.\n\n\tMICHAEL pivots, and looks:\n\n\tThere is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal\n\tsuspended in air before his gaping mouth.\n\n\tMICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging\n\tthroat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then\n\tcoolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right\n\tthrough McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.\n\n\tThe air is filled with pink mist.\n\tMICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.\n\tHe does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.\n\tNow he carefully shows his hands to be empty.\n\tThe WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an\n\texpression of horror on his face.\n\tMICHAEL looks at his two victims:\n\tSOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by\n\tthe table.\n\tMcCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.\n\tMICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His\n\thand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.\n\tHe moves, not letting the gun go.\n\n\tMICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.\n\n\tHis hand: still holding the gun.\n\n\tHis face: finally he closes his eyes.\n\n\tHis hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.\n\n\tHe walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.\n\n\tHe sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had\n\tbeen recreated in wax.\n\n\tThen he leaves.\n\n<b>\t---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\n</b>\n<b>\tFADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>\tINT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\n</b>\n\tA MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old\n\tupright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.\n\tANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.\n\n\tA little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,\n\tquietly eating.

The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the\n\tkids on the street are still playing stickball.\n\n\tCARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street\n\tsuddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block\n\tand to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires\n\tscream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a\n\tMAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast\n\tthe everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we\n\trecognize that it is SONNY.\n\n\tHis face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on\n\tthe stoop and has CARLO by the throat.\n\n\tHe pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down\n\tinto the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,\n\tand hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to\n\thide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.\n\tHis shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.\n\n\tSALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.\n\n\tSONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,\n\tin a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His\n\tblows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.\n\n\tThe kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching\n\tin fascination.\n\n\tCARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.\n\n\tSONNY beats him mercilessly.\n\n\tNow SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become\n\tspectators.\n\n\tSONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into\n\tCARLO's face and body.\n\n\tCARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does\n\tnothing, other than hang onto the railing.\n\n\tSONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag\n\thim off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in\n\tthe effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;\n\teven biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go.\n\n\tIt's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will\n\tnot be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him\n\tmore; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he\n\tstammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSONNY\n</b>\t\tYou...bastard...You...hurt my\n\t\tsister... again...and I'll\n\t\tkill...you.\n\n\tHe wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.\n\tand hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,\n\tleaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN\n\twith a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially\n\tinterested.\n\n\tCARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.

Slowly the DON rises.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDON CORLEONE\n</b>\t\tI forego my vengeance for my dead\n\t\tson, for the common good.  But I\n\t\thave selfish reasons.

Because\n\t\tI was the only person in the world\n\t\tthat he truly hoped would not kill\n\t\thim.  I think you have done the\n\t\tsame with this man.\n\n\tThey walk through the DON's vegetable garden.

Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in\n\tawe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally\n\tthe Altar.\n\n\tMAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a\n\tlarge coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting\n\tcandles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives\n\ther some.\n\n\tMAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the\n\ttaper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great\n\tdignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights\n\ttwenty candles.\n\n\tShe finishes, and bows her head.\n\n<b>\tEXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME\n</b>\n\tVery few people in the streets.

We cannot see the remains of\n\tDon Corleone.\n\n\tBONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved\n\tfamily.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely\n\twith grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.\n\n\tThe VIEW ALTERS,\n\n\tand we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears\n\topenly falling, takes his turn.\n\n\tChildren are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last\n\tlook at the great man.\n\n\tCLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE\n\timmediately arranges for the members of the Five New York\n\tFamilies to pay their respects.\n\n\tFirst CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP\n\tTATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.\n\n\tThen BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.\n\n\tMICHAEL watches the scene.\n\n\tBARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined\n\tby his men.\n\n\tAs BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on\n\thim; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear\n\tfrom the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that\n\the is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don\n\tCorleone.\n\n\tMICHAEL watches silently.\n\n\tBARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.
