Those Samurai whose liege was\n     killed suffered a great shame, and they were forced to wander\n     the land, looking for work as hired swords or bandits.  These\n     masterless warriors were no longer referred to as Samurai,\n     they were known by another name: Such men were called Ronin.\n     The words hang on the screen and we hold for a BEAT, and then\n     the DRUMS are cut off by - A SILENCED GUN SHOT: Thwpfft...\n\n<b>     FADE IN ON:\n</b>\n<b>     INT. A MEDIEVAL CATHEDRAL - NIGHT\n</b>\n     It's dark, and so it takes us a minute to realize we're\n     MOVING UP STONE SPIRALING STAIRS, up up up in what we now see\n     is a medieval cathedral.  And as we continue MOVING UP\n     something TRICKLES DOWN INTO FRAME - BLOOD.  Running thin,\n     then thicker, as we CONTINUE TO MOVE UP the stairs and find -\n     A BODY, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs\n     akimbo, not so much Christ-like as victim-like.  In one hand\n     the Body holds a GUN he never had a chance to use.  In the\n     other - A DARK SHAPE, we can't quite tell what it is.\n     FOOTSTEPS sound from above and - THE KILLER walks into frame,\n     silenced pistol dangling at his side.  We don't know him, and\n     it's going to be a while before we see him again, but mark\n     his face because we'll see him again.  The Killer now picks\n     up the dark shape in the Body's hand, and we see it's - A\n     BRIEFCASE.  The Killer cuffs the Briefcase to his wrist and\n     turns to - TWO MEN standing behind him: subordinates.  The\n     Killer shows them the Briefcase.\n\n<b>                          KILLER\n</b>               God loves me.\n\n     THE BODY suddenly twitches -- this guy is not quite dead.\n     The Killer raises his silenced pistol.\n\n<b>                          KILLER\n</b>                   (to his victim)\n               But I don't think he's too fond of you...\n\n<b>     SLAM CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT. A BACK STREET - PARIS - NIGHT\n</b>\n     A PHONE RINGS, replacing the sound of the silenced gun shot\n     we expected to hear.\n\n     Rain-slicked cobblestones gleam in a twinkling of\n     streetlight.\n\n<b>     EXT. A PHONE BOOTH AT THE END OF THE STREET\n</b>\n     The source of the ringing.  We start to PUSH SLOWLY IN one the\n     phone booth, and as we do we hear the VOICE of an UGLY\n<b>     AMERICAN.\n</b>\n<b>                          UGLY AMERICAN (V.O.)\n</b>               What is this?\n\n<b>     CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     INT. A DRIVE BAR IN PARIS - NIGHT\n</b>\n     A SOCCER MATCH is in progress on a TV which sits above the\n     bar in this smokey, dim dive.\n\n<b>                          UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)\n</b>               This is not football...\n\n     And now we're PULLING BACK DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE BAR.  We\n     see THREE MEN sitting seperately at the bar, paying no\n     attention to each other.  One of these men watches the game\n     with real interest.  The Ugly American talks on from off\n     screen.\n\n<b>                          UGLY AMERICAN (O.S.)\n</b>                   (continuing)\n               ...Football is three hundred pound guys,\n               they run way too fucking fast, they got\n               helmets made of kevlar they use to spear\n               the quarterback into the next life.\n\n<b>     SLAM CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE\n</b>\n     The phone is still ringing, louder now, and we're MOVING\n     TOWARDS it while looking THROUGH AN UNSEEN PAIR OF EYES, and\n     even as we drink this in we're back in -\n\n<b>     INT. THE BAR\n</b>\n     AT THE END OF THE BAR - LARRY, the Ugly American.  He's got\n     an obvious attitude, all of it bad.  But there's something\n     about the guy -- he's not all bluster, and he has the look of\n     a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble.\n     He's big, and yeah he's got a gut, but the rest of him looks\n     solid.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>                   (talking to the air)\n               You wanna know what football is?  It's\n               hitting the other guy dirty and then\n               spitting in his face when he's down.\n               Football is all things American, and\n               American is A-Number-One the absolute\n               fucking best there is.  That's what\n               football is...\n                   (he points to the TV)\n               ...And that's not football.\n\n     The one man at the bar who's been watching the gam turns\n     slowly and gives Larry a long look.  This is VINCENT: French,\n     hard boiled and solid.  Charming when he wants to be, which\n     isn't all that often.  He gives Larry a long look and then\n     speaks -\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>                   (to Larry in perfect English)\n               Football -- American football -- is a\n               game for faggots.\n\n     A BEAT.  The other two men at the bar, who seem like tough\n     customers themselves, pretend not to watch too closely, but\n     they're interested: what's Larry going to say?  For a moment\n     it seems as if he's pissed, but then suddenly a smile breaks\n     out on his face and he laughs heartily at Vincent's remark.\n     Vincent joins in, as do the others.  In particular - THE\n     BARTENDER looks relieved -- he's tough enough to toss a bar\n     drunk, but these guys are in a different league.  The\n     Bartender laughs with the others, happy to have avoided a\n     confrontation as we go back to -\n\n<b>     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE\n</b>\n     We're almost ON TOP OF the phone booth, the phone is still\n     ringing as a HAND reaches INTO FRAME and snatches the phone\n     from its cradle.\n\n<b>                          A WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)\n</b>                   (a touch Irish accent)\n               Yes?\n\n     ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see a woman named DEIRDRE on the\n     phone: striking, dark-haired, Irish.  She carries herself\n     with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar.\n     Deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end,\n     and before she speaks she sense something - A SILHOUETTE\n     stands in the shadows of the bar, watching Deirdre.  She\n     gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking, her\n     hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               Can I help you?\n\n     The silhouette steps into a POOL OF LIGHT.  This is SAM.\n     Tough, lean, enigmatic.  Somebody you might trust, but whom\n     you'd never cross.  Sam returns her look before he speaks.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               No...\n\n     Sam moves towards the bar, and Deirdre returns to her phone\n     conversation.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               I'm here...\n                   (a beat, responding to a\n                    question)\n               No, it was nothing.\n\n<b>     INT. THE BAR - A MINUTE LATER\n</b>\n     Sam enters and by now the men inside have all come together\n     at the bar, talking casually, recognizing they're somehow all\n     here for a reason.  With Larry and Vincent we see - GREGOR, a\n     man from Eastern Europe.  His accent is hard to pin down,\n     but he most definitely has one.  Gregor has the air of an ex-\n     spook, and that's exactly what he is.  Lastly we see SWEDE --\n     blonde, muscular, and somehow blank in the face.  No, he's\n     not stupid -- he's a sociopath.  Now - Sam looks at the\n     group, which grows quiet as he enters.  Finally, Sam speaks.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Sorry I'm late...\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>                   (a challenge)\n               What makes you think we're here to meet\n               you?\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (meeting Vincent's gaze)\n               Who else would you be?\n\n     Vincent turns towards the others, including them in an\n     expansive gesture.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               Perhaps the police?\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               I know cops -- and you're no cop.\n\n     Vincent smiles at Sam's answer, satisfied, and makes room for\n     Sam to join them.  Vincent takes a pack of cigarettes, shakes\n     them so that one sticks out, and offers it to Sam.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               Cigarette?\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               No thanks.\n\n     Vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go -\n\n<b>     EXT. BACK OUTSIDE - SAME TIME\n</b>\n     THE PAY PHONE makes a sharp noise as it's cracked back into\n     the cradle.  Deirdre stands at the phone booth, lost in\n     thought.  Then, without warning - Deirdre spins around,\n     pulling TWO GUNS from inside her coat.  The move is fast,\n     performed with the grace of a professional killer, as Deridre\n     scans the horizon, but nobody seems to be watching.  Deirdre\n     pockets her guns and steps into the shadows of the street,\n     the better to watch -\n\n     THE BAR - And as Deirdre watches the bar we watch her.\n     PULLING BACK from Deirdre, UP INTO THE AIR and then MOVING\n<b>     THROUGH TO -\n</b>\n<b>     INT. A CHEAP APARTMENT - SAME TIME\n</b>\n     LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW, donw onto the street below.  Barely\n     visible we can see Deirdre.  And staring at Deirdre - THE\n     WATCHER.  Somebody we're going to see periodically through\n     the movie.  Right now he's only a SILHOUETTE with a well-\n     defined PAIR OF HANDS.  And in those hands - A KNIFE.  As the\n     Watcher watches he slowly cleans his nail with the knife,\n     methodically, perfectly.  And he watches.  First Deirdre, and\n     then turning his attention to THE BAR.  He's especially\n     interested in the bar.\n\n<b>     A TIME CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     INT. THE BAR - LATER\n</b>\n     The BARTENDER is wiping out a last glass.  When this is\n     finished he looks up at -\n\n<b>     A TABLE IN THE BACK -\n</b>\n     Where our five guys have relocated.  Now the Bartender and\n     Vincent exchange a look, and then the Bartender takes out a\n     set of keys and tosses them - THROUGH THE AIR and they SMWACK\n     into Vincent's hand.  The Bartender and Vincent speak in\n     rapid-fire French, and then the Bartender is gone.  Sam turns\n     to Vincent.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               He trusts you to lock up?\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               Let's just say he knows who I am.\n\n     Vincent takes out his pack of cigarettes and offer them\n     around the table -- again, nobody takes on.  Vincent seems\n     really disappointed by this.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>               Anybody wanna tell me what we're waiting\n               for?\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>                   (lighting his cigarette)\n               The question isn't what we're waiting\n               for... it's who.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>               And who the fuck is that?\n\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>               Whoever hired us.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               I got this gig through a contractor.\n               And he most definitely didn't know who\n               was doing the hiring, only that they\n               were paying a lot of money...\n\n     There's a kind of general look around the table -- a nod or\n     grunt of acknowledgement, indicating that all of these men\n     were hired the same way.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (continuing his thought)\n               So none of us knows who's paying the\n               freight, this is just some anonymous job.\n               For all we know, we're working for\n               different people.\n\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>               Now that is an interesting proposition.\n\n<b>                          SWEDE\n</b>               How so?\n\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>               Because if there's more than one party\n               involved, if we really are working for\n               different people, then perhaps some of us\n               are on different sides.\n                   (with great meaning)\n               Your orders might be different from mine.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>               What're you talking about, man?

Gregor, Swede and Larry look at Sam, who\n     glares them all down.  Lastly, Sam turns and looks at\n     Vincent.  The two men nod at one another, acknowledging a\n     kind of mutual respect.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               The point remains: we could be working\n               for different people.

ANOTHER ANGLE -\n\n     Deirdre has entered the bar, and she's amused by this last\n     exchange.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               It's good to see you've all got such\n               faith in our little undertaking.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>               Who the fuck are you?\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>                   (staring at Larry)\n               The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this\n               show.\n\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>               Who are you?

Once, yeah, I was -- but\n               there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and\n               I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my\n               meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the\n               rest of you, and that's all any of us\n               needs to know about the other.\n\n     Deirdre hands out several thick envelopes.

This blow hurt, but the real damage is\n     to the Leader's pride.  Now - One of the Toughs rushes at\n     Sam, only to have Sam perform what looks like a jujitsu throw\n     which savagely jerks the Tough off his feet and flattens him.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (as if it were an accident)\n               Oh man, I am sorry about that...\n                   (he sticks his hand out)\n               Let me give you a hand.\n\n     Sam reaches down as if to help the Tough, who ignores the\n     hand and totters to his feet.  As soon as he's up he turns\n     and runs away, followed by the other Toughs.  Now only the\n     leader is left behind.  He looks for a second at Vincent and\n     Sam, and then turns and runs after his friends.  Vincent\n     calls after him in French, but whatever he says isn't\n     translated.

Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy\n               SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for\n               the CIA in some place like El Salvador or\n               Afghanistan, a real mercenary.\n                   (beat)\n               Only now -- now you're like the rest of\n               us, it's a very competitive market since\n               the end of the cold war.  There's a lot\n               of hired guns out here, and not nearly\n               enough work to go around.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               That's right: there's not hardly enough\n               work these days, nothing that pays the\n               big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this\n               job, paying so much goddamned money I\n               couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's\n               paying through the nose for this.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               They certainly are.

A SIDE STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\n     The Fiat pulls up to the curb and Vincent and Sam get out.\n     Vincent leads Sam around a corner and they come to -\n\n     AN EXQUISITE PARK, a small, perfectly manicured place -- a\n     kind of mini-Luxembourg Gardens in the middle of nowhere.\n     When Sam sees the park, he draws an involuntary breath.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               Lovely, isn't it?\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               They'd have to keep something like this\n               under lock and key in New York, and it\n               would still get fucked up.\n\n     The two men enter the park, which is, indeed, open to the\n     public.  Inside, sitting on a bench in the back, almost\n     invisible from the street, we see - FRANCOIS, a stubble-faced\n     tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth.  Vincent and Sam\n     draw near.  This next conversation between Francois and\n     Vincent is in FRENCH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES.\n\n<b>                          FRANCOIS\n</b>               That's good right where you are, Vincent.\n\n     Vincent signals for Sam to stop.

Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT.  Neither Vincent\n     nor Francois pulls out a piece to shoot Sam.  Instead they\n     wait to see if Sam will respond in any way to what Francois\n     said.  The conversation now switches to ENGLISH, which (it\n     turns out) Francois speaks fairly well.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (to Vincent)\n               What's going on?\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               I just wanted to see something.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (that edge creeping into his\n                    voice)\n               See what?\n\n     Vincent isn't going to answer, but the overbearing Francois\n     chimes in.\n\n<b>                          FRANCOIS\n</b>               He wanted to see how you reacted when I\n               said that you were a cop.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (he can't believe this)\n               You told him I was a cop?\n\n<b>                          FRANCOIS\n</b>               He asked me to say it.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (looking at Vincent, truly\n                    pissed)\n               He asked you to?\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               I needed to know.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.\n\n<b>                          FRANCOIS\n</b>                   (to Vincent, in subtitled\n                    French)\n               Are you ready?\n\n     Francois's French words give Sam pause -- he's wondering\n     what's being said, as - Vincent moves towards Francois,\n     leaving Sam several steps away.

All Sam can see is an earnest Vincent listening to\n     Francois talk, almost as if Francois is giving Vincent\n     instructions.  Now - Vincent reaches into his pocket,\n     reaching for the envelope of cash he's carrying.  As he hands\n     the money to Francois, Vincent uses his free hand to pull out\n     his gun while - Sam already has his gun out -- somehow he\n     figured out what was going on -- and now Francois looks on in\n     stunned disbelief as -\n\n     Sam fires a single shot, hitting Francois in the shoulder,\n     driving him away from - Vincent, who now squeezes off several\n     rapid fire shots at the sniper, while - Francois, bleeding\n     but still very much alive, now has his piece free just as -\n     The Sniper, his gun firing wildly into the air, falls to the\n     ground, shot dead by Vincent, and now - Francois is drawing a\n     bead on Vincent when - Sam hits Francois with a fusillade of\n     bullets in the chest and now - A SINGLE SPENT BULLED CASING\n     flies through the air in SLOW MOTION and lands on the ground,\n     spinning around until it comes to a halt and - A HEAVY\n     SILENCE FALLS, as the last echo of the last gunshot finally\n     dies.  Vincent and Sam look at one another, see that they're\n     still alive, and then look back at - The two men they've\n     shot.  Francois isn't quite dead.  Blood bubbles from his\n     lips as Vincent leans over him.  Again, they speak in\n<b>     SUBTITLED FRENCH\n</b>\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               Where's my information?\n\n<b>                          FRANCOIS\n</b>                   (with a grim smile, pointing to\n                    his head)\n               In here...\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               Then you better find it in your heart to\n               tell me, Francois, because while your\n               death is inevitable, it still isn't\n               decided how painful it's going to be.\n\n     A LONG ANGLE - Vincent whispers in Francois's ear, whose grin\n     blanches as he realizes Vincent means to hurt him.  Francois\n     whispers something back and then - BANG.  Vincent shoots\n     Francois in the head, killing him instantly.  Then Vincent\n     bends down and retrieves the envelope of money which Francois\n     had tucked inside his shirt.  As Vincent does this, Sam comes\n     up from behind.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Now would be a good time to get the fuck\n               out of here.\n\n<b>     INT.

Vincent and Sam exit the car and move\n     towards the house -- a silence hanging between them.  Right\n     before they go into the house, Vincent takes out the envelope\n     full of cash that was supposed to have been for Francois.

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT\n</b>\n     A CAR sits, cloaked in shadows.  Inside sits our friend, the\n     WATCHER.  Once again we see the Watcher's knife -- once again\n     he manicures his nails with it, almost delicately, as he\n     watches the House.  It's dark -- a single light glows behind\n     a window on the third floor.  Sam's room.\n\n<b>     INT. SAM'S ROOM - SAME TIME\n</b>\n     Sam has pushed all the furniture aside to make enough room to\n     do a martial arts form.  Right now he's frozen, one leg\n     extended in a kick, balancing on the other leg.  Now - A\n     KNOCK at his door -- seconds later, it opens.  Deirdre stands\n     there, watching as Sam holds his position for a BEAT more,\n     and then retracts his leg.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               I feel as if I've wandered onto the set\n               of Enter The Dragon.

Sam parries her blows as she drives him across the\n     floor until he's got his back to the wall.  Their movements\n     are controlled, but powerful, and there's something almost\n     flirtatious about the whole thing.  Now -\n\n     Deirdre throws one last punch which Sam ducks.  He slips\n     behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest.  The\n     previous martial arts stuff was a kind of choreographed\n     exercise, but now - They spar for real -- they never hit one\n     another, but they come awfully close, hands and feet whizzing\n     through the air, throwing rapid-fire combinations and\n     techniques.  They're not angry, but they're not kidding,\n     either.  Finally - Deirdre feints a punch that distracts\n     Sam's attention from - The KICK she throws right behind her\n     punch, and she smiles as - WHUMP!  Sam wasn't distracted at\n     all -- he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches\n     her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground\n     and now - She's trapped beneath him.  The two of them are\n     breathing hard from the exertion, their faces close to one\n     another, shining with sweat and excitement and - We've gone\n     from flirting to an almost primal seduction, and with their\n     faces only inches apart Deirdre leans in to kiss Sam, and\n     he's about to meet her half way when he pulls back.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Part of me says I should just look at\n               this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But\n               then I remember you're you -- Deirdre\n               who used to belong to the IRA -- and it\n               occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge\n               come very naturally to you.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>                   (kissing him very lightly)\n               Nobody's saying they don't.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (returning the kiss, just as\n                    lightly)\n               And when I consider that, I have to\n               wonder if you don't have some ulterior\n               motive for being here, with me, right\n               now.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               I probably do.\n                   (pulling him close)\n               But for the time being, I'm willing to\n               forget about it...\n\n     They finally kiss, slowly and then building in intensity, and\n     as they start to make love the\n\n     CAMERA MOVES UP - THROUGH THE BUILDING, floor by floor, until\n     we've reached -\n\n<b>     EXT.

Which the\n     briefcase is still handcuffed to his side.  Now the Target\n     gets into his car, a BLACK MERCEDES, and as soon as he's in\n     the caravan pulls out and - The Target takes out his cell\n     phone, punches in a number and starts to talk, and as he does\n     we - PULL BACK, INTO THE AIR, leaving the Caravan behind as\n     we MOVE TOWARDS THE WATER and -\n\n     THE PROMENADE DES ANGLAIS, the long roadway that runs the\n     length of the town adjacent to the beach.  It's a special\n     place, a huge road for cars, along with a promenade for\n     tourists.  Here we come upon -\n\n<b>     AN OUTDOOR CAFE -\n</b>\n     Where we find Deirdre, a laptop in front of her, wearing a\n     HEADSET.  And, lest we think she looks out of place, we get\n     a look at -\n\n<b>     THE REST OF THE CAFE -\n</b>\n     Where many of the other PATRONS are typing away on laptops,\n     or chattering like crazy on their cell phone.  She types a\n     sentence on her keyboard, and as she types she says it out\n     loud.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               Alright, Gregor, I'm...\n\n<b>     CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     INT. A CRAMPED COMPTUER CONTROL ROOM - SAME TIME\n</b>\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>                   (finishing her sentence)\n               Ready when you are...\n\n     Gregor is sitting behind a console, looking at Deirdre's\n     message, which we can read on his laptop.  Gregor also has a\n     much bigger COMPUTER with him as well, and on this screen we\n     see - A COMPUTER GRAPHIC MAP OF NICE.  This is a map of\n     incredible detail, a high-tech graphic rendering of Nice.\n     Now - THE MAP starts to shift, randomly moving about the city\n     as it searches for the proper signal.  The computer isolates\n     an entire district of the city, enlarges a part of the\n     district, and then locates and enlarges a single street.  Now\n     - On screen a FLASHING CURSOR appears on the map, the TARGET.\n     The Cursor starts to move down one of the streets of Nice and\n     as we follow the Curson it TURNS INTO - THE TARGET CAR,\n     driving home the point that Gregor is now locked onto the\n     Target.  THE JAPANESE DRUMS we heard in the opening sequence\n     start to play again -- softly, ominously, and we're on -\n\n<b>     EXT. A SIDE STREET\n</b>\n     Where VINCENT'S FIAT is parked at a curb, Sam and Vincent\n     sitting inside.\n\n<b>     INT. THE FIAT\n</b>\n     Vincent sits behind the wheel, while Sam sits next to him,\n     loading a small arsenal of weapons.\n\n     The DRUMS grow, a little louder now, a little more urgent.\n\n<b>     EXT. ANOTHER STREET\n</b>\n     A VOLVO idles, waiting for something, Larry behind the wheel\n     of this car, and sitting next to him Swede.  The DRUMS\n     continue to play, and their volume is still low, but they're\n     jarring, setting our nerves on edge.\n\n<b>     INT.

Deirdre's\n     Voice is heard on the speaker phone.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE (V.O.)\n</b>               Hello gentlemen, are we ready?\n\n<b>     EXT. THE CAFE\n</b>\n     Deirdre looks at her laptop and relays Gregor's instructions.\n     She speaks over her headset as if she's conducting ordinary\n     business -- as if she's giving someone traffic directs\n     over the phone.  The JAPANESE DRUMS continue, quiet and yet\n     intense.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               You want to take a left, then, so that\n               you're going west.\n\n     During this next sequence, the DRUMS will continue to play,\n     building with the action as we do -\n\n<b>     THE CHASE MONTAGE: A SERIES OF CUTS AS -\n</b>\n     The Volvo takes a flying left turn -\n\n     Gregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards\n     the Promenade des Anglais, typing the results on his\n     keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a\n     bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as -\n     The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does\n     the same flight through the air and lands with a thud -\n\n     THE CARAVAN of cars -\n\n<b>     THE TARGET CAR -\n</b>\n     THE TARGET, still talking away on his cell phone - THE\n     COMPUTER MAP tracking the Target's movements, as the Map\n     shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now -\n\n     The Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build\n     to a crescendo as -\n\n     The Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind\n     together, as -\n\n     CARS 3 &amp; 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincent's Fiat,\n     which forces them to slam to a halt, as -\n\n     Larry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS\n     stop.\n\n     Larry and Swede hop out of the Volvo, and Swede brandishes a\n     MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN, with which he opens fire, a blast\n     of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing\n     against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car, which is bullet-\n     proof.  The windshield doesn't break right away -- but the\n     heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle.\n\n     Sam and Vincent are now out of the Fiat, guns drawn, blazing\n     away at BODYGUARDS, and Christ, there's an army of them,\n     pouring out of Cars 3 &amp; 4.  These guys are armed and returning\n     fire as -\n\n     Larry gets out of the driver's seat of the Volvo, and he's\n     got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a ROCKET LAUNCHER,\n     which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as\n     it scorches the air, traveling towards -\n\n     The LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized\n     what's going on behind it, and as frantic Bodyguards drive\n     back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS, blowing the\n     Car sideways.\n\n     Meanwhile - Sam and Vincent are taking out the Other\n     Bodyguards, and these guys are warriors -- they moves as a\n     team, each man with a gun in both hands, using a weapon until\n     it's out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new\n     one.\n\n     And even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray,\n     firing both of her pistols, taking Sam's place at Vincent's\n     side so that Sam can run towards -\n\n     The Target Car, where the Target is seated in the backseat,\n     pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death\n     himself as -\n\n     Swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his\n     monster gun, and now - The Windshield has started to crack\n     and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a\n     bright red as Swede's bullets tear up the body of the Driver.\n\n     Now Sam has reaches the Target Car, just as the Target, who\n     is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of\n     the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING!  Sam fires,\n     winging the Target, knocking the gun out of his hand and\n     still the Target won't give up without a struggle, he hits\n     Swede with the Briefcase.\n\n<b>                          THE TARGET\n</b>               Fuck you!\n\n<b>                          SWEDE\n</b>               Not today.\n\n     BANG.  Swede puts one shot between the Target's eyes, ending\n     his life.  Now - Swede takes out a DAI-SHO, the smaller of the\n     two traditional Japanese Samurai swords.  With one slashing\n     blow he hacks off the Target's HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs\n     the briefcase.  The SEVERED HAND is still caught in the\n     handcuffs, so that it is carried along for the ride.  Now -\n     DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back\n     towards Larry and the Volvo, and as he goes he raises the\n     briefcase (with its severed hand) in a kind of mock salute to\n     Sam, who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent, who\n     have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards, and now the\n     SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW\n     MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent\n     are already at Vincent's Fiat, waiting for Sam, and so they\n     don't notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire\n     time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by\n     any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van, a gun at his\n     side, and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry\n     and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat, and now he looks\n     back and sees - Gregor, crossing the street, and now - Sam\n     screams a warning to Larry, but it's way too late because -\n     Swede shoots Larry in the neck, hitting him above the\n     protective covering of his bullet proof vest.  Now we're\n     MOVING IN REAL TIME as - Larry manages to get his backup\n     piece drawn, a snub-nosed .38, and he fires all six shots\n     into - Swede, hitting him in the stomach -- it's the same way\n     Larry shot the target in the warehouse.  Swede is sent flying\n     backwards, where he crashes to the pavement.  For a second we\n     think he's dead, but then he gets up, in pain but alive, just\n     as Sam predicted.  Swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he\n     too wears a bullet proof vest.  By now - Larry has rolled out\n     of the Volvo, crawling away but too weak to go far, and now -\n     Swede has Larry in his sights, he's going to kill him.\n\n<b>                          SWEDE\n</b>               I don't particularly like killing, tubby,\n               but I want you to know that this one I'm\n               going to enjoy.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>                   (sees something over Swede's\n                    shoulder)\n               I don't think so.\n\n     Swede turns to follow Larry's gaze, and as he does - Gregor\n     walks INTO FRAME and puts his gun right beneath Swede's chin.\n     Before Swede can even compute this, Gregor pulls the trigger,\n     firing straight up into Swede's brain.  Then, without even\n     looking at Larry, who is lying helpless on the ground -\n     Gregor takes the briefcase and gets into the Volvo, driving\n     off just as - Sam arrives, kneeling down by Larry.  The SIRENS\n     get louder.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>                   (in shock)\n               He just...I don't believe that son-of-\n               a...\n\n     Vincent's Fiat comes peeling to a halt in front of them,\n     Vincent and Deirdre inside it as Sam manages to get Larry\n     into the back seat.  Sam doesn't get in the car yet as Larry\n     says -\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>                   (still having trouble believing\n                    it)\n               We've been crossed...\n\n     The SIRENS reach a crescendo as a group of GENDARMES arrive,\n     charging with automatic weapons drawn.  Between the French\n     cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the Target Car,\n     and now - Sam takes out a GRENADE, pulls the pin, and rolls\n     it across the ground, beneath the Mercedes, which the cops\n     have just reached.  Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES, cutting\n     off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to\n     the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge.  We start to SLOWLY\n     PULL BACK on the remains of this battle: the dead bodies, the\n     shot up cars, the broken glass, and that flaming, smoking\n     hulk of a Mercedes in the middle of the street.\n\n<b>     DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT. THE OLD CITY/NICE - SUNSET\n</b>\n     The FIREBALL of the car turns into a BLOOD RED SUN as it sets\n     in the Western sky, tinting the stone buildings of the Old\n     City a coppery red.\n\n     We're MOVING THROUGH the Old City, through the twists and\n     turns of what an American would call back alleys but that\n     pass for streets in this place.  It is quiet almost deserted,\n     then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car\n     through one of these streets, engine whining, as we - MOVE\n     DOWN yet another side street, and this sucker really is a\n     back alley, you couldn't get a car down here if you tried.\n     Finally, we come to - A RAT TRAP OF AN OLD BUILDING, and we\n     PUSH TIGHT on this building as we hear -\n\n<b>                          LARRY (V.O.)\n</b>               What is this?\n\n<b>     INT. A BACK APARTMENT - SAME TIME\n</b>\n     A SYRINGE is plunged into Larry's arm.  Sam is tending to\n     Larry's wound.

Vincent is tracing\n     Gregor's route so far, and we follow his RED MAGIC MARKER as\n     it traces a line up the highway.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               He's going north.\n                   (circles something on map)\n               That's Aix en Provence, where he used the\n               phone.\n\n     Sam runs his finger along the length of the highway on the\n     map.  Destination: Paris.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (making up his mind)\n               He's going back.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               Not necessarily.  He could go off road at\n               any number of places.  He might not even\n               be in the country anymore.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for\n               anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he\n               doesn't waste time on this road unless he\n               has to be on it in the first place.\n               Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by\n               now.  He's going to Paris.\n                   (beat)\n               Now I just hope we can find him before he\n               gets there.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               If somebody else doesn't find him first.\n\n<b>     EXT. THE TOWN OF ORANGE - DAY\n</b>\n     Orange, pronounced \"Au-Ronge\", is a mid-sized town of fifty\n     thousand souls.  It is small, charming, quaint, and it has\n     one particular thing that no other town in France can claim -\n\n     AN ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER that has been painstakingly\n     restored.  We see this Roman Theater from the outside, as we\n     MOVE THROUGH the streets of the town, to the TOWN SQUARE.\n     It's packed -- every seat in every outdoor cafe is filled\n     with a tourist having breakfast.  This normally quiet place\n     explodes one month out of the year, when an internationally\n     famous music festival is held in the Roman Theater.  We come\n     upon -\n\n     A TABLE OF AMERICAN TOURISTS: a Family.  Dad is angry at Mom.\n\n<b>                          DAD\n</b>               Opera?  This is an opera festival?\n\n<b>                          MOM\n</b>               I told you that, Henry.\n\n<b>                          DAD\n</b>               I thought you meant Phantom of the Opera.\n               You know, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cats, that\n               kind of thing.\n\n     Mom and Dad continue their discussion, but we've left them\n     behind, MOVING THROUGH the seats and cafes until we get to a\n     cafe on the outskirts of the Town Square.  Here, in the most\n     removed table in the entire Square, we find Gregor sitting in\n     the shadow of the trellis.  Unless you're on top of him you\n     can't see him, but he can see everything perfectly.  His cell\n     phone sits on the table in front of him -- he picks it up and\n     starts to punch in a number.\n\n<b>     CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT. A REST STOP ON THE HIGHWAY - MEANWHILE\n</b>\n     THE CITROEN is parked among a number of other cars.  Sam is\n     sleeping in the back seat, while Vincent is seen on an\n     outdoor pay phone at the other end of the parking lot.\n     Deirdre and Larry sit at a nearby picnic table, eating French\n     fast food, which we get a good look at as we - PAN THE LENGTH\n     OF THE TABLE, which is covered with pasta, grilled sausages\n     with dijon mustard, really good fried potatoes.\n\n     In fact, everything that's on this table is so far beyond the\n     imagination of your average American truck driver that Larry\n     can't contain himself.  He's stuffing himself, washing\n     everything down with the wine which is also sold at these\n     road-side rest stops.  Deirdre drinks coffee.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>                   (mouth full)\n               This...this is incredible.

Italy, for\n               instance, they're serious about their\n               food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere\n               in the U.K., you don't get much fancier\n               than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not\n               our thing, you see.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>               What is?\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>                   (everybody knows this)\n               Best beer in the world known to man or\n               God.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>                   (with a snort)\n               Best beer in the world?

All eyes are on\n     Vincent, who waits for a BEAT before he reveals his news.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               We've got him.\n\n<b>                          LARRY\n</b>               I'm driving.\n\n<b>     EXT. THE TOWN SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY\n</b>\n     Gregor is seated where we saw him last -- at the little table\n     in the corner cafe.  He's been here for hours, observing the\n     Town Square, and now, he finally sees what he's been looking\n     for - TWO MEN, definitely not tourists here for the music,\n     have entered the Square -- everything about these guys\n     screams GUNMEN.  Now, as Gregor watches - A PUNKED-OUT TEEN\n     comes up to the men and hands them a small envelope.  The\n     Gunmen look around the Square, trying to see where Gregor is,\n     but he's too far back in the shadows.  The Gunmen ask the\n     Teen a question, to which the Teen can only shrug his\n     shoulders.  Now - The Teen walks away, leaving the Gunmen to\n     open the envelope and look at its contents, which are quickly\n     read.  From OFF SCREEN we hear the sound of Gregor punching\n     in a number on his cell phone.  Simultaneously, the Gunmen\n     finish reading the instructions Gregor has sent them, and\n     turn around to face - A PAY PHONE.  The phone rings, and one\n     of the Gunmen goes to pick it up.\n\n<b>     EXT. ANOTHER STREET - MEANWHILE\n</b>\n     The Citroen pulls into town and slows to a crawl, cruising\n     the streets, looking for Gregor.\n\n<b>     INT. THE CITROEN - SAME TIME\n</b>\n     Vincent stares out of the window and sees something that\n     causes him to swear under his breath in French.  It's -\n\n     The Gunmen walking down the street.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               I know those men.\n\n     Sam frowns: he also seems to recognize at least one of the\n     gunmen.  None of the others in the car notice Sam's reaction,\n     but we do.  The Gunmen are heading straight for -\n\n<b>     EXT. THE ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE\n</b>\n     THE MID-AFTERNOON SUN shines down on the open air Roman\n     Theater.  The theater itself is almost two thousand year\n     old.  A semi-circle of seats surrounds a huge Stage Wall, a\n     massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its\n     kind in the world.  THE GUNMEN enter at the bottom of the\n     theater, holding ticket stubs.  They are with a Tour Group\n     led by an ANCIENT GEEZER who speaks in rapid-fire French.  As\n     the tour moves off to see the Stage Wall, the Gunmen hang\n     back and then separate from the crowd.\n\n<b>     EXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - SAME TIME\n</b>\n     THE CITROEN sits at a curb.  Larry sits behind the wheel of\n     the car, the getaway driver with the motor running.  Vincent\n     and Deirdre are already walking towards the Theater.  Sam\n     stays behind for a second to say something to Larry.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Whatever you hear, whatever happens, when\n               your partners come back out, you make\n               sure you're here with the motor running.\n\n     And on that note Sam follows after Vincent and Deirdre.\n     Larry doesn't notice it, but - THE WATCHER has found them.\n     He's a block or so away, wearing a two-day stubble of beard\n     and hugging the shadows of back alley.  Cradled in one hand,\n     barely visible but ominously present: his knife, which for\n     one moment catches a glint of sun that hits our eyes as we -\n\n<b>     CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT. INSIDE THE ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE\n</b>\n     The Gunmen have reached a point about midway up the coliseum-\n     like staircase.  Behind them we can see the Tour Group,\n     standing on the stage, being lectured to by the Ancient\n     Geezer.  In front of them the Gunmen find -\n\n     AN EXIT which leads to an interior hall.  Inside the exit\n     it's dark, while a bright sun falls down on the Gunmen.  They\n     look into the dark, unable to see a thing, while a voice\n     come at them from out of the dark.\n\n<b>                          GREGOR (V.O.)\n</b>               Thank you, gentleman, that will do\n               nicely.\n\n<b>     IN THE HALL -\n</b>\n     ON GREGOR.  It's dark in here.  There are no lights, no\n     torches.  From the dark in here, he can look out and see -\n     THE GUNMEN, who make plain targets, backlit as they are by\n     the sun.  Now we CUT BACK AND FORTH between these two ANGLES,\n     and it becomes clear that Gregor has chosen wisely -- he can\n     see his quarry, but they can't see him.\n\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>               Edvard, is that you?\n\n     EDVARD, the more dangerous looking of the two Gunmen\n     responds.\n\n<b>                          EDVARD\n</b>               Yes, Gregor, they sent me.\n\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>               I'm touched, really, that they'd send\n               someone of your caliber.

But I'm sorry to say that it's\n               too late for trust: we have a serious\n               problem.\n\n<b>                               EDVARD\n</b>               We'll double your price.\n\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>                   (now that's interesting)\n               Really?

Now we notice that\n     - The Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are coming towards\n     us.  Meanwhile, back in -\n\n<b>     THE TUNNEL -\n</b>\n     Sam is grilling Gregor furiously, his gun still to Gregor's\n     head.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Don't talk to me unless you tell me what\n               I want to hear, understand?!?

Sam runs\n     after him, tackling him just as they reach - THE OUTSIDE,\n     where the two men roll into plain sight of - The Gunmen, who\n     are still covered by Vincent and Deirdre.  Now we notice -\n     That the Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are really close,\n     no more than ten yards away, as - Sam has Gregor pinned face\n     first on the ancient stone of the theater.  He looks up at\n     the others, and that's when it happens - Edvard looks at Sam\n     and recognizes him.\n\n<b>                          EDVARD\n</b>                   (stunned, announcing to the\n                    group)\n               Do you know who he is?  He's with\n               Interpol, the Internation Police.  He's\n               a cop.\n\n<b>     A SLOW MOTION BEAT.\n</b>\n     Vincent and Deirdre don't know what to make of this, their\n     heads turn to look at Sam, and in this instant - The Tour\n     Group walks into their midst and - The 2nd Gunman reaches for\n     his piece and - Sam FIRES his gun at the 2nd Gunman, and with\n     the sharp report of the pistol we move back to REAL TIME, as -\n     The Crowd panics, screaming, and now Edvard is reaching for\n     his weapon, as - Sam shoots again, killing the 2nd Gunman,\n     and now - The Crowd is still screaming and running as -\n     Gregor shoves through the crowd into the exit, as -\n\n     Deirdre pushes through the crowd, and now she's made it into\n     the tunnel.  Now we go -\n\n<b>     OUTSIDE THE THEATER -\n</b>\n     Where Larry has heard the shot -- his piece is drawn, but\n     he's been ordered to stay in the car.  In frustration he\n     slams on the steering wheel, as we see that - Behind Larry,\n     the Watcher is slowly closing in, knife poised to strike as\n     we go back -\n\n<b>     INTO THE THEATER -\n</b>\n     Edvard tries to get to the exit, but there are too many\n     Tourists in his way, and he proceeds to shoot several of\n     them, including the Dad we saw earlier.  Seconds later,\n     Edvard has vanished into the tunnels, and now - Vincent and\n     Sam meet in the middle of the crowd.  There is time for a\n     QUICK BEAT, while Vincent glares at Sam.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I\n               should kill you.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               But you can't.\n\n     And now Sam runs into the tunnel, after the others, leaving\n     Vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh, and then follow\n     Sam into -\n\n<b>     THE TUNNELS -\n</b>\n     It's like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena.\n     Except that everything here is made of stone and the only\n     light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit\n     openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide\n     just barely enough light for us to see.  Now we do a SERIES\n     OF QUICK CUTS - Sam running, followed by - Vincent, while -\n     Edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a\n     dead end.  He turns around, looking for a way out as - Gregor\n     sees the final exit ahead of him as we go -\n\n     OUT IN THE STREET - Larry is still behind the wheel of the\n     Citroen, anxiously looking at the exit, not realizing that -\n     The Watches is almost on him, and now we're back -\n\n<b>     IN THE TUNNELS -\n</b>\n     Deirdre comes running around a corner, and now she's almost\n     reached the exit as -\n\n<b>     OUT IN THE STREET -\n</b>\n     Gregor hits the street running.  He doesn't notice the\n     Citroen parked ahead, because he's never seen it before, but\n     as he runs by -\n\n     The car door swings open and Gregor runs straight into it.\n     He smashes into the door and falls to the ground, injured.\n     Strong Hands reach out of the car and pull him in.  It's the\n     Watcher, and let's give him a name now because he needs one:\n     SEAMUS REILLY.  Seated in the front seat is - A very dead\n     Larry.  Seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear.\n\n<b>                          SEAMUS\n</b>                   (to Gregor, with an Irish\n                    accent)\n               If you want to live you'll do exactly as\n               I tell you.\n\n     THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW - Deirdre appears, exiting the\n     theater and running towards the Citroen as we go back to -\n\n<b>     INT.

Even as he\n     squeezes off the shot, Edvard turns to look at Sam, and as he\n     does so, Vincent strikes out at the gun, sending the shot\n     awry, causing it to - RICOCHET wildly, whining around the\n     room, until it - Rips through Sam's side, a nasty wound but\n     not fatal, as - Edvard tries to fire another shot but it's\n     too late, because - Vincent fires a single shot to the head\n     that kills Edvard.\n\n<b>     EXT. OUTSIDE THE THEATER - MEANWHILE\n</b>\n     Deirdre has reached the Citroen.  She looks in and sees\n     Seamus and Gregor.  Lastly she looks at the dead Larry.

They arrive at the street only\n     to see - Larry, lying dead in the street, even as the Citroen\n     speeds away from them, turning the corner before they can\n     even think to raise their guns.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               That double-crossing bitch.\n\n     Sam isn't even capable of saying that much -- he just stares\n     after the departed Citroen with a look on his face unlike any\n     we've seen in the film: \"how the hell did that happen?\"  But\n     there's no time to ponder this because they've been joined by\n     - A COP.  He's a local guy, he directs traffic and busts\n     drunks in the town square -- and he's scared shitless,\n     holding his gun in both hands, trying not to tremble, as he\n     stares back at - TWO GUNS, Sam's and Vincent's, and they're\n     both pointed at the Cop.  LONG BEAT.  In the way off distance,\n     another siren can just be heard.  Sam and Vincent glare at\n     the Cop, who strains with all his might to control himself,\n     but he can't because Sam and Vincent are death waiting to be\n     served.  The cop knows he has three seconds to make up his\n     mind.  Two.  One.  The Cop puts his gun on the ground and\n     steps back, raising his hands in the air.  Now - Sam and\n     Vincent stumble into the street, and are instantly almost hit\n     by - A CAR speeding around the corner, its Driver oblivious\n     to what's going on.  The car screeches to a halt, and the\n     Driver curses loudly in French.  And then the next thing the\n     Driver knows - A Gun is in his face.

Vincent is behind\n     the wheel, while the wounded Sam sits in the passenger seat.\n     Gritting his teeth, Sam peels back his shirt to get a look at\n     - THE WOUND, and it's small but bad -- the ricochet ripped a\n     small raw hole in Sam's side.

We PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Sam, stretched out on the\n     kitchen table.  Around him we see - Vincent and Jean-Pierre,\n     who are wearing rubber gloves and examining Sam's wound.\n     Jean-Pierre holds a mirror up so that Sam can see what's\n     going on.  Sam, with his medical training, is treating\n     himself.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>                   (to Sam)\n               It's right there, beneath the surface.  I\n               can just make it out.\n\n     Sam is in terrible pain, but necessity dictates that he focus\n     on what's going on so that he can talk Vincent through this\n     next procedure.\n\n<b>                          JEAN-PIERRE\n</b>               Are you sure you won't have a drink?\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (sharply)\n               No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the\n               mind I can control.\n                   (quick beat)\n               Alright, let's do it.\n\n     During this next sequence, we CUT BACK AND FORTH between\n     Sam's reactions to the surgery, and the mirror itself where\n     he's watching.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Douse the wound with alcohol.\n\n     Vincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the\n     wound and - Sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his\n     central nervous system.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (to Jean-Pierre)\n               Take that sponge and wipe away as much of\n               the blood as you can, keep it clean so I\n               can see.\n\n     Jean-Pierre does as Sam says, wiping away the blood that\n     keeps filling the wound.  Throughout the procedure Jean-\n     Pierre will do this; every time the sponge is saturated he\n     squeezes the excess blood into - A BUCKET which sits on the\n     floor, slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (to Vincent)\n               Take the clamp...\n\n     Vincent picks up the clamp.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Peel back the skin and attach the clamp.\n\n     Vincent attaches the clamp to Sam's wound.  It takes perhaps\n     fifteen seconds, and everyone of those seconds is agonizing\n     for Sam.  He sweats, he grits his teeth, he grunts the\n     smallest of grunts.  But he doesn't move.

Now take the forceps, and\n               remember, Vincent, what we're doing here\n               is routine.  I've done stuff like this at\n               least twenty times in the field.  There\n               are no vital organs where you're working,\n               no major muscles or arteries -- you can't\n               kill me.  Just make sure you've got the\n               bullet before you try to pull it out.\n\n     Vincent probes the wound with the forceps.  This takes\n     probably thirty seconds, and it hurts even more then when the\n     clamp was attached.\n\n     Several times - Vincent seems to have the bullet in his\n     grasp, but it slips, and each time it slips - Sam makes the\n     smallest of noises, as if to indicate the level of the pain.\n     Finally - The forceps firmly grasp the bullet, and with a\n     single tug, Vincent extracts it.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>                   (holding the bullet aloft)\n               A souvenir...\n\n     He tosses the bullet through the air, and we FOLLOW IT IN\n     SLOW MOTION as it lands in - A SAUCER, which sits on the\n     kitchen counter.  We're back in REAL TIME, as the bullet\n     rolls around the plate for a second before coming to a halt.\n     Now - Sam breathes the hugest of sighs, and his face relaxes.\n     Instantly, Vincent puts a lighted cigarette in Sam's mouth,\n     and he drags deeply on it.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>                   (to Vincent)\n               You think you can stitch me up on you\n               own?\n\n<b>                          JEAN-PIERRE\n</b>               Don't worry, we'll take care of it.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Then if you don't mind...\n                   (he hands the cigarette back to\n                    Vincent)\n               I'm gonna pass out.\n\n     And that's exactly what he does.\n\n<b>     A TIME CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     INT.

Something in Sam's speech touches Jean-Pierre.\n     He relaxes his finger on the hammer.\n\n<b>                          JEAN-PIERRE\n</b>               Survival.  I suppose that's as good a\n               cause as any.\n\n     BACK ON Vincent - Who relaxes his grip on his gun.

Why don't we come back later\n               today and do this all over again, huh?\n\n     Seamus smiles a smile that is more than a little bit\n     sadistic.

Seconds later, the car pulls out, even as -\n     Sam drives up in the Peugeot to Vincent, who picks himself up\n     off the ground and leaps into the car.

In front of the Chateau - ARMED\n     MEN.  Lots of them.  Whatever this place is, it's not one\n     that invites company.  Now we're - MOVING TOWARDS the\n     Chateau, and as we MOVE we get a glimpse of the surrounding\n     environment: ancient statues, sitting benches in private\n     gardens, small pools of fish -- you name it, this place has\n     it.  We hear VOICES, and they're talking in - RUSSIAN.\n     Heavy, thick Russian, punctuated with words like \"Da!\" and\n     \"Nyet!\" -- making it clear that we've reached the address of\n     the Russian Production Company.  BEHIND THE CHATEAU - MORE\n     GARDENS, more everything.

And\n     in this woods, looking out, we find - Vincent and Sam.\n     Heavily armed, they've just humped God knows how many miles\n     through the woods to get here.  Both men exhausted from the\n     walk -- Sam from his wound, Vincent from his smoking habit.\n     They collapse and Vincent takes out his cigarettes.

He kills the first, and then the second, and then -\n     No third.  The Third Gunman rolls out of the way as Sam\n     fires, the Third Gunman fires back and - Their shots go wide,\n     ripping into mirrors and chandeliers, littering the floor\n     with glass.  And now we're -\n\n<b>     ON DEIRDRE -\n</b>\n     Running through the halls as we hear one last burst of\n     gunfire: somebody in the ballroom is dead.

Little pustules have\n     started to form all over its surface, oozing a whitish\n     viscous liquid.

There's something between these\n     two, and now - Sam looks around and sees Deirdre's other\n     pistol lying on a broken chair, and now he -\n\n     Kicks out with his foot and hits the chair leg, causing it to\n     function as a lever, sending the gun - THROUGH THE AIR in a\n     graceful SLOW-MO arc until it - THWACKS into Sam's Hand.  Now\n     he's armed and he looks back at - Deirdre.  Her FINGER\n     tightens on the trigger, she's almost ready to shoot -- if\n     Sam raises his piece, he's a dead man.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               Let it go, Sam, walk away.\n\n     In response Sam stares at Deirdre for a BEAT and then he\n     smiles an enigmatic smile and - He steps sideways, into a\n     nearby corridor, vanishing.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               God damn it!\n\n     She runs after him but she's too late -- The corridor outside\n     is empty.  Now we're back in -\n\n<b>     THE DINING ROOM -\n</b>\n     With Gregor and Mikhi, and the tension is unbearable, because\n     they can hear the sounds of the fighting as it starts and\n     then stops, but they don't have the least idea of what's\n     going on.  Still, Mikhi won't let Gregor leave without giving\n     up the Briefcase.  Mikhi has a gun on Gregor, who in turn\n     holds the Briefcase close, ready to open it and set off the 5\n     Second Timer that will blow it up.\n\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>                   (a feral hiss)\n               We'll die if we stay here!\n\n<b>                          MIKHI\n</b>                   (threatening with the gun)\n               You'll die if you leave here.\n\n     Gregor sits back down, fairly close to Mikhi.  Then, in a\n     manner so deft that Mikhi never even notices, Gregor extracts\n     a wickedly thin stiletto blade from the leather lining of the\n     Briefcase.  Before Mikhi can even react, Gregor stabs his arm\n     forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhi's\n     throat.  Mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade,\n     already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the\n     slashed artery.  Within seconds - Mikhi falls to the ground,\n     jerking viciously in his death throes as - Gregor picks up\n     the pistol and runs to leave the room, and as he does we move\n     to - \n\n<b>     THE GALLERY -\n</b>\n     Filled with Paintings and Sculptures, nothing less than 200\n     years old.  This place is a maze, what with it's walls of\n     paintings that jut out here and there, the various corridors\n     which lead from room to room, and the sculptures which block\n     sight lines.  Now we find - Vincent, pressed against a wall, a\n     gun in each hand, while - FIVE RUSSIAN MAFIA GUYS are hunting\n     him down.  We do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS as the Five Guys split\n     up and look for Vincent, all the while speaking in low Russian\n     voices.  Suddenly one of the Guys turns a corner and sees -\n     Nothing.  No Vincent.  Now he turns back and - A FIST CRASHES\n     through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall.  It's\n     Vincent.  His hand wraps around Mafia Guy's neck, pinning him\n     in place.  Seconds later - Two quick shots rip through the\n     painting, hitting Mafia Guy in the head.  Now - The other men\n     are alerted by the shots, they come running and - Vincent steps\n     out firing -\n\n     And now it's a bullet-fest, as he gets the drop on them,\n     using the maze of the Gallery to his fullest advantage,\n     gunning them down - First one - Then two - Three, and then -\n     No four.  Vincent turns, surprised that his man wasn't where\n     he expected him to be when - A SHOT RINGS OUT, hitting\n     Vincent, a flesh wound that disarms him.  The Last Guy has\n     the drop on Vincent.  Now - The Last Guy smiles a nasty\n     little smile at Vincent and - A PISTOL spits fire and - A\n     BULLET bursts out of the Last Guy's chest.  It's Sam.  Now\n     Sam and Vincent exchange a look: Sam has, once again, saved\n     Vincent's life.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               You have to stop doing that!\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               I'll work on it...\n\n     The two men don't have time for any more words, they move\n     from the Gallery and find themselves in -\n\n<b>     THE DINING ROOM -\n</b>\n     Where they find nothing but the bloody remains of Mikhi the\n     Gangster.  Sam and Vincent are surveying the room when a\n     VOICE comes from BEHIND them -\n\n<b>                          SEAMUS (O.S.)\n</b>               Turn around real slow, and try hard not\n               to breathe when you do it.\n\n     ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus Reilly has come in behind them, and\n     he's got his gun pointed straight at Sam's heart.  If Seamus\n     is enraged at discovering Gregor's absence, he's overjoyed to\n     find Sam in his place.\n\n<b>                          SEAMUS\n</b>               It's you...\n                   (touches his face)\n               You're the one did this to my face, are\n               you?\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               That's me.\n\n<b>                          SEAMUS\n</b>               Have a nice afterlife.\n\n     Seamus pulls the trigger and his BULLET spins out towards\n     Sam, ready to blow a hole through him except that - Vincent\n     leaps forward and takes the bullet -- it rips into his side,\n     a huge splash of red against his white shirt.  He falls to\n     the ground, horribly wounded, but he's given Sam enough time,\n     and now - Sam and Seamus open fire on one another - BULLETS\n     RIPPING into the table, chewing up the china and crystal,\n     taking glass shattering bites out of the CHANDELIER above the\n     table, turning the Dining Room from a primo Louis XIV\n     showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then\n     suddenly - They're face to face, each with a gun to the other\n     - Mexican Standoff.  Suddenly, from Off Screen -\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE (O.S.)\n</b>               Seamus!\n\n     ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre has appeared, her gun leveled at the\n     two men.\n\n<b>                          SEAMUS\n</b>               Deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking\n               bullet in his head!\n\n     Deirdre hesitates, uncertain.\n\n<b>                          SEAMUS\n</b>               Do it, for Christ's sake, do it so we can\n               find that stinking Gregor, he's got the\n               bloody package!

Now - BENEATH A VERY FULL MOON, the stark figure\n     of Gregor makes its way toward the Dock.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>                   (calling out)\n               Sam...\n\n     Sam turns at the sound of her voice and sees Gregor making\n     his escape.  Sam looks back at Vincent, who is almost passed\n     out from blood loss.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               I'm really sick of you saving my life.  Go\n               out and get the bastard.\n\n     Same makes up his mind, and as Vincent passes out, Sam runs\n     out after Deirdre and towards -\n\n<b>     THE PRIVATE DOCK -\n</b>\n     And as the two of them run we MOVE WITH THEM.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               He's got the briefcase rigged to explode\n               five seconds after anybody other than\n               himself tries to open it.\n\n     And now they reach the Dock and they find - Nothing -- no\n     Gregor.  And the Boat is still there.  Before Sam can\n     restrain her - Deirdre stps out towards the Boat.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Deirdre, wait up --\n\n     But it's too late: Gregor steps out from behind -\n\n     A BOATHOUSE, and before Deirdre can even figure out what\n     happened, Gregor has her in an arm lock, a gun to her head.\n     His free hand sticks out and we see the Briefcase, which is\n     still handcuffed to his wrist.\n\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>               You might have made a good field agent\n               you arrogant American prick, but you're\n               not smart enough to go up against me.\n\n     Gregor and Deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake.  This\n     Private Dock is made completely of stone, and the drop to the\n     water is nearly five feet.  Sam has reached a position where\n     there is no right answer.  Still, he points his gun at\n     Gregor, who in turn shields himself with Deirdre's body.\n\n<b>                          GREGOR\n</b>               Go ahead, shoot...

But he can go no further, and he collapses in his own\n     blood, near death, just as - Gregor takes a step towards the\n     boat and - Sam makes up his mind and shoots - THE BULLET\n<b>     FLIES ACROSS THE SCREEN -\n</b>\n     IMPACT - The Briefcase bursts, shot open by Sam and now we're\n     in SLOW MOTION as -\n\n     Gregor relaxes his grip on Deirdre as he struggles to close\n     the case and - Deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the\n     other, into the lake, while -\n\n     BABOOM!  The case EXPLODES, a flash of phosphorescent white\n     light that incinerates Gregor and the case and whatever was\n     inside it with an explosion that knocks Sam to the ground and\n     when the light clears - Gregor and the case are gone, while -\n     THE EXPLOSION ECHOES out over the lake, booming again and\n     again until finally there is - SILENCE.  Sam looks out over\n     the lake for any sign of Deirdre - But there is none.  And\n     then, after we've held for a BEAT longer than it should be\n     possible for her to have survived - her head splits the\n     surface and she emerges, coughing.  Sam reaches down to help\n     her out.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Are you alright?\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in\n               here!\n\n     Sam pulls Deirdre out of the water and then the two of them\n     immediately turn and move towards Vincent, and as they do we\n     start to PULL BACK on them, and now the SOUNDS of SIRENS can\n     be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise.\n     And we're STILL PULLING BACK ON -\n\n     THE CHATEAU - Or what's left of it, because it's started to\n     burn, and quickly the flames start to rise into the night,\n     like something out of medieval times as we -\n\n<b>     DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>     INT. A HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Sam waits outside a hospital room, inside of which we get a\n     glimpse of - A DOCTOR tending to a heavily bandaged and\n     sedated Vincent.  As Sam waits - TWO GENDARMES and a\n     PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE approach.  The Detective looks at Sam\n     for a BEAT, and then goes to push past him.  Sam blocks his\n     way.\n\n<b>                          DETECTIVE\n</b>               I need to speak with that man.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               I'm sorry, I can't allow that.\n\n     Sam reaches into his coat, and for a moment everybody thinks\n     he's going for his gun, but instead he comes out with - A\n     PIECE OF PAPER.  He hands it to the Detective.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Call that number and ask them what you\n               should do.\n\n     The Detective eyeballs the number suspiciously.\n\n<b>     FIVE MINUTES LATER -\n</b>\n     The Detective hangs up a nearby wall phone and then looks\n     over at Sam in disgust.  Without another word, the Detective\n     signals to the two Gendarmes, and all three men exit.  Now -\n\n     The DOCTOR, a beautiful French Woman, comes up and speaks to\n     him in FRENCH -- and the amazing thing is that Sam speaks\n     back.  Everything in SUBTITLED.\n\n<b>                          DOCTOR\n</b>               You can see your friend, now.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Thank you very much.\n\n<b>                          DOCTOR\n</b>               The field dressing you put on saved his\n               life.\n                   (giving him a look)\n               Where di you learn to do that?\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Here and there, I guess.\n\n     The Doctor isn't entirely satisfied with this answer, but\n     it's the only one she's going to get, because Sam moves past\n     into -\n\n<b>     INT.

Cigarettes kill\n               more patriots than bullets.\n                   (a quick beat)\n               Besides, I'm not IRA no more.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               So where do you go from here?\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the\n               three of us might partner up -- guns for\n               hire, that sort of thing.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               I'm up for that...\n\n     The two of them turn to Sam, but he shakes his head.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               Not me.  You work too often with the same\n               people and you become friends -- clouds\n               your judgement.\n\n<b>                          DEIRDRE\n</b>               Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends\n               already we wouldn't be here now, would\n               we?\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>               She's got a point.\n                   (playing a trump card)\n               Besides, I know of a job that's\n               available.\n\n     Sam can't help it -- he's interested.\n\n<b>                          SAM\n</b>               How much does it pay?\n\n<b>     SLAM CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT. OUT ON THE RIVER SEINE - MEANWHILE\n</b>\n     SILENCE AND FOG.  A RIVER FERRY does a slow ghostly glide\n     down the river, and in seconds it approaches -\n\n     THE RIVERSIDE CAFE, which appears through the mist, looked at\n     by --\n\n     A SLEEK PAIR OF SUN GLASSES attached to a young PUNK in a\n     leather coat, and the Punk is looking at - Sam, Vincent, and\n     especially: Deirdre.  Sam looks up and shouts a warning as -\n     The Punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat, pumps\n     the gun and screams out at Deirdre with an Irish accent -\n\n<b>                          PUNK\n</b>               This is for Seamus!\n\n     BOOM!  The Punk pulls the trigger, a blast of fire as - Sam's\n     gun is already out, TWO QUICK SHOTS squeezed off and - The\n     Punk is capped twice in the head, dead, sailing away on the\n     Ferry which never stops as -\n\n     THE CAFE goes wild, CUSTOMERS running, screaming, WAITERS\n     dropping their trays.  But - Sam doesn't run, and neither\n     does Vincent.  Sam stands, stunned by what he sees - Deirdre\n     lies on the ground, hit full on in the chest: she's dead.  A\n     BEAT OF PURE SILENCE - Broken by SIRENS in the distance, but\n     quickly growing closer.  Now - Vincent looks at Deirdre's\n     corpse, then at Sam, who is unable to move.  For maybe the\n     first time in his professional career, Sam is staggered by\n     the loss of a life.  Vincent gently takes Sam's arm.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>                   (soft yet urgent)\n               We have to go, Sam, we can't be here.\n\n     Sam looks at Vincent, and for a moment Sam struggles to find\n     something to say, but he can't find a goddamned thing.  The\n     SIRENS are getting louder -\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>                   (a little louder, bordering\n                    desperation)\n               Let's go!!\n\n     Vincent literally drags Sam away and now the SIRENS have\n     arrived, followed quickly by - THE GENDARMES, who come\n     running into the Cafe but - It's empty except for Deirdre's\n     body.  Now -\n\n<b>     THE STREET ABOVE THE RIVER -\n</b>\n     Sam and Vincent are running through patchy fog, Vincent\n     leading the way, and now -\n\n     We're CLOSER ON Vincent as he runs and runs and runs until he\n     feels he's far enough away from the scene of the crime to\n     relax.  He collapses against a stone wall, chest heaving,\n     shaking out two cigarettes, one for himself and one for Sam.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT\n</b>                   (thrusting the cigarettes out to\n                    Sam)\n               Doctor's orders...\n\n     But Sam isn't there to take the cigarette -- Vincent looks\n     around, trying to see what happened to his friend, but the\n     fog has covered any sign of Sam.  Vincent stands there,\n     stunned, alone, the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that\n     slowly falls back to Vincent's side as he realizes that Sam\n     has left him on purpose.  Then - Vincent lights both\n     cigarettes at the saem time and throws one of them over the\n     stone wall - THE GLOWING CIGARETTE arcs through the air until\n     it lands in the river where it extinguishes with a hiss.\n\n<b>                          VINCENT (O.S.)\n</b>               Goodbye, Sam...\n\n<b>     BACK AT THE CAFE -\n</b>\n     The Gendarmes have secured the scene (there isn't much to\n     secure since everyone has run away).  A majority of cops\n     surround Deirdre's dead body, but - One GENDARME wanders\n     around the cafe, looking about, and then he sees something -\n\n<b>     ON THE STREET ABOVE -\n</b>\n     A SHAPE IN THE FOG.  The wind blows and the fog clears for a\n     second, and we see that it's - Sam.  Getting one last look at\n     Deirdre.  Quickly - The Gendarme points Sam out but as he\n     does the wind continues to blow and - THE FOG swallows Sam.\n     Seconds later the fog clears again, and when it does - Sam is\n     gone.\n\n<b>     FADE OUT.\n</b>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   </pre>\n\n\n\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Ronin</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=J.D.
