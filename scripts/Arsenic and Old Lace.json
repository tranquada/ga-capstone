Written in white letters on this\r\n   overview, the following words :\r\n\r\n                         This is a Hallowe'en\r\n                       tale of Brooklyn, where\r\n                        anything can happen--\r\n                         and it usually does.\r\n\r\n   Then :\r\n                           At 3 P.M. on this\r\n                         particular day, this\r\n                             was happening-\r\n\r\n   Several white circles move on the screen, then the whole screen is\r\n   covered by a huge base ball, with \u00abBrooklyn\u00bb written on it in\r\n   black letters.\r\n\r\n<b>   BASEBALL GAME - SPECTATORS - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\n   Close-up of the face of man, screaming :\r\n\r\n<b>          BASEBALL FAN\r\n</b>          I'll knock your block off, you big stiff ! You're a bum !\r\n\r\n   The camera moves away, so we can see the other baseball spectators\r\n   behind the first one.\r\n\r\n<b>   BASEBALL FIELD - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\n   General view of a baseball field, where a game is being played.\r\n   Follow several very quick sequences (one or two seconds each) : A\r\n   general view of the spectators. Then a player throwing a ball.\r\n   Then a very excited brass band playing. Then a few very excited\r\n   spectators. Then another player throwing a ball.\r\n\r\n   Finally we see a batter missing his ball. We hear the Umpire,\r\n   standing behind the catcher and heavily covered with a protection\r\n   suit, yelling :\r\n\r\n<b>       THE UMPIRE\r\n</b>       Strike ! You're out !\r\n\r\n   The batter, who missed the ball, drops his bat on the ground and\r\n   comes back to the Umpire. He tears the Umpire helmet and mask\r\n   away, and gives him a good punch in the nose. The Umpire falls on\r\n   the ground. The catcher then hits the batter. The Umpire rises\r\n   slowly from the ground.\r\n\r\n   Several very quick sequences : The ball-thrower drops his glove\r\n   and runs to the fight. Then several excited spectators stand up to\r\n   join the fight. Several player, who were waiting for their turn to\r\n   go on the field, also run to the fight. Then a view of the fight,\r\n   where all the players are hitting each other. Then the popcorn\r\n   seller, dropping his basket to join the fight. Then spectators\r\n   jumping over the balustrades to join the fight. Then another view\r\n   of the players fighting. Then a final view of the Umpire, laying\r\n   on the field and leaning on one elbow, and quietly munching some\r\n   food.\r\n\r\n<b>   NEW YORK - A BRIDGE - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\n   We see a large view of a bridge with a white boat passing\r\n   underneath.

Two journalists\r\nare approaching, one equipped with a camera.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE PHOTOGRAPHER\r\n</b>       I wonder if any big shots are getting married today ?\r\nThey stop at the door of the room.\r\n\r\nLarger view of the room, where several people are, either standing\r\nin a queue, either sitting at a table and filling forms, either\r\nchatting in groups of two or three\r\n\r\nBack to the two journalists still standing a the door.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\r\n</b>       Looks like the same suckers get married every day.\r\n\r\nHe looks around for a few second, then starts to move away.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\r\n</b>       Come on.\r\n\r\nThe photographer makes him come back. He points to someone in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE PHOTOGRAPHER\r\n</b>       Hey, the guy with the cheaters.\r\n\r\nIn a line of people queueing in front of a counter, we see\r\nMortimer Brewster, with a hat and a pair of large dark glasses. He\r\nturns around and notices the two journalists looking at him. He\r\nraises the collar of his black coat to try to hide his face. The\r\ngirl in front of him turns around to look at him. She has blonde\r\ncurly hair and wears a hat with a strange white feather. She is\r\nElaine Harper. With both his hands, Mortimer turns her face back\r\ntoward the counter.\r\n\r\nBack to the two journalists at the door of the room.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\r\n</b>       Now what's he hiding from ?\r\n\r\nHe starts moving to get a better look at Mortimer.\r\nMortimer moves in front of Elaine, who smiles.\r\n\r\nThe two journalists are now in the room, and they look at\r\nMortimer.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\r\n</b>       Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster?\r\n\r\n<b>       THE PHOTOGRAPHER\r\n</b>       Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic ?\r\n\r\nMortimer looks very embarrassed.\r\n\r\nBack to the two journalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\r\n</b>       No, it's not him. But what a scoop it would be ! The guy\r\n       who wrote The Bachelor's Bible finally getting hooked\r\n       himself. Nope. It's too good to be true. Come on, let's\r\n       snap the mayor in his new fire helmet and go home.\r\n<b>       THE PHOTOGRAPHER\r\n</b>       Hey, let's stick around, and see who the guy is.\r\n\r\nBack to the line of people waiting in front of the counter. The\r\nmarriage clerk is standing behind a set of metal bars. A couple of\r\npeople leaves the counter. It's now Mortimer and Elaine's turn.\r\nThe marriage clerk sings :\r\n\r\n<b>       THE CLERK\r\n</b>       \"Two by two they come and go. Hip hip hig hay !\"\r\n\r\nHe smiles to Mortimer and Elaine.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE CLERK\r\n</b>       Good morning, children. Your name, please ?\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Elaine Harper.\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a very soft voice. The clerk put his hand around his\r\near.\r\n<b>        THE CLERK\r\n</b>        Speak a little louder.\r\n\r\nShe speaks louder.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Elaine Harper.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE CLERK\r\n</b>       Thank you. Yours ?\r\n\r\nMortimer comes very close to the bars above the counter and\r\nwhispers.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Mortimer Brewster.\r\nThe clerk puts his hand back around his ear.\r\n\r\nThe two journalists are straining their own ears to be able to\r\nunderstand Mortimer's name\r\n\r\n<b>       THE CLERK\r\n</b>       How's that ?\r\n\r\nMortimer raises his glasses, but still whispers.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Mortimer Brewster.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE CLERK\r\n</b>       Speak up, sonny. There's nothing to be afraid of.\r\n\r\nMortimer bends down, putting his chin at the counter level. Then\r\nhe stands up again, and opens the gate in front of the clerk. He\r\nknocks his head on the bar above the gate. He straightens his hat,\r\nand brings his face close to the clerk's one. He still whispers.\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       I want to keep this undercover.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE CLERK\r\n</b>       Love her ? But of course you love her. You're going to\r\n       marry her, aren't you ?\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       No-no, you don't understand. Come here, come.\r\n\r\nWith his finger, he signals the clerk to come close to him.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       You see, I don't want this to get out for a while. I'm\r\n       Mortimer Brewster.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE CLERK\r\n</b>       You're who ?\r\n\r\nMortimer stops controlling himself and starts yelling\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Mortimer Brew...\r\n\r\nHe doesn't finish telling his name, takes Elaine's hand, and runs\r\noutside the room, dragging Elaine behind him.\r\n\r\nThe two journalists react to the news.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\r\n</b>       That's him !\r\n\r\nThey start running after Mortimer.\r\n\r\n<b>CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE MARRIAGE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\nStill dragging Elaine, Mortimer runs in the corridor.\r\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\r\n</b>       (voice over)\r\n       Mister Brewster !\r\n\r\nMortimer pushes Elaine into a telephone booth and enters behind\r\nher. There is already a man in the booth who is using the phone.\r\nWith three people in the booth, Mortimer can hardly close the door\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nThe two journalists runs in the corridor.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE OTHER JOURNALIST\r\n</b>       Oh, Mister Brewster !\r\n\r\nBut they pass the booth without noticing that Mortimer is inside.\r\n\r\nIn the booth, the man, still holding the phone receiver, tries to\r\nprotest the intrusion.\r\n\r\n<b>       THE MAN ON THE PHONE\r\n</b>       Now, look...\r\nMortimer takes the receiver from him and speaks into it.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Goodbye, dear.\r\n\r\nHe hangs up the receiver, and then pushes violently the man\r\noutside the booth. The man looks very angry, but doesn't try to\r\ncome back in the booth.\r\n\r\nIn the booth, a very exciter Mortimer is talking to Elaine.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Don't you understand ? How can I marry you ? Me, the symbol\r\n       of bachelorhood. I've sneered at every love scene in every\r\n       play. I've written four million words against marriage !\r\n       Not only hooked, but to a minister's daughter, and not only\r\n       a minister's daughter but a girl from Brooklyn. And look at\r\n       the way you look ! What is that sort of contraption you've\r\n       got there ?\r\n\r\nHe taps on a pin on the lapel of Elaine's jacket.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       That's a pin I borrowed from your aunts. You know what\r\n       they're saying, \"Something borrowed...\"\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Yeah, I know that \"Something borrowed, something blue.\"\r\n       Old, new. Rice and old shoes. Carry you over the threshold.\r\n       Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe I made fun for years.\r\n       Is this what I've come to ? I can't go through with it. I\r\n       won't marry you. And that's that.\r\n\r\nHe takes his glasses off. Elaine whispers :\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Yes, Mortimer.\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       What do you mean, \u00abYes, Mortimer\u00bb ? Aren't you insulted ?\r\n       Aren't you going to cry ? Aren't you going to make a\r\n       scene ?\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       No, Mortimer.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       And don't \u00abNo, Mortimer\u00bb me, either ! Don't you see\r\n       marriage is a superstition. It's old-fashioned. It's...\r\n       a... a... Ohh !...\r\n\r\nHe kisses her very passionately.\r\n\r\nHe stops kissing her, and gets out of the booth, dragging her\r\nbehind him. They enter the marriage bureau.\r\n\r\n<b>MARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\nThey get back a the end of the line of people waiting to be\r\nmarried.\r\nThe girl in front of Elaine winks to Elaine. Elaine winks back to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nA man in front of the girls turns toward Mortimer and smiles to\r\nhim, in a slightly idiotic way. Mortimer looks at him, a bit\r\nsurprised, and gives him a forced smile, showing his teeth.\r\n\r\n<b>BROOKLYN - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\nWe see a street in Brooklyn, in front of nice house. Written on\r\nthe screen in large white letters :\r\n\r\n                        And now, back to\r\n                     one of Brooklyn's most\r\n                      charming residential\r\n                           districts--\r\n\r\n<b>BROOKLYN - CHURCHYARD - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\nA churchyard, with a close-up on a tombstone : \u00abJacob John\r\nVendemeer died 1654\u00bb. Written on the screen in large white\r\nletters :\r\n\r\n                      --From her in you're\r\n                           on your own.\r\n\r\nWe see the gate of the churchyard, with a plate that says : \u00abThis\r\ncemetery was established in april 1654\u00bb\r\n\r\nAlong this gate, two cops are doing their beat. The older one,\r\nSargent Brophy, is talking to the younger one, Officer Patrick\r\nO'Hara.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't seem to realize. I'm\r\n       turning over to you the nicest, the best beat in Brooklyn.\r\n       Now look at that old church. And them old houses.\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Did George Washington ever do any sleeping around here ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Of course he did. Well, this whole neighborhood just stinks\r\n       with atmosphere. And look at that old house there.\r\n\r\n<b>BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\nWalking their beat, the two cops have come outside the Brewster\r\nsisters residence.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Are the original owners still over there ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Now, don't crack wise about the Brewster sisters. They're\r\n       two of the dearest, sweetest, kindest old ladies that ever\r\n       walked the earth. They're out of this world. They're\r\n       like... they're like pressed rose leaves.\r\nThey have come near a police call box. Brophy takes a key out of\r\nhis pocket to open the box\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Pressed rose leaves ?\r\n\r\nIn front of the house, there is a \u00abRoom for Rent\u00bb sign. While\r\nBrophy picks up the phone in the call box, O'Hara looks at the\r\nsign.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       The old girls must be kind of hard up, huh ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       No, no. Their old man left them fixed for life. And don't\r\n       you call them \u00abthe girls\u00bb, either.\r\n\r\nBrophy starts talking in the receiver of the call box.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Brophy. Is Lieutenant around ?\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Then, so why here do they rent a room for ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       They don't rent rooms. But you can bet if anybody came\r\n       looking for a room, they wouldn't go away without a good\r\n       meal and probably a couple of bucks in their pockets.\r\n       That's just their way of digging up people to do good to.\r\n\r\nWe get a closer view of the front of the house. A large\r\nrectangular stone, with \u00abBrewster\u00bb engraved on it. A group of\r\nchildren runs in front of the house.\r\n\r\n<b>BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\nIn the forefront of the room, Teddy Brewster is playing Mozart's\r\nTurkish March on the harpsichord. He looks a bit like late\r\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt. And he is dressed like the President\r\nwas dressed on the official pictures we've got of him... And, like\r\nthe President, he is wearing a pince-nez.\r\n\r\nIn another corner of the room, Abby Brewster is having tea with\r\nReverend Harper, Elaine's father. She looks like an old English\r\nlady, a bit like Agatha Christie's Miss Marple.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Reverend Harper, I do hope you don't disapprove of Mortimer\r\n       just because he's a dramatic critic and takes your daughter\r\n       to the theater every night.\r\n\r\n<b>       REVEREND HARPER\r\n</b>       It's not so much that I disapprove of his being a critic,\r\n       but no man, no man with this published attitude on\r\n       marriage...\r\n\r\nClose-up on the book Reverend Harper just took on the table :\r\n\u00abMarriage, a Fraud and a Failure, by Mortimer Brewster\u00bb.\r\n<b>       REVEREND HARPER\r\n</b>       ...should take any man's daughter anyplace...\r\n\r\nHe sneezes.\r\n\r\n<b>       REVEREND HARPER\r\n</b>       ...at any time.\r\n\r\nHe sneezes again, louder this time. Teddy stops playing and there\r\nis a puzzled look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n<b>       TEDDY\r\n</b>       I must be catching cold.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       (to Teddy)\r\n       No, dear. It was Reverend Harper who sneezed.\r\n       (to Reverend Harper)\r\n       Bless you.\r\n\r\nTeddy puts back in his pocket the handkerchief he had taken out\r\nand starts playing again.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       We mustn't be angry with Mortimer. He's so very much in\r\n       love with her. And Sister Martha and I are so happy about\r\n       it. He used to come to see us only occasionally, and now,\r\n       now he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.\r\n\r\n<b>BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\nThe two cops, Brophy and O'Hara, are mounting the steps to the\r\nBrewster sisters house.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Remember now, watch your language.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Besides, you know I'm not a swearing man.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       You'd be surprised what they'd consider swearing.\r\n\r\nHe rings the doorbell.\r\n\r\n<b>BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\nAt the sound of the doorbell, Teddy stops playing.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Oh, will you excuse me ?\r\n\r\nShe gets up from her armchair.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       No, no, Teddy, dear.

O'Hara looks at his Sargent with a\r\nperplexed expression, and takes longer to put his arm down\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       You know the Reverend Doctor Harper from the church next\r\n       door ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Hello, Reverend.

Teddy's eyes are following\r\nhim with the same puzzled expression. O'Hara feels less and less\r\nat ease.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Oh, Teddy, will you run upstairs and bring down your Army\r\n       and Navy from Aunt Martha's room.

The minute hand of the clock falls down to the\r\nhalf-hour position. O'Hara is very disturbed and points his stick\r\nto his Sargent, who seems to be totally unmoved by the event and\r\nlaughs with Reverend Harper and Abby.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       It gives us something to do as we are sitting around the\r\n       station. You get tired of playing cards.\r\n\r\nAbby moves away from them to the grandfather's clock. She puts the\r\nminute hand back into its original position. Brophy and Reverend\r\nHarper joins her by the clock.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       So these are the toys ?\r\n\r\nO'Hara picks up the box in which the toys are stocked.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       How's Missis Brophy ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Oh, she's better, thank you.

O'Hara jumps and drops the box with\r\nthe toys on the floor. Reverend Harper and Brophy seem to be less\r\nmoved by the event.\r\n\r\nBrophy stands back and points his finger up to Teddy.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Oh, Teddy, you promised me you wouldn't do that anymore.\r\n\r\nTeddy, still standing on the balcony, answers him leaning on the\r\nbalustrade.\r\n\r\n<b>       TEDDY\r\n</b>       But I have to call a Cabinet meeting to get the release of\r\n       those supplies.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Now don't do that again. Do you hear me ?\r\n\r\nTeddy goes back into his room, slamming the door behind him. The\r\ngrandfather's clock chimes once, and the minute hand falls back to\r\nthe half-hour position. O'Hara jumps and looks at the clock.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       He used to do that in the middle of the night, and\r\n       neighbors raised Cain with me.

Like her\r\nsister, she looks like an old English lady. She is wearing a short\r\ncape and a hat, and she carries a cylindrical can with a handle.\r\n\r\nShe closes the door.\r\n\r\n<b>       MARTHA\r\n</b>       Oh, well, now, isn't this nice !\r\n\r\nShe goes to Brophy and the Reverend.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.\r\n\r\n<b>       MARTHA\r\n</b>       How do you do, Mr Brophy ?\r\n\r\n<b>       REVEREND HARPER\r\n</b>       Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.\r\nO'Hara has picked up the toys and he joins the group.\r\n\r\n<b>       MARTHA\r\n</b>       Reverend Harper, how do you do ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Oh, Miss Martha, this is Officer O'Hara.

They\r\nlaugh and then slightly move the curtains open a few inches to\r\nhave a better look.\r\n\r\nBack to the tree. The couple is hidden by the tree. They separate\r\nand move a little away from each other, each one of them appearing\r\non either side the tree.\r\n\r\nElaine drags Mortimer by the hand from behind the tree.\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       But, Mortimer, you're going to love me for my mind, too ?\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       One thing at a time.\r\n\r\nShe starts running away from him.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Oh !

We've got a drawing-room on the train,\r\n       the bridal suite in the hotel, and tomorrow morning\r\n       we go over the falls in a barrel.\r\n\r\nElaine kisses Mortimer very passionately.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Go on, darling, hurry and pack.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       I don't have to.

That's what\r\n       I hate about women.\r\n\r\nMortimer kisses her.\r\n\r\nBack to the cab driver who is pacing in front of his car. He rubs\r\nhis chin.\r\n\r\n<b>       CAB DRIVER\r\n</b>       I wonder what Mary's doing now ?\r\n\r\nMortimer and Elaine are still kissing.

Oh, he's probably in prison or hanged or\r\n       something by now.\r\n\r\nHe walks across the room and starts searching on the table.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       I saw a play, which had a character in it.

When the curtain goes up, the first\r\n       thing you see is a dead body.\r\n\r\nWhile talking, he keeps on searching and opens the lid of the\r\nwindow-seat. He gives its insides a quick look and closes it back,\r\nand then moves away.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       The next thing...\r\n\r\nHe stops in his tracks and looks back at the window-seat. He jumps\r\nback to it, opens the lid and closes it very quickly. He then sits\r\non the seat with a frightened look on his face. Slowly, he kneels\r\ndown on the floor, and opens the lid again, but very slowly. He\r\ntalks to whatever, or whomever, is in the seat.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Hey, mister.\r\nHe remains a few seconds seated of the seat, with a very puzzled\r\nface.\r\n\r\nWe hear Elaine whistling. Mortimer tries to whistle back, but no\r\nsound comes from his mouth. He tries again, but with no more\r\nsuccess. He seems in shock.\r\n\r\nHe looks at the kitchen, then at the seat. There is horror on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHis two aunts come from the kitchen, singing and carrying things\r\nfor the celebration.\r\n\r\nMortimer shows a forced smile.\r\n\r\nThe two sisters puts things on the table, then they come to\r\nMortimer, who is still seated on the window-seat. Abby is carrying\r\na big bowl of rice, and the two girls start throwing rice on him.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Happy bridegroom !\r\n\r\n<b>       MARTHA\r\n</b>       Congratulations, darling !\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Never mind that now.

We don't\r\nsee her, but we imagine she doesn't understand, because Mortimer\r\nrushes to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n<b>BREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n</b>\r\nMortimer rushes into the kitchen.\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Aunt Abby !

The children are saying\r\nincomprehensible words of thanking.\r\n\r\nMartha closes the window on them, and switches on the lights.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Oh, the dears.

Do you remember when we\r\n       took the little Schultz boy to the movies and I was so\r\n       frightened ? It was that face.\r\n\r\nJonathan turns around and look harshly at Einstein, who seems a\r\nbit uneasy.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy. Don't worry. The last\r\n       five years, I give him three different faces. I give him\r\n       another one right away. That last face. I saw that picture,\r\n       too, just before I operated. I was intoxicated.\r\n\r\nJonathan grabs Einstein's collar and squeezes it.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       You see, doctor, what you've done to me ?

You are home in this lovely house.\r\n\r\nJonathan lets go of Einstein, who walks toward the two sisters.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       You know how many times he tells me about... about\r\n       Brooklyn, about this house, and about his aunts he loves so\r\n       much ? They know you, Johnny. Please tell him so.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Well, Jonathan, it's been a long time.\r\n\r\nJonathan sits down.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Bless you.

Unless you're\r\n       in a hurry to go somewhere.\r\n\r\nShe goes to the kitchen with the glasses. Martha picks up the wine\r\ncarafe, to the disappointment of Dr. Einstein, and follows her\r\nsister toward the kitchen. Before entering the kitchen, she puts\r\nthe carafe back on the shelf where it was before. She then closes\r\nthe kitchen door after her.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Well, Johnny, where do we go from here ?

Then Einstein appears behind\r\nthe window, carrying a suitcase. Jonathan helps him to bring the\r\nsuitcase in the room.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Jonathan, your room is waiting for you. You can go right\r\n       up.\r\n\r\nEinstein, still outside the window, gives Jonathan another\r\nsuitcase.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours. You two run along\r\n       to bed.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Oh, but you must be very tired. Both of you. And we don't\r\n       go to bed this early.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       It's time I came home to take care of you.\r\nBehind Jonathan, Einstein has come into the room and is closing\r\nthe window, and then the drapes.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       (to Einstein)\r\n       Take the bags upstairs.\r\n\r\nEinstein takes the two suitcases and starts moving away.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       For the instruments, I'll come back later.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Good night.\r\n\r\nEinstein slightly bows to Abby.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Now, we'll all go to bed.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       I'll wait until you're up and then turn out the lights.\r\n\r\nEinstein has already almost reached the balcony. Martha starts\r\nclimbing, with Jonathan behind her.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Run along, Aunt Martha. Just off the laboratory, Doctor.\r\n\r\nEverybody reaches the balcony. Einstein disappears at the end of\r\nthe balcony, and Martha enters her room. Jonathan turns around and\r\nlooks down at Abby.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       All right, Aunt Abby.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       I'll be right up.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Now, Aunt Abby ! Turn out the lights.\r\n\r\nAbby goes to the switch near the front door, and switches the\r\nlights off. The room is completely dark.\r\n\r\nAbby climbs the stairs, reaches the balcony, and walks slowly pass\r\nJonathan, who is still standing at the same place. Then, she\r\nquickly enters the room she shares with her sister, who is holding\r\nthe door open for her.\r\n\r\nJonathan moves along the balcony and starts climbing the stairs to\r\nthe upper floor. He stops after a few steps, and sees the door of\r\nhis aunts' room opening slowly. Abby comes out.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Aunt Abby.\r\n\r\nAbby quickly goes back into the room and closes the door. Jonathan\r\nresumes his climbing.\r\nThe camera moves down into total black darkness, and then into the\r\nroom, where we see some light underneath the cellar door. We hear\r\nsteps, and the door opens to reveal Teddy, still in his colonial\r\ncostume, but without the helmet. He stops a few seconds, then\r\nstarts crossing the room, only lit by light coming from underneath\r\nthe kitchen door. We hear the lid of the window-seat creaking, and\r\nwe guess Teddy has just opened it. Shuffling noises. Then we see\r\nthe shadow of Teddy carrying something apparently heavy. We hear\r\nthe cat screaming, and we guess Teddy must have stepped on its\r\ntail. When Teddy comes into the light from the open door of the\r\ncellar, we discover he is carrying a human body, which could only\r\nbe Mr. Hoskins' one taken from the window-seat. Teddy turns around\r\nand starts going backward down the steps to the cellar. He stops a\r\nfew seconds to close the door. Then we hear noises of something\r\nfalling, and we guess that Teddy must have missed a step and\r\nfallen all the way down to the cellar.\r\n\r\nBlack screen during one second.\r\n\r\nEinstein is going down the staircase, lit only by a match he is\r\nholding in his hand.\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       He's all right, Johnny.\r\n\r\nWhen he gets on floor level, he meets Jonathan.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       I'll open the window. You go round and hand him through.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       But he's too heavy for me.\r\n\r\nHe burns his finger and blows the match. The scene becomes\r\ncompletely dark. We see only shadows.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       You go outside, Johnny, and push, and I'll stay here and\r\n       pull. And then together we take him down to Panama. Huh ?\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       All right. We must be quick. I'll take a look around\r\n       outside the house. When I tap on the glass, you open the\r\n       window.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Yeah.\r\n\r\nJonathan moves to the front door, opens it, stops to look around,\r\nand then closes the door.\r\n\r\nEinstein walks slowly in the room.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       It's dark in here.\r\n\r\nHe bumps into something. We hear the lid of the window-seat\r\ncreaking several times.\r\nEinstein light another match, and we discover he has fallen into\r\nthe open window-seat, where he is now lying\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Where am I ? Oh, here I am.\r\n\r\nHe slowly gets out of the seat.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Who left this open ?\r\n\r\nJonathan taps on the window. Einstein blows the match and opens\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Johnny ?\r\n\r\nWe see only shadows in the dark, but we guess Jonathan is handing\r\nMr. Spenalzo's corpse to Einstein, who will then put it in the\r\nwindow-seat.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Okay, Johnny, wait a minute. Hand him over. Now I have him.\r\n       \u00abAllez !\u00bb Up ! Now, wait a minute, Johnny. You lost a leg\r\n       somewhere. Hey, help me. He's so heavy. Now I have him. Now\r\n       I got him.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Be careful.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Oh, but his shoe came off. Help me, Johnny. He's so heavy.\r\n       Now I've got him !\r\n\r\nKnocking at the door.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Hey, Johnny, somebody's at the door. Go open, quick.\r\n       I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick !\r\n\r\nSome more knocking. We hear the creaking of the lid of the window-\r\nseat, and we guess Einstein is closing it.\r\n\r\nThe front door opens slowly, and Elaine enters the house.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Mortimer ! Aunt Abby !\r\n\r\nWe see the frightened face of Einstein.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       (voice over)\r\n       Aunt Martha !\r\n\r\nJonathan enters through the front door left open by Elaine, closes\r\nit and locks it.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       (looking frightened)\r\n       Who is it ? Is that you, Teddy ?\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Who are you ?\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       What are you doing here ?\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       I came here to see my husband, Mortimer.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Why did you say your name was Harper ?\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Well, it is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster. I'm not very\r\n       used to it. I'm a brand-new Brewster.\r\n\r\nEinstein goes to the front door and switches the lights on.\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Doctor !\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       It's all right, Johnny. It's okay.\r\n\r\nEinstein has his little bottle in one hand, and, with the finger\r\nof the other hand, he tries to explain to Jonathan that the corpse\r\nis safely in the window-seat.\r\n\r\nJonathan looks at Einstein, and then goes across the room to look\r\naround. He even moves the drapes of a window to look outside.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       (voice over)\r\n       Maybe you'd better explain what you're doing here.\r\n\r\nJonathan keeps on checking around. He goes to the window above the\r\nwindow-seat, and looks outside.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       We happen to live here.\r\n\r\nHe spots an orphan shoe on the floor and picks it up.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       (voice over)\r\n       You don't live here. I've been in this house every day, and\r\n       I've never seen you before. Where are Miss Martha and Miss\r\n       Abby ? What have you done to them ?\r\n\r\nEinstein tries to explain to Jonathan, without using words, that\r\nthe shoe belongs to the corpse in the window-seat.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves. May I present\r\n       Doctor Einstein ?\r\nHe puts the shoe on the table, then lifts the tablecloth to look\r\nunderneath it.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Doctor Einstein ?\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       A surgeon of great distinction. And something of a\r\n       magician.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Now I suppose you're gonna tell me that you're Boris...\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       (cutting her very harshly)\r\n       I am Jonathan Brewster.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Oh !

Oh, that explains everything. Now that\r\n       I know who you are, I'll just be running along, if you'll\r\n       kindly unlock the door.\r\n\r\nThey move to the front door, beside which Einstein is standing,\r\nsmiling. Jonathan unlocks the door. He opens it a few inches, but\r\nstands in the way of Elaine, ready to got out.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       \u00abThat explains everything.\u00bb Just what do you mean by that ?\r\n       Why do you come here at this time of night ?\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Well, I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up.

But if he's not home, I'll\r\n       run...\r\n\r\nShe tries to run away, but Jonathan grabs her arms and holds it\r\nvery firmly.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       You've given two names.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       You're hurting me !\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       I think she's dangerous.\r\n\r\nTeddy comes in through the cellar door. He has his helmet back on\r\nhis head and wears heavy working gloves.\r\n\r\n<b>       TEDDY\r\n</b>       No visitors. It's going to be a private funeral.\r\n\r\nHe crosses the room and starts climbing the stairs. Both Jonathan\r\nand Einstein are now holding Elaine.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Teddy !

Don't play rough with the\r\n       gentlemen.\r\nHe pulls out his imaginary sword and rushes up the stairs.\r\n\r\n<b>       TEDDY\r\n</b>       Charge !\r\n\r\nHe rushes into his room and slams the door.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Teddy !\r\n\r\nElaine starts screaming. Jonathan holds a handkerchief over her\r\nmouth. Einstein runs to the front door and switches the lights\r\noff.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Doctor, the cellar.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Let go of me !

What's happening down there ?\r\n\r\nThe lights are switched back on, and we see Abby and Martha on the\r\nbalcony, just coming out of their room. They are both dressed in\r\nblack funeral clothes.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       What's the matter ?

The two sisters\r\nstarts going down the stairs.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Don't answer that.\r\n\r\nAnother doorbell. The two sisters are running downstairs.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Don't answer that !\r\n\r\nElaine rushes through the cellar door, screaming. She runs into\r\nMartha's arms, followed by Einstein.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Let go of me !\r\n\r\nMore knocking and ringing at the door. Abby goes and opens the\r\ndoor. Mortimer enters the house..\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Where's Teddy ? Is he upstairs ?\r\n\r\nElaine rushes to Mortimer and holds him by the neck. He gets rid\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Never mind that now, darling, please.\r\n\r\nHe starts climbing the stairs and looks, surprised, at Martha.\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       What are you doing with your best clothes on ?\r\n\r\nHe suddenly notices Jonathan's presence and stops mounting the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Holy...

So do\r\nAbby and Martha on either side of him. Since the three of them are\r\ntalking together, it is impossible to understand what they say.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       I've come back home, Mortimer.\r\n\r\nAt the voice of Jonathan, the three women stop talking\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       What ?\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       I've come back home, Mortimer.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       \u00abI've come back home, Mortimer.\u00bb Listen, it talks !\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Yes, I talk.

You know, you know how in those\r\n       days the Indians used to scalp the settlers ? Well, he used\r\n       to scalp the Indians.\r\n\r\nElaine bends out of her window to hug Mortimer.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Darling, that's ancient history.\r\n\r\nMedium shot on the doctor and Teddy walking arm in arm among the\r\ntombstones.\r\n\r\n<b>       TEDDY\r\n</b>       Yes, Doctor, I'll run for a third term, but I won't be\r\n       elected.

The doctor clears loudly his throat to\r\nattract Mortimer's attention.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR GILCHRIST\r\n</b>       Those papers.

Yes.\r\n\r\nHe pulls the papers from his jacket pocket, and gives them to the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR GILCHRIST\r\n</b>       I'll enjoy committing him to any place.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       You will ?\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR GILCHRIST\r\n</b>       I've just been appointed Ambassador to Bolivia !\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Ah, you see ?

Now, in this, there's a man...\r\n       Now listen to this...\r\n\r\nBehind Mortimer, the cellar door opens silently and Jonathan\r\nenters slowly into the room, without Mortimer noticing him.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Now, he knows he's in the house with murderers. So he ought\r\n       to know he's in danger. He's even been warned to get out of\r\n       the house. And does he go ?\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Yes.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       No, he doesn't. He stays ! This fellow doesn't even have\r\n       sense to be scared or to be on his guard. No, no. The\r\n       murderer even invites him to sit down. What do you think he\r\n       does ?\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Well, I don't know.\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       He sits down ! I remember what he did. He deliberately\r\n       pulls up a chair like that and he sits down in it.\r\n\r\nMortimer goes to a wooden armchair and sits down in it. He puts\r\nhis glass on the table.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Isn't that great ? So there he is, all waiting to be\r\n       trussed up and gagged. What do you think they used to truss\r\n       him up with ?\r\n\r\nHe keeps on laughing while talking.\r\n\r\nClose-up of Jonathan's face, smiling.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       (voice over)\r\n       Oh, what ?\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       (voice over)\r\n       The curtain cord.\r\n\r\nJonathan looks in the direction of the window... and the curtain\r\ncord.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Curtain cord ? But didn't he see him get it ?\r\n\r\nBehind the seated Mortimer, Jonathan is silently walking to the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Seen him get it. No. The silly chump sits down with his\r\n       back toward the murderer.\r\n\r\nMortimer turns slightly on his chair, but without taking his eyes\r\noff Einstein, and, of course, without looking at his brother\r\nbehind him, quietly cutting the curtain cords with a jack-knife.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       All he has to do is look around, but does he ? No !\r\n\r\nMedium shot on Jonathan cutting the curtain cords.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       (voice over)\r\n       No... Look, you see, brother Heidelberg, in a play or even\r\n       in a movie, for that matter, ...a fellow never sees or\r\n       hears anything. No. That's right.\r\n\r\nJonathan folds the jack-knife and puts it in his pocket. He\r\nprepares the cords he has just cut. Einstein takes a napkin on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       But what does he do ?\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Oh, what does he do ? Well, the big chump sits there. This\r\n       fellow's supposed to be bright. He sits there.\r\n\r\nJonathan is now just behind Mortimer's chair, with the cord ready\r\nin his hands.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Now get a load of this. Look, look at the attitude. Large\r\n       as life ! He sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged.\r\n       The big dope !\r\n\r\nHe bursts out laughing... But only for two seconds, because\r\nJonathan ties up his arm to the armchair from behind, and Einstein\r\nshoves the napkin in his open mouth. Einstein then helps Jonathan\r\nto tie Mortimer's legs to the legs of the armchair. Then, with the\r\nhelp of a knife, he puts all the napkin in Mortimer's mouth.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       You were right about that fellow. He wasn't very bright.\r\n\r\nFade out, and then fade in on the same scene a few moments later.\r\nThe lights have been dimmed. Mortimer is completely tied on the\r\nchair, and the gag is tied around his head.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Yes, Mortimer. I've been away for twenty years. But never,\r\n       my dear brother, were you out of my mind.\r\n\r\nJonathan is lighting candles on the table.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you.\r\n\r\nHe opens his instruments case. We see the surgery instruments\r\nshining in the candles light.\r\n\r\nClose-up on Mortimer's very frightened face.\r\n\r\nEinstein sits down near the table. He seems depressed at the sight\r\nof his surgery instruments.\r\n\r\nJonathan takes a small phial from the inside pocket of his jacket,\r\nopens it, smells it and closes it, and puts it back in his pocket.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       The more you struggle, Mortimer, the more you strangle\r\n       yourself. Later on, you may consider that a blessing.\r\n\r\nHe takes a curved forceps from the case and plays with it.\r\n\r\nClose-up on Mortimer's frightened face.\r\n\r\nEinstein wipes his face with a napkin.\r\n\r\nJonathan takes a scalpel from the case and feels the sharpness of\r\nthe blade.\r\n\r\nEinstein takes a bottle on the table and brings it to his mouth.\r\nUnfortunately, the bottle is empty.\r\nJonathan takes a pair of surgery gloves from the box and puts them\r\non.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Now, Doctor, we go to work.\r\n\r\nEinstein stands up.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Johnny, for me, please, the quick way. Please.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Doctor, this must be an artistic achievement.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Please.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       After all, we're performing before a very distinguished\r\n       critic.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Johnny, please !\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Doctor !\r\n\r\nEinstein takes his jacket off. He is almost crying.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       All right. Let's get it over with. No, but, Johnny, I\r\n       cannot see this without a drink.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Pull yourself together, Doctor.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       But I can't pull myself together without a drink. Johnny,\r\n       you remember when we came in here, there was some wine. And\r\n       then they took it. Where did they put it ?\r\n\r\nA glint of hope appears in Mortimer's eyes at the mention of his\r\naunts' wine.\r\n\r\nEinstein runs across the room to the shelves where the carafe of\r\npoisoned wine has been put away.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Johnny, I found some wine. I found some wine.\r\n\r\nHe comes back to the table with the carafe and glasses.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Here, I'll split it with you. We both have a drink before\r\n       we operate. Oh, I am so happy that we don't have to operate\r\n       without a drink.\r\n\r\nEinstein gives a glass to Jonathan. Mortimer, who recognized the\r\ncarafe, is smiling behind his gag. Jonathan smells the glass.\r\nEinstein has his glass almost to his lips, when Jonathan stops\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Doctor. One moment, please. Where are your manners ?\r\n       (to Mortimer)\r\n       Yes, Mortimer. I realize now that it was you who brought me\r\n       back to Brooklyn. We drink to you. Doctor ! To my dear,\r\n       dead brother.\r\n\r\nThey clink their glass in front of Mortimer's face. Einstein\r\nraises his glass before drinking.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Prosit !\r\n\r\nTeddy suddenly comes out of his room and plays his bugle very\r\nloudly.\r\n\r\nBoth Jonathan and Einstein drop their glass on the floor.\r\n\r\nTeddy then goes back into his room and slams the door. The grand-\r\nfather clock chimes once.\r\nMortimer seems very disappointed. He moves back and forth in his\r\nchair, moaning.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       That idiot ! He goes next. That's all. He goes next !\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Not Teddy ! Not Teddy ! Please !\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       We'll get to him later.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Not Teddy, we won't get to him at all !\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Now, we have to work fast. The quick way.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Oh, the quick way, oh yes ! If it has to be, then the quick\r\n       way. Yes, I'll help you with it.\r\n\r\nThey starts getting the instruments out of the case.\r\n\r\nAt the front door, we see the shadow of a policeman behind the\r\nfrosted glass. He rings the doorbell.\r\n\r\nJonathan and Einstein stop what they were doing. Einstein closes\r\nthe case and puts it under the table. He also puts all the\r\ninstruments lying on the table on the floor, behind the case.\r\n\r\nKnocking on the door. The door being open, O'Hara enters the room.\r\nHe spots Jonathan and Einstein.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Hey, the colonel has to quit blowing that horn.\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       It's all right, Officer. We're taking the bugle away from\r\n       him.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       I'd better talk to him myself. Where's the lights ?\r\n\r\nHe finds the switch by the door, and switches the lights on. He\r\ngoes to the stairs and starts mounting them, when he hears\r\nMortimer moaning. He goes down and walks toward Mortimer.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Hey ! You stood me up ! I've been waiting for you for over\r\n       an hour at Kelly's. What happened to him ?\r\n\r\nO'Hara is surprised to find Mortimer tied up on his chair. He\r\npoints his stick to Jonathan.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Nothing. He was explaining a play he saw the other night\r\n       and that's what happened to a poor man in the play.\r\nHe walks away with his jacket in his hands.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Oh, I see. Did that really happen in a play you saw ? How\r\n       do you like that ? You can't trust nobody no more. They\r\n       practically stole that from the second act of my play. You\r\n       know, in the second act, just... Well, maybe I'd better\r\n       start at the beginning.\r\n\r\nMortimer is moving and moaning on his chair. He tries to explain\r\nby movements of his face that he would like to have his gag taken\r\noff.\r\n\r\nBehind O'Hara, Einstein starts mounting the stairs, and Jonathan\r\nstands up at the bottom of them.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Huh ? Oh, yes, sure.\r\n\r\nHe puts his hands to Mortimer's face to take off his gag.\r\n\r\nEinstein runs upstairs, followed by Jonathan.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, O'Hara removes his hands and smiles broadly.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Nooo ! You've got to hear the plot !\r\n\r\nHe takes his jacket off.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       My mother's sitting there, making up, see. And, like a\r\n       flash, suddenly, out of a clear sky, the door comes open\r\n       and a man with a black mustache comes in.\r\n\r\nOn the stairs behind O'Hara, Jonathan takes his jack-knife out of\r\nhis pocket and opens it.\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       He turns to my mother and he says, \u00abMiss Peaches La Tour,\r\n       will you marry me ?\u00bb That's the first scene. My mother\r\n       doesn't tell him they're married. That's the surprise !\r\n\r\nEinstein, who has seen the knife, tries to stop Jonathan. But\r\nJonathan keeps on walking slowly downstairs.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Oh, What a kick ! All right. Twenty-five years pass. Well,\r\n       in the meantime, there's me. Growing into a magnificent\r\n       specimen. So what do I do ? I join the police force and\r\n       become one of New York's finest. Well, I'm cleaning out a\r\n       crooked laundry, see ?\r\n\r\nClose-up on Jonathan's hand holding the knife, the blade of which\r\nis shining in the light.\r\n\r\nMortimer stares at the knife\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Little do I know it, but there is a dope fiend with a long\r\n       knife crawling after me. I'm in great danger. It's getting\r\n       you, ain't it ? I can see it in your eyes.\r\n\r\nActually, Mortimer's eyes are trying to attract O'Hara's attention\r\nto Jonathan, just behind him now.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Well, you ain't heard nothing yet.\r\n\r\nEinstein tries to stop Jonathan, but Jonathan pushes him away.\r\nEinstein takes off one of his shoes, and hits Jonathan very hard\r\non the head with it. Jonathan falls on the floor.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       All of a sudden, a fire breaks out. What an effect ! The\r\n       firemen rush in and who do you think is leading them ?\r\n       Mayor Fiorello La Guardia !\r\n\r\nO'Hara turns around and sees Jonathan lying on the last steps of\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       What's the matter with him ?\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Yeah, probably your play put him to sleep.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       What ?\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       I personally, I like it very much.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       It's probably over his head, huh ?\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Yeah.\r\nO'Hara looks at Jonathan's face.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Where have I seen that face before ?\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       No, please.\r\n\r\nHe kneels beside Jonathan's body, and O'Hara returns to Mortimer.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Well, the scene changes. It's an evolving stage. I'm\r\n       walking along my beat, well, like that, casual-like, when a\r\n       guy that I'm following, it turns out he's really following\r\n       me !\r\n\r\nKnocks at the door. O'Hara turns to Einstein.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       (to Einstein)\r\n       Don't let nobody in.\r\n       (to Mortimer)\r\n       I figure I'll outsmart him. There's a vacant house on the\r\n       corner.\r\n\r\nEinstein peeks through the drapes to have a look at the outside of\r\nthe front door. He rushes to Jonathan.\r\n\r\n<b>       DOCTOR EINSTEIN\r\n</b>       Hey, Johnny, the cops !\r\n\r\nEinstein tries to wake up Jonathan, but doesn't succeed. He picks\r\nup his shoe and rushes upstairs.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       So, I ducks in there. I sees the door handle turn, so I\r\n       pulls out my gun, braces myself against the wall and I\r\n       says : \u00abCome in !\u00bb\r\n\r\nHe takes out his gun and points it at the door. Brophy and another\r\ncop, officer Saunders, come in. When they see O'Hara's gun\r\npointing at them, they raise their arms. O'Hara puts his gun back\r\nin his holster and welcomes his colleagues.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Oh, hello, boys.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       What the Sam Hill's going on here ?\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Hello Sarge, what do you think, this is Mortimer Brewster.\r\n       He's going to help me write my play.\r\n\r\n<b>       SAUNDERS\r\n</b>       Do you have to tie him up to make him listen ?\r\n\r\nHe starts to untie Mortimer.\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       O'Hara, you better report in the station. Why didn't you\r\n       ring in ? You got the whole force out looking for you.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Right in the middle of the second act. Did they send you\r\n       guys here looking for me ?\r\n\r\nBrophy goes to the telephone and starts dialing.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       No, we came to warn the old ladies. There is a difficulty.\r\n       The colonel blew that bugle again.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Yeah, I heard him.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       The neighbors are all phoning in. The Lieutenant's on the\r\n       warpath. He says we've got to put him away someplace.\r\n\r\nHe sees Jonathan lying on the steps.\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Now, who the heck is this ?\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Oh, that's Mister Brewster's brother. My play put him to\r\n       sleep.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Oh ! That's the one that ran away. So he came back.\r\n       (in the phone)\r\n       Brophy. Get me Mac.\r\n       (to O'Hara)\r\n       Haven't you got yourself in a mess ! You're two hours\r\n       overdue at the station. I better let them know that I found\r\n       you.\r\n\r\nO'Hara bends on Jonathan and shakes him\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Hey ! It wasn't that bad, was it ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       (in the phone)\r\n       Mac ? Tell the Lieutenant he can call off the big manhunt.\r\n       We found him... At the Brewster house... Shall we bring him\r\n       in ?... All right, we'll hold him right here.\r\n\r\nHe puts the phone down and turns to O'Hara, who has succeeded in\r\nwaking up Jonathan and getting him on his feet. Jonathan stares at\r\nBrophy. He thinks Brophy is talking about him.\r\n\r\nMortimer looks at his left hand, which has just been freed by\r\nSaunders.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       The Lieutenant is on his way over.\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       So I've been turned in, hey ? All right, you've got me. I\r\n       suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother will split the\r\n       reward.\r\n\r\nBrophy and O'Hara each take one arm of Jonathan.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY &amp; O'HARA\r\n</b>       Reward ?\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Yes, reward ! Now I'll do some turning in !\r\n\r\nMortimer, who had his hand and legs untied by Saunders but is\r\nstill gagged and has his chest still tied on the armchair, moans\r\nand moves excitedly on his seat.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       (to Jonathan)\r\n       Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       You think my aunts are sweet, charming old ladies, don't\r\n       you ? Well, there's thirteen bodies buried in the cellar !\r\n       Yes, thirteen.\r\n\r\nMortimer jumps on his chair and try to scream through his gag.\r\nSince he cannot succeed to get off the chair, he stands up, still\r\ngagged and tied to the back of the chair and rushes to Brophy,\r\ncarrying the armchair with him.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Be careful what you say about your aunts, they happen to be\r\n       friends of ours.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       I'll show them to you.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Don't you make any trouble for them, do you hear me !\r\n\r\nMortimer walks between Brophy and Jonathan, and tries to say\r\nsomething to Brophy through his gag. Saunders, behind Mortimer,\r\nkeeps on untying him.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       (to Mortimer)\r\n       Never mind, Mr. Brewster. Leave him to me, I'll take care\r\n       of him.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       (to O'Hara)\r\n       You come down to the cellar.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       (to Jonathan)\r\n       Now, wait a minute.\r\n\r\nMortimer is still trying to talk through his gag to O'Hara and\r\nBrophy, and moves excitedly around the two cops. He moves so much\r\nthat Saunders has stopped trying to untie him.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       Thirteen bodies.

I'll tell you the rest of my\r\n       play later.\r\n\r\nHe pushes Mortimer away from him.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Go on down to the cellar with him.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Gee, do I have to, Sarge ? Look at that puss. He looks like\r\n       Boris Karloff.\r\n\r\nHearing that, Jonathan screams, jumps on O'Hara and puts his hand\r\naround his throat.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       (to Jonathan)\r\n       Don't !\r\n       (to Brophy)\r\n       Sarge !\r\n\r\nThe three cops and Jonathan starts fighting. A fist comes out of\r\nthe battle and hits Mortimer on the chin. He staggers back to the\r\ncenter of the room, and falls on the floor.\r\n\r\nWe see Einstein cautiously appearing on the landing of the upper\r\nfloor of the house. He slowly comes down the stairs.\r\n\r\nDown in the sitting-room, the fight goes on. Saunders falls on his\r\nback and Jonathan jumps on him. O'Hara, in his turn, jumps on\r\nJonathan. Behind them, Mortimer is slowly getting up and getting\r\nrid of his ropes. Apparently, his fall has completely untied him.\r\n\r\nEinstein, watching this heated fight, moves back to the upper\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nMortimer gets rid of his gag, and slowly moves away from the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       (voice over)\r\n       Look out, Pat !...

Look out !\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Fight. Go on and fight.\r\n\r\nMortimer climbs up a few steps on the staircase and sits down on a\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       That's enough, that's enough. Everybody off.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       (voice over)\r\n       Pat ! Pat, look out!\r\n\r\nMortimer, still seated on the step, quietly gets his cigarette\r\ncase from his pocket, takes a cigarette, puts the case back in his\r\npocket, while we hears the noise of the battle still going on down\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Amazing... Such a fine day, too. All I did was cross the\r\n       bridge and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing. Amazing, amazing.\r\n\r\nHe takes a matchbox from another pocket and lights his cigarette.\r\nBehind Mortimer, on the wall, we see the shadows of the men\r\nfighting. Then we see various objects falling around Mortimer.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Don't... Don't bother me now.\r\n\r\nO'Hara is projected on the wall below the staircase, near the\r\nplace where Mortimer is still quietly seated.\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Buddy, you could use this in the third act.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       Oh yes, I got something better than this. Let me tell\r\n       you...\r\n\r\nJonathan breaks a chair on his back. O'Hara staggers slightly.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       I'll see you later.\r\n\r\nHe goes back in the battle. Jonathan gives him a heavy punch and\r\nO'Hara falls in the window-seat, closing the lid over himself in\r\nhis fall.\r\n\r\nBack to Mortimer, still quietly smoking his cigarette, seated on\r\nthe same step. He takes papers out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       I got the papers signed. There, they're all signed. What do\r\n       I care ? Go ahead, go ahead, fight, fight, fight-fight-\r\n       fight !\r\n\r\nO'Hara cautiously lifts the lid of the window-seat, but seeing a\r\nchair flying in his direction, he slams it back shut. The chair\r\nhits the window-seat and breaks off in small pieces.\r\n\r\nBack to Mortimer on his steps. He puts the papers back in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       I'd better call up and see if Witherspoon has left.\r\n\r\nHe puts his hand through the banister of the staircase to take the\r\ntelephone on the desk, but he cannot reach it.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Telephone. Hey !\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Jonathan comes smashing on the wall below the\r\nstaircase. He grabs the telephone and lifts it to throw it on the\r\ncops, bringing it within easy reach of Mortimer's hand.\r\n\r\n<b>       JONATHAN\r\n</b>       I'll get every one of you ! I hate cops. I'll brain the\r\n       first one that comes near me !\r\n\r\nMortimer picks up the telephone handset, and starts dialing.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Yeah. A little higher, please, brother.\r\n\r\nJonathan is watching the cops around him, and he is not looking at\r\nall at his brother behind him. Without thinking about it, he lifts\r\nthe telephone a little higher.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Thank you very much. Yeah, that's fine.\r\nJonathan suddenly realizes what Mortimer is doing and turns his\r\nhead toward him. Brophy immediately comes behind him and hits him\r\nwith his stick. Jonathan starts falling, and Mortimer has to pick\r\nup the telephone not to loose it.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Oh ! Don't do that, please.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Get him, Pat.\r\n\r\nSaunders comes on the other side of Jonathan and hits him with his\r\nstick.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       (in the phone)\r\n       Come on, doc...\r\n       (to the cops)\r\n       That won't have any effect. I've tried it before...\r\n\r\nJonathan falls heavily on the floor.\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Oh, it did. Dear me ! Isn't that amazing ?\r\n\r\nO'Hara slowly lifts the lid of the window-seat.\r\n\r\nSaunders bends on the motionless body of Jonathan\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.\r\n\r\nThe doorbell rings, and we see the shadow of a hatted man through\r\nthe frosted glass. Mortimer looks at the door.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Witherspoon !\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Come in.\r\n\r\nThe visitor enters. It's Lieutenant Rooney, a plain-cloth\r\npoliceman. He closes the door behind him. Both Brophy and Saunders\r\nstand at attention. Mortimer puts the phone receiver back on its\r\nhook. O'Hara comes out of the window-seat, and, seeing his\r\nsuperior, stands at attention. Rooney walks to the body of\r\nJonathan.\r\n\r\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\r\n</b>       What has occurred ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY &amp; SAUNDERS\r\n</b>       (speaking together)\r\n       Well, we...\r\n\r\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\r\n</b>       Never mind !

We were just acting in self-defense.\r\n\r\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\r\n</b>       (pointing to the body of Jonathan)\r\n       What happened ? He put up a fight ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       This isn't the one who blows the bugle. This is his\r\n       brother. He tried to kill O'Hara.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.\r\n\r\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\r\n</b>       Boris ?... Turn him over.\r\n\r\nSaunders turns Jonathan over and both the lieutenant and Brophy\r\nbends on the face of Jonathan.\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       Kind of think he's wanted somewhere.\r\nRooney stands up and looks at Brophy with an ironical smile.\r\n\r\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\r\n</b>       Oh ! You \u00abkind of think he's wanted somewhere\u00bb ? If you\r\n       guys can't look at the circulars we put up in the station,\r\n       you can at least read short detective stories. Certainly,\r\n       he's wanted somewhere. In Indiana ! He escaped from the\r\n       prison for criminally insane. He's a lifer.\r\n\r\nStill seated on his step, Mortimer smiles.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       That's my brother !\r\n\r\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\r\n</b>       For Pete's sake, that's the way they described him. \u00abHe\r\n       looked like Karloff\u00bb. Why'd you have to knock him off ?\r\n\r\n<b>       BROPHY\r\n</b>       He tried to get us to go down to the cellar.

He\r\nstops after a few steps, as if he were hesitating.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Don't charge !\r\n\r\nMortimer and Witherspoon are exchanging faces. Martha and Abby are\r\nwhispering into each other's ear.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Mortimer. Mortimer, we're really very worried about\r\n       something.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Oh, now, darling, don't be worried.\r\n\r\nHe kisses Abby.\r\n\r\n<b>       MARTHA\r\n</b>       Me too, Mortimer.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Well, of course, darling.\r\n\r\nHe kisses Martha.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       You'll both are going to be very happy at Happy Dale, will\r\n       you.\r\n\r\n<b>       MARTHA\r\n</b>       Oh yes, dear, we're very happy about the whole thing,\r\n       but that's just it.

What ? What ?\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Your mother came to us as a cook. And you were born about\r\n       three months afterwards. And she was such a sweet woman and\r\n       such a good cook, we didn't want to lose her. So brother\r\n       married her. Your real father was a cook, too. He was a\r\n       chef on a tramp steamer.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       You mean... you mean I'm not really a Brewster ?... Oh !\r\n\r\nHe almost falls backward. Both sisters catch him up.\r\n\r\n<b>       MARTHA\r\n</b>       Oh, darling ! Don't feel so badly about it.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       I'm sure it won't make any difference to Elaine.\r\n\r\nHe yells several whooping cries and then kisses them both very\r\naffectionately. Then he rushes to the window, jumps into the open\r\nwindow-seat, opens the drapes and yells outside.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Elaine ! Elaine ! Where are you ? Can you hear me ? I'm not\r\n       really a Brewster ! I'm the son of a sea cook !\r\n\r\nWe hear Elaine screaming. Elaine comes running upstairs from the\r\ncellar.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Mortimer ! Mortimer ! Mortimer ! It's true ! It's true ! I\r\n       saw them. Mortimer, it's true.\r\n\r\nRooney and Saunders come out of the kitchen.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       It's true ! There are thirteen bodies down there !\r\n\r\nMortimer tries to make her shut up, and succeeds only by kissing\r\nher very passionately on the mouth.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       (mumbles through Mortimer's mouth)\r\n       But I saw them\r\n\r\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\r\n</b>       What's all this screaming about ?\r\n\r\nElaine tries to put a few words but Mortimer keeps on kissing her.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       (mumbles through Mortimer's mouth)\r\n       But I saw them...\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       It's way past her bedtime.\r\nWith his mouth still pressed on her, he lifts her and carries her\r\nacross the room to the front door.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Quiet !\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       But, Mortimer...\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Goodbye !\r\n\r\nHe opens the door and rushes outside. The two sisters come to the\r\ndoor, waving goodbyes to him.\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       Bye.\r\n\r\n<b>       MARTHA\r\n</b>       Goodbye, darling !\r\n\r\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\r\n</b>       What is all this ?\r\n\r\n<b>       ABBY\r\n</b>       They're going on their honeymoon.\r\n\r\n<b>       LIEUTENANT ROONEY\r\n</b>       Well, they're off to a flying start.\r\n\r\nThe two sisters burst laughing and turn to the door.\r\n\r\n<b>BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\nMortimer comes out of the house, still carrying Elaine with his\r\nmouth pressed on her. O'Hara and the cab driver, who were chatting\r\ntogether, jump up and look at the strange couple. Mortimer, still\r\ncarrying Elaine, moves along the house, with the cab driver\r\nfollowing him.\r\n\r\n<b>       O'HARA\r\n</b>       (finishing the story he was telling the cab driver)\r\n       I pull my gun at...\r\n\r\n<b>       CAB DRIVER\r\n</b>       Hey !\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       What ?\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       I really did see...\r\n\r\n<b>       CAB DRIVER\r\n</b>       Hey ! You'll own two cabs !\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Huh ?\r\n\r\n<b>       CAB DRIVER\r\n</b>       I mean the meter !\r\n\r\nElaine, eventually, comes out of her hysteria. She puts her arms\r\naround Mortimer, and talks to him in a very sweet voice.\r\n\r\n<b>       ELAINE\r\n</b>       Oh, Mortimer.\r\n\r\nThey kiss very tenderly. The cab driver comes closer to the couple\r\nand looks at their closed-eyes faces.\r\n\r\n<b>       CAB DRIVER\r\n</b>       (imitating Elaine's voice)\r\n       Oh, Mortimer.\r\n\r\nMortimer turns to him.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       (to the cab driver)\r\n       Oh, we're going to Niagara Falls. Call me a cab, dear.\r\n\r\n<b>       CAB DRIVER\r\n</b>       Yes, love.\r\n\r\nThe cab driver realizes his mistake and checks himself.\r\n\r\n<b>       CAB DRIVER\r\n</b>       But, Mister Brewster !\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       No, no, I'm not a Brewster. I'm a son of a sea cook.\r\n\r\nHe laughs and lifts a very surprised Elaine on his shoulder, and\r\nruns through the churchyard towards Reverend Harper's house.\r\n\r\n<b>       MORTIMER\r\n</b>       Charge !\r\n\r\nThe cab driver puts his hands to his face, then takes them away\r\nand yells :\r\n\r\n<b>       CAB DRIVER\r\n</b>       I'm not a cabdriver. I'm a coffeepot !\r\n\r\nWith one hand on his cap, and the other hand extended on his side,\r\nhe mimes a coffeepot.\r\n\r\nIn the background, we see Mortimer entering the house, with Elaine\r\nstill on his shoulder. The cab driver drops his arms and walks\r\nback to his taxi.\r\n\r\n<b>FADE OUT TO BLACK SCREEN\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                                 THE END\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>END CREDITS\r\n</b>\r\nBoth the words \u00abThe End\u00bb and the credits are written in white\r\nletters on a cartoon representing a village with a sorceress\r\nflying on a broomstick above the village.\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Arsenic-and-Old-Lace.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Arsenic and Old Lace</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Julius J.
