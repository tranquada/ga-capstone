Strong and blond and handsome.\n\n<b>     SUPERIMPOSE:  SEPTEMBER 15, 1954\n</b>\n     LONG ANGLE...from below, we watch CARL HEINE, high on the cross\n     spar of his mast.

Empty, silent.  A tin\n     COFFEE CUP on the counter's edge.  The battery well open, revealing\n     two large BATTERIES in place.  PAN to...\n\n     ...the deck of this sturdy stern-picker.  The fishing net stretched\n     from the huge DRUM into the sea.  Keep PANNING to the bow, where...\n\n     ...Carl stands with his kerosene lantern and his air horn, watching\n     as another BOAT comes slowly out of the mist.  The silhouette of a\n     FISHERMAN, holding a long fishing GAFF.  As fragments of fog part,\n     we CLOSE on the figure's face, to see...\n\n     ...his eyes.  They are Asian.

As CREDITS\n     CONTINUE, two figures slowly reel in the massive net.  SHERIFF ART\n     MORAN is painfully thin, unimposing, methodical.  Only the eyes\n     reflect his disquiet.  His young deputy, ABEL MARTINSON, cuts\n     anxious looks between his mentor and the sea.  As the net brings\n     silvered salmon across the gunnel, CUT to...\n\n     ...the cabin.  Tidy as before.  Only two things have changed.\n     CLOSE on the tin coffee cup, which now lies OVERTURNED on the\n     floor.

And then.\n     He sees something more.  His fingers gently pull back the hair\n     from above Carl's left ear, to reveal...\n\n     ...a skull wound.  The bone caved in.  Four inches across.\n\n<b>     EXT. SAN PIEDRO ISLAND - DAY\n</b>\n     Snow falling on cedars.\n\n<b>     SUPERIMPOSE:  DECEMBER 6.\n</b>\n     The heavens descend softly onto our island.  Exquisite, silent,\n     hypnotic.  An epic snowfall inspiring awe at our frailness against\n     the limitless scope of nature.  As CREDITS CONCLUDE, a series of\n<b>     QUICK ANGLES...\n</b>\n     ...cars pirouetting, skating on their tires, past an abandoned\n     school bus, where kids throw snowballs at is windows...\n\n     ...Fisk's Hardware Center, its endless queue of orderly citizens\n     waiting stoically for their snow shovels and kerosene...\n\n     ...the harbor, with its moored fleet of tiny fishing vessels\n     blanketed as if by volcanic ash, a pair of teenage lovers building\n     a snowman at the edge of a dock, she pushes the boy into the water,\n     and he rises laughing, steam rising from his clothes...\n\n     ...undulating strawberry fields of pure white, untouched and\n     flawless as the Sahara...\n\n     Finally, to a public building, cars gathering as best they can,\n     people streaming up snow-laden steps to the entrance, and as we\n     FOLLOW them, SMASH CUT to...\n\n<b>     INT.

He sits\n     ramrod straight, utterly motionless, expressionless, the eye of a\n     storm of movement in...\n\n     ...the assembling COURTROOM.  A packed gallery of buzzing locals,\n     the scent of anticipation.  A bank of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS,\n     cosmopolitan in attire, bearing themselves as jaded dignitaries\n     from the civilized world.  As we PAN their ranks...\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     It was the first murder trial on\n                     the island in thirty-one years.\n\n     ...we look over the right shoulder of ISHMAEL CHAMBERS, early 30's,\n     dark, a rugged, somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on\n     his right leg.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     Our only newspaper was the San\n                     Piedro Review, a four-page weekly\n                     that I operated alone.\n\n     He glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     What, I wondered, could the Seattle\n                     boys know of the hearts of these\n                     people...\n\n     To the JURY BOX.  Truck farmers, grocers, fishermen, in sober\n     neckties.

With this jury.\n\n     ...it falls with a CLATTER of pages.  He reaches with his right\n     hand, replaces the pad on his thigh.  Around him, CAMERAS are being\n     swung to the ready.  Ishmael looks to see...\n\n     ...a slender WOMAN of refined beauty, entering the courtroom.\n     A few flashes POP, and Ishmael's right hand retrieves a venerable\n     box camera from beneath his seat, as his notepad falls once more,\n     unheeded.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     Hatsue Miyamoto had been without\n                     her husband for 77 days.\n\n     Ishmael pivots, and we understand his struggle with the notepad.\n     For he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated\n     left arm, its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     He was in jail.  When his baby son\n                     learned to walk.\n\n     Through his VIEWFINDER, we see HATSUE take her place in the first\n     row.  And sensing her presence, her husband turns.  Their eyes\n     meet.  A string of FLASHES...\n\n     But none from Ishmael.  He hesitates.  As if considering whether he\n     will violate this woman's privacy.  The camera lowers.  HOLD on his\n     face...\n\n<b>     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY\n</b>\n     MATCH CUT to Hatsue's face.  Staring, impassive, empty.  PULL BACK\n     to see that she sits alone on a wooden bench by the courtroom door.\n     Her hands rest delicately on the purse in her lap.  Her demeanor as\n     removed from this place as is her husband's.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     Earlier, I noticed her in the\n                     corridor.\n\n     PULL BACK to see him alone, in shadow.  It is more than a notice.\n     Ishmael stares with fixed intensity at the motionless woman, as\n     she gathers her thoughts.  A moment of decision.  He approaches.\n     Stops, respectfully, at a distance which will not invade her\n     personal space.  And softer than we might have imagined...\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL\n</b>                     Are you all right?\n\n     She turns her head only slightly.  It is enough.

As one, the Japanese-Americans watch...\n\n     ...the prosecutor, ALVIN HOOKS, a crisp, even dapper man.

Taking the glances of the jury with it.\n     SUSAN MARIE HEINE is pretty and blonde and full-bodied in her\n     modest black dress.  Composure and dignity.  Against her grief.\n\n<b>     EXT.

Or seemed so, at the\n                     time.\n\n     See ARTHUR CHAMBERS now, at the printing press, an enormous lime\n     green contraption, with rollers and conveyor pulleys in a cast-\n     iron housing.

A community.  Arthur unselfconsciously slips\n     his arm over the shoulder of his tall son.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     ...which keeps us from accepting\n                     the warmth.

Always a Japanese girl,\n                     sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice\n                     to the concept of racial harmony.\n\n     We are there now.  Arthur pulling down the same box camera Ishmael\n     would use years later.

Digging for clams in the mud.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     I had kissed her once, when we\n                     were ten.  Looking at fish through\n                     a glass-bottomed box.  It was just\n                     an impulse, and no big deal.\n\n     Ishmael pulls back from the deep hole, to make room for Hatsue to\n     reach down.

As if all of our times alone\n                     together...in the hollow cedar,\n                     everywhere...were a secret.\n\n     They are digging now, together.  Carefully.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     I told myself that was good.  That\n                     it made our friendship special.

Sometimes,\n                     all the time.  I knew I was unhappy.\n                     But I knew if I told her...\n\n     She lifts it clear.  And as she admires its size and roughness with\n     her fingertips.  As she washes it in the shallows.  He watches her\n     movements.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     It might be a mistake.

He leans slightly closer, and she looks\n     down.  This is the moment.  Afraid and driven, he moves slowly\n     to her face.  And puts his mouth against hers.  She lets him and,\n     encouraged, he pushes harder, making Hatsue...\n\n     ...lose her balance, and planting a hand beneath the water to\n     support herself, eyes closed too tightly, she kisses Ishmael for a\n     long moment, before...\n\n     ...leaping up, snatching her clam pail and running AWAY down the\n     beach like a deer.  He stands slowly.  To watch her go.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     I knew in my heart that we would\n                     love each other forever.\n\n     His face is slack and unsmiling, but he is helpless with happiness.\n     Contemplating this truth.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     The way she kissed me.

Hatsue\n     with a half-dozen Japanese girls, her hair loose, her face lightly\n     sheened with sweat.  She works with efficiency and grace, filling\n     her flat.\n\n     Three rows away.  Ishmael watches.  The fear not far beneath the\n     surface of his quiet, dark features.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     By two weeks, I knew I had made\n                     the defining mistake of my life.\n\n     Hatsue's gaze drifts slightly in this direction, and Ishmael looks\n     DOWN rapidly at his work.  Cheeks burning, certain she is watching.\n     Which she is not.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     I'd ruined everything.\n\n     LATER...end of day.  The young pickers turning in their flats as a\n     gentle rain begins.  Hatsue counts her money, slips it into her\n     pocket, and...\n\n     ...runs lightly off, into the growing rain.  Ishmael sees.\n     Stricken to his soul with longing.  And indecision.\n\n<b>     EXT. CEDAR GROVE - DAY\n</b>\n     Hatsue, drenched, alone with her thoughts in the protection of\n     the hollow cedar.  The rain is driving now, and she glances up.\n     At something we don't see.  And watches it.  Finally...\n\n<b>                               HATSUE\n</b>                     You followed me, huh?\n\n     PULL BACK to see him.  Rain pelting off his poor soaked form.

Stunned, uncomprehending.  Watching with blank\n     eyes, as she stares up at him.  Then, with dignity and tenderness,\n     he helps her dress, his eyes awkwardly away from hers...\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL\n</b>                     It felt right to me.

Keeping\n     their distance out of awkwardness rationalized as respect.\n\n     One man comes to him.  MASATO NAGAISHI is aging and frail.  But his\n     voice is clear...\n\n<b>                               NAGAISHI\n</b>                     The Japanese people of the island\n                     are saddened by this loss.  Your\n                     father was a man of great fairness\n                     and compassion for others...\n\n     He stands at a respectful distance.  Ishmael clears his throat.  He\n     nods, thank you.  No words to say.  So the small man adds...\n\n<b>                               NAGAISHI\n</b>                     A friend to us.  And to all people.\n\n     Silence.  They are a tableau of stone.  Finally...\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL\n</b>                     Well...\n\n     And no more.  The man takes a step back...\n\n<b>                               NAGAISHI\n</b>                     We know you will follow in his\n                     footsteps.  And honor his legacy.\n\n     Which changes Ishmael's face.  To something harder.\n\n<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n</b>                     I thought it then.  And often since.\n                     A balance, he's said.  Finding the\n                     facts.  That folks needed to know.\n\n<b>     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Ishmael stands at an open closet.  Cardboard boxes have been set\n     aside.  One has been searched for treasure.  The page is in his\n     hand.  Only slightly discolored by age.\n\n<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n</b>                     Dear Ishmael.  These things are\n                     very difficult to say.

Where he slept alone.\n     Thinking of her.\n\n<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n</b>                     Whenever we were together, I knew\n                     it.  I loved you and I didn't love\n                     you at the same moment.\n\n     He sinks slowly.  As if beneath the letter's weight.\n\n<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n</b>                     The last time.  At the cedar tree.\n                     I knew we could never be right\n                     together.  And that soon I would\n                     have to tell you.\n\n     His eyes are dry.

Withdrawing...\n\n<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n</b>                     I must say good-bye to you now.\n                     Our lives will move on.
