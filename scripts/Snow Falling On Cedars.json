THE SUSAN MARIE, SHIP CHANNEL BANK - NIGHT\n\n     Fog.  Penetrated only by sound.  The LAPPING of sea at a drifting\n     hull.  Tendrils of mist part, revealing...\n\n     ...a face.  Strong and blond and handsome.\n\n     SUPERIMPOSE:  SEPTEMBER 15, 1954\n\n     LONG ANGLE...from below, we watch CARL HEINE, high on the cross\n     spar of his mast.  He has pulled a SHUTTLE of TWINE from his rubber\n     overalls, and is LASHING a LANTERN in the cloud of mist, as MAIN\n     TITLES BEGIN...\n\n     ANGLE...the tiny, meticulously neat cabin.  Empty, silent.  A tin\n     COFFEE CUP on the counter's edge.  The battery well open, revealing\n     two large BATTERIES in place.  PAN to...\n\n     ...the deck of this sturdy stern-picker.  The fishing net stretched\n     from the huge DRUM into the sea.  Keep PANNING to the bow, where...\n\n     ...Carl stands with his kerosene lantern and his air horn, watching\n     as another BOAT comes slowly out of the mist.  The silhouette of a\n     FISHERMAN, holding a long fishing GAFF.  As fragments of fog part,\n     we CLOSE on the figure's face, to see...\n\n     ...his eyes.  They are Asian.  SMASH CUT to...\n\n     EXT. THE SUSAN MARIE, SHIP CHANNEL BANK - MORNING\n\n     Blinding sun.  Our boat bobs lifeless on placid water.  As CREDITS\n     CONTINUE, two figures slowly reel in the massive net.  SHERIFF ART\n     MORAN is painfully thin, unimposing, methodical.  Only the eyes\n     reflect his disquiet.  His young deputy, ABEL MARTINSON, cuts\n     anxious looks between his mentor and the sea.  As the net brings\n     silvered salmon across the gunnel, CUT to...\n\n     ...the cabin.  Tidy as before.  Only two things have changed.\n     CLOSE on the tin coffee cup, which now lies OVERTURNED on the\n     floor.  PAN above the open battery well, where a third MARINE\n     BATTERY now stands next to the wheel.  CUT to...\n\n     ...the stern, as the raveling net LIFTS from the water's surface...\n\n     ...the face of Carl Heine.  Turned to the sun.  SMASH CUT to...\n\n     INT. CORONER'S LAB - DAY\n\n     WHITE fills the frame.  A hand PULLS back the blanket-shroud\n     revealing Carl's face.  As CREDITS CONTINUE, tilt up to the\n     coroner, HORACE WHALEY, gazing down.  A shading of regret behind\n     the professional mask.  A series of QUICK CUTS...\n\n     ...Whaley's hand pulls the SHUTTLE of TWINE from Carl's pocket...\n\n     ...examines the open, empty KNIFE SHEATH at Carl's belt...\n\n     ...Carl's wrist, its WATCH stopped at 1:47...\n\n     Whaley bends over Carl's body, presses on his solar plexus,\n     watching pink FOAM rise from Carl's mouth and nose.  And then.\n     He sees something more.  His fingers gently pull back the hair\n     from above Carl's left ear, to reveal...\n\n     ...a skull wound.  The bone caved in.  Four inches across.\n\n     EXT. SAN PIEDRO ISLAND - DAY\n\n     Snow falling on cedars.\n\n     SUPERIMPOSE:  DECEMBER 6.\n\n     The heavens descend softly onto our island.  Exquisite, silent,\n     hypnotic.  An epic snowfall inspiring awe at our frailness against\n     the limitless scope of nature.  As CREDITS CONCLUDE, a series of\n     QUICK ANGLES...\n\n     ...cars pirouetting, skating on their tires, past an abandoned\n     school bus, where kids throw snowballs at is windows...\n\n     ...Fisk's Hardware Center, its endless queue of orderly citizens\n     waiting stoically for their snow shovels and kerosene...\n\n     ...the harbor, with its moored fleet of tiny fishing vessels\n     blanketed as if by volcanic ash, a pair of teenage lovers building\n     a snowman at the edge of a dock, she pushes the boy into the water,\n     and he rises laughing, steam rising from his clothes...\n\n     ...undulating strawberry fields of pure white, untouched and\n     flawless as the Sahara...\n\n     Finally, to a public building, cars gathering as best they can,\n     people streaming up snow-laden steps to the entrance, and as we\n     FOLLOW them, SMASH CUT to...\n\n     INT. COURTROOM - DAY\n\n     CLOSE on impassive EYES.  They are Asian.  We have seen them\n     before.  PULL BACK to see...\n\n     KABUO MIYAMOTO.  Early 30's, dark blue suit, clean shirt.  He sits\n     ramrod straight, utterly motionless, expressionless, the eye of a\n     storm of movement in...\n\n     ...the assembling COURTROOM.  A packed gallery of buzzing locals,\n     the scent of anticipation.  A bank of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS,\n     cosmopolitan in attire, bearing themselves as jaded dignitaries\n     from the civilized world.  As we PAN their ranks...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     It was the first murder trial on\n                     the island in thirty-one years.\n\n     ...we look over the right shoulder of ISHMAEL CHAMBERS, early 30's,\n     dark, a rugged, somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on\n     his right leg.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Our only newspaper was the San\n                     Piedro Review, a four-page weekly\n                     that I operated alone.\n\n     He glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     What, I wondered, could the Seattle\n                     boys know of the hearts of these\n                     people...\n\n     To the JURY BOX.  Truck farmers, grocers, fishermen, in sober\n     neckties.  A waitress, a secretary, fisher wives in Sunday dresses.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Neighbors, sitting in judgement.\n                     On their neighbor.\n\n     To the neighbor.  The ramrod-still defendant.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid\n                     grace of a Samurai warrior.  As if\n                     detached from his own trial.\n\n     Ishmael writing on the pad balanced precariously on his knee,\n     until...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Did he know how dangerous his demeanor\n                     could be?  With this jury.\n\n     ...it falls with a CLATTER of pages.  He reaches with his right\n     hand, replaces the pad on his thigh.  Around him, CAMERAS are being\n     swung to the ready.  Ishmael looks to see...\n\n     ...a slender WOMAN of refined beauty, entering the courtroom.\n     A few flashes POP, and Ishmael's right hand retrieves a venerable\n     box camera from beneath his seat, as his notepad falls once more,\n     unheeded.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Hatsue Miyamoto had been without\n                     her husband for 77 days.\n\n     Ishmael pivots, and we understand his struggle with the notepad.\n     For he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated\n     left arm, its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     He was in jail.  When his baby son\n                     learned to walk.\n\n     Through his VIEWFINDER, we see HATSUE take her place in the first\n     row.  And sensing her presence, her husband turns.  Their eyes\n     meet.  A string of FLASHES...\n\n     But none from Ishmael.  He hesitates.  As if considering whether he\n     will violate this woman's privacy.  The camera lowers.  HOLD on his\n     face...\n\n     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n     MATCH CUT to Hatsue's face.  Staring, impassive, empty.  PULL BACK\n     to see that she sits alone on a wooden bench by the courtroom door.\n     Her hands rest delicately on the purse in her lap.  Her demeanor as\n     removed from this place as is her husband's.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Earlier, I noticed her in the\n                     corridor.\n\n     PULL BACK to see him alone, in shadow.  It is more than a notice.\n     Ishmael stares with fixed intensity at the motionless woman, as\n     she gathers her thoughts.  A moment of decision.  He approaches.\n     Stops, respectfully, at a distance which will not invade her\n     personal space.  And softer than we might have imagined...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Are you all right?\n\n     She turns her head only slightly.  It is enough.  Her voice quiet\n     and firm at once...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Go away, Ishmael.\n\n     There is no anger.  Only directness and resolve.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Please don't be like th...\n\n                               HATSUE (softer)\n                     Go away.\n\n     INT. COURTROOM - DAY\n\n     PAN the back of the courtroom.  Twenty-four citizens of Japanese\n     ancestry fill the last row, dressed in their most formal clothes.\n     Shades of Atticus Finch.  As one, the Japanese-Americans watch...\n\n     ...the prosecutor, ALVIN HOOKS, a crisp, even dapper man.  There is\n     a quickness about the eyes, a tendency to sharpness of manner, that\n     he works carefully against...\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     ...four inch gash, skull crushed,\n                     and your thought was, what...?\n\n     JUDGE FIELDING, tall and gray and rawboned, leans on his elbows,\n     his eyelids droop slightly, a deceptive masking of keen attention.\n\n                               HOOKS (O.S.)\n                     That he...fell?  Hit his head on\n                     the gunnel going over?\n\n     The witness is Sheriff Moran.  He answers as if this were a sincere\n     question.  As if he had never heard it before.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     Well, Carl was six-four, went 235.\n                     He was a grizzly bear and an able\n                     seaman...\n\n     Ishmael watching.  Thinking on that.\n\n                               MORAN (O.S.)\n                     For him to just...go over.  Crush\n                     his skull like that on the way in...\n\n     HOLD on Ishmael.\n\n     INT. TEAM BUS - DAY\n\n     Teenage BOYS in football uniforms.  They ride with their helmets in\n     their laps.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     He was a mountain, all right.\n                     Anchored the line for us little\n                     fellers.\n\n     CLOSE on Carl and Ishmael at 18, riding together.  Ishmael, dark\n     and rugged even then, is scarcely little.  But dwarfed by the blond\n     giant at his side, who glares out the window, at...\n\n                               CARL\n                     Chambers.  Y'see the geese?\n\n     ...snow geese landing in low flooded wheat.  The grace of it holds\n     both boys.\n\n                               CARL\n                     Picture'd be nice.  In your pa's\n                     paper.\n\n     Ishmael nods absently.  They stare, side-by-side.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Lucky I got the camera in my\n                     helmet.\n\n     They never look at each other.  They never smile.  But you can\n     almost hear one in...\n\n                               CARL\n                     Careful, Chambers.  That was almost\n                     a joke.\n\n     INT. COURTROOM - DAY\n\n     Hooks now stands with his polished shoe up on the witness podium.\n     Like chatting with the Sheriff across the back fence...\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     And you weren't there, when the\n                     coroner examined the wound.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid...\n                     to tell Mrs. Heine.\n\n     And his glance inevitably goes to the first row behind the\n     prosecutor's table.  Taking the glances of the jury with it.\n     SUSAN MARIE HEINE is pretty and blonde and full-bodied in her\n     modest black dress.  Composure and dignity.  Against her grief.\n\n     EXT. HEINE HOME - DAY\n\n     Moran climbs from his vehicle, as Carl's young SONS dash around the\n     corner of the house.  Seeing the Sheriff, they stop cold.  Silent,\n     shirtless, barefoot.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     Hey there, men.  Is your mother\n                     home a-tall?\n\n     He spits his Juicy Fruit into a wrapper.  And as the younger boy\n     nods across the distance...\n\n                               SUSAN MARIE (O.S.)\n                     Sheriff Moran, hullo.\n\n     She has appeared in the doorway, smiling, spittle-marked baby's\n     diaper across her shoulder.  And he smiles back.  Tells the boys...\n\n                               MORAN\n                     You go on and play, now.\n\n     But they don't.  So he follows into her entryway, closing the door\n     behind him.  And at the foot of her curving staircase...\n\n                               SUSAN MARIE\n                     What can I do for you, Sheriff,\n                     Carl's not home y...\n\n                               MORAN\n                     That's...\n\n     Too quick.  He stops himself.  And she sees that.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     It's why I'm here.  I'm afraid I\n                     have some...very bad news to tell\n                     you, the...worst...kind of news.\n\n     She looks at him, uncomprehending, the smile only beginning to\n     fade, before...\n\n                               MORAN\n                     Carl died last night.  In a fishing\n                     accident.  In White Sand Bay.\n\n     She only blinks.  As if translating the words from a foreign\n     language.\n\n                               SUSAN MARIE\n                     No, Carl's fine, h...\n\n                               MORAN\n                     We found him, Mrs. Heine.  Tangled\n                     in his net.\n\n     And with these words, a slack, blank look crosses her face, and she\n     stumbles back one step, sitting down HARD on the bottom stair of\n     her curved staircase.\n\n     He doesn't know what to do.  She digs her elbows into her lap, and\n     begins to rock, very slowly, wringing the diaper in her hands.  Her\n     face is more terrible than tears.  It is frightened.  She murmurs\n     to herself, so that we can barely hear...\n\n                               SUSAN MARIE\n                     I told him this could happen.\n\n     INT. COURTROOM - DAY\n\n     CLOSE on Hooks, nodding.  As if, slowly, digesting something in his\n     mind.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     So, no...immediate suspicion,\n                     no...general talk of enmity\n                     between the two.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     These are fishermen, Alvin.  They\n                     don't talk at all to each other\n                     and less to me.  Specially gossip.\n\n     EXT. DOCKS - DAY\n\n     Ishmael walking down the sunlit wharf.  Purpose in his stride...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     A gill-netter works through black\n                     nights with only himself to talk\n                     to.  And learns to be silent.\n                     They were lonely men and products\n                     of geography.\n\n     Up ahead, the Susan Marie has been brought to dock.  Moran stands\n     chatting with a knot of six or seven FISHERMEN.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     ...men who, on occasion, realized\n                     that they wished to speak, but\n                     couldn't.\n\n     As he arrives, Moran smiles a thin greeting.  Not happy to see him.\n     Of course, neither is anyone else.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     Figure you'da heard by now.\n\n     Ishmael shakes his head in silent helplessness.

Her slender fingers find the\n     buttons of his shirt, deftly undoing it, as he kisses her face.\n     He unclasps her dress.  And as it falls from her shoulders, falls\n     to the floor, we PUSH INTO her eyes, and...\n\n     INTERCUT her MEMORY of...\n\n     ...a beach.  Two 10-year-old CHILDREN floating on the water.\n     Clinging to a wooden box, with a glass bottom for fish-watching.\n     The girl is Asian.

SHIGEMURA\n                     No.  You must never look at a man\n                     directly.  This is part of grace.\n\n     The girl smiles a small sour smile.  Speaks quietly...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I don't think the boys on this\n                     island.  Are impressed.  By grace.\n\n     The old woman studies her without irritation.\n\n                               MRS. SHIGEMURA\n                     Hakujin know nothing of life, Hatsue.\n\n     Apparently, the girl has heard this before.\n\n                               MRS. SHIGEMURA\n                     This is why they fear death.  Because\n                     life here is separate from Being.\n\n     The girl takes a long pin.  Begins carefully to fasten her hair.\n     Breaking eye contact with the mirror.\n\n                               MRS. SHIGEMURA\n                     It is why they have no soul.\n\n     Is the girl even listening?  The old woman's voice never rises.\n     Remains patient.\n\n                               MRS. SHIGEMURA\n                     Life embraces death, includes it.\n                     This truth brings tranquility.  You\n                     must see yourself...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     ...as a leaf.  On a great tree.\n\n     No irony in the girl's voice.  No disrespect.  The old woman reads\n     the young face in the mirror.\n\n                               MRS. SHIGEMURA\n                     The pin.  Could be better placed.\n\n     INT. SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - DAY\n\n     CLOSE on 12-year-old Ishmael.  Neutral eyes.  Eating an apple.  A\n     horrific CLANGING surrounds us.  The clash of metal on metal.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     My lessons came from my father.  They\n                     were different.  Or seemed so, at the\n                     time.\n\n     See ARTHUR CHAMBERS now, at the printing press, an enormous lime\n     green contraption, with rollers and conveyor pulleys in a cast-\n     iron housing.  The shrieking of metal and gears recalls an ancient\n     locomotive.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     He operated the Review alone, with\n                     an integrity and passion for principle\n                     that made him a figure of respect.  If\n                     slightly larger than life.\n\n     Arthur is a large, rugged man, with round gun-metal rimmed\n     spectacles and garters on his shirtsleeves.  He wears the soft,\n     perpetual smile of an Oxford Don, as he gracefully ducks in and\n     out of the machine, inspecting plates and printing cylinders.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     He never spoke of wanting me to\n                     succeed him.  And, in truth, it was\n                     the last job on earth I thought I'd\n                     ever want.\n\n     The boy rises now.  Sets his apple carefully aside.  And under his\n     father's supervision, takes his place operating the press.  His\n     arms inches from the fearful clatter of the rollers.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     When I was five, he casually mentioned\n                     that if his sleeve got caught in the\n                     press, he'd be instantly popped open\n                     like a child's balloon, and splattered\n                     across the walls.\n\n     Watch Ishmael running the monster, coolly, efficiently, with\n     complete concentration.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Even his bones would disappear, to\n                     be discovered later on the floor,\n                     as strips of white confetti.\n\n     Arthur turns away, lest his son feel a lack of confidence.  Picks\n     up the boy's apple.  A crisp BITE.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Which, of course, made me certain that\n                     life would have no meaning until I\n                     could run that teakettle.\n\n     EXT. MAIN STREET, AMITY HARBOR - SUNSET\n\n     Arthur and Ishmael, now 17, strolling Main Street in the midst of\n     what seems a festive carnival.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     He was, for better or worse, the\n                     only God in my life.  I guess it's\n                     our nature to resent those we know\n                     we can never measure up to...\n\n     They are passing modest parade floats, booths with food and games.\n     A genial crowd of farmers, fishermen, families, both races\n     heedlessly mingling.  A community.  Arthur unselfconsciously slips\n     his arm over the shoulder of his tall son.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     ...which keeps us from accepting\n                     the warmth.  The way we should.\n\n     Up ahead, a crowd has gathered at the steps of the courthouse.\n     Something's up.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Every summer, after harvest, the\n                     Strawberry Festival was Dad's favor-\n                     ite story to cover.  Good news was\n                     his preference.  Making him an oddity\n                     among journalists.\n\n     As we approach, we see a ceremony begin at the top of the\n     courthouse steps.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Highlight was crowning the Strawberry\n                     Princess.  Always a Japanese girl,\n                     sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice\n                     to the concept of racial harmony.\n\n     We are there now.  Arthur pulling down the same box camera Ishmael\n     would use years later.  Focusing up at the MAYOR, as he places the\n     crown on the radiant young girl...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Senior Year.  It was Hatsue.\n\n     And as the applause ripples through the crowd.  As the Strawberry\n     Princess acknowledges her subjects, her eye falls on...\n\n     ...Ishmael.  She drops him a wink.  And a special wave.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     She winked at me.  In public.\n                     Which was unusual.\n\n     EXT. SOUTH BEACH - DAY\n\n     Two 14-year-olds alone on a beach.  Digging for clams in the mud.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I had kissed her once, when we\n                     were ten.  Looking at fish through\n                     a glass-bottomed box.  It was just\n                     an impulse, and no big deal.\n\n     Ishmael pulls back from the deep hole, to make room for Hatsue to\n     reach down.  We can see her fingers explore the shell of the dug-in\n     geoduck clam.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     He's still got a good grip.  We\n                     need to dig more.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     At school, she kept mostly to the\n                     Japanese kids, and sort of ignored\n                     me.  As if all of our times alone\n                     together...in the hollow cedar,\n                     everywhere...were a secret.\n\n     They are digging now, together.  Carefully.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I told myself that was good.  That\n                     it made our friendship special.  And\n                     didn't mean she was ashamed of it.\n                     Necessarily.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Easy.  Slow is best.\n\n     Gently, she begins to dislodge the clam from its lair.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I thought about her.  Sometimes,\n                     all the time.  I knew I was unhappy.\n                     But I knew if I told her...\n\n     She lifts it clear.  And as she admires its size and roughness with\n     her fingertips.  As she washes it in the shallows.  He watches her\n     movements.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     It might be a mistake.  I could\n                     never correct.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (quietly)\n                     I like you.\n\n     The words make her turn.  Not startled, exactly.  Alerted.  But\n     neutral, without affect.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Do you know what I mean, Hatsue?\n                     I've always liked you.\n\n     There is no answer.  He leans slightly closer, and she looks\n     down.  This is the moment.  Afraid and driven, he moves slowly\n     to her face.  And puts his mouth against hers.  She lets him and,\n     encouraged, he pushes harder, making Hatsue...\n\n     ...lose her balance, and planting a hand beneath the water to\n     support herself, eyes closed too tightly, she kisses Ishmael for a\n     long moment, before...\n\n     ...leaping up, snatching her clam pail and running AWAY down the\n     beach like a deer.  He stands slowly.  To watch her go.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I knew in my heart that we would\n                     love each other forever.\n\n     His face is slack and unsmiling, but he is helpless with happiness.\n     Contemplating this truth.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     The way she kissed me.  She knew\n                     it, too.\n\n     EXT. IMADA FARM - DUSK\n\n     Ishmael crouching at the edge of the farm, in near-darkness.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     She avoided me for a week.\n\n     Across the distance, the screen door opens, light slips across the\n     porch.  Hatsue appears with a wicker basket, to take the laundry\n     from the line.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     So this way, I could see her\n                     without...bothering anyone.\n\n     He watches, rapt, as she unpins and folds the clothes, clenching\n     the clothespins in her teeth.  Then reeling the line again, elegant\n     hand over elegant hand...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I was certain everything would\n                     work out.\n\n     She corrals the long sweep of her hair, knotting it deftly, before\n     heading inside.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     And frightened.\n\n     EXT. STRAWBERRY FIELDS - DAY\n\n     Children working fields in sunlight.  Kneeling in the rows.  Hatsue\n     with a half-dozen Japanese girls, her hair loose, her face lightly\n     sheened with sweat.  She works with efficiency and grace, filling\n     her flat.\n\n     Three rows away.  Ishmael watches.  The fear not far beneath the\n     surface of his quiet, dark features.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     By two weeks, I knew I had made\n                     the defining mistake of my life.\n\n     Hatsue's gaze drifts slightly in this direction, and Ishmael looks\n     DOWN rapidly at his work.  Cheeks burning, certain she is watching.\n     Which she is not.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I'd ruined everything.\n\n     LATER...end of day.  The young pickers turning in their flats as a\n     gentle rain begins.  Hatsue counts her money, slips it into her\n     pocket, and...\n\n     ...runs lightly off, into the growing rain.  Ishmael sees.\n     Stricken to his soul with longing.  And indecision.\n\n     EXT. CEDAR GROVE - DAY\n\n     Hatsue, drenched, alone with her thoughts in the protection of\n     the hollow cedar.  The rain is driving now, and she glances up.\n     At something we don't see.  And watches it.  Finally...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     You followed me, huh?\n\n     PULL BACK to see him.  Rain pelting off his poor soaked form.  She\n     is waiting for an answer.  So...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Sorry.  It sort of...happened, I\n                     just...I followed you.  I'm sorry.\n\n     She pulls her hair behind her ears.  A movement which stretches her\n     body.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I'm all wet.\n\n     She starts refastening her hair now, looking away.  He comes\n     inside, crouches as respectfully far from her as he can.  Which is\n     close.  He watches her, watches her, and...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     I'm sorry I kissed you on\n                     the beach.\n\n     No reaction.  As if she hasn't heard.  Now his heart is beating\n     straight through his chest.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Let's just forget about it.\n                     Forget it happened.\n\n     She picks up her damp straw hat.  And, eyes down, tracing a finger\n     around its brim...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Don't be sorry.  I'm not sorry\n                     about it.\n\n     His heart bursts within him.  And he struggles to keep it from his\n     face.  Even though she isn't watching.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Me neither.\n\n     She turns her face to him, and offers a small smile.  It is\n     genuine, and therefore dazzling to the boy.  She lies back on\n     the ground.  Her eyes so unafraid and direct.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Do you think this is wrong?\n\n     He swallows.  Staring at her lying there so comfortably.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     The best part was that there was a\n                     'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Your friends would.  Your dad would\n                     kill me with a machete.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael.\n                     He'll slice you up with a ceremonial\n                     sword.\n\n     Ah.  Better.  They are both grinning now.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     My mom.  Would be the problem.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Why?  We're only talking.\n\n     Her eyes flicker.  The synapse that a woman can offer a man.\n\n                               HATSUE (softly)\n                     Sure.\n\n     And touches his hand.  With her fingertips.  The barest whisper...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I can't hear you.\n\n     Thus invited, he leans down over Hatsue.  Kisses her mouth with all\n     the tenderness in him.  This time, her eyes close gently.  And her\n     body arches slightly, into his.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     We kissed for half an hour, that\n                     first time.

HEINE FARMHOUSE - DAY\n\n     Etta twenty years younger, watches stoically from the parlor\n     window, as her husband CARL SENIOR strools the strawberry fields\n     with Kabuo's father Zenhichi.

Don't go pawing through\n                     the underwear!\n\n     And chuckles.  He knows they appreciate a joke.  It means there's\n     nothing to be afraid of.  Stops turning pages now.  Looks up, his\n     eyes moving until they find Hatsue.\n\n                               AGENT\n                     Strawberry Princess, huh?  You\n                     musta been flattered by that.\n                     Looks just like y...\n\n     The soft slamming of a screen door.  Another AGENT, large and\n     shambling in his too-small suit, is carrying a crate.  And a\n     telling look.\n\n                               AGENT #2 (quiet triumph)\n                     Dynamite.  Twenty-four sticks.\n\n     And the crate BANGS onto the table.  Just beside the kimono.  Lifts\n     out two sticks and holds them high.  Proof.\n\n                               HISAO\n                     You must believe.  This for tree\n                     stumps.  For clearing land.\n\n     The small man's smile fades now.  First time.  And his eyes fix\n     Hisao before he speaks.  As if reading his mind.\n\n                               AGENT\n                     Maybe.  Maybe.  But this is still\n                     bad, y'see.\n\n     Fujiko slips her hand into her husband's.  To give him strength.\n\n                               AGENT\n                     It's illegal contraband, you were\n                     s'posed to turn this stuff in.\n                     We, uh...\n\n     Slight shrug.\n\n                               AGENT\n                     We gotta arrest you.  Have to\n                     take you to Seattle.\n\n     Fujiko's breath catches.  One of the daughters whimpers.  The\n     silence hangs thick and frightening.  The bigger agent unhooks a\n     pair of handcuffs from his belt, but...\n\n                               AGENT\n                     Naw, you don't need those.  Mister\n                     Eee-ma-da-san here is a class act,\n                     a real gentleman.\n\n     The younger girls are crying now, clinging to their sisters.  The\n     agent regrets this.\n\n                               FUJIKO\n                     Please, reconsider.

So, best for an honest man\n                     to clear his name for godd and all.\n\n     Ain't that right?\n\n                               AGENT\n                     Only a few questions in Seattle,\n                     okay?  Few questions, few answers,\n                     the whole thing is over.\n\n     He puts his hand on Hisao's arm.  Not roughly, but much firmer than\n     the ease of his voice...\n\n                               AGENT\n                     Simple as that.\n\n     INT.

Tries to keep his smile calm,\n     steady...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     You write to my house, and put\n                     Kenny Yamashita's name on the\n                     return address.

Not knowing what to say, she winds an arm behind his\n     head, and brings him nearer.  His mouth opens into hers, with more\n     force, more of his heart, than he has ever given.  Deep and tender.\n     His hands reach beneath her dress...\n\n     ...peel her panties down her thighs...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     When something that means your\n                     whole life.

Everything has stopped.\n     Her face is strong and yet overflowing with regret.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     No.  No.  It isn't right.\n\n     So he draws away.  Stunned, uncomprehending.  Watching with blank\n     eyes, as she stares up at him.  Then, with dignity and tenderness,\n     he helps her dress, his eyes awkwardly away from hers...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     It felt right to me.  It felt\n                     like getting married.\n\n     She draws her legs up.  Kneeling now, putting her hands on his\n     face...\n\n     But no words come.  No words.  Until...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I'll write you.\n\n     And KISSES him fiercely, and BOLTS up before he can grab her,\n     RUNNING off like a deer, while he...\n\n     ...kneels.  His mouth open.  Like a silent scream.\n\n     EXT. AMITY HARBOR FERRY - MORNING\n\n     An army truck pulls up behind several others in cold morning air.\n     Hesitantly, looking in all directions, Fujiko, Hatsue, and her four\n     sisters climb from the truck, to see...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     On Monday, March 30, 1942, the\n                     United States Army graciously\n                     transported the Imada women to\n                     the docks.\n\n     ...a ferry, the KEHLOKEN, stands waiting.  Soldiers are dis-\n     tributing tags for luggage and coats.  The evacuees, mostly women,\n     stand in the cold, trying to smile bravely for each other.  And\n     lined against the railing...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Lifelong neighbors came to watch.\n                     Curiosity masked as kindness...\n\n     ...a cluster of white islanders gawking as their Japanese neighbors\n     file toward the ferry.  A middle-aged woman waves to Fujiko, who\n     casts her eyes down, refusing to acknowledge the greeting.  And\n     just as they reach the gangway...\n\n     ...Hatsue sees Ishmael, who stands at an unobtrusive distance,\n     among a group of students.  She pauses.  Her eyes hold his for a\n     heartbeat...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     ...with some exceptions.\n\n     The wisp of a smile.  And she is gone.\n\n     EXT. IMADA FRONT PORCH - NIGHT\n\n     Hatsue comes alone onto the white-blanketed porch.  Snow is no\n     longer falling.  She takes out a cigarette, lights it impassively.\n     The mannerisms make her seem fully American, despite the porcelain\n     impenetrability of her Asian exterior.  She closes her eyes, and...\n\n     ...draws deep on the smoke.  The act seems to cause her pain.  When\n     the eyes open, they are frightened, unguarded.  Nowhere to turn.\n     The next puff looks desperate, and she FLIPS the cigarette out onto\n     the snow.  Jams her hands in the pockets of her parka, stamps her\n     feet against the cold, the helplessness.  And looks out...\n\n     ...strawberry fields, endless and white, shimmering in filtered\n     moonlight, become...\n\n     EXT. MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP - NIGHT\n\n     ...a moonlit DESERT.  PAN the barbed wire, the distant barracks,\n     the desolation.  Come to...\n\n     ...two women walking alone.  The younger one glancing at her mother\n     as they go.  Fujiko's eyes unreadable, stare implacably ahead.\n     The barracks, everything, in distance behind them.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     You think we're far enough\n                     away now?\n\n     No sarcasm in the voice.  She lets the words carry her irony.\n     Her mother stops.  Looks at her so directly, so strong.  Even her\n     tough-minded daughter flinches slightly.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Mom, whatever this is, they don't\n                     keep war secrets this carefully.\n\n     Fujiko thinks that over.  Nods.\n\n                               FUJIKO\n                     Secrets are hard to keep.\n\n     She goes over to a large, flat rock.  Sits down.  Pulls two sheets\n     of paper from her coat.  And waits.  As her daughter comes and\n     crouches at her feet.  Fujiko clears her throat.\n\n                               FUJIKO\n                     This letter.  Was opened.\n                     By mistake.\n\n     And watches.  As the shard of fear penetrates her daughter's mask.\n     Silence.  Then...\n\n                               FUJIKO (reads)\n                     'My love.  I still go to our\n                     cedar tree in the afternoons every\n                     day.  I shut my eyes, waiting.'\n\n     Hatsue has turned to stone.  To ice.  Wind blows.\n\n                               FUJIKO (reads)\n                     'I smell your smell.  And I dream\n                     of you.  And I ache for you to come\n                     home.  So I can hold you and feel\n                     you near.'\n\n     Fujiko scans the page silently.  Turns to the second...\n\n                               FUJIKO (reads)\n                     'After all these years that we've\n                     been together, I find you're a\n                     part of me.  Without you, I have\n                     nothing.  All my love, forever...'\n\n     And looks up.  Her eyes calm, quiet.\n\n                               FUJIKO\n                     The neighborhood boy.  Who taught\n                     you to swim?\n\n     The look holds.  And holds.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     You shouldn't have opened that.\n                     It was mi...\n\n                               FUJIKO (so quiet)\n                     How deceitful of me.\n\n     Anger only at the edges.  Like finely-honed steel.\n\n                               FUJIKO\n                     How can I ever hope.  For your\n                     forgiveness.\n\n     The wind swirls a cloud of dust between them.  They seem not to\n     notice.\n\n                               FUJIKO\n                     I have written this letter to\n                     the boy's parents...\n\n     She pulls out a single page.  Hands it down to her daughter.\n     Hatsue's eyes move quickly over the words.\n\n                               FUJIKO\n                     Attraction is no crime, certainly\n                     among children.  The dishonor\n                     lies in the concealment.  From\n                     your families.\n\n     Watches her daughter reading.  And quietly...\n\n                               FUJIKO\n                     I know that you know this.  I know\n                     you have suffered.  Even if the\n                     hakujin could not.\n\n     Silence.  Hatsue's eyes cast down.  She folds the page.\n\n                               FUJIKO\n                     There will be no further letters.\n                     No contact of any k...\n\n     And stops.  Because Hatsue is TEARING the page in two.  She looks\n     up.  Into her mother's shock.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     One more letter.  I will write\n                     it.  You may read it, and send\n                     it for me.\n\n     Her mother's anger fades.  Into interest.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I deceived more than you.  I\n                     deceived this sweet boy.  And\n                     myself.  It was never love.\n\n     Never love.  The mother's face changes.  There is understanding,\n     acceptance.  Even pride.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I will work hard.  To earn your\n                     forgiveness.\n\n     A sigh.  A sadness deep, beyond her years.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I can never hope for his.\n\n     INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT\n\n     Mother and daughter enter their crude quarters.  They find Hatsue's\n     sisters sitting on the wooden floor, watching...\n\n     ...a team of young MEN, working with tools and pieces of lumber.\n     One is building shelves, two others, a chest of drawers.  Their\n     leader kneels tacking scraps of tin over the knotholes on the\n     floor.  One girl beams at her mother...\n\n                               SUMIKO\n                     These boys are buildings us\n                     a mansion!\n\n     The leader grins and rises.  Bows slightly to Fujiko.  He is, of\n     course...\n\n                               KABUO\n                     I'm Kabuo Miyamoto, Mrs. Imada.\n\n     The woman smiles.  Bows slightly in return.\n\n                               FUJIKO\n                     We are in your debt, Miyamoto-san.\n                     How are your parents, your family...?\n\n                               KABUO\n                     My father is sick with the camp\n                     food.  The rest of us are fine.\n                     Don't speak of dept, please, we\n                     just want to help.\n\n     And glances.  To the eldest daughter.  In the doorway.\n\n                               KABUO\n                     Hi, Hatsue, remember me?\n\n     She looks back, without expression.  There is much on her mind.\n     His smile is handsome, easy.\n\n                               KABUO\n                     I was a senior when you were a\n                     junior.  But I've seen you around.\n\n     She tosses her hair free of the parka.  Gathers it in her hands.\n     Saying only...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Hello.\n\n     Can't win a smile, but he doesn't seem to mind.\n\n                               KABUO\n                     Nice to see you.\n\n     EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE REAR PORCH - NIGHT\n\n     Ishmael steps from the building onto the rear porch.  He draws from\n     his coat a black CIGAR.  Box of matches.  The cigar goes into his\n     mouth.  With amazing dexterity...\n\n     ...he slips a single match from the box, turns his face to the\n     wall, and still palming the box, STRIKES a match on the buckle of\n     his belt, bringing it smoothly to the cigar for a few critical\n     puffs before the match dies.  He turns toward...\n\n     ...the fields.  Stretching treeless, endless, seemingly to the\n     horizon.  Bathed in filtered moonlight, they become...\n\n     EXT. TARAWA ATOLL - NIGHT\n\n     ...the shimmering Pacific.  We are with Ishmael in an LCVP landing\n     craft, as his platoon enters Tarawa lagoon.  Bobbing past two\n     DESTROYERS firing in waves at the beach.  Ishmael and his platoon\n     mates watch with adrenaline-fueled fear as amphibious tractors draw\n     fire on the sand, one exploding in flame.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Her letter reached me on the North\n                     Island of New Zealand.  So I had a\n                     month to think it over...\n\n     Men around him are shouting, cursing, jostling against each other,\n     frightened out of their minds, as SHELLS POUND the ocean, horrify-\n     ingly huge and near.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I wrote her four times.  'I hate\n                     you with all my heart.  I hate you,\n                     Hatsue, I'll hate you always!'\n\n     Suddenly their craft runs AGROUND on the hidden reef.  They are\n     still 300 yards from shore.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I never sent the letters.  I wanted\n                     to kill as many Japs as possible.\n\n                               SQUAD LEADER\n                     MOVE IT, MOVE IT, MOVE IT,\n                     LET'S GO!!\n\n     The SQUAD LEADER goes over the side, Ishmael and others follow,\n     struggling with 85 pound packs.  As Ishmael hits the water, the\n     squad leader is SHOT in the face, a man five yards from Ishmael has\n     the top of his head BLOWN AWAY, men are DROPPING in numbers under\n     the WITHERING BURSTS of fire, the deafening ordnance sweeping over\n     the SHRIEKS of terror and agony, and Ishmael...\n\n     ...submerges behind his pack, splashing hard, keeping its bulk\n     ahead of him as a shield, until he can wade and swim and plunge\n     toward shore, as hellfire CRASHES everywhere, dead bodies floating,\n     machine-gun blasts WHIPPING the water's surface, Ishmael at...\n\n     ...the shallows now, men rising to make a run at the seawall, being\n     CUT DOWN, Ishmael crouching in the water, watching other men draw\n     fire, and in a moment's lull, four of them and Ishmael...\n\n     ...GO for it, lungs BURSTING, pounding MADLY up the sand, one\n     SHOT DEAD, another SCREAMS as his knee is blown away and goes down\n     writhing, as three men...\n\n     ...MAKE IT to the wall.  Gasping, puking, shivering with cold and\n     fright.  They have no gear, no weapons.  One of them is Ishmael.\n     He looks back to...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Eric Bledsoe was bleeding to death.\n                     Thirty yards away.\n\n     Bullets FLYING everywhere, CHEWING up the sand.  The young man\n     twitching, pleading...\n\n                               BLEDSOE (crying)\n                     Oh, shit, please, please help me\n                     you guys, come on, help me, fucking\n                     help me, PLEASE...!\n\n     And flat against the seawall, three men watch.  Not daring to look\n     at each other.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I knew nothing could save him.  Hell,\n                     I didn't have so much as a band-aid.\n                     I also knew I was a coward.  For not\n                     giving up my life to try.\n\n     EXT. SEAWALL - DAY\n\n     Ishmael and his companions have been joined by others.  Sixty or\n     so men mill in the shadow of the seawall.  The beach is littered\n     with dead marines and wounded, calling for help.  As Ishmael\n     glances up, a SERGEANT leaps ONTO the seawall, cigarette dangling\n     from his mouth...\n\n                               SERGEANT\n                     You pussies are the kinda chickenshits\n                     deserve to have your balls chewed\n                     off real slow when this is over!\n\n     Stands with his hands on his hips.  The men below him properly\n     mesmerized.\n\n                               SERGEANT\n                     Any man who won't follow me over\n                     this wall is a cornhole-fucker with\n                     a half-inch hard-on wh...\n\n     The words CUT OFF by the shell that RIPS THROUGH his spine, OPENING\n     his shirt front as he PITCHES forward FLAT upon the sand.\n\n     No one looks.  No one speaks.  It never happened.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I wanted to live.  And I didn't\n                     know why.\n\n     EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT\n\n     Ishmael has a carbine now and a field machete.  PULL BACK to reveal\n     300 MARINES all down the wall, a striking force assembled from the\n     survivors of multiple landings.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Some colonel came down the beach.\n                     Any man who didn't go over the wall\n                     at 2100 would be court-martialed,\n                     disgraced and imprisoned...\n\n     Every man lining up now, rifles at the ready.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     The captain who followed said shot\n                     on sight.\n\n     They seem more resigned, or is it stunned numb, than terrified.\n     There is no interaction.  Each man dealing with his own insides.\n     And suddenly...\n\n     ...squad leaders go OVER THE WALL, the firing ERUPTS, and three\n     hundred marines SCRAMBLE into the teeth of it, mortar and machine-\n     gun BARRAGE lighting the sky from the row of battered palm trees,\n     Ishmael SPRINTING, the man next to him goes DOWN, Ishmael TURNS\n     instinctively, and a shot...\n\n     ...RIPS into his left bicep, SPINNING him OFF his feet in SLO-MO,\n     falling to dirt as all goes...\n\n     BLACK.\n\n     INT. SHIPBOARD OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Ishmael feverish, writhing unconscious against the straps that\n     hold him to a table.  All around him, a hell of men and blood\n     and doctors and limbs and shouted curses they never showed us\n     on M.A.S.H.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     My arm was dealt with by a\n                     pharmacist's mate, whose surgical\n                     career was four hours old.\n\n     Ishmael LURCHES, his eyes pop OPEN, wild and bleary...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     He used a handsaw.\n\n     ...seeing there, in a corner, on a pile of blood-soaked\n     dressings...\n\n     ...his left arm.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I dream of it, now and then.\n                     The way my fingers curled.\n                     Against the wall.\n\n     He blinks at it.  Realizing at last that the arm is his...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     ...fucking goddam Jap bitch!\n\n     An ORDERLY turns at the words.  Nods.  As if he knows.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     It was all I could think of to say.\n\n     His eyes squeeze shut.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     There was nothing more to say.\n                     For a long while.\n\n     INT. KABUO'S CELL - LATE NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE on a dark blue suit.  Clean shirt.  Hanging on a hook against\n     the green wall.  PAN ACROSS the bars in the cell door's tiny\n     window.  All is dark out there, and silent.  Here...\n\n     ...the bare bulb glows.  Its light throws shadows of castles and\n     horses across the chessboard.\n\n     Kabuo cross-legged on the floor, alone.  His back erect.  His eyes\n     calm.  Stare at the pieces.\n\n     EXT. WOODS - NIGHT\n\n     Kabuo at 19 sits on the earth.  By a shovel.  By a lantern.  This\n     place is shielded by trees.  PAN across the ground to...\n\n     ...his father.  Slowly, reverently, placing objects into burlap\n     sacks, beside a shallow hole in the earth.  Wooden swords, hakama\n     pants, a bokken, scrolls written with care.  Dialogue plays in\n     subtitled JAPANESE...\n\n                               ZENHICHI\n                     Your great-grandfather was a\n                     samurai, a magnificent soldier.\n\n     The father never looks at the son.  Only at his work.\n\n                               ZENHICHI\n                     He killed himself.  On the\n                     battlefield.  At Kumamoto.\n\n     The boy knows this.  Yet his entire being is focused on every word.\n\n                               ZENHICHI\n                     He went to battle with a sword.\n                     Against rifles, mind you.  Knowing\n                     what honor required.\n\n     An elegant SWORD.

THE ISLANDER - NIGHT\n\n     Kabuo kneeling at the battery well of his boat.  He is sliding a\n     new BATTERY into place.  Beside its older companion.  He bolts it\n     down.  Starts his engine.  He is visibly tense.  As he steps onto\n     the deck, he sees...\n\n     ...two figures at the pilings.  Sheriff Moran makes a cutting\n     motion across his throat, as Abel moves to grasp the mooring line.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     Cut your engine, we're coming\n                     aboard.\n\n     Kabuo doesn't move.

Now, cut\n                     yor engine.\n\n     And walks ahead into the cabin, shining his flashlight across\n     everything.  Kabuo follows, killing the engine.  And in the sudden\n     silence, Moran's beam finds...\n\n     ...the still-open battery well.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     You always run with the well open?\n\n                               KABUO\n                     I was checking the cables.\n\n     Moran's light moves over the batteries.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     D-6s, huh?\n\n     And says no more.  Runs his beam once more around the cabin.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     We'll come back, let's take a\n                     look at the stern.\n\n     Off he goes.  Kabuo's glance goes to the open well.  Then follows,\n     noticing Abel Martinson prowling around the bow.  But in the stern,\n     Moran is shining his light.  Third cleat.  Port side.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     See you replaced a mooring line,\n                     lately.

In a half hour you could\n                     be in Canada.\n\n     Kabuo's face has gone dead.  Which makes it seem somehow fierce,\n     almost threatening.  And the sheriff is watching that.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     I'm sorry, son.  But you're under\n                     arrest.\n\n     INT.

Finally, silence.\n\n                               NELS\n                     Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine.\n                     Shall I repeat the ques...\n\n                               SUSAN MARIE\n                     Carl said he didn't like Kabuo\n                     much anymore.\n\n     A silence.

ISHMAEL'S DESOTO, CENTER VALLEY - TWILIGHT\n\n     Ishmael driving an aged DeSoto through the blanketed strawberry\n     fields of Center Valley.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     My father had bought the DeSoto\n                     fifteen years before.  Driving it\n                     reminded me of him.  Which I\n                     considered a neutral fact...\n\n     He turns the wheel, using a cherry wood knob, specially mounted for\n     his convenience.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Actually, it was pleasant.\n\n     Following the curve, fields are pure white to the horizon.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Snow made all the fields into one.\n                     The notion that one man might kill\n                     another for a small patch, made no\n                     sense.\n\n     Up ahead, a Willys station wagon has run into a ditch.  A middle\n     aged Japanese man is working at a rear wheel with a shovel.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     But I knew such things occurred.\n                     Having been to war and all.\n\n     The man is Hisao Imada, and we can now see his eldest daughter\n     working with a shovel behind the car.  Ishmael pulls up behind\n     them.  And gets out.\n\n     He crunches over to where Hisao works...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     May I give you folks a lift?\n\n     Hatsue has come around the car now, pulling her snowflaked hair\n     from her eyes.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I didn't look at her.  I thought\n                     that would be best.\n\n     Her eyes on Ishmael's profile, Hatsue goes to her father's side.\n     Murmurs to him in Japanese.  WHen he answers, she turns to face\n     Ishmael...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     My father is grateful for your\n                     kindness.  But he will free his\n                     car, shortly.\n\n     Ishmael smiles softly.  This car isn't going anywhere.  He goes to\n     Hatsue, reaching gently for her shovel.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Okay, I'll help.\n\n     INT. DESOTO, SOUTH BEACH DRIVE - TWILIGHT\n\n     Ishmael drives with Hisao beside him.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     I know it's caused you trouble.\n                     But don't you think the snow is\n                     beautiful, coming down?\n\n     His eyes flick to Hatsue in the rearview mirror.  She stares out\n     the side window, concentrating on the world.  Two strands of wet\n     hair pasted against her cheek.\n\n                               HISAO\n                     Yes, very beautiful.\n\n     Suddenly, her eyes SNAP to meet Ishmael's in the mirror.  His dart\n     away.  Hers hold.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     This trial is unfair.  You should\n                     write about that in your newspaper.\n\n     He keeps driving.  And he keeps his eyes on the road.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (calmly)\n                     What should I say?\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Just that.  This trial is wrong,\n                     they are calling a good man a killer.\n                     It is only about prejudice, and that\n                     is unfair.\n\n     He thinks.  As he drives.  Hisao Imada silent beside him.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     We all expect the world to be fair.\n                     As if we have some right t...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I don't mean everyone.  Just people\n                     who can do things because they can\n                     arrest people or convict them.  Or\n                     run a newspaper.\n\n     And his eyes come up.  Meet hers in the mirror.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Maybe I should write a column.\n                     What do you think?\n\n     She studies his face.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     What do you think?\n\n     No smile.  On either side.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     I think people.  Should be fair.\n\n     His eyes on the road now.  The farmhouse seen through the drifting\n     screen of white.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Will you write that?\n\n     Her voice is soft.  The difference is palpable.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     I might just.\n\n     His voice is kindness and friendship.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I was part of her life again.  I\n                     was a person.\n\n     EXT. COAST GUARD LIGHTHOUSE, POINT WHITE - DUSK\n\n     A tower of reinforced concrete, rising a hundred feet above the\n     sea.  Ishmael's hand in his pocket.  Trudging toward it.\n\n     INT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - DUSK\n\n     Ishmael being led into a cramped room, stacked floor to ceiling\n     with wooden crates, file cabinets, duffel bags.  Our host is\n     LEVANT, a young Coast Guard radioman nearly six foot six, with a\n     huge Adam's apple, and kinky black hair.  He gestures around the\n     room at all the records.  Voila.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     You have the night watch?  On the\n                     radio.\n\n                               LEVANT\n                     Since September.  Last guys got\n                     transferred.\n\n     Ishmael looks around.  There is a lot of stuff.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     And you keep the records, or\n                     contribute to 'em.\n\n                               LEVANT\n                     Shorthard the radio transmis-\n                     sions, write 'em up, file 'em\n                     in a cabinet.

Guess so.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     All kinds of radio transmissions?\n                     Fisherman in trouble, and such.\n\n     Innocent question.  Random example.\n\n                               LEVANT\n                     All kinds.  Make yourself at home.\n\n     And leaves.  Ishmael looks at the task before him.  Then, out\n     the window.  Dark now.  His reflection stares back.  As troubled\n     as he is.\n\n     INT. PETERSEN'S GROCERIES - DAY\n\n     Ishmael at 24, carrying milk and crackers down the aisle of a\n     grocery store, the empty sleeve of his mackinaw pinned up at the\n     elbow.  He turns the corner to see...\n\n     ...three people in line at the register.  The second is Hatsue.  An\n     infant carried at her shoulder.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I'd been back two months.  It was\n                     the first time I'd seen her.\n\n     He joins the line.  The CHECKER glances his way, then looks\n     awkwardly down.  This makes the others turn.  And Hatsue's eyes.\n     Meet his.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Hello.\n\n     The voice, the face, are cool and formal.  There is no anger, no\n     unkindness.  Only the absence of warmth.  Ishmael nods.  His face\n     hard, stricken.  His heart pounds in his throat.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I couldn't say anything.  I just\n                     stood there, hating her.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and\n                     I.  Are very sor...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     The Japs did it.\n\n     No one knows where to look.  Down, away, anything.  But Hatsue\n     never blinks.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     They shot it off.  At Tarawa.\n\n     She holds her ground, her eyes soften, somehow.  Somewhere between\n     compassion and pity.  Her slender fingers stroke the baby at her\n     shoulder.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     I'm sorry, I'm sorry I said that.\n\n     All the feeling comes to his eyes.  Everything he will never tell\n     her.  A murmur...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     I'm sorry about everything.  All\n                     of it.\n\n     He drops his milk and crackers on the counter.\n\n     And walks away.\n\n     INT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Ishmael sits alone.  Beyond the glass, a SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the\n     sea, the snow-covered shore.  But Ishmael stares at a folder.  Open\n     in his lap.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     September 16.  At 1:42 A.M., the\n                     dead of night.  The S.S. West Corona,\n                     a Greek-owned freighter, was lost.\n                     In heavy fog.\n\n     His finger.  Traces a line of the report.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     They radioed to the lighthouse.\n                     They would have to dogleg, bisecting\n                     Ship Channel Bank.  And Seaman Philip\n                     Milholland wrote that down.  In his\n                     report.\n\n     Ishmael closes his eyes.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Carl Heine drowned.  In Ship\n                     Channel Bank.  And his watch\n                     stopped.  At 1:47.\n\n     He looks out through the glass.  As if he could watch it happen.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     A huge freighter plowing through.\n                     Throwing a wake big enough to fling\n                     any man overboard.\n\n     And Ishmael removes the page from the file.  Slowly, he folds it\n     into quarters.  Slides it into his coat pocket.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (calls out)\n                     Seaman...?\n\n     And closes the file.  Slips it back into the cabinet.  Levant\n     appears, vaguely irritated by the summons.  So Ishmael smiles.\n     Sorry, nothing important.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     How long you have this detail?\n\n                               LEVANT\n                     Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch\n                     September 16.\n\n     Ishmael's face.  Just to clarify...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     You mean, early morning the 16th?\n\n                               LEVANT\n                     No, night of the 16th, morning the\n                     17th.  We replaced two guys named\n                     Miller and Milholland.\n\n     Oh.  Ishmael nods.\n\n                               LEVANT\n                     They got transferred that day.\n                     Out to Cape Flattery.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Some seaman's loast report.\n                     Stuffed in a cabinet, good as\n                     lost forever.  No one knows.\n\n     Ishmael rises, stiffly.  Starts to pull on his coat.\n\n                               LEVANT\n                     You get what you come for?\n\n     And Ishmael looks at the youngster.  A little oddly.  Admits...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Guess I'm not completely sure.\n                     What that was.\n\n     EXT. FLETCHER'S BAY - MORNING\n\n     Ishmael at 24, crouched among trees.  Above a sunlit stretch of\n     beach.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I left the grocery, and wrote a\n                     letter.  I apologizes from my heart.\n                     I should never have said that word\n                     to her.  I never would again.\n\n     CLOSE on his face.  Eyes gazing down.  At something.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     It sat in my desk for two weeks.\n                     Before I threw it away.\n\n     He sighs.  Rises slowly.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I knew her car.  And sometimes\n                     when I'd see it, I'd...drive that\n                     way.  At a distance.\n\n     See Hatsue down on the beach.  Alone, raking for steamer clams.\n     Her baby beside her on a blanket, beneath an umbrella.\n\n     Ishmael walks down to the sand.  Crosses to where she works.  And\n     squats down.  At a respectful distance.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Can I talk to you?\n\n     She must have seen who was coming.  Because the words do not\n     startle her.  Or slow her work.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't\n                     right for us to be alone.  People\n                     will t...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     There's no one here, and I've got\n                     to talk to you.\n\n     Her back is to him.  She is motionless.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Don't you owe me that?\n\n     And she turns.  Her eyes go first to her sleeping child.  Then she\n     walks over, and sinks to the sand.  Just before him.  Near enough\n     to touch.\n\n     She looks in his eyes.  And waits.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     I'm like a dying person.\n\n     The words just came out.  His eyes move over her face.  His aching\n     for her is naked, beyond his ability to cope.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     I don't sleep.  I tell myself this\n                     can't go on, but it goes on anyway.\n\n     He seems at the edge of insanity.  Or tears.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I did a terrible thing, Ishmael.\n                     I knew what you felt.  And what I\n                     didn't.\n\n     Sadness in her voice.  But strength as well.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     And I never found the courage to\n                     tell you.\n\n     His eyes swim with tears.  He chokes them back, he has to.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     You'll think this is crazy, but all\n                     I want is to hold you.  Just once.\n                     And smell your hair.\n\n     She absorbs this.  No sign of repulsion or anger.  Her eyes seem\n     wise.  And very sad.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     You have to hear this, I can\n                     never touch you, Ishmael.  Not\n                     once, not ever.  There's no half-\n                     way.  As much as I know it hurts\n                     you, you have to let this go.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Look, I want to forget you, I do.\n                     I think if you hold me, just this\n                     once, I can walk away and never\n                     speak to you again.\n\n     She just keeps looking at him.  There is a bravery to her steady\n     gaze.  Her calm resolve.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Please?  As one human being to\n                     another, just because I'm miserable\n                     and don't know where to turn.  I\n                     need to be in your arms.  If it's\n                     just for thirty seconds.\n\n     His pleading look holds her for a moment.  In the silence...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I hurt for you.  Whether you'll\n                     ever believe that or not.\n\n     Feeling behind her eyes.  First time she lets it show.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     I feel sick sometimes, with the\n                     guilt of what I've done to you.\n                     And I can't make it right.\n\n     She rises slowly.  Brushes the sand from her skirt.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     To hold you would be wrong and\n                     deceitful.  You're going to have\n                     to live without holding me, that\n                     is the truth of the way things are.\n\n     She takes one step back.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Things end.  They do.  Get on\n                     with your life.\n\n     And turns away.  She gathers her baby in her arms.  Takes her\n     blanket, her umbrella, her rake and her pail.  He watches, never\n     moving, as she gathers her things.  Gathers them as if he wasn't\n     there.  And with her back turned...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Get on with your life.\n\n     She walks slowly away.  Her baby cries.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE on a steaming soup kettle, resting on a woodstove.  A woman's\n     hand stirs with a wooden ladle.  PULL BACK to see...\n\n     HELEN CHAMBERS, slender and strong and keen.  She is not yet 60.  A\n     code of fairness and self-reliance is written on the fine-boned\n     features.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I drove from the lighthouse to\n                     my mother's place.  I brought\n                     her some groceries.\n\n     Beyond the window, snow falls more heavily than ever.  Silent.\n     Spellbinding.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     Your father thought that heavy snow\n                     was God's kindness.  Despite the\n                     hardship, it brought us beauty...\n\n     Ishmael at the rustic table.  Watching her back.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     ...and reminded us.  Of our place\n                     in things.\n\n     Softer.  Not bitter, but regretful that...\n\n                               HELEN\n                     You don't believe in God anymore.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve,\n                     Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.\n\n     She begins ladling the soup into big porcelain bowls.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     We don't know God, we feel Him.  You\n                     felt Him as a child.  I remember.\n\n     And turns.  Looks at him.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     That's a long time ago.  What a\n                     child feels...that's different.\n\n     She studies him silently for a moment.  Then brings the bowls to\n     the table...\n\n                               HELEN\n                     Spend the night, will you?  Don't\n                     go back out into all that snow.\n\n     Sets them down.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I felt Milholland's report in my\n                     pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't\n                     telling her.  Telling someone.\n                     What I'd found.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     You've been busy with that trial,\n                     I suppose.  Such a travesty...\n\n     She takes her seat.  As he watches her.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     They only arrested that poor soul\n                     because he's Japanese.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They\n                     say the evidence is rock solid.\n\n     She begins to eat.  Eyes on her bowl.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     They're not his neighbor, like\n                     you are.  He is a husband, a father,\n                     he risked his life for their country.\n                     The same as you.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Those aren't the facts that matter.\n\n     She looks up.  Straight to his eyes.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     Well, folks are pretty cold.\n                     And folks who believe in nothing\n                     else...they're cold, too.\n\n     No mistaking her meaning.  He swallows.  Uneasy as always, in the\n     path of her disapproval.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     I've tried to understand your\n                     unhappiness, all these years.\n                     Having gone to war, losing your arm...\n\n     The directness of her gaze.  He can't turn from that.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     But other boys came back.  And\n                     pushed on.  They found girls, and\n                     married, had babies...\n\n     He doesn't flinch.  His voice too quiet with...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Someday I'll get lucky, too.\n\n     Too quiet to conceal the hurt.  She thinks it is hurt she has\n     caused.  It changes her tone to a plea...\n\n                               HELEN\n                     Your father fought at Belleau\n                     Wood, it took him years to get\n                     over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     ...but he found you.\n\n     Their eyes locked.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     It isn't the war, Ishmael.  All\n                     those years growing up.  You never\n                     had a real girl of your own.\n\n     And now he looks down.  He sees that his fist is tight around the\n     handle of his spoon.\n\n                               HELEN\n                     And I know you have it in you\n                     to love.  I know that much.  I\n                     wish I knew more.\n\n     His fingers open, and the spoon clatters softly on the wood.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     I'll stay tonight.  Thanks\n                     for asking.\n\n     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Ishmael wanders through a silent room.  A bed, a dresser.  Work\n     table and lamp.  A room denuded of all decoration, all possessions,\n     all sign of life.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I came back from the war to\n                     this room.  I stayed a few\n                     months.  Until my father passed.\n\n     EXT. VETERAN'S CEMETERY - DAY\n\n     Ishmael at 24, the left sleeve of his dark suit of mourning pinned\n     at the elbow.  The diggers are filling a grave in distance.\n     Mourners mingle, some casting glances back at Ishmael.  Keeping\n     their distance out of awkwardness rationalized as respect.\n\n     One man comes to him.  MASATO NAGAISHI is aging and frail.  But his\n     voice is clear...\n\n                               NAGAISHI\n                     The Japanese people of the island\n                     are saddened by this loss.  Your\n                     father was a man of great fairness\n                     and compassion for others...\n\n     He stands at a respectful distance.  Ishmael clears his throat.  He\n     nods, thank you.  No words to say.  So the small man adds...\n\n                               NAGAISHI\n                     A friend to us.  And to all people.\n\n     Silence.  They are a tableau of stone.  Finally...\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Well...\n\n     And no more.  The man takes a step back...\n\n                               NAGAISHI\n                     We know you will follow in his\n                     footsteps.  And honor his legacy.\n\n     Which changes Ishmael's face.  To something harder.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     I thought it then.  And often since.\n                     A balance, he's said.  Finding the\n                     facts.  That folks needed to know.\n\n     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Ishmael stands at an open closet.  Cardboard boxes have been set\n     aside.  One has been searched for treasure.  The page is in his\n     hand.  Only slightly discolored by age.\n\n                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n                     Dear Ishmael.  These things are\n                     very difficult to say.  I can't\n                     think of anything more painful\n                     than writing this letter.\n\n     He closes his eyes.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (a murmur)\n                     Think of reading it.\n\n                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n                     I don't love you, Ishmael.  There\n                     is no more honest way to say it.\n\n     He carries the letter to the twin bed.  Where he slept alone.\n     Thinking of her.\n\n                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n                     Whenever we were together, I knew\n                     it.  I loved you and I didn't love\n                     you at the same moment.\n\n     He sinks slowly.  As if beneath the letter's weight.\n\n                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n                     The last time.  At the cedar tree.\n                     I knew we could never be right\n                     together.  And that soon I would\n                     have to tell you.\n\n     His eyes are dry.  The letter has used up his tears long ago.\n\n                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n                     This is the last time I will write\n                     to you.  I am not yours anymore.\n\n     He sets the letter on the bed beside him.\n\n                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n                     I wish you the very best.  Your\n                     heart is large and you are gentle\n                     and kind.  I know you will do great\n                     things in the world.\n\n     He reaches now to his inside coat pocket.  Withdrawing...\n\n                               HATSUE (V.O.)\n                     I must say good-bye to you now.\n                     Our lives will move on.  The best\n                     we can.\n\n     ...a page.  Folded in quarters.  Sets it near the letter.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Milholland's report was like her\n                     letter.  Something no one else.\n                     Would ever read.\n\n     He stares at them.  Side by side.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     Thing about having only one hand.\n                     It's hard to tear pages up.  And\n                     I wasn't carrying a match.\n\n     He lies back.  Across the bed.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     So I thought of my father.  The man\n                     who would have taken this report to\n                     Judge Fielding.\n\n     Tears stand in his eyes.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     But every reporter.  Chooses his own\n                     balance.  FInds the facts that matter.\n\n     Shuts the eyes.  Against them.  Against everything.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     After all, the freighter was only\n                     a theory.

That was Kabuo's\n                     point.  Given how Carl's mother\n                     felt, Carl was still willing to\n                     consider selling to us.  It was a\n                     good sign.\n\n     Nels considers that.\n\n                               NELS\n                     Well, in the week that followed,\n                     the week before Carl's death...\n                     did your husband pursue him?\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     No.  Kabuo did not wish to beg,\n                     he respected Carl's right to\n                     reflect.  He was sure Carl would\n                     do the honorable thing.\n\n                               NELS (right back)\n                     And did he?\n\n     She nods.  Only once.

They shook on it.  Kabuo\n                     was so excited when he came home.\n\n     Nels lets that sit.  And sit.\n\n                               NELS\n                     And when did you first learn.\n                     That Carl had drowned?\n\n     The slightest pause.

Not agitated,\n                     he was excited in the sense of\n                     being overjoyed.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     You were...overjoyed yourself, to\n                     hear the news?\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Happy for him.  And relieved.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     So, then, you...and your husband...\n                     must have called friends, relatives,\n                     to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?\n\n                               HATSUE (calm, respectful)\n                     No.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     Really?  Didn't call your mother,\n                     your sisters, about starting a new\n                     life.  Your husband never tells\n                     his brothers that the family honor\n                     is vindicated.\n\n     Hatsue shifts in her chair.  Smooths her skirt.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     We hear how Carl...passed away.\n                     Only a few hours later.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     Your husband returned at, what,\n                     seven o'clock?\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Closer to eight.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     So, five hours.  Plenty of time for\n                     a call.  He was 'excited', you say.\n                     In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.\n\n     She nods, he was.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     We are...cautious people.  You\n                     would say conservative.  There\n                     would be time for celebrating\n                     with others when a paper was signed.\n\n     Hooks pouts.  He allows himself that.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     You thought the deceased might...\n                     break his promise?\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Of course not.  We're just not\n                     quick to run and boast.  In case\n                     something went wrong.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     And then, something did.  Carl\n                     Heine was found dead.  With his\n                     head crushed.\n\n     She weathers that last part.  As if taking no notice.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Yes, and then, what was there\n                     to call about?  Everything was\n                     up in the air.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     Up in the air?  Was that your\n                     reaction?\n\n     And he rises.  Tastefully indignant.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     I would suggest that more happened\n                     than a land sale evaporating.  A\n                     man died, Mrs. Miyamoto.

Well, did you come\n                     forward to tell Sheriff Moran\n                     what you knew?  The encounter in\n                     the fog, the...dead battery, was it?\n\n     Silence.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     We discussed that.

Concealing\n                     information during the course of\n                     a sheriff's investigation.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     It seems human.

Now what happened the\n                     day Carl Heine was found?

We\n                     talked for a few hours.  I left at\n                     six and went straight to my boat.\n\n                               HOOKS\n                     Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands,\n                     no purchases?  Just straight to the\n                     boat.

If you left one with\n                     Carl Heine, how is that possible?\n\n                               KABUO\n                     I had a spare battery in my shed.\n                     I brought it down, and put it in\n                     just before the sheriff showed up.\n\n     Ah.

Only\n                     you didn't mention that a moment ago.\n                     Why does this battery story change\n                     every time a new question is raised?\n\n     Kabuo looks at him, evenly.\n\n                               KABUO\n                     You asked if I went straight to the\n                     boat.

COURTROOM - LATER\n\n     CLOSE on handcuffs SNAPPING into place.

Grasping Kabuo's arm, Moran\n     begins leading him toward a small doorway just at the rear of the\n     witness box.  But...\n\n     ...someone is there.  In the doorway.

Such as they are.  A few\n     bare bulbs strung across the rafters of this towering ramshackle\n     enclosure.  A 50-year-old mildewed barn, built of creosoted\n     timbers.  This is a place for overhauling boats, with sea doors\n     facing the harbor.\n\n     Two BOATS are tied to wide-elbowed piers.

If the public\n                     cares enough to read it.\n\n     They step across the gunnel.  Onto Carl Heine's boat.  Flashlights\n     working against the dim, eerie glow of distant bulbs, they enter\n     Carl's cabin.\n\n     Neat as a pin.  Ishmael scans the floor.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     You said there was a coffee c...\n\n                               ABEL (sorry)\n                     I picked it up.\n\n     And points to the cup.

Because Ishmael's gaze has gone to a kerosene lantern.\n     In the corner.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     One lantern.  Like the inventory\n                     says.  Sorry to disappoint you.\n\n     But Ishmael is out the door.  Shining his flashlight.  Up the mast.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Actually.  I was hoping you got\n                     it right.  What's that, up there?\n\n     And they all squint up.  Shining their lights together.  Along the\n     cross spar.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     Nothin'.  Bits of string.\n\n     That's what it looks like.  Many of them.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Pieces of twine aren't nothing.\n\n     And he steps to the base of the mast.  Puts the flashlight in his\n     pocket.  Wraps his arm around the shaft of wood.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     Here now, what are you fixin'\n                     to do?\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     Have a look.  At nothing.\n\n     And wrapping his legs around the mast, he hoists himself up.\n\n                               MORAN\n                     You can't go up there, touch things...\n\n     With all his strength.

Same report Milholland\n                     heard.  And that makes him get the\n                     lantern fast.

Not beyond a\n                     reasonable doubt.\n\n     And he smiles.  First time.\n\n                               ISHMAEL\n                     It's fortunate that the man who\n                     needs to prove his fancy story.\n                     Beyond a reasonable doubt.  Is\n                     someone else.\n\n     There is laughter in the room, so welcome is any chance to relieve\n     the tension.

Two PHOTOGRAPHERS pop flashes that she does not seem to\n     notice, as she continues with refined determination, and we...\n\n     PULL BACK, down the hallway to the POV of a man who sits alone,\n     unnoticed.  There is an unopened pack of cigarettes in his only\n     hand, turning absently in long, strong fingers that crinkle the\n     pristine cellophane.

You felt the same\n                     as your husband, I expect?\n\n     Her eyes move to the eager young man.  She reflects for a beat.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     Honestly, no.\n\n     Which catches everyone.  A little short.\n\n                               HATSUE (quietly)\n                     I felt my husband would be found\n                     guilty.  Unless proven innocent.\n\n     No apologies for the truth.  That's not her way.\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     And Mr. Chambers did that.\n\n     INT. COURTHOUSE BASEMENT\n\n     A vending machine stands in silence.  The eerie strobing glow of\n     defective neon.  PULL BACK as...\n\n     Ishmael thinks it over.  Drops in his dime.  Pulls the plunger, to\n     watch a Snickers fall.  Scoops the candy from the tray, pins it\n     between his body and the machine.\n\n     ...tears the wrapper.\n\n     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR\n\n     BACK to the reporters.  The crowd of onlookers has grown.\n\n                               REPORTER #3\n                     ...can we get some background on\n                     your handsome family?  I understand\n                     you two were childhood sweethearts...\n\n     And brings his Parker pen to his notepad.  His subject smiles\n     easily...\n\n                               KABUO\n                     Well, no sir, not exactly.  We met\n                     in the Manzanar camp, you see, so I\n                     guess that was the most beautiful\n                     place I've ever been.\n\n     There is gentle laughter.  And as Kabuo looks up, he sees something\n     in the rear of the crowd.  Something we do not.  And softly...\n\n                               KABUO\n                     No, her first love was another\n                     fella...\n\n     Which brings Hatsue's eyes up, following his gaze.  And there, in\n     the back.  A man watches.  Eating a candy bar.\n\n                               KABUO (O.S.)\n                     I was the lucky one.\n\n     No one sees their eyes lock.  It is only an instant.\n\n     It is enough.\n\n                               REPORTER #4\n                     It all sounds very romantic,\n                     ma'am.  Falling in love under\n                     those circumstances...\n\n     And as she looks to the reporter, Ishmael begins to walk away...\n\n                               HATSUE\n                     He went off to the Army, right\n                     from Manzanar.  And that last\n                     night, we danced alone in the\n                     desert...\n\n     And somehow, Ishmael catches the eye of Hatsue's 4-year-old\n     daughter.  So he pulls a coin from his pocket...\n\n                               HATSUE (O.S.)\n                     I told him.  If you don't come\n                     back alive, I'll kill you.\n\n     ...Ishmael ROLLS the coin across his knuckles.  And the child\n     responds...\n\n     With her mother's smile.\n\n     EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DUSK\n\n     Alone on the steps where the Strawberry Princess once winked at\n     him.  Snow has begun to fall, soft and altogether beautiful.  He\n     squints up...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     God's kindness, my father said.\n                     Despite the hardship...it reminds\n                     us.  Of our place in things.\n\n     Our place in things.  He slides a black cigar between his teeth...\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     What the hell.

Freighters plowing through...\n\n     Cupping it expertly in a single motion, he brings the flame to the\n     cigar.  A single puff.\n\n                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)\n                     And we seem...helpless.  Until we\n                     understand.\n\n     One more.  Savors it.  The sky.
