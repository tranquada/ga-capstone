Well,\r\n          weirder.\r\n          Toothless spots a nearby sheep and makes a move toward it. As\r\n          a result, Hiccup is suddenly PULLED TIGHT against the window\r\n          shutters. He STRIKES A POSE to compensate... then gets PULLED\r\n          THROUGH the shutters. They snap back in Astrid's face.\r\n          Astrid reopens them and finds nothing but an empty stall.\r\n          In the distance, Toothless and Hiccup slip off unseen.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

The rings of\r\n          his vest float off of the harness hooks. Hiccup suddenly\r\n          finds himself detached, free-falling.\r\n\r\n          HICCUP (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh gods!

The expanding fireball races toward\r\n          them, about to swallow them.\r\n          They manage to clear the obstacles.

I'm happy to see you\r\n          too, bud. Now just--\r\n          Toothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT\r\n          UPRIGHT with a YELP.\r\n          He looks around, confounded. He's in his bed, moved beside\r\n          the fire pit on the main floor of his house.\r\n\r\n          HICCUP (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm in my house.\r\n          (re: Toothless, leaning\r\n          over him, excited)\r\n          You're in my house.\r\n          Toothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far\r\n          too big for the space.\r\n\r\n          HICCUP (CONT'D)\r\n          Uh...does my dad know you're in\r\n          here?!\r\n          Toothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He\r\n          eyes the rafters... and LEAPS UP onto them, brimming with\r\n          'happy dog' energy.\r\n\r\n          HICCUP (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (DISTRESSED)\r\n          Okay, okay -- no Toothless! Aw,\r\n          come on...\r\n          Hiccup shifts to get out of bed... then pauses... sensing\r\n          that something is wrong.\r\n          He peels back the covers slowly. What he sees startles,\r\n          horrifies, and overwhelms him -- all at once.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Dragon\" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 102.\r\n\r\n          ON THE BARE FLOOR\r\n          His booted foot touches down. Followed by a mechanical\r\n          prosthetic in place of his second leg. It's an ingenious\r\n          spring-loaded replacement, made of wood and iron.\r\n          Toothless lands by the bed and approaches calmly, sniffing\r\n          the new leg. He raises his eyes to meet Hiccup's, seemingly\r\n          aware of what Hiccup is going through.\r\n          Hiccup braces himself on the bedpost and tries to stand on\r\n          it. He winces and stifles the pain...\r\n\r\n          HICCUP (CONT'D)\r\n          Okay...okay...\r\n          ... but STUMBLES with the first step. Toothless catches\r\n          Hiccup's fall with his head... and slowly lifts him up,\r\n          stabilizing him.\r\n\r\n          HICCUP (CONT'D)\r\n          Thanks bud.\r\n          Hiccup leans on him like a crutch. They take a few steps\r\n          together.\r\n          Their missing parts form a poetic silhouette as they make\r\n          their way toward the door.\r\n          Hiccup pries it open (as he did in the opening scene),\r\n          revealing a MONSTROUS NIGHTMARE flapping outside the door.\r\n          Hiccup YELPS and slams the door closed. He turns to\r\n          Toothless, alarmed.\r\n\r\n          HICCUP (CONT'D)\r\n          Toothless? Stay here, bud.\r\n          Hiccup pauses... and cracks the door open again. He peeks\r\n          outside, his eyes widening. He allows to door to swing open,\r\n          revealing...\r\n          ... the Monstrous Nightmare, carrying Snotlout on its back.\r\n\r\n                         SNOTLOUT\r\n          Come on guys, get ready!

No one seems upset, there\r\n          isn't a sword in sight.\r\n          Under the framework of a MASSIVE BARN, a Nadder BLASTS fire\r\n          onto a metal brace. It steps back to let a Viking hammer it\r\n          into shape. Nearby, a Gronkle lands, carrying a tree trunk in\r\n          his mouth. He shows a Viking what he's found. The Viking pats\r\n          his head. Another Viking backs a Zippleback into a stall to\r\n          check it for size.\r\n          Hiccup takes a step outside, finding Stoick waiting for him\r\n          on the step.\r\n\r\n                         HICCUP\r\n          I knew it.
