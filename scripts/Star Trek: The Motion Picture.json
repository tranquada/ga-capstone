But Kirk does not see them; his\n\t      mind is tormented by the transporter accident -- was\n\t      there something he should have done, could have done,\n\t      to prevent it? Should he launch on schedule with the\n\t      starship this unready? Has he done right in yielding\n\t      to this terrible needs for starship command again,\n\t      forcing Starfleet to give her to him? Would Decker's\n\t      knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci-\n\t      dent?\n\n\t      Kirk reaches a corridor intersection, looks around,\n\t      realizes he's lost track of where he is.

Only then does Spock seem to\n\t      become aware of Kirk and Decker standing there with\n\t      questioning expressions.\n\n\t                              SPOCK\n\t                        (continuing)\n\t                I offer my services as Science\n\t                Officer.\n\n\t      Kirk starts to grin -- then remembers to wipe it off\n\t      his face as he turns to Decker.\n\n\t                              KIRK\n\t                If our Executive Officer has no\n\t                objections...?\n\n\t                              DECKER\n\t                        (interrupting)\n\t                Of course not.

Spock gives McCoy a similar\n\t      glance - turns back to his console readings as:\n\n\t                              UHURA\n\t                That's how we all feel, Mister...\n\n\t      The same cold glance causes Uhura to stop in mid-\n\t      sentence.

The medium from which the\n\t      ship moves appears almost solid, to the point where it\n\t      seems incredible that the ship can be pulled through\n\t      it at all. The entire chamber pulses with machine-\n\t      like, alien life. This should even be evidenced in the\n\t      booming POWERFIELD LIGHTENING BOLTS as they course in\n\t      ever more frighteningly close proximity to the ship as:\n\n\t  350A   INT BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER                         350A\n\n\t      The crew all watching the awesome spectacle of V'ger's\n\t      interior (on the viewer) as the Enterprise is being\n\t      pulled toward the brain complex.

In the\n\t      midst of it, Kirk finds a SHAFT OF LIGHT very much\n\t      centering on him.
