These very mobile cameras move around\r\n          the set, and get constantly closer and further from the\r\n          characters. Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such\r\n          as \u00ablong shot\u00bb or \u00abfull shot\u00bb or \u00abmedium shot\u00bb here and there to\r\n          give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the\r\n          beginning of each sequence. And then we'll mention the movements\r\n          of the camera.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n                         TRISTAR LOGO\r\n          Winged white horse flying over clouds\r\n                         \r\n \r\n                         BLACK SCREEN\r\n                         \r\n          CREDITS IN WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK SCREEN\r\n                         \r\n          We hear jazz music during the credits.\r\n                         \r\n          END OF CREDITS\r\n                         \r\n          NEW-YORK - AERIAL VIEW - EXTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          While the camera is flying over New-York, we keep on hearing the\r\n          jazz music.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and\r\n          starts moving around the building.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          HOCKEY GAME - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Long shot on the skating rink. A hockey game is in progress on the\r\n          rink. The camera follows a player, and then pans on the audience.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera stops on a medium shot of Larry and Carol, a couple in\r\n          their early fifties. Larry seems fascinated by the game, but Carol\r\n          seems to find it boring. She looks at the ceiling, and then puts\r\n          her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn. Larry turns toward\r\n          her.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Come on.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           What?\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without\r\n           being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you\r\n           next week.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           I know, honey, I promised.

Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see\r\n           the puck.\r\n                         \r\n          The crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has\r\n          done something really good. Carol mockingly claps her hands.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Yay, hooray.\r\n                         \r\n          Then she raises her eyes to the ceiling, seeming more bored than\r\n          ever.\r\n                         \r\n          LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          A nice-looking apartment building in New-York.\r\n                         \r\n          Full shot of the lobby. We see the street through the glass door.\r\n          An uniformed attendant is standing near a counter, on which he is\r\n          writing on a book.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry and Carol are coming from the street and entering the\r\n          building. He is carrying some shopping bags, and she is reading a\r\n          newspaper, the \u00abDaily News\u00bb.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Yeah.\r\n                         \r\n          The attendant slightly turns around and bows to them. They bow\r\n          back to him. He goes back to his book-keeping, and the couple\r\n          keeps on walking through the lobby.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve\r\n           victims, dismembered them and ate them.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Yeah, I'll say.\r\n                         \r\n          They reach the two elevators. Larry presses the call-button on the\r\n          wall between the two elevators.\r\n                         \r\n          LARRY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Medium shot inside the cabin of the elevator. The inner door\r\n          slides open. Carol enters first, still reading her newspaper.\r\n          Larry enters behind her and presses a button on the control panel.\r\n                         \r\n           PAUL (voice over)\r\n           Hold the elevator.\r\n                         \r\n           LILLIAN (voice over)\r\n           I'm coming.\r\n                         \r\n          Hearing people's voices, Larry puts his hand on the edge of the\r\n          door to keep it from closing.\r\n                         \r\n           PAUL (voice over)\r\n           Hold the elevator.\r\n                         \r\n          Paul and Lilian enter the elevator. They are a middle-aged couple.\r\n          He is bald and tall, and very smily. She is small, with grey hair.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           That's right.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           Thank you.\r\n                         \r\n          Lilian has a broad smile when she recognizes Larry and Carol. The\r\n          elevator door slides shut. Lilian looks at Carol.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh, you do ?\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline.\r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           It's important to put that time in. It does wonders.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh god, yeah. I agree with you.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           Exercising changed my life.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Well, geez...\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           We bought a treadmill last week.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it\r\n           because it was just taking up too much space.\r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           Oh, it-it-it...\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a\r\n           while. That was her problem.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all\r\n           those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never\r\n           gonna get that.\r\n                         \r\n          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Full shot of a very sober and modern hallway. Creme-colored walls,\r\n          grey carpeting, dark wooden doors.\r\n                         \r\n          We hear the elevator door opening and Carol comes out, followed by\r\n          Lilian, Larry and Paul. They all talk together and we can hardly\r\n          understand the following dialogue.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh, I know.

You have neighbors. You never\r\n           meet them... You guys...\r\n                         \r\n          The following line, said by Lilian, is clearer and we understand\r\n          it better.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           ... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know...\r\n           and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           Well, anyway... good night.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry and Carol walk away from Lilian and Paul, who remain near\r\n          the elevator.\r\n                         \r\n           CAROL (voice over)\r\n           Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that...\r\n                         \r\n          Paul bends down to pick up something on the carpet. Lilian walks\r\n          one step in Larry's direction.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           Oh, uh, say, hello ?\r\n                         \r\n          Paul starts opening his apartment door, just across the hallway\r\n          from the elevator.\r\n                         \r\n           CAROL (voice over)\r\n           Huh ? Yeah ?\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           Huh, listen... why don't you come in for a-a-a second and\r\n           have a drink with us ? I mean, we'd really love that.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera pans around toward Larry and Carol. Larry makes a\r\n          negative sign with his hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh, oh well that'd be fine...\r\n                         \r\n           PAUL (voice over)\r\n           She makes great Irish coffee.\r\n                         \r\n          Mute conversation between Carol and Larry. Larry evidently doesn't\r\n          want to accept Lilian's invitation, but Carol wants to.\r\n                         \r\n           LILLIAN (voice over)\r\n           Oh, please ?

Very rare... and\r\n           very beautiful.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry is seated near a small table, on which Paul puts the book\r\n          down.

And this plate block is quite unique because\r\n           it has a flaw in the engraving. See if you can see it.\r\n          Larry, who is not interested in philately at all, scratches his\r\n          head.\r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Uh, it's hard for me.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           Actually I'll give you a little hint.

I mean, so, we...\r\n                         \r\n          In the background, behind Larry, we see Carol and Lilian entering\r\n          the room.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           Coffee's ready !\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Oh, coffee.

Come on in.\r\n                         \r\n          We see Paul's hand on Larry's shoulder, pushing him toward the\r\n          centre of the room.\r\n                         \r\n          A little later.\r\n                         \r\n          Full shot of the room. They are all seated around a low table,\r\n          Larry and Carol on the sofa, Paul and Lilian on two armchairs.\r\n          They've just finished their coffee.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           Well, we've never had any children, but it's easy to\r\n           empathize. Oh, um, uh, what college does your son attend ?\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Brown.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           Oh.\r\n                          PAUL\r\n           Nice color.\r\n                         \r\n          They all laugh.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           Paul never attended college.

First is health, then knowledge, then\r\n           money.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry puts his cup down on the low table.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just...\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           And, do you work ?\r\n                         \r\n          Larry stands up.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Huh ?

Her duck and fennel\r\n           omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with\r\n           truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal\r\n           position and have you in bed screaming for a month.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic\r\n           food.\r\n                         \r\n                          LILLIAN\r\n           My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything\r\n           with fat.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh, really ?

On\r\n           her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Yeah. Oh no.

It is the apartment of a couple of New-York\r\n          intellectuals, with nice, artistic furniture. We hear a door\r\n          opening.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little\r\n           longer in there ?\r\n                         \r\n          Lights are switched on.\r\n                         \r\n          Full shot.

The partition is\r\n          only a half wall. There is a opening, without door, at each end of\r\n          the partition, to go from one section of the room to the other.\r\n                         \r\n           CAROL (voice over)\r\n           Oh, come on, Larry.

He lied.\r\n                         \r\n          She puts the box in a cupboard above the sink.

Then he picks up a brochure on a low\r\n          table and walks toward the kitchen. The camera follows him.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           So what ?

So, he went\r\n           someplace.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           All right. So, I'm right, though.\r\n                         \r\n          She starts walking back to the bedroom. Larry follows her.

Carol is crossing the\r\n          street. She stops walking while on the crosswalk. The camera zooms\r\n          on her and we see an expression of surprise on her face.\r\n                         \r\n          Reverse angle long shot on the entrance of Larry's building. Paul\r\n          comes out of the building.

With a\r\n          screwdriver and a plier in his hands, he is working on something\r\n          we don't see.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Jack, do you think you could come upstairs today, because I\r\n           got a leak in the kitchen ?\r\n                         \r\n                          JACK\r\n           Well, yeah.

I'll be right back.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera follows Jack walking away.\r\n                         \r\n           CAROL (voice over)\r\n           Yeah. Okay. All right. Oh, God.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera turns around to a reverse angle shot on Carol, still in\r\n          the workshop. She looks around, apparently looking for something.\r\n          She peeks through the door of the workshop, to make sure Jack is\r\n          not coming back too early. Carol rushes to a key-box on the wall,\r\n          into which there is a spare key for every apartment in the\r\n          building. She selects a key, takes it out of the box and puts it\r\n          in her pocket. Then she leaves the workshop toward the staircase.\r\n                         \r\n          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Full shot of the hallway. Carol comes out of the elevator, and\r\n          looks around her. She walks back and forth in the hallway, before\r\n          coming back to Paul's apartment door, just in front of the\r\n          elevator. She opens the door with the key she has just stolen in\r\n          Jack's workshop.\r\n                         \r\n          PAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Full shot of the front door, seen from the living room.

She kneels down to look into the\r\n          cupboard where she had found the funeral urn. Apparently the urn\r\n          is not there anymore.\r\n                         \r\n          NEW YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Long shot on a crosswalk in New-York. Paul is crossing the street.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera zooms on Paul. He has almost crossed the street, but he\r\n          suddenly stops a few feet from the next sidewalk. He feels his\r\n          jacket : apparently he has forgotten something in his apartment.\r\n          He turns around and starts walking back on the crosswalk.\r\n                         \r\n          PAUL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Carol is still looking in all the cupboards of the kitchen.

She walks\r\n          away from the room. The camera spins back to the front door, which\r\n          opens. Paul enters and switches the lights on. He closes the front\r\n          door, and walks along the corridor to the living-room.\r\n                         \r\n          Carol walks into the kitchen from the living-room.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera pans to Paul, looking for something on his desk.

He starts walking across the\r\n          room, and the camera pans back to Carol in the kitchen. She rushes\r\n          out of the kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera remains at the same spot, and we see Paul in the\r\n          living-room, still looking for whatever he is missing.

He puts them inside the inner pocket of his jacket. He\r\n          starts walking out of the room, when the phone rings. He stops and\r\n          picks up the phone receiver on one of the night-tables.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           Hallo.\r\n                         \r\n          Medium shot of Carol hiding under the bed.

He stops, thinks for a couple of seconds, turns around, sits\r\n          on the bed and picks up the phone.\r\n          Back to Carol under the bed. The bed frame hits her back when Paul\r\n          sits on it. She looks up. We hear Paul dialing a number.\r\n                         \r\n           PAUL (voice over)\r\n           Extension five.

In the forefront, a reception\r\n          desk, with a young female receptionist talking to someone we still\r\n          don't see. Coming from the other end of the room, Larry is walking\r\n          with Marcia, a tall dark-haired lady, wearing sunglasses.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           So, I thought your rewrites were great.

I think the book is great.\r\n           Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much\r\n           of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how\r\n           much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own\r\n           life ?\r\n          They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private\r\n          room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on\r\n          a sofa.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARCIA\r\n           Well, I was a waitress.

This shot is low-angled because the lounge is\r\n          located slightly above street level. Carol is seated in front of\r\n          the window, looking very pensive. She takes a sip of her glass of\r\n          wine. She looks absently though the window.\r\n                         \r\n          NEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAY\r\n          The street seen through the window, next to which Carol is seated,\r\n          but we don't actually see Carol. We see a big car, followed by a\r\n          bus. The camera zooms on the bus. Through one of the bus windows,\r\n          we see a woman, seated inside the bus. And this woman looks very\r\n          much like the deceased Lilian, Paul's wife.\r\n                         \r\n          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Close shot on the window, in front of which Carol is seated. She\r\n          looks at the passing bus, with a wide open mouth, and a surprised,\r\n          almost frightened, expression on her face. She stands up a little\r\n          and then sits back.\r\n                         \r\n          NEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Full view of the room. In the background, Carol, still seated by\r\n          the window. She stands up, picks up her purse, and starts crossing\r\n          the room, bumping into people. She reaches the staircase, and\r\n          walks downstairs.\r\n                         \r\n          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY\r\n          Full view on the entrance of the lounge. Carol is walking rapidly\r\n          down the stairs leading to the entrance. She reaches the sidewalk,\r\n          and looks around her for the bus. She walks away from the lounge\r\n          and toward us, with the camera on a tracking shot in front of her.\r\n                         \r\n          LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Medium shot of Larry working in the kitchen, putting things away\r\n          in the cupboards. Behind him, we see the front hall. The front\r\n          door opens and Carol walks in.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers' today for Nick,\r\n           today.\r\n                         \r\n          Carols closes the door and leans on the wall. But Larry doesn't\r\n          seem to understand that something is wrong with her. He walks away\r\n          to the sitting room. He keeps on talking in voice over, while\r\n          Carol is still leaning on the wall of the front hall.\r\n                         \r\n           LARRY (voice over)\r\n           Really beautiful. It's cashmere. Very expensive. The kid\r\n           looked so handsome in it, though. Also, I decided I'd cook\r\n           dinner tonight. My one dish tuna casserole.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry comes back in the kitchen and looks at his wife, but still\r\n          doesn't seem to notice that something is wrong. We follow Larry\r\n          into the sitting-room.\r\n                         \r\n          LARRY'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Larry is setting the table for dinner\r\n                         \r\n           CAROL (voice over)\r\n           Well, no wonder he had her cremated.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           What ?\r\n                         \r\n           CAROL (voice over)\r\n           Mrs. House.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Oh, Jesus.

It is very dark\r\n          and the sidewalks are wet from a recent rain.\r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Jesus, it's starting to rain again. Can you believe that ?\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh, God. If only Ted were with us, he'd have a million\r\n           theories about this, I'll tell you that.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Yeah, I know. I know. Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh, right.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera hasn't moved, so now we get a medium shot of Larry and\r\n          Carol. They have reached their car, and Carol walks around it to\r\n          get into the passenger's seat.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           You know what I think ? I think it's possible. That hotel\r\n           room was on the, on the ext... That end of the hall.\r\n          The camera tilts up the facade of the Waldron Hotel.\r\n                         \r\n           CAROL (voice over)\r\n           What ? Yeah ?\r\n                         \r\n           LARRY (voice over)\r\n           It's right up there.

Why would...\r\n                         \r\n          The two windows, which Larry is pointing at, suddenly get lit.\r\n                         \r\n           CAROL (voice over)\r\n           Ohhh !... What are the lights...\r\n                         \r\n           LARRY (voice over)\r\n           Oh, Jesus.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera tilts back down to street level. Larry and Carol are\r\n          around their car, ready to climb in.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Larry, the lights !\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Yeah, that's eerie, isn't it ?\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           My God.

Why don't\r\n           we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can\r\n           check it out while we're home in the... ?\r\n          Carol walks away from the car toward the hotel.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh, no, the police are red tape. Come on. This is my case,\r\n           honey.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry catches up with her. The camera remains on the sidewalk,\r\n          looking at the couple walking toward the hotel.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           What do you mean, it's your case ?\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Yes, it's my case.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Hey, come here.

Behind\r\n          the window, the night clerk is sorting some paper. There is a\r\n          grill in the window, to allow people to to talk to the clerk.\r\n                         \r\n          Carol and Larry walk to the window.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Um, excuse me.

Yes. Mm-hm. Yeah.\r\n           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK\r\n           You are Police ?\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Ee... Ooh, um, just, uh-uh...

Your card. He's got his card.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry goes through the pockets of his jacket and gets the business\r\n          card the police officer gave him. He shows it to the clerk and\r\n          then slides it through a small rectangular hole at the bottom of\r\n          the window. The clerk takes it and looks at it.\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Yeah.

Six-eleven ? Okay. Great.\r\n                         \r\n          The clerks goes and gets the key of the room. He gives it to\r\n          Carol, who drops the card on the small counter under the window.\r\n                         \r\n           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK\r\n           Is there any trouble ?\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           No, no, no, no, no.

Larry keeps looking around while Carol is opening\r\n          the door.\r\n                         \r\n          HOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Full shot of the room with the door in the background.

The door opens\r\n          and the cleaning lady walks in with her bucket and things. Larry\r\n          is ready to hit her, but, when he realizes who she is, he drops\r\n          the lamp. The cleaning lady yells.\r\n                          CLEANING LADY\r\n           Ahhh !... Oh, Jesus!

At this early hour of the night,\r\n          the bridge still has a lot of traffic moving on it. Then the\r\n          camera moves down to get a closer look of the traffic on the\r\n          bridge.\r\n                         \r\n           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)\r\n           Oh, Jesus. I-I can't c... I can't follow his car.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera follows the moving traffic on the bridge, and certainly\r\n          also follows Larry's car, even though, from this height, we can't\r\n          tell which car it is.\r\n                         \r\n           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)\r\n           Well, he's right up ahead.

You know, I'm not a good driver. I can't chase\r\n           somebody in a car. I'm gonna have an accident.

Larry's car drives slowly inside the park, coming toward\r\n          us. There is no one else at this time of the night. The place is\r\n          lit by a few lampposts, and there is smoke behind Larry's car.\r\n                         \r\n           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)\r\n           You have no sense of direction.

It is inside a huge building. But they don't go inside the\r\n          building and, instead, keep on running along the building.\r\n                         \r\n          Medium shot on Larry and Carol.

A body, half-\r\n          wrapped in a white sheet, is being lifted by a huge electromagnet.\r\n           LARRY (voice over)\r\n           Oh, my God ! It's Mrs. House's body !\r\n                         \r\n          Reverse high-angle shot on Larry and Carol, as if they were seen\r\n          from the magnet.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           Come on ! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry takes Carol's hand and runs toward the magnet.\r\n                         \r\n          Reverse angle long shot on a group of workers in the background.\r\n          Then the camera pans to a reverse angle medium shot on Larry and\r\n          Carol coming out between rows of huge heavy-duty bags.\r\n                         \r\n          Reverse angle medium shot on a huge cauldron full of hot melted\r\n          metal. A huge pair of metal jaws is dropping metal scraps into the\r\n          cauldron. Among the metal scraps, we see Mrs. House's body\r\n                         \r\n                          CAROL\r\n           Oh, my God.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera zooms to a close shot on the cauldron.\r\n                         \r\n           LARRY (voice over)\r\n           Good bye, Mrs. House.\r\n                         \r\n          Reverse angle shot on Larry and Carol. Then reverse angle long\r\n          shot on the cauldron. A lot of bright sparks are coming out of the\r\n          cauldron.\r\n                         \r\n          Long shot on the building. Larry and Carol are coming out of the\r\n          building. They start running toward the camera. The camera pans\r\n          around to a medium shot on Paul's car. Through the windshield, we\r\n          see Paul behind the wheel, lit by the red light coming from the\r\n          melted metal. He starts the car and drives away.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera pans around toward Carol and Larry, still running - too\r\n          late - toward Paul's car.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           That was Mr. House !

In the middle of the\r\n          stage floor, a white circle, on which there is a chair and a small\r\n          table with a telephone. Suzanne Raphael, a young woman, is\r\n          auditioning. She is seated on the chair, holding the telephone.\r\n          Behind Suzanne, which is the left side of the stage seen from the\r\n          audience, a white wall, with a doorless opening. On either side of\r\n          the wall, two red columns. And on either side of the girl, which\r\n          are the front and the back of the stage, two red metallic frames.\r\n          In front of the girl, a video camera on a tripod, with an operator\r\n          standing behind the camera. Actually, the operator is Sy, Larry\r\n          and Carol's friend, whom we have seen much earlier in the film, in\r\n          the antique market and at Elaine's restaurant. The stage is well\r\n          lit, when the audience hall is in the dark.\r\n                         \r\n                          SUZANNE\r\n           Yeah, well, Dad, you know, I've heard just about enough of\r\n           this.\r\n                         \r\n          She slams the phone down. The camera pans around to show us the\r\n          right side of the stage, where there is several rows of theatre\r\n          seats and a table in front of the seats. Ted, Marcia and Marilyn\r\n          are seated in the front row. Marilyn is Sy's wife, whom we have\r\n          also seen earlier in the film. Carol is seated in the second row,\r\n          behind Marcia.\r\n                         \r\n                          TED\r\n           Good, that's great. Thank you, Suzanne.

The camera pans\r\n          back on the stage. Larry, with a clipboard in his hand, has\r\n          entered the stage, pushing Helen in front of him.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           This is Helen Moss.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN\r\n           Hi, there.\r\n                         \r\n           CAROL (voice over)\r\n           Hi, there.\r\n                         \r\n           MARCIA (voice over)\r\n           Hi.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN\r\n           Hi.\r\n                         \r\n          Medium close shot on Ted, who stands up, and walks toward the\r\n          stage.

Helen takes a very deep breathing, sits down, puts\r\n          her hands trough her hair, takes another breathing, and picks up\r\n          the phone handset from the telephone on the table. She overdoes it\r\n          a lot, trying to act as the prima dona she is not.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN\r\n           Yeah, okay.\r\n                         \r\n          She dials a fake number on the phone keyboard.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN\r\n           Hello, Joe ?

I can't talk much, now, and if I sound\r\n           strange, don't get alarmed.\r\n                         \r\n          Later. Helen is auditioning another scene. She doesn't have the\r\n          phone in her hand any more. She is holding a script and looking at\r\n          it. Larry is seated in front of her, and read his own script on\r\n          his clipboard.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN\r\n           Give me your hand. Hold on. Try not to fall. Hold on.\r\n                         \r\n                          LARRY\r\n           I'm trying, I'm trying.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN\r\n           Quickly !

Close shot of Helen's face auditioning another scene.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN\r\n           They're asking two hundred thousand dollars for it. Yeah.\r\n           They say it's Monet, but I say it's a fake.\r\n                         \r\n          Medium shot of Helen, seen from behind. We see Sy standing behind\r\n          his camera on her right, and Larry standing with his clipboard in\r\n          his hand on her left. In the background, Ted, Marcia, Marilyn and\r\n          Carol listening to her. While Helen is talking, the camera moves\r\n          backward through the opening in the scenery.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN\r\n           Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on\r\n           everything. A dark cloud, a pall.\r\n                         \r\n          A BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT.\r\n                         \r\n          Full shot on the upper level of a building, that could be either\r\n          Ted's theatre of Sy's workshop. The camera tilts down to street\r\n          level.\r\n                         \r\n          SY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          We are inside Sy's workshop. It is full of very high-tech video\r\n          and audio equipment.\r\n                         \r\n          Medium shot of Marilyn standing behind a computer. Close to her,\r\n          Carol is seated on a table, and Ted is standing next to her. They\r\n          are both looking at a large video monitor. On the monitor screen\r\n          and on the computer screen, we see the same picture of Helen\r\n          auditioning with the telephone in her hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN'S VOICE\r\n           Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, right now...\r\n                         \r\n          The camera pans to Marcia, seated behind Carol and also looking at\r\n          the monitor. Behind her, Sy is looking at another monitor, and\r\n          manipulating some switches on an editing machine underneath the\r\n          monitor. Larry is standing next to him.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN'S VOICE\r\n           ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.\r\n                         \r\n          Sy rewinds the video tape.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN'S VOICE\r\n           Hello, Joe ?

Ever since Joe came back from Vietnam...\r\n                         \r\n          Close shot on Ted's face, then the camera pans to Carol and\r\n          Marcia, seated one behind the other, and behind them, Sy working\r\n          on the editing machine, with Larry standing next to him. The\r\n          camera zooms on Sy.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN'S VOICE\r\n           ... he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall.\r\n                         \r\n          Sy rewinds the tape.\r\n                          HELEN'S VOICE\r\n           A pall.\r\n                         \r\n          Sy rewinds the tape.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN'S VOICE\r\n           Pall.\r\n                         \r\n          Sy rewinds the tape.\r\n                         \r\n                          HELEN'S VOICE\r\n           Pall.\r\n                         \r\n          Slightly later.

We hear Helen's voice distorted by Sy's editing machine.\r\n           HELEN'S VOICE (distorted)\r\n           Hello, Joe.\r\n                         \r\n          The camera pans back on Ted and Marcia, then it pans to a close\r\n          shot of a big high-tech tape recorder, on which Sy is working. We\r\n          see his hands cutting off a short section of the audio tape, and\r\n          gluing back the two severed ends of the tape together.\r\n                         \r\n          Full shot of the room. In the foreground, Sy is working on his\r\n          tape recorder. On his right, Larry is standing and looking at him.\r\n          On his left, Marilyn also looking at him. Behind him, Carol, Ted\r\n          and Marcia, all looking at him.\r\n                         \r\n                          TED\r\n           It's so...\r\n                         \r\n          The camera zooms on Ted and Marcia.\r\n                         \r\n          Close up shot on the tape recorder.

Larry succeeds in\r\n          getting away from Paul, who fires his gun. But, apparently, Larry\r\n          is not hit by the gunshot, because he runs toward the back\r\n          entrance of the movie house. The camera follows him.\r\n          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Medium shot on the staircase on the side of the backstage. Larry\r\n          runs down the stairs, while we hear the sound of the \u00abLady from\r\n          Shangai\u00bb. \u00abThe Lady from Shangai\u00bb is a 1947 film written, directed\r\n          and played by Orson Welles.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)\r\n           That's what Grisby thought. But, of course, she meant to\r\n           kill Grisby, too. After he'd served his purpose. Poor\r\n           howling idiot.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry has now reached the backstage. He is behind the screen, a\r\n          small part of which is seen on the side of the shot.\r\n                         \r\n           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)\r\n           He never even did that. He went and shot Broome. And that\r\n           was not part of the plan. Broome might have got to the\r\n           police before he died.\r\n                         \r\n          Larry walks around the backstage, trying to find his way. We see\r\n          the black and white film on the screen, but also reflections of\r\n          the screen on the multiple mirrors scattered around the backstage.\r\n                         \r\n           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)\r\n           And if the cops traced it to Grisby... and the cops made\r\n           Grisby talk, he'd spill everything.\r\n                         \r\n          Medium shot on the staircase.

Not even a gunshot.\r\n                         \r\n          Behind Paul, we see the film on the screen. We have now reached\r\n          the famous last scene of the film, shot in the hall of mirrors.\r\n          Rita Hayworth's face is reflected on the many mirrors in the film,\r\n          just like, in the actual scene in the backstage, Paul and Larry\r\n          are reflected on the many mirrors scattered around.\r\n                         \r\n           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)\r\n           I knew I'd find you two together.\r\n                         \r\n          Arthur's figure, walking with a cane, is reflected in the many\r\n          mirrors in the film. Just the same, Gladys, who has just entered\r\n          the backstage, walking with a cane, is also reflected on the\r\n          mirrors scattered around her. She has a gun in the hand which is\r\n          not holding the cane.\r\n                         \r\n          While Gladys and Paul are talking, the film keeps on showing on\r\n          the screen behind them, but we do not understand the words from\r\n          the film, because Paul and Gladys' voices are louder.\r\n                         \r\n                          GLADYS\r\n           Hallo, Paul.
