EARLY MORNING. - CUSTOMER SERVICE KIOSK                          1\n\n               JAFFA, a Jamaican looking fellow in his early 20's, arrives\n               at Water World, carrying a dusty cardboard box.\n\n               There are a few workers milling about, setting up the park\n               for opening. He passes EDDIE, a 25-something grounds worker\n               with Down's Syndrome.\n\n                                     JAFFA\n                         Eddie!\n\n                                   EDDIE\n                             (smiling, nodding)\n                         Jaffa.\n\n               They do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked\n               out some time in the past. JAFFA proceeds up to the Customer\n               Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the\n               kiosk. We see him open the box, it is full of CD's.\n\n               He pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a CD\n               player and amplifiers. He starts pushing buttons he's pushed\n               a thousand times, and lights come on. He pulls down a\n               microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works.\n\n               He reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out. We see it\n               is Sheryl Crow. He gets the CD, examines it, and pops it\n               into the CD player.\n\n               He once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he\n               pushes the \"play\" button on the CD player.\n\n               His voice echoes through the park.         \"Soak up the Sun\" begins\n               playing.\n\n                                   JAFFA\n                             (smiling)\n                         Ladies and Gentlemen, Water World will be\n                         open in\n                             (checking his watch)\n                         twenty-six hours and forty-three minutes.\n\n               GFX - OPENING CREDITS BEGIN\n\n       2       EXT EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY                                    2\n\n               BIG MIKE, the park's owner/manager - a 50-something man who\n               is portly and bald, and RICHARD THOMPSON, head lifeguard and\n               another GUARD are on the east side of Thunder Bay.\n\n               There is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter\n               cover on it. The GUARD is standing there with a garden hose\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   Page 2 of 81\n\n               holding it so the water goes into Thunder Bay.\n\n               He is obviously tired, and has been standing there a long\n               time. We look back at the massive size of the pool and get\n               the joke.\n\n               BIG MIKE and RICHARD pull off the winter cover. The GUARD\n               turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting BIG MIKE\n               wet. They object and he turns back to filling Thunder Bay.\n               RICHARD moves the GUARD to a safe distance.\n\n               BIG MIKE blows the dust off of the box at the top of the\n               post, and we see it is a large push button. BIG MIKE looks\n               at RICHARD who nods \"go ahead\" and then pushes the button.\n\n               They both draw back as if something big should happen, but\n               nothing. They look at each other and BIG MIKE motions for\n               RICHARD to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the\n               pool.\n\n               RICHARD waves OK, and BIG MIKE pushes the button again. When\n               nothing happens, RICHARD whacks the side of the tank with his\n               closed fist. Suddenly a huge wave rolls out.\n\n               Nodding his approval, BIG MIKE checks off an item in his\n               clipboard.\n\n       3       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   SURFS UP AREA                       3\n\n               We see people working to open the park. The VAIL PRECISION\n               LAWN CHAIR DRILL TEAM dressed in Water World uniforms is\n               setting and arranging chairs in time to the music. They\n               perform precision maneuvers with the chairs, as if rifles,\n               and cross each other in a timed march to the music.\n\n       4       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   FUN HOUSE AREA                      4\n\n               BIG MIKE is standing under the Fun House structure with a\n               clipboard. He is talking to RICHARD.\n\n               After talking to BIG MIKE, RICHARD shakes his head\n               affirmatively and walks off. He glances up to the two guards\n               above, and grins. BIG MIKE is looking at his clipboard. We\n               see quickly the large water tank above is spilling water a\n               bit, indicating it is full.\n\n               The water tank spills over BIG MIKE drenching him. He stands\n               there still, angry for a moment, then thinks better of it\n               shaking his head and smiling, takes his pen and checks OK on\n               his wet clipboard for the fun house water tank.\n\n       5       EXT. EARLY MORNING. - DAY   FIRST AID SHACK NEAR FUNHOUSE       5\n\n               Two guards are looking down at BIG MIKE below. One guard\n               begins motioning as if guiding a crane into place. The other\n               guard has his hand poised on a large switch lever.\n\n               GUARD ONE is gesturing more emphatically now, closing his\n               hands to indicate \"almost there\". He closes his hands, and\n               GUARD TWO pulls the lever.\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 3 of 81\n\n\n       6       EXT. LATER THAT MORNING - DAY   2001 VW BUG                     6\n\n               We are on the road to Water World in Federal Heights,\n               Colorado. ROBBIE ZIRPOLLO is riding with his mother CONNIE\n               ZIRPOLLO.\n\n                                  ROBBIE\n                            (sardonically)\n                        Yeah. This is great. I love this plan.\n                        Drag me kicking and screaming from my\n                        happy home in California to some weird\n                        place in Colorado, and say hey, this'll\n                        be fun Robbie. Maybe we can go\n                        camping....\n\n                                   CONNIE\n                         Look, I know you're not happy about this.\n                         But it wasn't my idea for your father to\n                         have some kind of mid-life crisis and\n                         disappear with his secretary to Mexico\n                         with our life savings.\n\n                                   ROBBIE\n                         \"Administrative Assistant.\" There's no\n                         such thing as a secretary anymore.\n\n                                  CONNIE\n                        Fine.

I\n                        was able to land a good job here. And\n                        now thanks to Uncle Bernie you have this\n                        job at the Water Park...\n\n                                   ROBBIE\n                             (shaking his head)\n                         Grounds crew. What kind of job is that?\n                         It sound like the guy who cleans out the\n                         coffee pots.\n\n                                  CONNIE\n                        Bernie says you help keep the park clean,\n                        sweep up, that sort of thing.\n                        I'm sure it won't be so bad. Besides, a\n                        lot of the kids who work at this park go\n                        to the same high school you'll be going\n                        to. You can start the school year with\n                        some ready-made friends.\n\n                                   ROBBIE\n                         I had friends in Oceanside. I had\n                         something to do for the summer.\n\n               They pass the main Water World sign.    Hanging below it is a\n               banner that says Opening Tomorrow!.\n\n                                  CONNIE\n                        Hanging out at the beach surfing with\n                        your friends is not my idea of something\n\n\n\n\n\nPage 4 of 81\n\n                         to do. This way you'll make some money\n                         and meet people here. You'd best get\n                         used to it.

EARLY MORNING. - DAY FRONT GATES OF WATER WORLD            7\n\n               There are about 40-50 teenagers in various default street\n               clothes, shorts and tees mostly. Robbie takes his place in\n               line behind an older, taller boy, ALEX, who seems to know\n               almost everyone, and has made it his personal mission to\n               greet them.\n\n                                   ALEX\n                             (back still to ROBBIE)\n                         ...and so SHE says I'll have the filet\n                         AND the lobster\".

Off they\n               go again, get another 50 feet, and the same thing happens.\n\n                                    AOKEE\n                             (out of breath)\n                         Alex......\n                             (wheeze)\n                         ..you got to go ahead...\n                             (wheeze)\n                         ...stall 'til I get there.\n\n                                     ALEX\n                               (nodding, running in place)\n                         OK.\n\n               ALEX takes off, and AOKEE runs again....\n\n     11        EXT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH          11\n\n               WE SEE several rolling trash cans lined up in a row, along\n               with several janitorial carts filled with cleaning utensils\n               and supplies.\n\n               THE COLONEL is standing, dressed in army fatigue pants and a\n               Water World golf shirt, with a green Water World baseball\n               cap. He is wearing black horn-rim glasses, thick lenses, and\n               carrying a clipboard.\n\n               Lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids, including\n               ROBBIE, who is sixth furthest from THE COLONEL. They are all\n               younger than ROBBIE except one, EDDIE, whom we met at the\n               beginning of the film.\n\n               EDDIE is standing tall and straight, proud to be there.      He\n               is nearest THE COLONEL\n\n\n\n\n\n    Page 11 of 81\n\n\n                                   THE COLONEL\n                             (looking up from clipboard)\n                         Well, it looks like we have a good staff\n                         here. Yes...yes a good staff. It will be\n                         an excellent summer. Remember as we go\n                         through training today, our park is\n                         judged by the work WE do. If we do it\n                         well, the people come back.\n                             (walking up and down the line)\n                         We have a little tradition here on the\n                         grounds crew. Rather than having to\n                         learn a lot of names, many of which I can\n                         never hope to pronounce properly, each\n                         grounds crew member gets a grounds crew\n                         nickname. You will be known by that\n                         nickname in every way except, of course,\n                         your paycheck and employee records.\n\n               THE COLONEL looks over his paperwork.\n\n                                   THE COLONEL    (CONT'D)\n                         Let's see, what do we    have? Hmm...yes.\n                         OK, first up is Eddie    Cochran. Your\n                         grounds crew nickname    will be.....Eddie!\n\n               EDDIE smiles knowingly. This has been his grounds crew\n               nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never\n               answer to anything else, and THE COLONEL gave up trying.\n\n                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)\n                         Now crewmembers, listen up. Eddie here\n                         has eight years experience on the grounds\n                         crew. Why, I'd like to think there isn't\n                         anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't\n                         faced. Listen to him. Learn from him.\n                         Watch what he does. This man is the\n                         finest, most conscientious grounds\n                         crewman we've ever had.\n\n               EDDIE is beaming with pride now. THE COLONEL pulls a brand\n               new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to\n               EDDIE. EDDIE shoulders it as if it were a rifle.\n\n               THE COLONEL walks down the line.\n\n                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)\n                         Let's see...Clark? Hmmm. Your grounds\n                         crew nickname will be....Sparky.\n\n               It is all ROBBIE can do not to laugh. THE COLONEL goes on to\n               the next kid, SKEETER who is tall, skinny and goofy-looking.\n               SKEETER'S eyes are faced forward, but something catches them.\n               His eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small\n               mosquito. Finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross\n               eyed at his own nose.\n\n               THE COLONEL has taken note of this and is following it too.\n               SKEETER can take no more, and brushes it off his nose as he\n               makes a face.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Page 12 of 81\n\n\n                                   SKEETER\n                         Sorry, sir. Mosquito.\n\n                                   THE COLONEL\n                         Hmmm.....your grounds crew nickname will\n                         be.....Skeeter.\n\n               THE COLONEL steps over the cart and gets another new plunger\n               and hands it to SKEETER who follows EDDIE's lead.\n\n               Next in line is a short, chubby lad, SNITCH. As THE COLONEL\n               approaches him, a quick sound of passing gas is heard.\n\n               THE COLONEL is startled, and SNITCH makes a quick finger\n               motion indicating the culprit is SKEETER, next to him.\n\n                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)\n                             (looking at the clipboard)\n                         Bradley, is it? OK, Mr. Bradley.....your\n                         grounds crew nickname will be Snitch.\n\n               SNITCH shows his dismay with a frown. THE COLONEL has run\n               out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of\n               last year's leftovers, which look somewhat depressing.\n\n               He gets one and give it to SNITCH, who looks at it, makes a\n               face, and decides not to shoulder it. ROBBIE is so depressed\n               he looks like he's about to pass out.\n\n               His worst fears have been realized.    His summer is passing\n               before his eyes.\n\n               There's only one more person, a young 14 year-old girl, to go\n               before ROBBIE. THE COLONEL addresses her.\n\n                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)\n                         Melinda Tally. Hmmm... your grounds crew\n                         nickname will be...\n                             (thinking)\n\n               Suddenly ALEX bursts onto the scene, and even he, at this\n               point, is somewhat out of breath.\n\n                                   ALEX\n                         Hello, Colonel!\n\n                                   THE COLONEL\n                             (thinking, staring)\n                         Alex, isn't it?\n\n                                   ALEX\n                         Yes sir, Colonel. And what a fine staff\n                         you've assembled this year. Have you\n                         told them yet about your army background?\n\n                                   THE COLONEL\n                         Well, no, I didn't think it was..\n\n                                   ALEX\n\n\n\n\n\n    Page 13 of 81\n\n                            (interrupting, to the grounds\n                             kids)\n                        The Colonel here is very modest. Did you\n                        know that he reorganized the entire\n                        process of cleaning and sanitizing an\n                        army barracks and its latrines?\n\n                                   THE COLONEL\n                         Well, it really wasn't much of a...\n\n                                   ALEX\n                             (interrupting again)\n                         Wasn't much?\n                             (again, to grounds kids)\n                         Can you just imagine for a moment the\n                         germs and bacteria our American soldiers\n                         could pick up in an unsanitised army\n                         latrine?

ALEX looks, and sees what he is looking for.\n               ROBBIE smiles.\n\n                                    ALEX (CONT'D)\n                         Yesss!\n\n               We look back at the WAVE BABE, but the water is obscuring our\n               view. We then see a medium shot of SKEETER and SNITCH. The\n               WAVE BABE walks past them carrying a board, but we don't see\n               below her waist, the board obscures our view.\n\n               SNITCH sees, and freezes, dumbstruck. SKEETER is looking\n               down at the grate where THE WAVE water drains. He reaches\n               down and pulls something out, and turns to the WAVE BABE\n               walking away.\n\n                                   SKEETER\n                             (unaffected)\n                         Excuse me...

We see her, but just a flash of her from\n               the back, as the board covers her waist area. She is puzzled\n               by this grounds kid.\n\n                                   SKEETER (CONT'D)\n                             (holding up the bottom to her\n                              swimsuit)\n                         Is this yours?\n\n               She looks down behind the board and reacts.     She bites her\n               lower lip, winces and nods yes.\n\n               SKEETER hands her her swimsuit, and she looks around and\n               backs away towards a towel hanging from the fence nearby.\n               SNITCH is still frozen, stunned by what he's just seen, mouth\n               wide open. SKEETER waves his hand in front of SNITCH's face.\n\n               No reaction.   He's never seen a naked girl before.\n\n               We're back to ALEX and ROBBIE.\n\n                                   ROBBIE\n                             (looking at ALEX)\n                         You were right.

He is\n               pretty good, but not nearly as good as the WAVE BUMS. He\n               does a few tricks and wipes out. He gets up and walks up to\n               the line to watch ROBBIE.\n\n                                   ALEX (CONT'D)\n                             (shouting)\n                         Just ease into it.\n\n               ROBBIE takes the board and looks around.

It takes him just a moment to get the feel of\n               the board, and then he is all over it, making the WAVE BUMS\n               look like rookies. Spins, rolls, everything that can be done\n               he does. Finally, the guard blows a whistle indicating that\n               his time is up.\n\n                                   ALEX (CONT'D)\n                             (meeting him at the exit)\n                         Gees.

BIG MIKE himself is behind the bar making smoothies,\n               while RICHARD is playing bass in the band. AOKEE is running\n               around making sure all the buffet items are full.

Many\n               couples are dancing; it is a slow song.\n\n               ALEX, of course, is a goof. He dances slow, but every once\n               in a while executes a deep dip, much to AMY's terror.\n\n               EDDIE is off to the edge of the dance floor, watching,\n               longingly, and kind of swaying to the music. A couple of\n               girls walk by and he does a magic trick for them.\n\n               He holds both hands up, palms open to show he has nothing in\n               his hands. He also gestures that he has no sleeves (he is\n               wearing a tuxedo t-shirt). He reaches behind his back and\n               pulls out a trick bouquet of flowers, but they don't quite\n               open right, and are still unfolding as he holds them.\n\n               EDDIE smiles weakly, he knows that isn't quite how it was\n               supposed to go. The girls appear encouraging, but as they\n               leave look at each other and giggle.\n\n               We pick up ROBBIE and KATIE dancing.\n\n                                  KATIE\n                         So.

This is my first year, but\n\n\n\n\n\n    Page 44 of 81\n\n                         apparently it's a pretty big deal. Being\n                         from Oceanside, you should have a good\n                         chance.\n\n                                   ROBBIE\n                         We'll see. It seems kind of stupid to\n                         me. A surfing contest in Colorado.\n\n                            (laughing)\n                        My friends back home would never believe\n                        it.\n\n               They continue to dance. WE SEE BIG MIKE talking to TIFFANY\n               and gesturing broadly. TIFFANY is clearly not agreeing with\n               what he is saying. COWBOY is nowhere to be seen. Suddenly she\n               throws up her hands and marches over to the dance floor where\n               EDDIE is standing alone, swaying a bit to the music.\n\n               She whispers something in his ear, and EDDIE'S eyes get real\n               big as she leads him by the hand to the middle of the dance\n               floor. She wraps her arms around EDDIE and they dance, all\n               the while glaring at her father.\n\n               EDDIE knows a good thing when he sees it, and quickly settles\n               in, Big Man on Campus. TIFFANY is taller than he is, so he\n               happily puts his head on HER shoulder.\n\n               BIG MIKE looks back at them, not happy with the way it\n               happened, but satisfied.\n\n               DOUG FITZGERALD (twenty bucks DOUG) is dancing with a girl\n               when ALEX, doing some kind of fancy spin to AMY, bumps into\n               him.\n\n                                   DOUG\n                             (to ALEX)\n                         Alex.

We hear girls screaming and he exits\n               quickly, followed by a volley of thrown girl's underwear,\n               swimsuits and towels.\n\n     50        INT. MORNING - MOMENTS LATER - THUNDER BAY PUMPHOUSE - SURF50\n               MUSIC BED\n\n               This room is creepy. It is full of loud pumps and large\n               pipes. ROBBIE is making his way through a labyrinth of\n               piping and gauges and the like. He peers and sees a head\n               with a red scarf, but it moves out of view.  Surf music\n               fades.\n\n               There is a constant whine of the pumps. ROBBIE moves further\n               in and finally comes across a man holding a large pipewrench,\n               with his back to him. He is working to tame a small leak.\n\n                                   ROBBIE\n                             (quietly)\n                         Hello?\n\n               No reaction.\n\n                                   ROBBIE (CONT'D)\n                             (loudly this time)\n                         Hello?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Page 50 of 81\n\n               This startles and kind of angers PIPEMAN.\n\n                                   PIPEMAN\n                        Hey.

AOKEE is lathering on suntan lotion, and\n               puts on a large straw hat. ALEX puts sun block cream on his\n               nose, and they both sit on the lawn chairs. They both have\n               large smoothies.\n\n               ROBBIE appears with his surfboard, and lays it up against the\n               east fence at Thunder Bay.

AOKEE\n               and ALEX are now sitting on the edge of the lawn chairs\n               anxiously awaiting the next wave. It comes and ROBBIE\n               catches it easily and begins riding it aggressively. He has\n               a good run and kicks out at the end.\n\n               AOKEE and ALEX high-five.\n\n                                   ALEX AND AOKEE\n                             (together)\n                         Yeee-haww.\n\n               They settle back into their chairs to absorb some sun.\n\n     52        INT.

ALEX, AMY and KATIE are\n               still standing on the porch of the TIME SHACK, shocked at\n               what they've seen.\n\n                                   ALEX\n                             (disbelief)\n                         Tiff?\n\n                                   AMY\n                             (grossed out)\n                         Tiff?\n\n                                   KATIE\n                             (forlorn, stunned)\n                         Tiff.\n\n               WE SEE ROBBIE and TIFFANY drive out the gate.     We see KATIE\n               walk slowly out of the park alone.\n\n               As she is walking, we flash back to scenes of KATIE and\n\n\n\n\n\n       Page 60 of 81\n\n               ROBBIE together, dancing and laughing. This time the dance\n               moves to the song of Allison Krause's \"New Favorite\".\n\n               We take a final look at KATIE with the setting sun at her\n               back and see she is crying.\n\n     58        EXT. EARLY MORNING. - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE            58\n\n               We see the rising sun behind AOKEE's head as he raises a\n               conch shell and blows it like a horn. He is dressed like a\n               Hawaiian prince.\n\n               As the shot widens it reveals six males and two females\n               dressed in Hawaiian native garb. ROBBIE And ALEX are among\n               several drummers with bamboos sticks in their hands that\n               provide percussion for the Hawaiian war dance.\n\n                                    AOKEE\n                          Aie, noka moka kei kai ke alo.\n\n               The drums begin and the male dancers, carrying spears begin\n               the Hawaiian war dance. The drummers sing the Hawaiian folk\n               tune \"No ka moku Kiakahi Ke Aloha\".\n\n               There are about 100 concessions kids in regular uniform\n               sitting cross-legged behind them, clapping the beat in\n               unison.\n\n               The MALE DANCERS circle each other in time to the beat,\n               gesturing a story the seems to involve some invading army.\n               The war dance progresses until the invading warriors are\n               defeated and the folk song ends. At the end, the kids\n               sitting behind raise their hand and shout.\n\n                                    CONCESSIONS GIRLS AND BOYS\n                          Concessions! Concessions!

In our foreground there are\n               six large trash cans, with toilet plungers arranged next to\n               them, 2 each.\n\n               To our left are a line of six grounds kids in army fatigues\n               carrying brooms as if rifles.

The lead\n               marcher holds his plunger high and shouts.\n\n                                         LEAD MARCHER (CONT'D)\n                            Company!

These\n               become drums as well as two of the drummers switch from trash\n               can to can lids using the stick side of the toilet plunger as\n               the drumstick.\n\n               A competition erupts from the left and right sides of the\n               line as they each set a beat and then the other matches.\n\n               Finally, a show of unity as both sides join back into the\n               beat for an ending flourish.\n\n               They pick up their brooms and turn their attention to the\n               kids behind them.

Trash rats!\n\n               They clap and cheer, and settle back down to sit.\n\n               All is quiet now. WE SEE concessions kids sitting, grounds\n               kids sitting and we look to the west side of the pool and see\n               lifeguards sitting. Everyone is looking around.\n\n               Suddenly two lifeguards dressed as Roman Soldiers appear with\n               horns. They bellow a Roman Call to Action, and two Roman\n               drummers lead a column of other lifeguards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Page 63 of 81\n\n               First we see female guards dressed in togas filing in. Behind\n               them are six gladiators with swords and shields, marching.\n\n               They are followed by one female lifeguard with a basket of\n               rose petals. She is throwing them into the path of the next\n               group to enter.\n\n               Next we see six more guards dressed as slaves carrying\n               COWBOY, who is sitting up on a First Aid backboard. HE is\n               wearing laurel leaves and a toga, he is obviously Cesar. On\n               the backboard is also the surfer king trophy.\n\n               They all approach the area in front of the seated guards, and\n               rearrange themselves so that COWBOY has a good view of the\n               gladiators. The drummers count a cadence that sets the pace\n               for a simulated battle between the gladiators.\n\n               The simulated battle rages until three of the gladiators are\n               on their knees before the three victorious gladiators. The\n               victorious gladiators hold their swords over the fallen ones,\n               and look to COWBOY for a yea or nay.\n\n               COWBOY generously waves and makes a thumbs up signal, and the\n               swords are put away. The seated lifeguards all raise their\n               fists and shout.\n\n                                   LIFEGUARDS\n                             (together)\n                         Lifeguards! Lifeguards!     Lifeguards!\n\n               The guards holding COWBOY set him down in front of an\n               elevated platform that has a microphone..\n\n               COWBOY picks up the surfer king trophy and walks to the\n               platform. He sets the trophy on a table next to the\n               microphone, arranging it carefully.\n\n               We see now there is a large banner hanging at the back of the\n               wave pool that says \"WATER WORLD WELCOMES EMPLOYEE\n               OLYMPIANS\".\n\n               COWBOY moves to the microphone and raises his arm in a regal\n               manner and speaks.\n\n                                   COWBOY\n                             (to all)\n                         Let the games...begin!\n\n               The seated crowd now stands and cheers loudly. We see a\n               group of three people, two male and one female, adults we\n               will later identify as JUDGES. They nod approvingly and\n               write something down on their clipboards. We see BIG MIKE\n               near them, smiling broadly.\n\n     59        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE            59\n\n               We see that the lounge chairs have been removed and the area\n               is clear. There are scattered squashed up pieces of white\n               paper lying about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Page 64 of 81\n\n               We look to the south and see that there are three boy/girl\n               teams with one of their legs tied together, like a three\n               legged race.\n\n               The rub here is one team member has the dustpan and the other\n               team member has the broom. A JUDGE triggers a starter pistol\n               and they are off.\n\n               The lifeguard team falls almost immediately, and the grounds\n               team takes a early lead over the concessions team, who are\n               trying to figure the dustpan/broom operation out. The two\n               grounds people work tightly together and quickly advance.\n\n               The lifeguards have gotten back up and are hobbling up to\n               their first piece of trash. Concessions has figured out the\n               dustpan, but are still well behind the grounds kids.\n\n               Finally, the grounds kids win, with concessions up second,\n               and lifeguards trailing in third. The judges note the finish\n               on their clipboards.\n\n     60        EXT. LATER THAT DAY - THUNDER BAY                              60\n\n               We see three male participants standing in the shallow end of\n               Thunder Bay, One red suit (lifeguard) one blue suit\n               (concessions) and one green suit (grounds)\n\n               A JUDGE on the rise to the west of Thunder Bay blows an air\n               horn to start the race. They all rush into the bay and begin\n               swimming furiously.\n\n               The guard takes the lead quickly, followed not far behind by\n               the grounds kid. The concessions kid is working hard and\n               splashing a lot but not getting very far.\n\n               As the guard reaches the back wall, he does an underwater\n               racing turn and swims back toward the point where they\n               started. Right behind him, the smaller grounds kid does the\n               same thing.\n\n               As they are returning, they pass the concessions kid, who\n               still is splashing a lot but not going fast. After they pass\n               him he stops, as he is tired out.\n\n               Momentarily he can't even tread water any more, and a guard\n               watching from the sidelines jumps in and pulls him out. The\n               swimming guard has beaten the grounds kid, the concessions\n               kid never finishes.\n\n     61        EXT LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL SOUTH SIDE            61\n\n               There are three lines set up with several participants. It\n               is a relay race, with the baton replaced by a tray full of\n               drinks in paper cups, water. The colors indicate again\n               concessions, guards and grounds.\n\n               The race is already in full swing, with concessions in the\n               lead. The last group of relayers are now getting their\n               trays, and concessions is way ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       Page 65 of 81\n\n               Everyone is cheering their team on. The final pass is made\n               to SARAH who works for AOKEE's. She takes the tray and moves\n               gracefully to the final stop.

They lie them down on a clear\n               area and begin CPR.\n\n               The guards have a nifty little plastic device that lets them\n               blow air into the mouth of their victim, and they roll him\n               quickly on his side to clear water and back to begin CPR.\n               They are fast and efficient, and clearly expertly trained.\n\n               We move left to see the grounds kids, knowledgeable but\n               inexperienced. One girl is using her hands to provide a\n               seals over the mouth of her \"victim\" and another is clumsily\n               pumping his chest while the others try to keep a count while\n               reading some kind of instruction card..\n\n               We move again to see the concessions kids, who are in\n               trouble. ALEX is lying there dying, and they are arguing\n               about who has to breathe into his mouth. They form a circle\n               over him, pointing and arguing.\n\n               Finally they all just walk off and ALEX is still lying on the\n               ground, eyes rolled back and twitching convulsively in a\n               hilarious death scene.\n\n               The JUDGES take their notes.\n\n     64        EXT LATER THAT DAY - IN FRONT OF THE CANNING COMPANY           64\n\n               Once again three teams representing the three competing\n               factions. Large stainless steel pots are bubbling on three\n               propane cooking stands in front of the concession.\n\n               The teams each have three members in cooking aprons, again,\n               color coded. One from each team is stirring the team's chili\n               while the others watch the JUDGES anxiously.\n\n               Lines are forming in front of each pot, with people in line\n               each carrying a paper chili bowl, but holding back, deferring\n               to the JUDGES. The JUDGES are each carrying three styro cups\n               in which to receive the chili.\n\n               They each get a portion from the guard team and take a sip.\n               They smile politely to the cooks, but turn around and spit\n               the chili back into the cup as delicately as possible, almost\n               as if throwing up. A concessions kid is there with a tray of\n               waters, which they quickly take advantage of.\n\n               They move on to the grounds team. They get their portions\n               and taste the chili and nod, not bad.\n\n               They take another sip of water to clear their palate and move\n               on to the concessions team. The portions are proudly\n               scooped.\n\n               They take a taste, smile and take some more.     They huddle for\n\n\n\n\n\n    Page 67 of 81\n\n               a moment and then place a blue ribbon on the concessions pot.\n               The lines quickly rearrange and merge themselves so that\n               everyone is in line for the concessions pot.\n\n     65        EXT LATER THAT DAY - SURF'S UP WAVE POOL EAST SIDE             65\n\n               An obstacle course has been set up, and the event provides a\n               background to the dialogue that follows.

You get three\n                         tries; three heats. We judge each run\n                         and only your high score counts. If you\n                         fall you get no score for the run. Your\n                         score will be added to the total for your\n                         team, and the winner gets the Surfer King\n                         Trophy. Any questions?\n\n               They all shake their head no.\n\n                                  HEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)\n                        Then let's begin. Grounds is up first.\n\n               MELINDA grabs her board and begins paddling out. The wave\n               comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board. She\n               struggles and falls at the end. She will clearly not be a\n               factor. The big screen shows a 0 in a column after the\n               grounds score.\n\n               We look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the\n               COLONEL and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed.\n\n               COWBOY is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it\n               easily. He rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out\n               at the end. The big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row.\n               The lifeguards and RICHARD are cheering now.\n\n               ROBBIE is next. He catches the wave and rides it more\n               aggressively than COWBOY, but nearly falls at the end of his\n               run. The big screen shows an 8. The concessions kids and\n               AOKEE are very enthusiastic. They can see they have a chance\n               with ROBBIE. PIPEMAN is watching from a far corner.\n\n               MELINDA begins her second run. She is a little more\n               confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and\n               ride the wave. More polite applause, and the big screen\n               shows a 5.\n\n               COWBOY catches his wave, and tries to imitate ROBBIE'S more\n               aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. We hear\n               a large gasp from the crowd as this happens.\n\n               The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive\n               but disappointed. We see the JUDGES confer and the big screen\n               shows a 0.\n\n               ROBBIE gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this\n               time not nearly falling at all. The JUDGES nod approvingly\n               and confer. The big screen shows a 9. The crowd goes wild,\n               especially the concessions kids.\n\n               Melinda begins her final run. She does better than the past\n               two, but not significantly. The JUDGES confer and the screen\n               shows a 5. The ground kids are very disappointed, they know\n               they are out of it now. THE COLONEL shakes MELINDA'S hand\n               and thanks her for her efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Page 74 of 81\n\n               COWBOY gets his wave, and has clearly decided to go back to\n               his original style; he rides the wave gracefully, but takes\n               no chances.\n\n               He kicks out at the end with a wave and a smile. The guards\n               applaud, hoping to make it seem better than it was, and the\n               JUDGES confer and the screen shows an 8.\n\n               ROBBIE snags his wave and rides it aggressively again, but\n               loses his balance momentarily. It costs him; the JUDGES\n               confer and the screen shows a 7.\n\n               The concessions kids applaud, and the point totals show\n               \"Grounds   98\", \"Concessions 102\" and \"Lifeguards 102\".\n\n               EVERYONE is confused, there has never been a tie before. THE\n               JUDGES Are flipping through papers, and BIG MIKE steps up to\n               the microphone.\n\n                                  BIG MIKE\n                            (clearing his throat,\n                             flustered)\n                        It looks like we have a tie. This has\n                        never happened before, but I seem to\n                        remember we provided for this possibility\n                        in the rules. Hopefully our judges can\n                        help us figure out what to do!\n\n               The HEAD JUDGE is reading to the other JUDGES out loud, slaps\n               his hand on one of the papers and comes up to the mike.\n\n                                  HEAD JUDGE\n                        Reading from the rules, \"...in the event\n                        of a tie at the end of three heats in the\n                        surf competition, the teams who are tied\n                        will participate in a sudden-death surf\n                        off.

It\n               comes and he has apparently decided to stay with what has\n               gotten him this far; a conservative style that keeps him\n               looking good without falling. His ride is similar to the\n               last one, but even more graceful and lyrical and he gets a 9.\n\n                                   ALEX\n                             (to ROBBIE)\n                         Looks like he's waiting for you to make a\n                         mistake.

Go get 'em.\n\n               ROBBIE appears on the seawall holding his board and looking\n               out first at the bay, then at the crowd. His mom, CONNIE\n               waves, and he smiles weakly.\n\n               HE sees KATIE and she looks hopeful. She hasn't given up on\n               him completely. He smiles at her and gets into the water.\n\n               He begins paddling. It seems to take forever for him to get\n               out to the spot where he catches the wave, but he finally\n               arrives.\n\n               He sits there for a moment, collecting himself, then raises\n               his hand to signal he is ready.\n\n               The CONCESSIONS KIDS have started to chant, ROBBIE! ROBBIE!\n               The guards are anxious, but even they can't help moving to\n               the cadence of the chant.\n\n               The wave comes and he catches it quickly, and slips his feet\n               into the duct tape pockets. He misses one pocket at first,\n               then gets it in.\n\n               He rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to\n\n\n\n\n\n      Page 78 of 81\n\n               the top and executes a full 360 degree turn out of the water.\n\n               On landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down\n               it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads\n               straight into the wave. At the top he bounces and does a\n               complete back flip in slow motion.\n\n               We see the crowd also in slow motion. AOKEE Is covering his\n               eyes, he can't watch. ALEX's face is contorted with\n               disbelief. Various faces in the crowd are in open-mouthed\n               disbelief. THE JUDGES are staring intently, focussed so as\n               not to miss anything.\n\n               ROBBIE lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave.      He\n               waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted.\n\n               The place goes nuts. No one here has ever seen anything like\n               this before. AOKEE and ALEX run into the water and help him\n               out. People are still cheering.\n\n               COWBOY knows he's in trouble.\n\n               THE JUDGES confer only momentarily and the score 10 appears,\n               and the word concessions starts flashing along with the word\n               winner. COWBOY nods in agreement.\n\n               TIFFANY says something to him, and he appears angry.      We can\n               only hear part of his response, something like:\n\n                                   COWBOY\n                             (disbelief)\n                         You did WHAT?\n\n               AOKEE and ALEX lead him up to the grandstand. COWBOY also\n               makes his way up there, and we see him talking to BIG MIKE.\n               BIG MIKE nods in agreement and COWBOY goes to the mike as the\n               crowd settles down.\n\n                                   COWBOY (CONT'D)\n                         As last year's Surfer King, it's my\n                         privilege to present this year's trophy\n                         to the most amazing surfer on the water\n                         today.
