He passes EDDIE, a 25-something grounds worker\n               with Down's Syndrome.\n\n<b>                                     JAFFA\n</b>                         Eddie!\n\n<b>                                   EDDIE\n</b>                             (smiling, nodding)\n                         Jaffa.\n\n               They do a hand slap maneuver that they have obviously worked\n               out some time in the past. JAFFA proceeds up to the Customer\n               Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the\n               kiosk. We see him open the box, it is full of CD's.\n\n               He pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a CD\n               player and amplifiers. He starts pushing buttons he's pushed\n               a thousand times, and lights come on. He pulls down a\n               microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works.\n\n               He reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out. We see it\n               is Sheryl Crow. He gets the CD, examines it, and pops it\n               into the CD player.\n\n               He once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he\n               pushes the \"play\" button on the CD player.\n\n               His voice echoes through the park.         \"Soak up the Sun\" begins\n               playing.\n\n<b>                                   JAFFA\n</b>                             (smiling)\n                         Ladies and Gentlemen, Water World will be\n                         open in\n                             (checking his watch)\n                         twenty-six hours and forty-three minutes.\n\n<b>               GFX - OPENING CREDITS BEGIN\n</b>\n<b>       2       EXT EARLY MORNING - THUNDER BAY                                    2\n</b>\n               BIG MIKE, the park's owner/manager - a 50-something man who\n               is portly and bald, and RICHARD THOMPSON, head lifeguard and\n               another GUARD are on the east side of Thunder Bay.\n\n               There is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter\n               cover on it.

We look back at the massive size of the pool and get\n               the joke.\n\n               BIG MIKE and RICHARD pull off the winter cover. The GUARD\n               turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting BIG MIKE\n               wet. They object and he turns back to filling Thunder Bay.\n               RICHARD moves the GUARD to a safe distance.\n\n               BIG MIKE blows the dust off of the box at the top of the\n               post, and we see it is a large push button. BIG MIKE looks\n               at RICHARD who nods \"go ahead\" and then pushes the button.\n\n               They both draw back as if something big should happen, but\n               nothing. They look at each other and BIG MIKE motions for\n               RICHARD to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the\n               pool.\n\n               RICHARD waves OK, and BIG MIKE pushes the button again. When\n               nothing happens, RICHARD whacks the side of the tank with his\n               closed fist. Suddenly a huge wave rolls out.\n\n               Nodding his approval, BIG MIKE checks off an item in his\n               clipboard.\n\n<b>       3       EXT.

The VAIL PRECISION\n               LAWN CHAIR DRILL TEAM dressed in Water World uniforms is\n               setting and arranging chairs in time to the music. They\n               perform precision maneuvers with the chairs, as if rifles,\n               and cross each other in a timed march to the music.\n\n<b>       4       EXT.

He is talking to RICHARD.\n\n               After talking to BIG MIKE, RICHARD shakes his head\n               affirmatively and walks off. He glances up to the two guards\n               above, and grins. BIG MIKE is looking at his clipboard. We\n               see quickly the large water tank above is spilling water a\n               bit, indicating it is full.\n\n               The water tank spills over BIG MIKE drenching him. He stands\n               there still, angry for a moment, then thinks better of it\n               shaking his head and smiling, takes his pen and checks OK on\n               his wet clipboard for the fun house water tank.\n\n<b>       5       EXT.

One guard\n               begins motioning as if guiding a crane into place. The other\n               guard has his hand poised on a large switch lever.\n\n               GUARD ONE is gesturing more emphatically now, closing his\n               hands to indicate \"almost there\". He closes his hands, and\n               GUARD TWO pulls the lever.\n\n\n\n\n<b>\n</b>Page 3 of 81\n\n\n<b>       6       EXT.

He is wearing black horn-rim glasses, thick lenses, and\n               carrying a clipboard.\n\n               Lined up as if an army unit are ten grounds kids, including\n               ROBBIE, who is sixth furthest from THE COLONEL. They are all\n               younger than ROBBIE except one, EDDIE, whom we met at the\n               beginning of the film.\n\n               EDDIE is standing tall and straight, proud to be there.

Yes...yes a good staff. It will be\n                         an excellent summer. Remember as we go\n                         through training today, our park is\n                         judged by the work WE do. If we do it\n                         well, the people come back.\n                             (walking up and down the line)\n                         We have a little tradition here on the\n                         grounds crew. Rather than having to\n                         learn a lot of names, many of which I can\n                         never hope to pronounce properly, each\n                         grounds crew member gets a grounds crew\n                         nickname. You will be known by that\n                         nickname in every way except, of course,\n                         your paycheck and employee records.\n\n               THE COLONEL looks over his paperwork.\n\n<b>                                   THE COLONEL    (CONT'D)\n</b>                         Let's see, what do we    have? Hmm...yes.\n                         OK, first up is Eddie    Cochran. Your\n                         grounds crew nickname    will be.....Eddie!\n\n               EDDIE smiles knowingly. This has been his grounds crew\n               nickname for the last 8 years, mostly because he would never\n               answer to anything else, and THE COLONEL gave up trying.\n\n<b>                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)\n</b>                         Now crewmembers, listen up. Eddie here\n                         has eight years experience on the grounds\n                         crew. Why, I'd like to think there isn't\n                         anything, any situation that Eddie hasn't\n                         faced. Listen to him. Learn from him.\n                         Watch what he does. This man is the\n                         finest, most conscientious grounds\n                         crewman we've ever had.\n\n               EDDIE is beaming with pride now. THE COLONEL pulls a brand\n               new toilet plunger from the cart nearby and hands it to\n               EDDIE. EDDIE shoulders it as if it were a rifle.\n\n               THE COLONEL walks down the line.\n\n<b>                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)\n</b>                         Let's see...Clark? Hmmm. Your grounds\n                         crew nickname will be....Sparky.\n\n               It is all ROBBIE can do not to laugh. THE COLONEL goes on to\n               the next kid, SKEETER who is tall, skinny and goofy-looking.\n               SKEETER'S eyes are faced forward, but something catches them.\n               His eyes follow an unseen object as we begin to hear a small\n               mosquito. Finally his eyes follow it until he looks, cross\n               eyed at his own nose.\n\n               THE COLONEL has taken note of this and is following it too.\n               SKEETER can take no more, and brushes it off his nose as he\n               makes a face.\n\n\n\n\n<b>\n</b>    Page 12 of 81\n\n\n<b>                                   SKEETER\n</b>                         Sorry, sir.

As THE COLONEL\n               approaches him, a quick sound of passing gas is heard.\n\n               THE COLONEL is startled, and SNITCH makes a quick finger\n               motion indicating the culprit is SKEETER, next to him.\n\n<b>                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)\n</b>                             (looking at the clipboard)\n                         Bradley, is it? OK, Mr. Bradley.....your\n                         grounds crew nickname will be Snitch.\n\n               SNITCH shows his dismay with a frown. THE COLONEL has run\n               out of new plungers already and is forced to move to one of\n               last year's leftovers, which look somewhat depressing.\n\n               He gets one and give it to SNITCH, who looks at it, makes a\n               face, and decides not to shoulder it. ROBBIE is so depressed\n               he looks like he's about to pass out.\n\n               His worst fears have been realized.    His summer is passing\n               before his eyes.\n\n               There's only one more person, a young 14 year-old girl, to go\n               before ROBBIE. THE COLONEL addresses her.\n\n<b>                                   THE COLONEL (CONT'D)\n</b>                         Melinda Tally.

Grounds is up first.\n\n               MELINDA grabs her board and begins paddling out. The wave\n               comes and it's all she can do to stay on her board. She\n               struggles and falls at the end. She will clearly not be a\n               factor. The big screen shows a 0 in a column after the\n               grounds score.\n\n               We look back to the bleachers to polite applause, but the\n               COLONEL and the grounds kids are clearly disappointed.\n\n               COWBOY is out there now, the wave comes and he catches it\n               easily. He rides the wave gracefully and well, and kicks out\n               at the end. The big screen shows an 8 in the lifeguard row.\n               The lifeguards and RICHARD are cheering now.\n\n               ROBBIE is next. He catches the wave and rides it more\n               aggressively than COWBOY, but nearly falls at the end of his\n               run. The big screen shows an 8. The concessions kids and\n               AOKEE are very enthusiastic. They can see they have a chance\n               with ROBBIE. PIPEMAN is watching from a far corner.\n\n               MELINDA begins her second run. She is a little more\n               confident this time, but still seems barely able to stand and\n               ride the wave. More polite applause, and the big screen\n               shows a 5.\n\n               COWBOY catches his wave, and tries to imitate ROBBIE'S more\n               aggressive style, but falls midway through the run. We hear\n               a large gasp from the crowd as this happens.\n\n               The crowd applauds politely, and the guards are supportive\n               but disappointed. We see the JUDGES confer and the big screen\n               shows a 0.\n\n               ROBBIE gets his wave, and surfs it aggressively again, this\n               time not nearly falling at all.

He misses one pocket at first,\n               then gets it in.\n\n               He rides it carefully and at the right moment slides up to\n\n\n\n\n<b>\n</b>      Page 78 of 81\n\n               the top and executes a full 360 degree turn out of the water.\n\n               On landing back on the downside of the wave, he slides down\n               it quickly, and then turns around with a deep cut and heads\n               straight into the wave. At the top he bounces and does a\n               complete back flip in slow motion.\n\n               We see the crowd also in slow motion. AOKEE Is covering his\n               eyes, he can't watch.

THE JUDGES are staring intently, focussed so as\n               not to miss anything.\n\n               ROBBIE lands the flip, and rides the rest of the wave.      He\n               waves to the crowd, and kicks off, exhausted.\n\n               The place goes nuts. No one here has ever seen anything like\n               this before.

COWBOY nods in agreement.\n\n               TIFFANY says something to him, and he appears angry.

He hands it to her, and she opens it. A beautiful\n               butterfly flies out and away.
