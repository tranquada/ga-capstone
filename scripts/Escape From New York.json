BUS -- NIGHT\n</b>S.D. \"SNAKE\" PLISSKEN gets off the bus, looks around, and is escorted by\nthree guards into the base.  He looks like the essence of cool.  His\nhair is long, wavy, and ratty, he lost his left eye somewhere along the\nline, and he's got a two-day beard thing going on.  He's wearing a black\nspandex/kevlar type shirt with zippers across the shoulders, and a pair\nof camouflage pants with lots of pockets.  His jacket is a brown leather\njacket that has seen far better days, and he's wearing a pair of\nhandcuffs that have, instead of the links we're used to, a straight\nmetal bar between them.  He's not resisting anything, but the police are\nnot taking any chances.\n\n<b>INT.

BASE -- NIGHT\n</b>Hauk and Rehme walk down the stairs.  They turn TOWARD US and walk into\nthe AIR TRAFFIC ROOM.  Dozens of men sit in front of radar transmission\nscreens, wearing headsets and working.   Following Hauk and Rehme into\nthe room:\n\n<b>INT. AIR TRAFFIC ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>REHME\n</b>We've been on the board for the last twenty minutes.  We haven't been\nable to reach them.  There was a transmission ten minutes ago.  He\nidentified as \"David 14.\"  Then all of a sudden he was cut off.\n\nHauk and Rehme stand behind a CONTROLLER.\n\n<b>CONTROLLER\n</b>David 14, acknowledge.  David 14, we are sending Air Rescue.

We telexed Washington.  Still waiting for a reply.\n\n<b>CONTROLLER\n</b>I think I've got him, sir.\n\nHauk and Rehme walk back over to the controller.  He patches a voice-\nover through.\n\n<b>REBEL VOICE\n</b>It's too late, assholes.  All your imperialist weapons and lies can't\nsave him now.  We're going down.  We're going to crash.\n\n<b>CONTROLLER\n</b>David 14, acknowledge!\n\n<b>CODEMAN\n</b>The code's coming in, sir.\n\nHauk and Rehme dash over to the codeman.  He shows them a display.\n\"Aircraft Identified.  Code: David14.  Decode: AIR FORCE ONE.\"\n\n\"Air Force One\" blinks as Hauk and Rehme look at each other in shock.\n\n<b>EXT.

COCKPIT -- NIGHT\n</b>The REBEL has killed the pilot and copilot and is working on her own.\n\n<b>REBEL\n</b>Tell this to the workers when they ask where your leader went . . .\n\nShe pulls out a slip of PAPER and proceeds to read.\n\n<b>REBEL\n</b>We, the soldiers of the national liberation front of America, in the\nname of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country\nhave struck a fatal blow to the racist police stick!\n\n<b>INT.

CLOSE UP -- The President's wrist as he handcuffs his briefcase to\nit.\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>Get me to the pod.\n\nThe President and all his advisors stand up and move to the back of the\nplane.\n\n<b>INT. POD ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>The pod opens.  An expert attaches a locating device to the President's\nwrist.\n\n<b>EXPERT\n</b>Sir, this is a locating device to trace you if you become separated from\nthe pod.  I'm activating it now.\n\nSCREENS on the pod begin to light up as the President gets into the pod.\nHe pushes a few buttons.\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>God save me and watch over you all.\n\n<b>EXT. BASE -- NIGHT\n</b>A guard watches as Air Force One descends into New York.\n\n<b>INT.

NEW YORK -- NIGHT\n</b>The plane goes down.\n\n<b>INT. BASE -- NIGHT\n</b><b>EXT. CLOSE UP -- MONITORS\n</b>As the plane smashes into a building, a red dot drops through the\nbuilding.  It's the pod.\n\n<b>O.S. MAN\n</b>It's down!\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>It's the escape pod.\n\n<b>REHME\n</b>40 degrees, 50 yards from impact.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>I'm going in.\n\n<b>EXT. BASE -- NIGHT\n</b>Helicopters prepare for, and execute, launch, and fly into New York.  A\nguard watches them.\n\n<b>INT. BASE -- NIGHT\n</b>Rehme watches monitors as Hauk talks.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>1-W-Larry.  Over the battery.  We're moving down.  Direct sight ahead.\n\n<b>EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT\n</b>The helicopters land.  A swarm of policemen run out, and Hauk hangs\nback.  He follows with a second swarm.  The first swarm assumes a\ndefensive position near the pod.  Hauk examines the pod.  It's\ndefinitely empty, and the rest of the jet is surrounded in flames.\n\nAn odd LAUGH from nowhere.\n\nWEIRDO walks out of the darkness.  He nods his head to Hauk.\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>You touch me... he dies.  If you're not in the air in thirty seconds...\nhe dies.  You come back in... he dies.\n\nWeirdo takes a package out of his shirt and unwraps it to reveal the\nPresident's middle finger, complete with ring.\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>Twenty seconds.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>I'm ready to talk.\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>Nineteen.  Eighteen.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>What do you want?\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>Seventeen.  Sixteen.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Let's go.  Let's go!\n\nWeirdo grins in triumph as the police force swarms back to the\nhelicopters and hauls ass out of New York.\n\n<b>INT. BASE -- NIGHT\n</b>Rehme stands behind a desk, talking on the phone.  Hauk is in the\nforeground, looking pensive.\n\n<b>REHME\n</b>Yes, he's right here, Mr. Vice President.\n\nHauk picks up a phone.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>This is Bob Hauk.  ...We can't.  If we move in with choppers, they'll\nkill him.  We're lucky if he's not dead already... They don't want\nanything yet.  By the time they figure out what they want, it'll be too\nlate.\n\n<b>REHME\n</b>Tell him we have to go with your plan now.\n\nHauk waves him off.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>We can't wait until tomorrow.  If we have to move in and take the\nisland, it's a last resort.  It's 8:45.  I want permission to try a\nrescue.  Thank you.\n\n<b>INT. HAUK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT\n</b>Hauk calmly arms a .45 pistol.  He looks up from his desk.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>All right.\n\n<b>OVERPROTECTIVE SECURITY GUARD\n</b>He's dangerous, sir.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>(with quiet confidence)\nI know.  I'll be OK.\n\n<b>HAUK'S P.O.V.\n</b>We see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure.  It's Snake Plissken\nall right, live and in the flesh.  The guards leave.  Snake walks into\nHauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk.  He raises\nhis cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say \"Take these off me, asshole,\" but\nhe doesn't actually say anything.  Hauk shakes his head.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>I'm not a fool, Plissken.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>(coooooool)\nCall me Snake.\n\nHauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>S.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.  Special Forces Unit, Black Flight.\nTwo Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.  Youngest man to be decorated\nby the President.  You robbed the federal reserve depository.  Life\nsentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick your\nass out of the world, War Hero.\n\nSnake could not care less.  He reaches forward with his still-cuffed\nright hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand,\nstrikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette.  He lets out a\ncalm breath and says:\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Who are you?\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Hauk.  Police Commissioner.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Bob Hauk...\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Special Forces Unit.  Texas Thunder.  We heard of you, too, Plissken.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Why are we talking?\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>I have a deal for you.  You'll receive full pardon for every criminal\nact committed in the United States.\n\nHauk shows Snake the pardon.  Snake's eye lights up.  This is something\nhe wants.  He's interested now, and can't hide it.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>(pressing his advantage)\nThere was an accident about an hour ago.  A small jet went down inside\nNew York City.  The President was on board.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>(re-establishing control over the conversation)\nPresident of what?\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>That's not funny, Plissken.  (beat)  You go in, find the President and\nbring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.\n\nWe sense amusement from Snake.  This is not the first time the\ngovernment has asked him for a favor.  But he's not a soldier or a \"War\nHero\" anymore.  He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon.\nHe's holding the cards now, and he knows it.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Twenty-four hours, huh?\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>I'm making you an offer.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Bullshit.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Straight just like I said.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>I'll think about it.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>No time.  Give me an answer.\n\nSnake turns away.  Hauk is pushing way too hard, and Snake is determined\nto be in the driver's seat.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Get a new president.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>We're still at war, Plissken.  We need him alive.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>I don't give a fuck about your war... or your president.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Is that your answer?\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>I'm thinking about it.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Think hard.\n\nSnake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette.  Next question:\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Why me?\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.  You know how to get in quiet.\nYou're all I've got.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>I guess I go in one way or the other.  Doesn't mean shit to me.  Give me\nthe paper.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>When you come out.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Before.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>I told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Call me Snake.\n\n<b>INT. WEAPONS ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>Rehme talks as we PAN ACROSS a table full of weapons.  We see two guns,\na belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a\nUzi, throwing stars, and more.  Snake surveys them with a cool\nexpression.\n\n<b>REHME\n</b>Some of them have cars.  They took old junkers that were left behind and\nconverted them to steam.  We think they may also have a gasoline source\nin there, and power.  Greenhouses, rigged up generators.  Some areas\nhave streetlights. The crazies.  Live in the subways.  Complete control\nof the underground.  They're night raiders.\n\nSnake's not into this.  He'll figure it out when he gets there.  He\npicks up a bracelet with an eagle on it.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Tracer.  Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes.  You push it, we can\ntrack you on radar.  Just like Leningrad.  But they added something.  A\nsafety catch.\n\nSnake pushes the safety catch.  Simple enough.  And yes, there's the\nbutton.  This is familiar.  He smiles.\n\n<b>INT. HALL -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now.  He walks down the\nhall to the medical room with Hauk.  Rehme has disappeared.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Where am I landing?\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Top of the world trade center.  Only place you can land.  They won't see\nit, and you can take off from a free fall.  On the roof there's a\nservice elevator.  It's still operational.  We use it to infiltrate the\nprison.  There's a power box.  It'll activate the elevator down to\nfifty.  From there on down\nyou walk.\n\nSnake shrugs on his jacket.  He knows Hauk is just trying to assert his\nauthority, and it's not working very well.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>You can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist.\nIt sends out a sig pulse.  Use this.\n\nHe hands Snake a homing device.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Homing device.  Shows directions and distance.\n\n<b>INT. MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake and Hauk walk into the room.  They're met by a young medic.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Strong antitoxin.  Stops bacteria and viral-proofs you for 24 hours.\n\nSnake braces himself against a table.  The medic is holding an\ninjection-type tech gizmo.\n\n<b>MEDIC\n</b>Take off the jacket.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>I'll be OK.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Let's go, Plissken.\n\nSnake shrugs off his jacket, disoriented by the place.  He's nervous.\nHis hackles are up.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>I don't like needles.\n\nHauk straps a timer gauge onto Snake's left hand.  He activates it and\nthe time blinks on.  It's counting down as we speak.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Twenty-two hours, twenty-nine minutes, fifty-seven seconds...\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>We talked about twenty-four.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>In twenty-two hours the Hartford Summit meeting will be over.  China and\nthe Soviet Union will go back home.  The president was on his way to the\nsummit when his plane went down.\n\nSnake snorts.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>He has a briefcase attached to his wrist.  The tape recording inside has\nto reach Hartford in 22 hours.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>What's on it?\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>You know anything about nuclear fusion?\n\nSnake turns away.  No.  Nuclear fusion is not his area of expertise.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>It's about the survival of the human race, Plissken.  Something you\ndon't give a shit about.\n\nHauk steps aside.  The medic swabs Snake's neck on both sides.\n\n<b>MEDIC\n</b>I'm going to inject you.  It'll sting for a second or two...\n\nHe raises a couple of hypos and injects Snake with them.  Snake jumps a\nlittle; clearly, this is not one of the world's most pleasant things.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>That's it, Plissken.\n\nSnake gets off the table.  The medic turns around.\n\n<b>MEDIC\n</b>Tell him.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Tell me what?\n\nHauk thinks he's got him this time.  Snake doesn't like that.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>That idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees and\nflying off to Canada.\n\nHauk shakes his head.  Snake puts his jacket down and turns to the\nmedic.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>What did you do to me, asshole?\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>My idea, Plissken.  Something we've been fooling around with.  Two\nmicroscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.  They're already starting\nto dissolve.  In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve.\nInside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge.  Not a large explosive.\nAbout the size of a pinhead.  Just big enough to --\n(he gestures)\nopen up both your arteries.  I'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteen\nseconds --\n\nHauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b><b>TAKE THEM OUT NOW.\n</b>\n<b>MEDIC\n</b>They're protected by the cores.  Fifteen minutes before the last hour is\nup we can neutralize the charge with X-rays.\n\nSnake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch.  22:57:38.  37.  36.  This\nis his life he's watching tick away.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>We'll burn out the charges IF you have the President.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>What if I'm a little late?\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>No more Hartford Summit.  And no more Snake Plissken.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>When I get back I'm going to kill you.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>The Gullfire's waiting.\n\n<b>EXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake pulls up in a Jeep.  He walks up to the tiny plane called the\nGullfire.  Two guards stand by to make sure he just gets in the plane\nand does his job.  He throws his cigarette out onto the runway and\ncloses the overhead window.\n\n<b>INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake turns on his monitors.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>I'm ready.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>21 hours.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Suppose he's dead, Hauk.  If I come back without him, you'll burn these\nthings out?\n\n<b>INT. BASE --- NIGHT\n</b>Hauk and Rehme exchange a glance; Hauk's been expecting this question to\ncome up.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Get them both back, Plissken.\n\n<b>INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake doesn't like the response, but figures he can't do anything about\nit.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Remember, once inside you're on your own.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Oh, you mean I can't count on you?\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>No.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Good.\n\n<b>EXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT\n</b>A larger plane hauls the Gullfire into the air; the Gullfire is\nessentially a big hang glider.\n\n<b>INT. BASE -- NIGHT\n</b>Hauk checks Snake's life clock, \"Master Life Clock\".\n<b>20:17:43... 42... 41....\n</b>\n<b>INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake's watch reads 20:17:40... 39... 38... 37... 36... 35...\nHe starts controlling the plane.  He flips the tracer open and hits the\nbutton, testing it.\n\n<b>INT. BASE -- NIGHT\n</b>The master life clock shows the test confirmation.\n\n<b>COMPUTER\n</b>Tracer test confirmed at 20 hours, 17 minutes, 30 seconds.\n\nHauk, Rehme and the Vice President nod with relief.\n\n<b>EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake takes the plane in.\n\n<b>INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake looks over his monitors.  He sees New York coming up.\n\n<b>INT. BASE -- NIGHT\n</b>Hauk waits at his microphone.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>Are you picking up the target blip?\n\n<b>INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Right on course.\n\n<b>EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT\n</b>The plane aims for the World Trade Center.\n\n<b>INT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>It's been a while . . .\n\nThe plane is aiming right at a building.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>How's your altitude?\n\nSnake calmly angles the plane up.\n\n<b>INT.

It's like he can feel the cores dissolving.\n\nA crazy walks past, bangs on manhole covers.  Snake doesn't know what\nhe's doing, but he doesn't like it.  Especially not when the manhole\ncovers start to rise up.  He runs off.\n\n<b>EXT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake finds the restaurant, and runs inside.  No one follows.\n\n<b>INT.

They split up, but\nshe gets sucked through the floor.  Snake tries to save her, but it's\ntoo late.  He gets the hell out of there.\n\n<b>INT. BUILDING -- NIGHT, EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT, EXT.

He breaks a window to get in, then pulls\na cabinet in front of the window.  He shoots through the cabinet,\ncausing some crazy to scream.  He busts down a door, shoots open part of\na wall, busts through that, climbs out a window, and climbs down a\ntelephone pole.  He then climbs up a wall.  On the way he drops his\nwalkie-talkie.  He runs down an alley, and as he does, Cabbie pulls up.\n\n<b>CABBIE\n</b>Where you goin', buddy?\n\nSnake points his gun at Cabbie.  He looks behind him, then gets in the\ncab.\n\n<b>INT.

The Duke gave him to Brain just to\nkeep him happy . . . see what I mean?\n\nSnake can tell that Maggie's more than just Brain's squeeze; she's his\nbodyguard, too.

He contemplates Brain.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Listen, I'll take you out of here.  Yeah.  Jet glider just a couple of\nblocks down the street.  And all you gotta do is get me to him.\n\nEveryone realizes the importance of this.\n\n<b>CABBIE\n</b>No kidding?  On the level?

Cabbie panics.\n\n<b>CABBIE\n</b>That's the Duke!  I know the sound of his engines.  Don't cross the Duke\n-- everybody knows that.\n\nWe get one glimpse of the Duke's car.  Then we realize that Cabbie is\ngone and his cab is racing away.\n\n<b>MAGGIE\n</b>Cabbie, you slime!\n\nThe Duke's car heads right for us.\n\n<b>MAGGIE\n</b>No, Brain!\n\nThe two of them run off.  After a while, Snake follows.  The three of\nthem hide.  The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended\nover the headlights.  It's in a caravan of three, leading the way.  A\nfourth car comes up later.  The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of\na car with Weirdo in the back.  The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at\nhis side.  The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy\njacket, bluejeans, and boots.  He looks TOUGH.  He sends Weirdo to knock\non the door.\n\n<b>MAGGIE\n</b>He's looking for you, Brain.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>What does he want?\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>He wants my diagram of the bridge.

The\ndeal is off --\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Just calm down.\n\n<b>EXT. CAR -- NIGHT\n</b>A lone man sits, looking bored.  Snake subtly goes up to him, knocks him\nout, and gets him out of the car.  He briefly considers shooting the guy\non the hood of the car.  Instead, the guy on the hood of the car walks\naround.  Snake knocks him out a second alter and then drives to get\nBrain and Maggie.  He knocks the other guy out of the car.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>(panicked)\nI think they saw us!  Turn left, turn left here!\n\n<b>INT.

Just keep driving!\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>What's wrong with Broadway?\n\n<b>EXT. BROADWAY -- NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>(to the car)\nCome on sweetheart . . .\n\nPeople start throwing bricks.  Snake hands his gun to Brain, who passes\nit to Maggie, holding it like a dead rat (or like a macho guy would hold\na purse).  Snake drives as fast as he can, gunning off the bystander who\ngets on the car.  A bystander grabs Brain.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Maggie!\n\nMaggie protects him.  She shoots the people grabbing at him.  Snake\nangles the car through a pile of scrap metal and drives away.  He glares\nat Brain.  Everyone seems visibly shaken.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Hold on.\n\nSnake backs the car through a bunch of piled cars.  He takes off, the\ncar a bit worse for wear but at least they got away from the crowd on\nBroadway.\n\n<b>EXT. TRAINS -- NIGHT\n</b>Brain points to the cars as Snake watches.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>He'll be in the third car from the end, by the last campfire.\n\nSnake looks around.  The Duke's caravan passes.  There are more cars\nthan there were before.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>It's all right.  He's got to go in the front way.  It'll take him five\nminutes.  If you're not back to the car in four minutes you're on your\nown.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>When we get there, Harold, you just keep talking.\n\nThey drive off.  Snake gets to the trains.  No one notices.  Maggie and\nBrain get out of the car and Snake ducks into the train car.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Hi, guys.  Hi . . . how's it going?  Cooled off a little, huh?\n\n<b>HEAD DUDE\n</b>What do you want, Brain?\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Duke told us to wait inside.

He hasn't found the President yet. But he doesn't have time to\nwonder if Brain double-crossed him.\n\n<b>HEAD DUDE\n</b>Why don't we wait outside here for him?\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Why don't we wait inside for him?\n\n<b>HEAD DUDE\n</b>'Cause I got orders, that's why.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>What are your specific orders, by the way?\n\n<b>HEAD DUDE\n</b>Specific orders, Brain, was for me not to let no one go inside.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>How's the President holding up, by the way?

The second is looking out the window.\n\n<b>SECOND GUARD\n</b>That Brain is a real pain in the ass.  He's always sniffing around like\na dog.\n\n<b>FIRST GUARD\n</b>He comes up with the gas.\n\nThe second guard looks out the window.  Snake grabs him by the neck, and\nbreaks it.  The first guard doesn't notice, but the President does, and\nthat tips off the guard.\n\n<b>FIRST GUARD\n</b>What are you looking at?\n\nHe turns and Snake throws a star at him.  It lodges right in his brain,\nbut not fast enough.  Snake is hit in the leg with a crossbow arrow.\n\nSnake limps over to the President and starts uncuffing him.  The\npresident still has the briefcase.  This is it, this is the big time.\nSnake keeps calm.\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>Are you from the outside?\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Stop shaking.\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>I can't!

Suddenly, Snake gets jumped.  Ten\nguys surround him and the President, and though Snake fights well, it's\nnot well enough.  Brain comes out with Maggie.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>They got him.  Now watch him.\n\nThe Duke steps out from the car, followed by Weirdo.\n\n<b>DUKE\n</b>Friend of yours, Brain?\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>He had a gun on me, Duke, there was nothing I could do.\n\n<b>DUKE\n</b>(not believing it for a second)\nUh-huh.\n\nWeirdo points accusingly as he and Duke walk away.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Maggie . . .\n\nDuke walks up to Snake.  Snake isn't giving in even though he's pretty\nsure he's beat.\n\n<b>DUKE\n</b>Who are you?\n\nSnake doesn't answer.  Duke grabs the arrow still lodged in his right\nleg and pulls on it.  Snake writhes in agony.\n\n<b>DUKE\n</b>I said who are you?\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Snake Plissken, Duke.  The Man sent him in here.  Something's going down\n. . . we need him.\n\nDuke recognizes the name.

There are LOTS of crossbows aimed at him.\n\n<b>GUARD\n</b>Don't move, Snake.\n\nSnake turns to face him.  He stands up.  We see for the first time\nexactly why he's called \"Snake\" Plissken.  There's a snake tattooed on\nhis stomach.  The snake's tail disappears into his pants, but we have a\ngood idea of where it leads and what it becomes.  Ah ha.\n\nSnake's life clock is gone.  He has no idea how much time he's got.\nShit.\n\n<b>INT. TARGET PRACTICE -- DAY\n</b>\n<b>DUKE\n</b>I want that diagram, Brain.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Oh. It's at my place, Duke.

The Duke fires at the\nPresident's briefcase.  Papers and a tape fall out.  Weirdo looks down\nand kicks the tape away.  He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then\nputs it in his pocket.  Guards come and unstrap the President.  The Duke\nhas decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had.\n\nWhich is not saying much.\n\n<b>EXT.

God, I hate that guy.\n\nBrain stands in front of his maps.\n\n<b>MAGGIE\n</b>He got in somehow.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Yeah, yeah, but how?  You gotta land the glider and take off.\n(he gestures at the map)\nYou can't do it in Central Park, there's too many trees.  Port\nAuthority's too low to the ground.

STADIUM -- SUNSET\n</b>Boos greet Snake as he walks in.  In the center of the room is a\nfighting ring.  Snake climbs in, not without effort.  A huge and\nextremely ugly man climbs into the ring, amid loud cheers.  Snake\nnotices that the huge ugly dude is wearing his life clock.  In the\nbalcony above is the Duke.  The Duke stands up and raises his arms, and\neveryone gets silent.\n\n<b>DUKE\n</b>They sent in their best man.  And when we roll down the 69th street\nbridge tomorrow on our way to freedom, we're gonna have their best man\nleading the way.

Ugly strikes at\nSnake.  Snake ricochets off the ring.  He rolls around, fighting for his\nlife.\n\n<b>INT. BUILDING -- SUNSET\n</b>Brain and Maggie walk around.  They knock on a door and Weirdo answers.\nHe's wearing Cabbie's hat.\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>Hello.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Where'd you get the hat?\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>Got it from Cabbie.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Yeah?\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>Traded him.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>For what?\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>What are you so nervous about?\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>I'm here to see the President.\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>Who says?\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>The Duke.\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>No he doesn't.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Well...

Brain starts checking the\nPresident's clothes.  The President has been dressed in a wig and tied\nto a chair with an American Flag on it.\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>Cyanide?\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Yeah.  He might try to take it tomorrow.\n\nWeirdo walks up to Brain.\n\n<b>WEIRDO\n</b>That's bullshit.  You're not supposed to be in here, Brain --\n\nBrain stabs Weirdo, who dies with a gasp.  Maggie dispatches of the\nthree guards.  She smiles.  Brain unties the President's hand.  The\nPresident snatches off the wig in a rage.\n\n<b>INT.

But he's\ncatching up.  As Ugly tries to hit him, he nails Ugly in the groin, then\nin the back of the head.  The crowd begins cheering \"SNAKE!  SNAKE!\"\nThe Duke can't believe it.  Snake runs to the guard with the tracer and\nactivates it.\n\n<b>INT.

Maggie, Brain, and the President all\ntake cover behind a chimney and try to get a gang to stop chopping down\nthe glider.  It doesn't work.  The glider floats away.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Goddamned redskins!  They're savages, Mr. President!\n\nSnake runs to get them.  They get in the elevator.\n\n<b>INT.

He's got half an hour to live if that.\nHe doesn't have time for Brain's shit, and he lets him know it.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>You shouldn't have double-crossed me again, Brain.  Come on, let's go --\n\nHe suddenly notices there's nothing on the end of the President's chain.\nHe holds it in front of the President's face.\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>They sawed it off...\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>The tape?\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>Gone...

Maybe.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Swear to god, Snake, I know where it is.  Just take us to the car and\nI'll take you right to it.\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Shit...\n\nHe tosses the diagram of the bridge to Brain.

There's a man with a crossbow pointed\nstraight at him.  Shit.  They've been caught.  Again.\n\n<b>DUKE\n</b>Car trouble?\n\nSnake looks over the hood.  There's the Duke.  With a dozen guards.\nBrain steps out.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Hi, Duke.\n\n<b>DUKE\n</b>This whole deal of yours is over, Snake.  You and Brain just say good-\nbye to each other.\n\nThe Duke turns away and loses aim of his gun for a moment.  At that\nmoment, Snake pulls a gun and fires at the steam vent.  At the same\ntime, Maggie slams the hood shut on the guard with the crossbow.  Steam\nflies everywhere, enough for cover.  The four of them run for it.  The\nDuke runs after them.\n\n<b>EXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT\n</b>A cab pulls up.  Its radio is playing \"American Bandstand\".  Guess who's\ndriving?  You got it!\n\nThe group of four runs up to the cab.

Brain laughs, trying to cover his ass.\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>You traded away your hat for it!\n\n<b>CABBIE\n</b>How'd you know?\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>See, see!\n\nSnake pops it into the deck.  It begins spewing out information.  It's\nthe right one.  He slips it into his pocket.\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>Here, give me that tape!\n\nHA!  No way!\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Not just yet.\n\nSnake checks his life clock.  23:20. 19. 18. 17.  Didn't that guy say 15\nminutes before the last hour was up?  But Hauk said they'd been playing\nwith this, so the 15 minutes was built in already.  Still, 23 minutes.\nThat's cutting it pretty fucking close.\n\n<b>EXT. CAB -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake races as fast as the cab can go.\n\n<b>INT. CAB -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake checks to make sure they're not being followed too closely.\nThey're not.  The Duke is behind, but he's FAR behind.\n\n<b>CABBIE\n</b>Easy... easy!\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>Go for it, Snake!\n\n<b>EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake jumps the car over the first obstacle.  Cabbie looks like he's\nhaving a heart attack.\n\nSnake swerves on Brain's direction.  So far so good.  A mine goes off,\nbut it's behind them.\n\nThe Duke goes forward.  He's going by the seat of his pants.  But he\nknows the general direction of how Snake went.  A mine goes off behind\nhim, too.\n\n<b>INT. CAB -- NIGHT\n</b>Brain reads the map.  Cabbie continues to freak out.\n\n<b>CABBIE\n</b>You've got to slow down a little, Snake...\n\n<b>BRAIN\n</b>I think there are three mines ahead, Snake.\n\n<b>MAGGIE\n</b>You think?!\n\n<b>EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT\n</b>The Duke continues in pursuit.\n\n<b>INT.

Snake limps up to her.\n\n<b>MAGGIE\n</b>Brain...\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Keep moving...\n\nThe Duke's car is coming.  Snake checks his life clock\n\n<b>SNAKE\n</b>Maggie... he's dead.  Come on.\n\nMaggie calmly holds out her hand.  Snake smiles and hands her his gun.\nHis grin grows.  It's one of respect for what she's about to do.  He\nruns off after the President.\n\nMaggie walks around to Brain, then steps in front of him.  She points\nthe gun at the Duke's car.  The first three shots don't connect.  The\nfourth nails the headlight, and then the Duke runs her over.  He keeps\ngoing.\n\n<b>INT. BASE -- NIGHT\n</b>Rehme runs up to Hauk and the Vice President.\n\n<b>REHME\n</b>Station 19!

The winch comes down and\nSnake helps the President into it first.  The President goes up and\nover.  Snake's life clock reads 1:32.  But he doesn't have time to watch\nseconds tick away because the Duke is right behind him firing at him.\nSnake ducks for cover.  The wall guards die.  The winch comes down\nagain, and the Duke sees it.  He starts toward it.  Snake tackles him\nand beats him up, dazing him but not knocking him out.  He grabs the\nwinch.\n\n<b>EXT. WALL -- NIGHT\n</b>A hand stops the winch from moving.\n\n<b>EXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT\n</b>Snake comes to a stop.  He panics and starts pulling on the winch line.\nThe Duke comes to and stands up.  But he can't get anywhere because the\nPresident has found a machine gun and is now firing away.  He is very\naccurate.  He nails the Duke right away but keeps firing.\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>(manic voice)\nYeah, hey, Number One!  You're the Duke!  You're the Duke!\n\nThe President calms down somewhat.\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>You're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One.\n\nThe President starts the winch again.  Snake climbs up and gets over as\nfast as he can without injuring himself.\n\n<b>EXT. WALL -- NIGHT\n</b>Hauk and the medic pull up with the machine.  Hauk interrupts the medic.\n\n<b>HAUK\n</b>The tape, Plissken.\n\nSnake reaches into his pocket, grabs the tape, and hands it to Hauk.  He\nis furious.  As soon as Hauk has the tape, he lets the medic come back.\nHe holds up two medal pads to Snake's neck.  They buzz, they buzz\nlouder, and then he takes them away.\n\n<b>MEDIC\n</b>That's it.\n\nSnake continues to pant and fume.  He stares at them, then lifts his\nwrist to look at his life clock.  2 seconds.  One second.\n\nBeep.\n\nNothing.\n\nSnake lowers his wrist.\n\n<b>EXT.

A lot of people died in the process.  I just\nwondered how you felt about it.\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>I want to thank them.  This nation appreciates their sacrifice.\n\nThe President is full of shit after all.  Snake has reason for his\ncynicism.  The President is uncomfortable with Snake's glare and it\nshows.\n\n<b>PRESIDENT\n</b>Look, uh, I'm on the air in...\n(questioning his aide)\nTwo and a half minutes?\n\n<b>AIDE\n</b>Yes, sir.\n\nSnake lights a cigarette and walks away.
