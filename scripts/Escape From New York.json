BUS -- NIGHT\nS.D. \"SNAKE\" PLISSKEN gets off the bus, looks around, and is escorted by\nthree guards into the base.  He looks like the essence of cool.  His\nhair is long, wavy, and ratty, he lost his left eye somewhere along the\nline, and he's got a two-day beard thing going on.  He's wearing a black\nspandex/kevlar type shirt with zippers across the shoulders, and a pair\nof camouflage pants with lots of pockets.  His jacket is a brown leather\njacket that has seen far better days, and he's wearing a pair of\nhandcuffs that have, instead of the links we're used to, a straight\nmetal bar between them.  He's not resisting anything, but the police are\nnot taking any chances.\n\nINT. BASE -- NIGHT\nPlissken and the guards follow a winding stairway down to the main\nfloor.\n\nVOICE\nAttention.

BASE -- NIGHT\nHauk and Rehme walk down the stairs.  They turn TOWARD US and walk into\nthe AIR TRAFFIC ROOM.  Dozens of men sit in front of radar transmission\nscreens, wearing headsets and working.   Following Hauk and Rehme into\nthe room:\n\nINT. AIR TRAFFIC ROOM -- NIGHT\n\nREHME\nWe've been on the board for the last twenty minutes.  We haven't been\nable to reach them.  There was a transmission ten minutes ago.  He\nidentified as \"David 14.\"  Then all of a sudden he was cut off.\n\nHauk and Rehme stand behind a CONTROLLER.\n\nCONTROLLER\nDavid 14, acknowledge.  David 14, we are sending Air Rescue.

He patches a voice-\nover through.\n\nREBEL VOICE\nIt's too late, assholes.  All your imperialist weapons and lies can't\nsave him now.  We're going down.

COCKPIT -- NIGHT\nThe REBEL has killed the pilot and copilot and is working on her own.\n\nREBEL\nTell this to the workers when they ask where your leader went . . .\n\nShe pulls out a slip of PAPER and proceeds to read.\n\nREBEL\nWe, the soldiers of the national liberation front of America, in the\nname of the workers and all the oppressed of this imperialist country\nhave struck a fatal blow to the racist police stick!\n\nINT. PLANE -- NIGHT\nA secret service AGENT taps on the door with his rifle as the rebel\ncontinues.\n\nREBEL\nWhat better revolutionary example than to let the president perish in\nthe inhuman dungeon of his own imperialist prison?\n\nThe agent runs back down the plane to the President and his advisers.\n\nAGENT\n(to 2ND AGENT)\nUnlock the pod!\n\n2ND AGENT immediately runs off.\n\nPAN LEFT TO PRESIDENT.\n\nAGENT\nShe's bolted the door.\n\nPRESIDENT\nCan't you shoot off the lock?\n\nAGENT\nNo, sir, she's pressurized the cabin.\n\nPRESIDENT\nHow about lifting the door off of the hinges?\n\nAGENT\nNo, sir.\n\nEXT. CLOSE UP -- The President's wrist as he handcuffs his briefcase to\nit.\n\nPRESIDENT\nGet me to the pod.\n\nThe President and all his advisors stand up and move to the back of the\nplane.\n\nINT.

I'm activating it now.\n\nSCREENS on the pod begin to light up as the President gets into the pod.\nHe pushes a few buttons.\n\nPRESIDENT\nGod save me and watch over you all.\n\nEXT.

MAN\nIt's down!\n\nHAUK\nIt's the escape pod.\n\nREHME\n40 degrees, 50 yards from impact.\n\nHAUK\nI'm going in.\n\nEXT. BASE -- NIGHT\nHelicopters prepare for, and execute, launch, and fly into New York.  A\nguard watches them.\n\nINT. BASE -- NIGHT\nRehme watches monitors as Hauk talks.\n\nHAUK\n1-W-Larry.  Over the battery.  We're moving down.  Direct sight ahead.\n\nEXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT\nThe helicopters land.  A swarm of policemen run out, and Hauk hangs\nback.  He follows with a second swarm.  The first swarm assumes a\ndefensive position near the pod.  Hauk examines the pod.  It's\ndefinitely empty, and the rest of the jet is surrounded in flames.\n\nAn odd LAUGH from nowhere.\n\nWEIRDO walks out of the darkness.  He nods his head to Hauk.\n\nWEIRDO\nYou touch me... he dies.  If you're not in the air in thirty seconds...\nhe dies.  You come back in... he dies.\n\nWeirdo takes a package out of his shirt and unwraps it to reveal the\nPresident's middle finger, complete with ring.\n\nWEIRDO\nTwenty seconds.\n\nHAUK\nI'm ready to talk.\n\nWEIRDO\nNineteen.  Eighteen.\n\nHAUK\nWhat do you want?\n\nWEIRDO\nSeventeen.  Sixteen.\n\nHAUK\nLet's go.  Let's go!\n\nWeirdo grins in triumph as the police force swarms back to the\nhelicopters and hauls ass out of New York.\n\nINT. BASE -- NIGHT\nRehme stands behind a desk, talking on the phone.  Hauk is in the\nforeground, looking pensive.\n\nREHME\nYes, he's right here, Mr. Vice President.\n\nHauk picks up a phone.\n\nHAUK\nThis is Bob Hauk.  ...We can't.  If we move in with choppers, they'll\nkill him.  We're lucky if he's not dead already... They don't want\nanything yet.  By the time they figure out what they want, it'll be too\nlate.\n\nREHME\nTell him we have to go with your plan now.\n\nHauk waves him off.\n\nHAUK\nWe can't wait until tomorrow.  If we have to move in and take the\nisland, it's a last resort.  It's 8:45.  I want permission to try a\nrescue.  Thank you.\n\nINT. HAUK'S OFFICE -- NIGHT\nHauk calmly arms a .45 pistol.  He looks up from his desk.\n\nHAUK\nAll right.\n\nOVERPROTECTIVE SECURITY GUARD\nHe's dangerous, sir.\n\nHAUK\n(with quiet confidence)\nI know.  I'll be OK.\n\nHAUK'S P.O.V.\nWe see the silhouette of an unmistakable figure.  It's Snake Plissken\nall right, live and in the flesh.  The guards leave.  Snake walks into\nHauk's office and sits down in the chair across from Hauk.  He raises\nhis cuffed hands to Hauk as if to say \"Take these off me, asshole,\" but\nhe doesn't actually say anything.  Hauk shakes his head.\n\nHAUK\nI'm not a fool, Plissken.\n\nSNAKE\n(coooooool)\nCall me Snake.\n\nHauk puts on his glasses and proceeds to read a file.\n\nHAUK\nS.D. Plissken.  American Lieutenant.  Special Forces Unit, Black Flight.\nTwo Purple Hearts, Leningrad and Siberia.  Youngest man to be decorated\nby the President.  You robbed the federal reserve depository.  Life\nsentence, New York Maximum Security Penitentiary. I'm ready to kick your\nass out of the world, War Hero.\n\nSnake could not care less.  He reaches forward with his still-cuffed\nright hand, picks up a cigarette, picks up a match with his left hand,\nstrikes the match and takes a drag from his cigarette.  He lets out a\ncalm breath and says:\n\nSNAKE\nWho are you?\n\nHAUK\nHauk.  Police Commissioner.\n\nSNAKE\nBob Hauk...\n\nHAUK\nSpecial Forces Unit.  Texas Thunder.  We heard of you, too, Plissken.\n\nSNAKE\nWhy are we talking?\n\nHAUK\nI have a deal for you.  You'll receive full pardon for every criminal\nact committed in the United States.\n\nHauk shows Snake the pardon.  Snake's eye lights up.  This is something\nhe wants.  He's interested now, and can't hide it.\n\nHAUK\n(pressing his advantage)\nThere was an accident about an hour ago.  A small jet went down inside\nNew York City.  The President was on board.\n\nSNAKE\n(re-establishing control over the conversation)\nPresident of what?\n\nHAUK\nThat's not funny, Plissken.  (beat)  You go in, find the President and\nbring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.\n\nWe sense amusement from Snake.  This is not the first time the\ngovernment has asked him for a favor.  But he's not a soldier or a \"War\nHero\" anymore.  He knows they need him more than he needs their pardon.\nHe's holding the cards now, and he knows it.\n\nSNAKE\nTwenty-four hours, huh?\n\nHAUK\nI'm making you an offer.\n\nSNAKE\nBullshit.\n\nHAUK\nStraight just like I said.\n\nSNAKE\nI'll think about it.\n\nHAUK\nNo time.  Give me an answer.\n\nSnake turns away.  Hauk is pushing way too hard, and Snake is determined\nto be in the driver's seat.\n\nSNAKE\nGet a new president.\n\nHAUK\nWe're still at war, Plissken.  We need him alive.\n\nSNAKE\nI don't give a fuck about your war... or your president.\n\nHAUK\nIs that your answer?\n\nSNAKE\nI'm thinking about it.\n\nHAUK\nThink hard.\n\nSnake pauses to take a draw on his cigarette.  Next question:\n\nSNAKE\nWhy me?\n\nHAUK\nYou flew the Gullfire over Leningrad.  You know how to get in quiet.\nYou're all I've got.\n\nSNAKE\nI guess I go in one way or the other.  Doesn't mean shit to me.  Give me\nthe paper.\n\nHAUK\nWhen you come out.\n\nSNAKE\nBefore.\n\nHAUK\nI told you I wasn't a fool, Plissken.\n\nSNAKE\nCall me Snake.\n\nINT. WEAPONS ROOM -- NIGHT\nRehme talks as we PAN ACROSS a table full of weapons.  We see two guns,\na belt, grenades, several pouches full of various stuff, a flashlight, a\nUzi, throwing stars, and more.  Snake surveys them with a cool\nexpression.\n\nREHME\nSome of them have cars.  They took old junkers that were left behind and\nconverted them to steam.  We think they may also have a gasoline source\nin there, and power.  Greenhouses, rigged up generators.  Some areas\nhave streetlights. The crazies.  Live in the subways.  Complete control\nof the underground.  They're night raiders.\n\nSnake's not into this.  He'll figure it out when he gets there.  He\npicks up a bracelet with an eagle on it.\n\nHAUK\nTracer.  Sends a radio signal for fifteen minutes.  You push it, we can\ntrack you on radar.  Just like Leningrad.  But they added something.  A\nsafety catch.\n\nSnake pushes the safety catch.  Simple enough.  And yes, there's the\nbutton.  This is familiar.  He smiles.\n\nINT. HALL -- NIGHT\nSnake has his jacket slung over his shoulder now.  He walks down the\nhall to the medical room with Hauk.  Rehme has disappeared.\n\nSNAKE\nWhere am I landing?\n\nHAUK\nTop of the world trade center.  Only place you can land.  They won't see\nit, and you can take off from a free fall.  On the roof there's a\nservice elevator.  It's still operational.  We use it to infiltrate the\nprison.  There's a power box.  It'll activate the elevator down to\nfifty.  From there on down\nyou walk.\n\nSnake shrugs on his jacket.  He knows Hauk is just trying to assert his\nauthority, and it's not working very well.\n\nHAUK\nYou can locate the President by his vital signs bracelet, on his wrist.\nIt sends out a sig pulse.  Use this.\n\nHe hands Snake a homing device.\n\nHAUK\nHoming device.  Shows directions and distance.\n\nINT. MEDICAL ROOM -- NIGHT\nSnake and Hauk walk into the room.  They're met by a young medic.\n\nHAUK\nStrong antitoxin.  Stops bacteria and viral-proofs you for 24 hours.\n\nSnake braces himself against a table.  The medic is holding an\ninjection-type tech gizmo.\n\nMEDIC\nTake off the jacket.\n\nSNAKE\nI'll be OK.\n\nHAUK\nLet's go, Plissken.\n\nSnake shrugs off his jacket, disoriented by the place.  He's nervous.\nHis hackles are up.\n\nSNAKE\nI don't like needles.\n\nHauk straps a timer gauge onto Snake's left hand.  He activates it and\nthe time blinks on.  It's counting down as we speak.\n\nHAUK\nTwenty-two hours, twenty-nine minutes, fifty-seven seconds...\n\nSNAKE\nWe talked about twenty-four.\n\nHAUK\nIn twenty-two hours the Hartford Summit meeting will be over.  China and\nthe Soviet Union will go back home.  The president was on his way to the\nsummit when his plane went down.\n\nSnake snorts.\n\nHAUK\nHe has a briefcase attached to his wrist.  The tape recording inside has\nto reach Hartford in 22 hours.\n\nSNAKE\nWhat's on it?\n\nHAUK\nYou know anything about nuclear fusion?\n\nSnake turns away.  No.  Nuclear fusion is not his area of expertise.\n\nHAUK\nIt's about the survival of the human race, Plissken.  Something you\ndon't give a shit about.\n\nHauk steps aside.  The medic swabs Snake's neck on both sides.\n\nMEDIC\nI'm going to inject you.  It'll sting for a second or two...\n\nHe raises a couple of hypos and injects Snake with them.  Snake jumps a\nlittle; clearly, this is not one of the world's most pleasant things.\n\nHAUK\nThat's it, Plissken.\n\nSnake gets off the table.  The medic turns around.\n\nMEDIC\nTell him.\n\nSNAKE\nTell me what?\n\nHauk thinks he's got him this time.  Snake doesn't like that.\n\nHAUK\nThat idea you had about turning the Gullfire around 180 degrees and\nflying off to Canada.\n\nHauk shakes his head.  Snake puts his jacket down and turns to the\nmedic.\n\nSNAKE\nWhat did you do to me, asshole?\n\nHAUK\nMy idea, Plissken.  Something we've been fooling around with.  Two\nmicroscopic capsules lodged in your arteries.  They're already starting\nto dissolve.  In twenty-two hours, the cores will completely dissolve.\nInside the cores are that heat-sensitive charge.  Not a large explosive.\nAbout the size of a pinhead.  Just big enough to --\n(he gestures)\nopen up both your arteries.  I'd say you'd be dead in ten or fifteen\nseconds --\n\nHauk stops talking because Snake has grabbed him by the throat.\n\nSNAKE\nTAKE THEM OUT NOW.\n\nMEDIC\nThey're protected by the cores.  Fifteen minutes before the last hour is\nup we can neutralize the charge with X-rays.\n\nSnake lets go of Hauk to look at his watch.  22:57:38.  37.  36.  This\nis his life he's watching tick away.\n\nHAUK\nWe'll burn out the charges IF you have the President.\n\nSNAKE\nWhat if I'm a little late?\n\nHAUK\nNo more Hartford Summit.  And no more Snake Plissken.\n\nSNAKE\nWhen I get back I'm going to kill you.\n\nHAUK\nThe Gullfire's waiting.\n\nEXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT\nSnake pulls up in a Jeep.  He walks up to the tiny plane called the\nGullfire.  Two guards stand by to make sure he just gets in the plane\nand does his job.  He throws his cigarette out onto the runway and\ncloses the overhead window.\n\nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\nSnake turns on his monitors.\n\nSNAKE\nI'm ready.\n\nHAUK\n21 hours.\n\nSNAKE\nSuppose he's dead, Hauk.  If I come back without him, you'll burn these\nthings out?\n\nINT. BASE --- NIGHT\nHauk and Rehme exchange a glance; Hauk's been expecting this question to\ncome up.\n\nHAUK\nGet them both back, Plissken.\n\nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\nSnake doesn't like the response, but figures he can't do anything about\nit.\n\nHAUK\nRemember, once inside you're on your own.\n\nSNAKE\nOh, you mean I can't count on you?\n\nHAUK\nNo.\n\nSNAKE\nGood.\n\nEXT. RUNWAY -- NIGHT\nA larger plane hauls the Gullfire into the air; the Gullfire is\nessentially a big hang glider.\n\nINT. BASE -- NIGHT\nHauk checks Snake's life clock, \"Master Life Clock\".\n20:17:43... 42... 41....\n\nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\nSnake's watch reads 20:17:40... 39... 38... 37... 36... 35...\nHe starts controlling the plane.  He flips the tracer open and hits the\nbutton, testing it.\n\nINT. BASE -- NIGHT\nThe master life clock shows the test confirmation.\n\nCOMPUTER\nTracer test confirmed at 20 hours, 17 minutes, 30 seconds.\n\nHauk, Rehme and the Vice President nod with relief.\n\nEXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT\nSnake takes the plane in.\n\nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\nSnake looks over his monitors.  He sees New York coming up.\n\nINT. BASE -- NIGHT\nHauk waits at his microphone.\n\nHAUK\nAre you picking up the target blip?\n\nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\n\nSNAKE\nRight on course.\n\nEXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT\nThe plane aims for the World Trade Center.\n\nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\n\nSNAKE\nIt's been a while . . .\n\nThe plane is aiming right at a building.\n\nHAUK\nHow's your altitude?\n\nSnake calmly angles the plane up.\n\nINT. BASE -- NIGHT\n\nHAUK\nPlissken?  Plissken?  Plissken, what are you doing?\n\nINT. GULLFIRE -- NIGHT\n\nSNAKE\nPlaying with myself.  I'm going in.\n\nSnake targets the World Trade Center.  He checks his instruments.\n\nEXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT\nThe plane comes down.  It hits hard.  Snake puts on the brakes, adds a\ngrappling hook, and finally comes to a stop right at the edge.\n\nINT. BASE -- NIGHT\n\nHAUK\nPlissken?  Plissken?\n\nEXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT\nSnake walks over to the elevator.  He uses the power box to get the\nelevator started.  He looks around, and the doors open.  He gets in the\nelevator.  The doors close.\n\nINT. BASE -- NIGHT\nSnake's voice comes through the radio.\n\nSNAKE\nI'm inside the World Trade Center on the 50th floor.  Just like\nLeningrad, Hauk.\n\nHAUK\nIs the glider intact?\n\nINT. WORLD TRADE CENTER -- NIGHT\nSnake stands with his walkie-talkie in the middle of the graffiti-\ncovered building.\n\nSNAKE\nYeah, but taking off is for shit.  I'll work it out.\n\nHAUK\nYou'll have to use the east stairwell.  It'll take you a little while to\nget to ground level.\n\nSnake checks his life clock.  19:22:44. 43. 42.\n\nHAUK\nCall me when you get outside.\n\nSnake puts his walkie-talkie away as someone runs past.  He doesn't\nnotice.  He walks on.\n\nFADE OUT.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFADE IN.\nEXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT\nSnake walks along with his tracer.  He goes through alleys and streets.\nHe draws his gun as he walks by a group of people.  He's armed and ready\nto fight.\n\nEXT. PLANE CRASH -- NIGHT\nThe plane is still burning.  Smoke is coming from everywhere.  The plane\nis severed in the middle.  The crash is very impressive.  Snake walks\nand notices a few people go by.  He pulls out his walkie-talkie.\n\nSNAKE\nI'm at the plane.  Nobody else made it, Hauk.\n\nSomething beeps.  His tracer.\n\nSNAKE\nWait a minute.\n\nHe looks at his tracer.  A small red dot lights up in the southeast\ncorner.\n\nSNAKE\nI've got his pulse.  Right up ahead, moving northwest.\n\nHe puts away his walkie-talkie and checks his life clock.  18:50:18.\n17.  16.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\nImages.  Snake holding the tracer.  He gets closer and comes up to a\nbuilding, formerly a theater.  He walks in.\n\nINT. THEATER -- NIGHT\nThe pulse keeps getting stronger.  Snake walks in.  He holds his gun at\nthe ready.  There's a truly horrible musical going on.\n\nINT. STAGE -- NIGHT\n\nACTORS\nThis is hell!  This is hate!  (etc.)\n\nSnake looks around.  No sign of the president, but there is a CABBIE\nenjoying the show.  Time to move on.  He enters against his better\njudgment, but he's just passing through, so that's OK.\n\nINT.

Nice boots.  Niiiiice boots.  Hey.\n\nA guy tries to sneak up behind Snake.  Snake knocks him out and points\nhis gun at the bum.\n\nBUM\nEasy now, chief.  I'm walking.

As he\ncomes back up, he sets up a chair and sits down heavily.  He touches his\nneck.  It's like he can feel the cores dissolving.\n\nA crazy walks past, bangs on manhole covers.  Snake doesn't know what\nhe's doing, but he doesn't like it.  Especially not when the manhole\ncovers start to rise up.  He runs off.\n\nEXT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT\nSnake finds the restaurant, and runs inside.  No one follows.\n\nINT. CHOCK FULL OF NUTS -- NIGHT\nSnake backs into a corner.

ALLEYS -- NIGHT\nSnake runs through the building, breaks a window, and climbs up a fire\nescape to get to a new floor.  He breaks a window to get in, then pulls\na cabinet in front of the window.  He shoots through the cabinet,\ncausing some crazy to scream.  He busts down a door, shoots open part of\na wall, busts through that, climbs out a window, and climbs down a\ntelephone pole.  He then climbs up a wall.  On the way he drops his\nwalkie-talkie.  He runs down an alley, and as he does, Cabbie pulls up.\n\nCABBIE\nWhere you goin', buddy?\n\nSnake points his gun at Cabbie.  He looks behind him, then gets in the\ncab.\n\nINT. CAB -- NIGHT\nSnake notices a tape player which is playing the theme from \"American\nBandstand.\"\n\nCABBIE\nBad neighborhood, Snake!

Yes, sir!\nThey'll kill you and strip you in ten seconds flat.  Usually I'm not\ndown around here myself, but I wanted to catch that show.\n\nCabbie lights a rag stuffed down the neck of a bottle which is full of\ngasoline.\n\nCABBIE\nThis stuff is like gold around here, you know.\n\nEXT.

I've been driving this cab for thirty years, this very same cab.\n\nSnake points his gun at Cabbie.\n\nSNAKE\nI'm GONNA ask you.  Now where's the President?\n\nCABBIE\nThe Duke's got him!  Everyone knows the Duke's got him!  You don't have\nto put a gun to my head.  I'll tell you!\n\nSNAKE\nWho's the Duke?\n\nCABBIE\nThe DUKE!  The Duke of New York!  A-Number-1!

BRAIN'S BUILDING -- NIGHT\nCabbie parks the cab and he and Snake walk up to Brain's building.\n\nCABBIE\nI hate to leave her on the street.  Usually I don't leave her alone at\nall.

Snake checks his life clock.  17:40:46. 45. 44.  Relax, my ass.\n\nSNAKE\nThanks.\n\nCABBIE\nBoy, they got a great place here.

She stands there and surveys the pair.\n\nMAGGIE\nYOU'RE Plissken?\n\nCABBIE\nHe wants to see Brain.\n\nMAGGIE\nWhy?\n\nSNAKE\nI want to meet the Duke.\n\nSnake and Maggie exchange a glance.  She leads them in.\n\nINT. BRAIN'S -- NIGHT\n\nCABBIE\nHey, what do you think of this place, Snake?  It used to be a public\nlibrary.  Oh, that Brain, he's the greatest!  Mr. Fabulous!  Duke loves\nhim.\n\nSNAKE\n(gesturing at Maggie)\nWho's that?\n\nCABBIE\nThat's Maggie.  Brain's squeeze.  The Duke gave him to Brain just to\nkeep him happy . . . see what I mean?\n\nSnake can tell that Maggie's more than just Brain's squeeze; she's his\nbodyguard, too.  She looks like she'd be willing to kill to protect\nBrain.\n\nMAGGIE\nHeard you were dead.\n\nINT. BRAIN'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n\nCABBIE\nBrain?  Brain!

Hey, Brain, I could use some gas if you can spare\nsome . . .\n\nNo one pays attention.  Snake advances on Brain.  Brain sits down.\n\nSNAKE\nI'm glad you remember me.  Yeah.  A man should remember his past.\nKansas City, four years ago.  You ran out on me.  You left me sitting\nthere.\n\nBRAIN\nYou were late.\n\nSNAKE\nWe were buddies, Harold.  You, me, and Fresno Bob.  You know what they\ndid to Bob?\n\nHis face changes.  He suddenly kicks Brain's chair into the wall and\npoints his gun.\n\nMaggie draws a knife and starts advancing on Snake.\n\nSNAKE\nYou want to see him sprayed all over that map, baby?\n(to Brain)\nWhere's the President?!\n\nBRAIN\nSwear to god, Snake, I don't know --\n\nSNAKE\nDon't fuck with me!\n\nBRAIN\nWhy do you want to know?\n\nSNAKE\nI want him.\n\nBRAIN\nWorking for the man now, huh?\n\nSNAKE\nThen I'll just beat it out of your squeeze --\n\nBRAIN\nMm-hm.  Maggie doesn't know EXACTLY where he is and unless you know\nEXACTLY PRECISELY where he is you'll never find him.\n\nSnake takes his gun away.  He contemplates Brain.\n\nSNAKE\nListen, I'll take you out of here.  Yeah.  Jet glider just a couple of\nblocks down the street.  And all you gotta do is get me to him.\n\nEveryone realizes the importance of this.\n\nCABBIE\nNo kidding?  On the level?  Will you take me, too?\n\nBRAIN\nWe've got to deal somewhere else.\n\nSNAKE\nNo glider.\n\nMAGGIE\nWe've got the President.  And the Duke's taking everybody out of here.\n\nSNAKE\nNever happen.  See, I know something you and the Duke don't know.  We've\nonly got so long before Mr. President don't mean a whole lot.\n\nBRAIN\nYou're lying.\n\nMAGGIE\nMaybe he's not . . .\n\nBRAIN\nI know him!  Look at his face, he's lying!\n\nSNAKE\nRight, Harold.  I'm lying.  So I might as well have some fun and keep\nlooking by myself.\n\nHe cocks his gun and points it at Brain again.\n\nMAGGIE\nBrain --\n\nSNAKE\nTalk to him, baby --\n\nMAGGIE\nBrain, he'll kill us both if you don't tell him --\n\nCABBIE\n(panicking)\nBrain, you've got to tell him!\n\nMAGGIE\n(panicking)\nBrain, you've got to tell him --\n\nCABBIE\n(panicked)\nTell him, tell him, tell him --\n\nBRAIN\nALL RIGHT!!!\n\nSnake lowers the gun.\n\nSNAKE\nYou always were smart, Harold.\n\nBRAIN\nJust one thing right now.  Don't call me \"Harold.\"\n\nEXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT\nSnake, Maggie, Cabbie and Brain all walk out.\n\nSNAKE\nSo you work for this Duke, huh?\n\nBRAIN\nYeah.  Make gas for him.  Figure out things for him.\n\nSNAKE\nLike what?\n\nBRAIN\n(showing off)\nLike how to get across the 69th street bridge -- it's mined, but I know\nwhere they're planted.\n\nMAGGIE\nWe got a diagram from a guy that got all the way across . . . before\nthey shot the poor bastard.\n\nBRAIN\nWe got a crew up there now clearing the way across the first barricade.\n\nCABBIE\nWhat a sight, Snake!  The whole camp rolling right across the bridge and\nthe President right out front!  Oh, that would have been so fine . . .\n\nMAGGIE\n(ironically)\nYeah, it would have been . . .\n\nCABBIE\nYeah, but we're going with Snake now.\n\nThe three of them cross into the street.  Cabbie panics.\n\nCABBIE\nThat's the Duke!  I know the sound of his engines.  Don't cross the Duke\n-- everybody knows that.\n\nWe get one glimpse of the Duke's car.  Then we realize that Cabbie is\ngone and his cab is racing away.\n\nMAGGIE\nCabbie, you slime!\n\nThe Duke's car heads right for us.\n\nMAGGIE\nNo, Brain!\n\nThe two of them run off.  After a while, Snake follows.  The three of\nthem hide.  The Duke's car is an old Chrysler with chandeliers suspended\nover the headlights.  It's in a caravan of three, leading the way.  A\nfourth car comes up later.  The Duke is sitting in the passenger seat of\na car with Weirdo in the back.  The Duke gets out of the car, Weirdo at\nhis side.  The Duke is wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, a snazzy\njacket, bluejeans, and boots.  He looks TOUGH.  He sends Weirdo to knock\non the door.\n\nMAGGIE\nHe's looking for you, Brain.\n\nSNAKE\nWhat does he want?\n\nBRAIN\nHe wants my diagram of the bridge.  When he finds out I'm with you he's\ngoing to want my life!  Shit, Plissken, I knew I shouldn't have listened\nto you --\n\nSNAKE\nWe've got to get to the President NOW, while he's busy.\n\nBRAIN\nForget it, he's on the other side of town and we got no wheels.  The\ndeal is off --\n\nSNAKE\nJust calm down.\n\nEXT. CAR -- NIGHT\nA lone man sits, looking bored.  Snake subtly goes up to him, knocks him\nout, and gets him out of the car.  He briefly considers shooting the guy\non the hood of the car.  Instead, the guy on the hood of the car walks\naround.  Snake knocks him out a second alter and then drives to get\nBrain and Maggie.  He knocks the other guy out of the car.\n\nBRAIN\n(panicked)\nI think they saw us!  Turn left, turn left here!\n\nINT. CAR -- NIGHT\n\nMAGGIE\nBrain, this is Broadway.\n\nBRAIN\nI know, I know, the Duke'll take Seventh Avenue, Broadway is five\nminutes --\n\nMAGGIE\nNo!!!\n\nBRAIN\nYes!!!  Just keep driving!\n\nSNAKE\nWhat's wrong with Broadway?\n\nEXT. BROADWAY -- NIGHT\n\nSNAKE\n(to the car)\nCome on sweetheart . . .\n\nPeople start throwing bricks.  Snake hands his gun to Brain, who passes\nit to Maggie, holding it like a dead rat (or like a macho guy would hold\na purse).  Snake drives as fast as he can, gunning off the bystander who\ngets on the car.  A bystander grabs Brain.\n\nBRAIN\nMaggie!\n\nMaggie protects him.  She shoots the people grabbing at him.  Snake\nangles the car through a pile of scrap metal and drives away.  He glares\nat Brain.  Everyone seems visibly shaken.\n\nSNAKE\nHold on.\n\nSnake backs the car through a bunch of piled cars.  He takes off, the\ncar a bit worse for wear but at least they got away from the crowd on\nBroadway.\n\nEXT. TRAINS -- NIGHT\nBrain points to the cars as Snake watches.\n\nBRAIN\nHe'll be in the third car from the end, by the last campfire.\n\nSnake looks around.  The Duke's caravan passes.  There are more cars\nthan there were before.\n\nBRAIN\nIt's all right.  He's got to go in the front way.  It'll take him five\nminutes.  If you're not back to the car in four minutes you're on your\nown.\n\nSNAKE\nWhen we get there, Harold, you just keep talking.\n\nThey drive off.  Snake gets to the trains.  No one notices.  Maggie and\nBrain get out of the car and Snake ducks into the train car.\n\nBRAIN\nHi, guys.  Hi . . . how's it going?  Cooled off a little, huh?\n\nHEAD DUDE\nWhat do you want, Brain?\n\nBRAIN\nDuke told us to wait inside.  He's on his way here now.\n\nHEAD DUDE\nHe didn't say nothing to us about it.\n\nBRAIN\nWell, you can't expect him to tell everybody in the joint, now can you?\nThat's why he's the Duke.\n\nThe camera angles back to show Snake walking on top of the railroad\ncars.  He hasn't found the President yet. But he doesn't have time to\nwonder if Brain double-crossed him.\n\nHEAD DUDE\nWhy don't we wait outside here for him?\n\nBRAIN\nWhy don't we wait inside for him?\n\nHEAD DUDE\n'Cause I got orders, that's why.\n\nBRAIN\nWhat are your specific orders, by the way?\n\nHEAD DUDE\nSpecific orders, Brain, was for me not to let no one go inside.\n\nBRAIN\nHow's the President holding up, by the way?  Any political discussion\nyou've had with him?\n\nINT. PRESIDENT'S TRAIN CAR -- NIGHT\nTwo guards sit with the President, talking.  The first guard is by the\nPresident.  The second is looking out the window.\n\nSECOND GUARD\nThat Brain is a real pain in the ass.  He's always sniffing around like\na dog.\n\nFIRST GUARD\nHe comes up with the gas.\n\nThe second guard looks out the window.  Snake grabs him by the neck, and\nbreaks it.  The first guard doesn't notice, but the President does, and\nthat tips off the guard.\n\nFIRST GUARD\nWhat are you looking at?\n\nHe turns and Snake throws a star at him.  It lodges right in his brain,\nbut not fast enough.  Snake is hit in the leg with a crossbow arrow.\n\nSnake limps over to the President and starts uncuffing him.  The\npresident still has the briefcase.  This is it, this is the big time.\nSnake keeps calm.\n\nPRESIDENT\nAre you from the outside?\n\nSNAKE\nStop shaking.\n\nPRESIDENT\nI can't!  Who are you?\n\nSNAKE\nHauk sent me.  We've got to move fast.\n\nPRESIDENT\nMove fast?  You're goddamned right I'll move fast.\n\nSNAKE\nQuiet!\n\nSnake limps away, President in the lead.\n\nEXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT\nSnake and the President keep moving.  Suddenly, Snake gets jumped.  Ten\nguys surround him and the President, and though Snake fights well, it's\nnot well enough.  Brain comes out with Maggie.\n\nBRAIN\nThey got him.  Now watch him.\n\nThe Duke steps out from the car, followed by Weirdo.\n\nDUKE\nFriend of yours, Brain?\n\nBRAIN\nHe had a gun on me, Duke, there was nothing I could do.\n\nDUKE\n(not believing it for a second)\nUh-huh.\n\nWeirdo points accusingly as he and Duke walk away.\n\nBRAIN\nMaggie . . .\n\nDuke walks up to Snake.  Snake isn't giving in even though he's pretty\nsure he's beat.\n\nDUKE\nWho are you?\n\nSnake doesn't answer.  Duke grabs the arrow still lodged in his right\nleg and pulls on it.  Snake writhes in agony.\n\nDUKE\nI said who are you?\n\nBRAIN\nSnake Plissken, Duke.  The Man sent him in here.  Something's going down\n. . . we need him.\n\nDuke recognizes the name.  He is impressed.  He lets go of the arrow.\nSnake hates him more than ever.\n\nDUKE\nSnaaaaaake Plissken.

There are LOTS of crossbows aimed at him.\n\nGUARD\nDon't move, Snake.\n\nSnake turns to face him.  He stands up.  We see for the first time\nexactly why he's called \"Snake\" Plissken.  There's a snake tattooed on\nhis stomach.  The snake's tail disappears into his pants, but we have a\ngood idea of where it leads and what it becomes.  Ah ha.\n\nSnake's life clock is gone.  He has no idea how much time he's got.\nShit.\n\nINT. TARGET PRACTICE -- DAY\n\nDUKE\nI want that diagram, Brain.\n\nBRAIN\nOh. It's at my place, Duke.

We need him.\n\nThe Duke points the gun at Brain, but doesn't even give him a glance.\n\nDUKE\nGet moving, Brain.\n\nBrain moves, and Weirdo laughs that odd laugh.  The Duke fires at the\nPresident's briefcase.  Papers and a tape fall out.  Weirdo looks down\nand kicks the tape away.  He picks it up and holds it to his ear, then\nputs it in his pocket.  Guards come and unstrap the President.  The Duke\nhas decided to take Snake a bit more seriously than he had.\n\nWhich is not saying much.\n\nEXT.

You gotta land the glider and take off.\n(he gestures at the map)\nYou can't do it in Central Park, there's too many trees.  Port\nAuthority's too low to the ground.

He might try to take it tomorrow.\n\nWeirdo walks up to Brain.\n\nWEIRDO\nThat's bullshit.  You're not supposed to be in here, Brain --\n\nBrain stabs Weirdo, who dies with a gasp.

The keys!  Quick!  Quick!  Diagram of the\nbridge!  Hey, hey, hey --\n\nSnake takes all the abovementioned items.\n\nBRAIN\nI'm the only one who knows how to read that, Snake --\n\nSNAKE\nStay out of my way, Harold.\n\nBRAIN\nBesides, you can't read and drive at the same time.  You need us!\n\nSnake is tired.  He's pissed.  He's got half an hour to live if that.\nHe doesn't have time for Brain's shit, and he lets him know it.\n\nSNAKE\nYou shouldn't have double-crossed me again, Brain.  Come on, let's go --\n\nHe suddenly notices there's nothing on the end of the President's chain.\nHe holds it in front of the President's face.\n\nPRESIDENT\nThey sawed it off...\n\nSNAKE\nThe tape?\n\nPRESIDENT\nGone... I don't know where...\n\nBRAIN\nI do.\n\nSnake shoots him a look.  Bullshit, his eyes say, but maybe Brain is\ntelling the truth.  Maybe.\n\nBRAIN\nSwear to god, Snake, I know where it is.  Just take us to the car and\nI'll take you right to it.\n\nSNAKE\nShit...\n\nHe tosses the diagram of the bridge to Brain.  They go down the stairs.\nSnake's in bad shape, but it's everyone else who's complaining.\n\nMAGGIE\nDon't talk.  Breathe.\n\nPRESIDENT\nCome on, come on, we're wasting time!\n\nSnake gets into the car.

With a dozen guards.\nBrain steps out.\n\nBRAIN\nHi, Duke.\n\nDUKE\nThis whole deal of yours is over, Snake.  You and Brain just say good-\nbye to each other.\n\nThe Duke turns away and loses aim of his gun for a moment.  At that\nmoment, Snake pulls a gun and fires at the steam vent.  At the same\ntime, Maggie slams the hood shut on the guard with the crossbow.  Steam\nflies everywhere, enough for cover.  The four of them run for it.  The\nDuke runs after them.\n\nEXT. NEW YORK -- NIGHT\nA cab pulls up.  Its radio is playing \"American Bandstand\".  Guess who's\ndriving?  You got it!\n\nThe group of four runs up to the cab.

Brain laughs, trying to cover his ass.\n\nBRAIN\nYou traded away your hat for it!\n\nCABBIE\nHow'd you know?\n\nBRAIN\nSee, see!\n\nSnake pops it into the deck.  It begins spewing out information.  It's\nthe right one.  He slips it into his pocket.\n\nPRESIDENT\nHere, give me that tape!\n\nHA!  No way!\n\nSNAKE\nNot just yet.\n\nSnake checks his life clock.  23:20. 19. 18. 17.  Didn't that guy say 15\nminutes before the last hour was up?  But Hauk said they'd been playing\nwith this, so the 15 minutes was built in already.  Still, 23 minutes.\nThat's cutting it pretty fucking close.\n\nEXT. CAB -- NIGHT\nSnake races as fast as the cab can go.\n\nINT. CAB -- NIGHT\nSnake checks to make sure they're not being followed too closely.\nThey're not.

Cabbie looks like he's\nhaving a heart attack.\n\nSnake swerves on Brain's direction.  So far so good.  A mine goes off,\nbut it's behind them.\n\nThe Duke goes forward.  He's going by the seat of his pants.  But he\nknows the general direction of how Snake went.  A mine goes off behind\nhim, too.\n\nINT. CAB -- NIGHT\nBrain reads the map.  Cabbie continues to freak out.\n\nCABBIE\nYou've got to slow down a little, Snake...\n\nBRAIN\nI think there are three mines ahead, Snake.\n\nMAGGIE\nYou think?!\n\nEXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT\nThe Duke continues in pursuit.\n\nINT. CAB -- NIGHT\n\nBRAIN\nStay left, stay left, stay left, and then jog right when I tell you.\n\nCABBIE\nYou're pushing her too hard, Snake.\n\nBRAIN\nOK, OK, NOW!\n\nEXT. 69TH STREET BRIDGE -- NIGHT\nThe cab explodes, being cut right in half.  Everyone makes it except\nCabbie.

Hold it, left...\nleft... LEFT, DAMMIT!\n\nThe other three go right.  Brain goes left and a mine explodes under\nhim.  Maggie walks up to the body in shock.  Snake limps up to her.\n\nMAGGIE\nBrain...\n\nSNAKE\nKeep moving...\n\nThe Duke's car is coming.  Snake checks his life clock\n\nSNAKE\nMaggie... he's dead.  Come on.\n\nMaggie calmly holds out her hand.  Snake smiles and hands her his gun.\nHis grin grows.  It's one of respect for what she's about to do.  He\nruns off after the President.\n\nMaggie walks around to Brain, then steps in front of him.  She points\nthe gun at the Duke's car.  The first three shots don't connect.  The\nfourth nails the headlight, and then the Duke runs her over.  He keeps\ngoing.\n\nINT. BASE -- NIGHT\nRehme runs up to Hauk and the Vice President.\n\nREHME\nStation 19!

You're the Duke!\n\nThe President calms down somewhat.\n\nPRESIDENT\nYou're... the Duke... You're A-Number-One.\n\nThe President starts the winch again.

Hauk interrupts the medic.\n\nHAUK\nThe tape, Plissken.\n\nSnake reaches into his pocket, grabs the tape, and hands it to Hauk.  He\nis furious.  As soon as Hauk has the tape, he lets the medic come back.\nHe holds up two medal pads to Snake's neck.  They buzz, they buzz\nlouder, and then he takes them away.\n\nMEDIC\nThat's it.\n\nSnake continues to pant and fume.  He stares at them, then lifts his\nwrist to look at his life clock.  2 seconds.  One second.\n\nBeep.\n\nNothing.\n\nSnake lowers his wrist.\n\nEXT. PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCE SITE -- NIGHT\nA jeep pulls Rehme up.

Anything you want... you just name it.\n\nSNAKE\nJust a moment of your time.\n\nAIDE\nThree minutes, sir.\n\nPRESIDENT\nYes?\n\nSNAKE\nWe did get you out.  A lot of people died in the process.  I just\nwondered how you felt about it.\n\nPRESIDENT\nI want to thank them.  This nation appreciates their sacrifice.\n\nThe President is full of shit after all.  Snake has reason for his\ncynicism.  The President is uncomfortable with Snake's glare and it\nshows.\n\nPRESIDENT\nLook, uh, I'm on the air in...\n(questioning his aide)\nTwo and a half minutes?\n\nAIDE\nYes, sir.\n\nSnake lights a cigarette and walks away.
