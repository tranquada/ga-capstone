A second BODY in a Santa Claus suit lies dead \n               in the doorway.\n\n               It's a man with a large build.

A third \n               BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of \n               an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed \n               through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened.\n\n               A halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang \n               off the front bumper.

Rudy watches a spider scurry across \n               the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day.\n\n               He turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage \n               self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family \n               photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful \n               Dodger.\n\n<b>               A WALL CALENDAR\n</b>\n               Shows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th.\n\n               December 22nd is circled again and again.\n\n               Rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops \n               to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen. \n               Turning back to the beds we reveal --\n\n<b>               THE LOWER BUNK\n</b>\n               where Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached \n               and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is \n               a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost \n               a mural.\n\n               All of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties, \n               smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous \n               brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy.\n\n<b>               RUDY\n</b>\n               stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores, \n               turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen \n               this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

A SHADOW falls across Rudy's \n               somber figure. It's the Mean Guard.

Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in \n               summer.\n\n               Secondhand shoes. No possessions.\n\n               He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All \n               fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the \n               fenceway.\n\n<b>               BEYOND THE GATE\n</b>\n               There are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN, \n               several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats \n               and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them.\n\n               The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks \n               the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free.\n\n               The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives \n               rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade \n               slaps on backs. Reunion time.\n\n               The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head \n               down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he \n               can't help himself -- he glances up --\n\n<b>               TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN\n</b>\n               bundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball \n               on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners.\n\n<b>               RUDY\n</b>\n               drops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus.\n\n<b>               INT.

A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard. \n               Then the cons with relatives start to pile in.\n\n               Rudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into \n               his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the \n               picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it.\n\n               He rubs his window with his sleeve.\n\n               Outside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and \n               that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing \n               onto the bus with their loved ones.\n\n               The woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the \n               gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming.\n\n               Rudy watches her sadly.\n\n               Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up \n               their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies, \n               buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's \n               changed.\n\n               The woman outside is now alone.

Strength giving out.\n\n               Rudy struggles to her, wrapping an arm around her. She fights, \n               panicked, clawing at the ice, both of them pulled further \n               away from the opening.\n\n               With Ashley safely in hand, Rudy raises his rifle-arm, \n               pressing the barrel against the ice above them --\n\n               -- and FIRES. A HOLE blasts a shaft of light into the gray-\n               blue. Rudy FIRES again. Another HOLE caves in.

PARKING LOT\n</b>\n               Rudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck. \n               And then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing\n\n<b>               MERLIN AND JUMPY\n</b>\n               stride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way \n               toward the Nova. Voices too low to hear.\n\n<b>               ON SCENE\n</b>\n               Rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side.  \n               Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him.\n\n               Rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars, \n               heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances \n               back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem \n               to. They stand at the Nova, talking.\n\n               Rudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs \n               turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building. \n               He slips around the corner, out of sight.\n\n<b>               AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL\n</b>\n               Rudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving \n               toward a side entry --\n\n               -- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER.\n\n               Above his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling \n               water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this \n               wall.\n\n               Sounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES.\n\n               Rudy stands absolutely still. His breaths stop frosting. \n               Because his breathing has stopped.\n\n<b>               INT.

From an \n               unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view --\n\n               It's Ashley. Hair wet, naked beneath the surface.

He opens his eyes.\n\n<b>               ANGLE ON SNOWY ROAD\n</b>\n               Rudy staggers to his feet. Battered and dazed. Looks at \n               Gabriel's body. Then looks to the trailer.\n\n               Inside, Nick is still alive, bones broken from the waist \n               down.\n\n               He's mumbling madly, staring at the ceiling:\n\n<b>                                     NICK\n</b>                         ...Rudy... help me... Rudy...\n\n               Rudy climbs the tire ramp. And pulls the trailer gate shut.\n\n               He climbs into the rig's cab. Starts the engine. Puts the \n               truck in reverse, taps the accelerator and hops out.\n\n<b>                                     NICK (O.S.)\n</b>                         ...Rudy! Rudy! HELP ME!!!\n\n               The truck rolls backwards. And into the ravine.\n\n               Rudy listens to its TUMBLING SOUNDS all the way to the bottom. \n               He then looks up the road one way. Then the other.\n\n               And notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow.\n\n               He stares at them.\n\n               A long time.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT. RUDY'S JOURNEY - MONTAGE - NIGHT/DAY\n</b>\n               In his burnt and battered Santa suit, Rudy's figure trudges \n               the snowy night. Two sacks over his shoulder. walking empty \n               roads and highways. And passing a roadsign that reads \"Sidnaw -- \n               35 Miles.\"\n\n               He passes rural roads and driveways, and every time he comes \n               across a mailbox... he puts a stack of cash inside. On the \n               soundtrack, the STRINGS and RUM-PUM-PUM-PUMS of \"The Little \n               Drummer Boy\" start to rise --\n\n               With snow falling, he passes a new sign: \"Sidnaw -- 27 Miles.\"\n\n               With the sun rising, a PAIR OF CHILDREN huddle at a window, \n               seeing the man in the Santa suit at the end of their driveway. \n               Giving them something from his sack and ambling on.\n\n               -- and we follow Rudy's march, stuffing presents into \n               mailboxes. At every-stop on the way.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

Christmas trees in windows, \n               lights on inside, figures of FAMILIES in holiday gear.\n\n               No one noticing the man in the Santa suit, his sacks long \n               gone, walking up the road.\n\n<b>               EXT./INT.

Where a blackened red cuff KNOCKS.\n\n               After a moment, the door opens to reveal a smiling MOTHER \n               and FATHER in their sixties. There's a party going on inside; \n               a dining table visible beyond them.\n\n               The Mother and Father's smiles disappear. Shock.

A table laden \n               with turkey and stuffing, gravy and cranberry, wassail and \n               wine.\n\n               The relatives stop still.

And takes \n               a plate. He stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings, \n               and sets it in front of him.\n\n               And digs in.
