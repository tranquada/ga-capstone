JAIL CELLS - DAY\n\nThe inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit\nup.

She swims\nlong, slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera\ntracks alonside her, lovingly admiring her tan lines and\nhydrodynamic build. She slides out of the water and walks up\na cobble stone walk, dripping as she passes a seated\nGENTLEMAN in a white suit. His face is unrevealed. As she\nenters the house, he sets his drink down by a phone. He lifts\nup the receiver and dials.\n\n                                                             2.\n\n\n\nINT. JAIL CELLS - DAY\n\nAzul's phone rings. He looks up at it, startled, as if no one\nhas ever called him before. He glances at his watch, and then\nback at the phone, hesitating to answer it. He looks around\nthe cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him.\nFinally he answers it, pausing before saying hello. It is El\nMoco.\n\n                    MOCO (V.O.)\n          Good morning, Azul. Do you know who this\n          is?\n\n                    AZUL\n              (into phone)\n          Moco...

They enter\nAzul's block and scope out the cells.\n\nThe Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun\nfrom under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the\nsink. He stands ready to fight.\n\nThe Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat\ncautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he\nsticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them\nbefore they can react. The shot one stumbles back into his\nbuddy's arms. Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his\ncell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them.\nThe Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so\nthey turn around. The other prisoners on the block begin\nexiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails. The\nTall Man drops his gun. Finally, Azul exits his cell carrying\nhis phone. The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into an empty\ncell, closing and locking the door.\n\nAzul presses the #-button on his phone. Moco's phone number\nis automatically redialed.\n\nMoco answers.\n\n\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              5.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                     AZUL\n               (into phone)\n          I'm still here, Moco.

Listen close, because you're going\n          to repeat it to me when I come to visit\n          you.\n\nINT. TALL MEN IN CELL - DAY\n\nThe cellmates throw their Molotov cocktails into the cell.\nMoco hears the men screaming as they burn to death.

JAIL - DAY\n\nA blue truck races towards the jail.\n\nAzul exits the jail carrying a shotgun. His Bodyguards get\ninside the Tall Men's truck and start it. Azul waits\npatiently for his blue truck.\n\nAs the blue truck pulls up, two little rat-like VATOS exit\nthe blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case. Azul tosses\nit onto the hood. The Bodyguards wave as they drive away.\nAzul waves back. He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of\nweaponry. Azul notices one piece is missing. One Rat quickly\npulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in\nthe case. Azul is unamused. He grabs his MAC-10 machine gun\nfrom the guitar case and aims it at the thieving Rat's head.\n\nSuddenly, the Guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of\nmoney, as if complaining.\n\nAzul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead. A few blasts\nlater Azul and his rats pack up and go as the Guard twitches\nhelplessly on the ground, still clutching the money in his\nbloody hand.\n\nCREDIT SEQUENCE EXT.

He notices a bar\nacross the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on\nhis jacket and crosses over to it. He stops to read a sign on\nthe building that says \"MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS ONLY\". He\nprays silently to himself before confidently walking inside.\n\nINT. CORONA CLUB - DAY\n\nMariachi enters the club, greeting the PATRONS    as ge makes\nhis way to the bar. No one seems to greet him    back. He sits\non a barstool near some OTHER DRINKERS, laying    his guitar\ncase down lovingly beneath his stool. He looks    around the\nplace, as if sizing it up.\n\n                       BARTENDER\n             What do you want to drink?\n\n                          MARIACHI\n             Refresco.\n\nThe other drinkers stare at him.\n\nGlancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table-\nshaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room.\n\nSitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes.\nMariachi is served his drink.\n\n                       MARIACHI (CONT'D)\n             No hay musica?\n\n                          BARTENDER\n                    (cleaning a glass)\n             Why?\n\n                       MARIACHI\n             I'm a mariachi.

Puts on\nhis mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and\nrubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big\nshow). He hits a few switches in EXTREME CLOSEUP as...\n\n... Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat.\n\nThe Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds\nlike an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses\nanother switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and\nwaltzes the familiar riffs. He adds the string and horns\naccents by banging on the keys. He sounds awful.\n\nMariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender\nwho seems to enjoy it.\n\nThe Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down.\n\n                    BARTENDER (CONT'D)\n              (nodding with satisfaction)\n          There you see?

The Bartender offers it to the MEAN DUDES\nat the table.\n\nThey all shake their heads no.\n\nThe Bartender shrugs and dumps it.\n\nEXT. CORONA CLUB - DAY\n\nMariachi walks out and looks up and down the street. He\ndecides to walk south.\n\nAs he walks down the sidewalk, the camera pans into a CLOSEUP\nof another guitar case that is moving towards the Corona\nClub.

The other two\nMean Dudes are already reaching for their pistols.\n\nThe Bartender ducks beneath the counter.\n\nAzul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the\nother is holding the case in shock). Their chests explode,\ncausing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly\neverywhere.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          10.\nCONTINUED:\n\nThe Mean Dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear. He\nmanages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes\ndie a slow, bloody death. The barrel of the MAC-10 is\nsmoking. Azul turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case.\nAzul aims his MAC-10 in the Dude's face. Still frozen holding\nthe case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's\nbarrel.\n\nINT. BATHROOM - DAY\n\nThe shots caused Old Mean Dude to peer out from his stall as\nthe toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll\nacross the floor. He now watches it roll as more shots ring\nout. He pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door\nslowly. He is sweating profusely. He slowly picks up the\ntoilet paper, plotting his next move. It grows silent... He\ntakes a deep breath and rushes out the door.\n\nINT. CORONA CLUB MAIN ROOM - DAY\n\nThe Old Dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper\nin his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face.\n\nThe Bartender rises up from behind the counter.\n\nThe camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes. Their blood-\nbathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions. The\ncamera continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding\nthe guitar case. His face is a bloody pulp. The camera stops\ndollying to the old Dude's mixed drink. A hand is stirring it\nwith a straw. The camera pans up the arm to reveal Azul,\nstanding expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder.\n\nShot at 16fps the Old Dude quickly drops the toilet paper and\nruns back inside the bathroom.\n\nAzul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another\nweapon. He grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm\nlike a waiter, then casually follows the Old Dude into the\nbathroom.\n\nThe Bartenders glance at each other. One pours a shot glass\nfull of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it. Shots\nring out and the Bartender spills the drink over himself.\n\nWithout warning Azul bursts from the bathroom and walks\ncalmly to his case. He replaces the weapon, picks up the case\nand leaves.\n\nA few seconds pass before the bartender grabs the phone and\nfuriously dials.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             11.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                    BARTENDER\n              (into phone)\n          Get me Moco!!!\n\nThe door bursts open as Azul reenters, storming to the bar.\n\nThe Bartender is so petrified he doesn't think to drop the\nphone.\n\nAzul walks right up to the Bartender.\n\nThe Bartender shuts his eyes. The sound of the beer bottle\npopping open canbe heard, along with the sound of thirsty\nguzzling.
