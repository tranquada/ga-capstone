A JAIL IN MEXICO - DAY\n</b>\nIt's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an\nunpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder\nblocks. The camera pans with the OFFICER as he exits his car\nand walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue JAIL HOUSE.\nHe is carrying a greasy bag of fast food.\n\n<b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY\n</b>\nThe Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his\nPARTNER who is sitting at a desk. He grabs a tin cup and\nwalks over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so\nCRIMINALS, from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping\npeacefully in their cell on Block A. The Officer rattles the\ntin cup between the entrance bar.\n\n<b>INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY\n</b>\nThe inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit\nup. The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the\nblock which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and\none bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound of\nscribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the\ncell. It is AZUL jottin ginto a business ledger while\nchatting on his cellular phone. His cell is equipped with a\nsmall desk and a refridgerator. He hangs up the phone and\ncontinues writing.\n\n<b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY\n</b>\nThe Officer with the tin cup sits in a couch across from his\npartner, who is now eating, and reads a magazine.\n\n<b>INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY\n</b>\nAzul picks up his phone and makes another call. He talks\nbusiness. In the other cell, prisoners are getting up and\nlooking around. Azul hangs up the phone and writes.\n\n<b>EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY\n</b>\nA gorgeous, bikini-clad BABE struts slowly into a tighly\nframed glamour shot. She pauses, takes a deep breath, then\ndives a 'perfect ten' dive into a house-side moat. She swims\nlong, slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera\ntracks alonside her, lovingly admiring her tan lines and\nhydrodynamic build. She slides out of the water and walks up\na cobble stone walk, dripping as she passes a seated\nGENTLEMAN in a white suit. His face is unrevealed. As she\nenters the house, he sets his drink down by a phone. He lifts\nup the receiver and dials.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                             2.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY\n</b>\nAzul's phone rings. He looks up at it, startled, as if no one\nhas ever called him before. He glances at his watch, and then\nback at the phone, hesitating to answer it. He looks around\nthe cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him.\nFinally he answers it, pausing before saying hello. It is El\nMoco.\n\n<b>                    MOCO (V.O.)\n</b>          Good morning, Azul.

Two tall, well-dressed MEN step out. They reach\ninto the cab and pull out machine guns. They walk briskly\ntowards the jail.\n\n<b>INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY\n</b>\nAzul walks to his toilet and stands on it to see out his\nbarred window.\n\n<b>                    AZUL\n</b>              (into phone)\n          There's something going on outside.

Peering down\nthe hall, he sees the guys with the guns. He hides behind the\nwall, peering out to see what happens next.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                              4.\n</b>\n\n\n<b>INT.

AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY\n</b>\nAzul hangs up the phone and kicks his Bodyguard awake. The\nBodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as Azul hides in a\ncorner.\n\n<b>INT. TALL MEN IN HALL - DAY\n</b>\nThe Tall Men walk steady and alert, ready to kill. They enter\nAzul's block and scope out the cells.\n\nThe Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun\nfrom under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the\nsink. He stands ready to fight.\n\nThe Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat\ncautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he\nsticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them\nbefore they can react. The shot one stumbles back into his\nbuddy's arms. Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his\ncell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them.\nThe Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so\nthey turn around. The other prisoners on the block begin\nexiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails. The\nTall Man drops his gun. Finally, Azul exits his cell carrying\nhis phone. The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into an empty\ncell, closing and locking the door.\n\nAzul presses the #-button on his phone. Moco's phone number\nis automatically redialed.\n\nMoco answers.\n\n\n\n<b>                                                 (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                              5.\n</b><b>CONTINUED:\n</b>\n\n<b>                     AZUL\n</b>               (into phone)\n          I'm still here, Moco.

Listen close, because you're going\n          to repeat it to me when I come to visit\n          you.\n\n<b>INT. TALL MEN IN CELL - DAY\n</b>\nThe cellmates throw their Molotov cocktails into the cell.\nMoco hears the men screaming as they burn to death. Azul is\nholding the phone at arm's length into the cell.\n\n<b>INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY\n</b>\nThe Guards exchange glances when they hear the screaming,\nthey smile and shrug, then go back to what they were doing.\nAs Azul and his Bodyguards exit the block, the Guard with the\nmagazine stands up as if to stop them, but Azul tosses him a\nwad of money and the guard sits back down to count it.\n\n<b>EXT. JAIL - DAY\n</b>\nA blue truck races towards the jail.\n\nAzul exits the jail carrying a shotgun. His Bodyguards get\ninside the Tall Men's truck and start it. Azul waits\npatiently for his blue truck.\n\nAs the blue truck pulls up, two little rat-like VATOS exit\nthe blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case. Azul tosses\nit onto the hood. The Bodyguards wave as they drive away.\nAzul waves back. He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of\nweaponry. Azul notices one piece is missing. One Rat quickly\npulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in\nthe case. Azul is unamused. He grabs his MAC-10 machine gun\nfrom the guitar case and aims it at the thieving Rat's head.\n\nSuddenly, the Guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of\nmoney, as if complaining.\n\nAzul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead. A few blasts\nlater Azul and his rats pack up and go as the Guard twitches\nhelplessly on the ground, still clutching the money in his\nbloody hand.\n\n<b>CREDIT SEQUENCE EXT. AZUL / MARIACHI ON HIGHWAY - DAY\n</b>\nThe blue truck barels down the highway and the camera pans\nwith the truck as it passes a hitchhiker, MARIACHI, standing\nin the sun with a thumb in the air.\n\n<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                                 6.\n</b><b>CONTINUED:\n</b>\nThe truck    passes him up so he continues walking. Mariachi is\ncarrying    a guitar case in one hand and a black jacket in the\nother. He    is wearing a white T-shirt, black pants. The camera\npans to a    sign that reads \"ACU\u00d1A 18 miles\".\n\n<b>EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY\n</b>\nMariachi is walking around downtown Acu\u00f1a. He notices a bar\nacross the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on\nhis jacket and crosses over to it. He stops to read a sign on\nthe building that says \"MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS ONLY\". He\nprays silently to himself before confidently walking inside.\n\n<b>INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY\n</b>\nMariachi enters the club, greeting the PATRONS    as ge makes\nhis way to the bar. No one seems to greet him    back. He sits\non a barstool near some OTHER DRINKERS, laying    his guitar\ncase down lovingly beneath his stool. He looks    around the\nplace, as if sizing it up.\n\n<b>                       BARTENDER\n</b>             What do you want to drink?\n\n<b>                          MARIACHI\n</b>             Refresco.\n\nThe other drinkers stare at him.\n\nGlancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table-\nshaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room.\n\nSitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes.\nMariachi is served his drink.\n\n<b>                       MARIACHI (CONT'D)\n</b>             No hay musica?\n\n<b>                          BARTENDER\n</b>                    (cleaning a glass)\n             Why?\n\n<b>                       MARIACHI\n</b>             I'm a mariachi.

Puts on\nhis mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and\nrubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big\nshow). He hits a few switches in EXTREME CLOSEUP as...\n\n... Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat.\n\nThe Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds\nlike an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses\nanother switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and\nwaltzes the familiar riffs. He adds the string and horns\naccents by banging on the keys. He sounds awful.\n\nMariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender\nwho seems to enjoy it.\n\nThe Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down.\n\n<b>                    BARTENDER (CONT'D)\n</b>              (nodding with satisfaction)\n          There you see?

He now watches it roll as more shots ring\nout. He pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door\nslowly. He is sweating profusely. He slowly picks up the\ntoilet paper, plotting his next move.
