HIGH SPEED TRAIN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          COLTER jolts awake. Sunlight hits his face.\r\n          He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented.\r\n          Slowly he turns his head to one side...\r\n          PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on\r\n          their morning commute into a city.\r\n          Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees\r\n          flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic\r\n          strobe pattern.\r\n          Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A\r\n          disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin\r\n          burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun.\r\n          His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually\r\n          wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble.\r\n          Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down\r\n          shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch.\r\n          It reads 7:40 a.m.\r\n          He swallows. A strange, creeping panic.\r\n          He has no idea where he is.\r\n\r\n          EXT. NEW JERSEY COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING\r\n\r\n          The train hurls straight at us.\r\n          NEW ANGLE -- Skimming alongside as the train twists and\r\n          turns, sucking up track -- feet, yards, miles of it.\r\n          Beneath it, the curving rails, which the rushing train barely\r\n          seems to touch. They vibrate with an eerie, dulcimer HUM.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Colter hasn't moved. By his side he sees a canvas MESSENGER\r\n          BAG. Is that his?\r\n          Tentatively, he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside. A\r\n          red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather\r\n          NAME TAG reads: \"SEAN FENTRESS.\"\u009d\r\n          It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is\r\n          starting to freak him out.\r\n          He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with\r\n          a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE.\r\n          CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of\r\n          soda.\r\n          Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late\r\n          twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits\r\n          around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail\r\n          polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button-\r\n          down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and-\r\n          bones cufflinks. She's busy writing in a journal.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Ma'am?\r\n          Nothing.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Excuse me... ma'am?\r\n          She looks up. Blank stare.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          What is this?\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          What's what?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Where am I?\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          (looks out the window)\r\n          Almost at Newark.\r\n          Goes back to her journal.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          What's Newark? A city?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          It's more of a hell hole.\r\n          But Colter still doesn't understand. He gets up. Nausea\r\n          slams into him. He hangs on to the seat.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Woah.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          I think I'm going to puke.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          (gestures, alarmed)\r\n          Okay, bathroom's that way.\r\n          Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Go. Seriously.\r\n          Colter eases himself into the aisle. Totters down the length\r\n          of the car until he finds the RESTROOM.\r\n          The door is LOCKED. The latch reads \"OCCUPIED.\"\u009d\r\n          Bracing himself, he lurches forward into...\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN - SECOND CAR - MORNING\r\n\r\n          He freezes. It's a mirror image of the first car. But no,\r\n          the passengers are different.\r\n          Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom,\r\n          he instead opens it to find a CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT. A\r\n          cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors.\r\n\r\n                         CONDUCTOR\r\n          Ticket?\r\n          A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of\r\n          keys. Colter just stares at him. Dazed.\r\n\r\n                         CONDUCTOR\r\n          May I see your ticket?\r\n          The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his\r\n          pockets.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I don't think I...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n\r\n                         CONDUCTOR\r\n          Have to write you up then.\r\n          He pulls out a citation pad.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Is this...?\r\n          From inside his sports coat he pulls out a TRAIN TICKET. The\r\n          conductor snips his ticket and brushes past.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Wait a sec. I'm a little out of it\r\n          here. Where's this train headed?\r\n\r\n                         CONDUCTOR\r\n          New York. Penn Station.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          New York?\r\n          Why would he be going to New York? How can this be\r\n          happening? Fear starts to grip him as the hallucination\r\n          simply continues.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Do you know where I got on?\r\n          The conductor examines his ticket again.\r\n\r\n                         CONDUCTOR\r\n          Princeton Junction.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Where's that?\r\n\r\n                         CONDUCTOR\r\n          \"\u0098Bout ten minutes back.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          But I've never been to Princeton\r\n          Junction. See... I don't remember\r\n          waking up or buying a ticket or\r\n          getting on the train or anything\r\n          else. It's just a blank.\r\n\r\n                         CONDUCTOR\r\n          Lucky you.\r\n          The jaded conductor moves on. Colter is alone with his\r\n          confusion. Takes a deep breath. The nausea has eased\r\n          slightly.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Okay. You're gonna figure this\r\n          out.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN - FIRST CAR - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Entering the first car again. The rows of passengers. Must\r\n          be at least forty people.\r\n          As he walks back up the aisle, he looks from face to face:\r\n          A pale COMPUTER ENGINEER reviews some documents.\r\n          A forty-something SECRETARY does a crossword puzzle.\r\n          DEREK, a stock broker type, talks on his cell phone:\r\n\r\n                         DEREK\r\n          Trust me, by one o'clock, the\r\n          bridge is going to be jammed...\r\n          A COLLEGE STUDENT, slumped against a window, eyes shut,\r\n          listens to an MP-3 player.\r\n          An OLD MAN with a faded wool suit clutches a cane.\r\n          A BACKPACKER, female, European, 20s, hiking boots, examines a\r\n          guidebook.\r\n          A dowdy OFFICER MANAGER type sorts supermarket coupons into a\r\n          tabbed file box.\r\n          An African American EXECUTIVE reads a newspaper.\r\n          None of them pays any attention to Colter.\r\n          A WHOOSH of AIR -- he turns to\r\n          An AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. The HISS of AIR sound sinister.\r\n          Like the exhalations of a creature.\r\n          A SCRAPE. He looks to see\r\n          A woman FILING HER NAILS.\r\n          Colter cringes. Every detail, every sensory impression seems\r\n          heightened, near the point of overload.\r\n          He reaches Christina again. Eases back in the seat across\r\n          from her. She writes in her journal, ignoring him.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          6.\r\n          There's something else in his sports coat. A WALLET. He\r\n          turns it over a few times, inspecting it. Pulls out a\r\n          DRIVER'S LICENSE. Another man's face is in the photo. The\r\n          name on the license reads: \"SEAN FENTRESS.\"\u009d The same name as\r\n          on the messenger bag. The street address on the license\r\n          reads: \"58 Alexander Road, Princeton Junction, New Jersey.\"\u009d\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Sean Fentress? Who the hell's\r\n          that?\r\n          And why does he have this guy's wallet? He leans forward to\r\n          speak with Christina again.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Ma'am?\r\n          She lowers her journal, annoyed. We see she hasn't been\r\n          writing but DRAWING. A well-executed sketch of a face.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Why do you keep calling me ma'am?\r\n          How old do you think I am, anyway?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I'm having a little problem here.\r\n          I'm trying not to freak out, but I\r\n          think something's happened to me.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Like what?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Like, total memory loss. Complete.\r\n          I don't know how I got here.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          So you drank too much last night.\r\n          So did I. Unfortunately, I\r\n          remember the whole thing.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          That's not it. See... I'm a pilot.\r\n          I fly helicopters in Iraq. I'm in\r\n          the army.\r\n          She waits for more. As if he's telling a joke.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I was on a mission. Right before I\r\n          woke up here I was in the middle of\r\n          a mission...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          7.\r\n          Wavering. Unsure of himself. His memories.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Boy, you really did drink a lot\r\n          last night.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I'm telling you the truth.\r\n\r\n          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          Now approaching Newark Station.\r\n          Newark Station, next stop.\r\n          The train begins to SLOW DOWN. A few people begin to get up.\r\n          The platform of Newark Station slides into view.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          These aren't my clothes. And this\r\n          wallet here...\r\n          He holds up the driver's license. One final attempt to\r\n          convince her.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          You see this? This isn't me.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Of course it is.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Take a look in the mirror, good\r\n          sir.\r\n          The mirror? She goes back to her sketchbook. Determined not\r\n          to be interrupted again. Anxiety ripples through Colter.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          This can't be happening.\r\n          The train lurches to a stop.\r\n\r\n          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          Newark Station.\r\n          Colter gets up. Through the windows, a few passengers\r\n          disembark onto the platform: Derek, the Old Man, the College\r\n          Kid and GUZMAN, a Middle Eastern man, who HURRIES past all of\r\n          them towards the station building.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          8.\r\n          Colter only half notices all this. He's intent on reaching\r\n          the train's BATHROOM, the door of which is now OPEN.\r\n\r\n          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          All aboard. Doors are closing.\r\n          Christina watches Colter go. Curious.\r\n\r\n          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          This is a New York bound train.\r\n          Next stop, New York - Penn Station.\r\n          The train begins MOVING. Colter reaches the bathroom.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          A fluorescent light flutters on as Colter shuts the door.\r\n          He's in a tiny space with prefab restroom fixtures in\r\n          stainless steel.\r\n          He SHOUTS in surprise. Recoils backwards. Eyes locked on\r\n\r\n                         THE MIRROR\r\n          Staring back is SEAN FENTRESS'S FACE. Not his own.\r\n          He's frozen there. Heart pounding. Seized by cosmic panic.\r\n          He SLAPS himself in the face.

Desperate for it all to end.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Christina's holding Colter's messenger bag. She talks\r\n          through the closed door.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          You left your bag on the seat.\r\n          Which is a flagrant violation of\r\n          rail security, leaving a suspicious\r\n          package behind and all that.

TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Colter stares into the mirror at the stranger's face.\r\n          Practically catatonic at this point.

A blur and a\r\n          whoosh, and it's gone.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          On the verge of opening the door, Colter hears a METALLIC\r\n          RATTLING. Two SCREWS are rattling around in the sink.\r\n          Colter picks up a screw. Turns it over and over in his hand.\r\n          What are they doing in the sink?\r\n          He looks UP.\r\n          An overhead VENTILATION PANEL has been PRIED OPEN. Above it\r\n          is the darkness of a CRAWL SPACE.\r\n          Something is sitting up there.\r\n          From outside comes a TRAIN HORN.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Through the windows, a FREIGHT TRAIN is passing the other\r\n          way. A moving wall of metal boxcars and liquid tankers.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Colter looks up into the crawl space. Can't quite see the\r\n          object up there.\r\n          Moving carefully in the tiny space, he stands up on the\r\n          toilet. Grabbing onto the ventilation panel, he WRENCHES IT\r\n          all the way open. Then PULLS himself uncomfortably upward.\r\n          On tip-toes, he looks into crawl space and discovers\r\n\r\n          A MASSIVE BOMB\r\n          It's an enormous device. Several large CANNISTERS tied\r\n          together, full of sloshing liquid. Barely discernible behind\r\n          wires and gaffing tape is CELL PHONE -- the bomb's detonator.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Jesus.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          11.\r\n          Running footsteps from outside. Commotion. An ALARM sounds.\r\n\r\n          THE BOMB'S CELL PHONE RINGS -- THE DEVICE'S CIRCUIT CLOSES --\r\n\r\n          THE BOMB EXPLODES IN COLTER'S FACE WITH A HUGE AND DEAFENING\r\n\r\n          FORCE, INSTANTLY KILLING HIM.\r\n\r\n          INT.

TRAIN TRACKS - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Fuel lines explode in the other cars in a horrendous chain\r\n          reaction. The fire is spectacularly bright, lighting up the\r\n          windows of the rowhouse apartments facing the tracks.\r\n          Nearby TREES INCINERATE, mere matchsticks amid sheets of\r\n          flames.\r\n          On the rowhouses, a ALUMINUM DOOR MOLDINGS begin to MELT in\r\n          the intense heat.\r\n          One of the FREIGHT CARS, loaded down with coal, shuddering\r\n          from the blast, wobbles a few yards then PITCHES OVER --\r\n          ROLLING off the rails, tipping right off the elevated\r\n          tracks...\r\n          It FALLS through the air and SMASHES into the middle of an\r\n          traffic intersection below with a shattering force.\r\n          The cascade of EXPLOSIONS continues. Large portions of BOTH\r\n          TRAINS are ANNIHILATED, while the heat reduces the heavy-\r\n          gauge steel rails back to elemental, molten ore.\r\n          And then...\r\n          An odd sound, like a BALLOON loosing air or MACHINERY winding\r\n          down as we\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n          BRILLIANT WHITE. All sounds cease.\r\n          For exactly 1/3 OF A SECOND, a mysterious PATTERN OF LINES\r\n          appears. Like METAL RODS, maybe. RADIATING OUTWARDS. It\r\n          makes no sense.

NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          The doors slide open.\r\n\r\n          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          Newark Station.\r\n          The Old Man, Derek and the College Kid get off. Guzman\r\n          hurries past them towards the station house.\r\n\r\n          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          All aboard. Doors are closing.\r\n          Just before the doors close, Colter steps out onto the\r\n          platform. Eyes locked on Guzman -- who disappears inside the\r\n          station house.\r\n          The train PULLS OFF, leaving Colter behind. Did he make the\r\n          right move?\r\n          As he goes to pursue Guzman, Colter is struck by more sensory\r\n\r\n                         IMPRESSIONS:\r\n          The STATION CLOCK. Its digital numerals flash 7:50 a.m.,\r\n          hurting Colter's eyes with their brightness.\r\n          The dying HISS of the rails as the train recedes down the\r\n          track.\r\n          The super-sharp glint of a PENNY embedded down in the gravel\r\n          of the tracks.\r\n          The melancholy SIGH of trees in the wind.\r\n          Pushing it all aside, he hurries after Guzman.\r\n\r\n          INT. NEWARK STATION HOUSE - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Entering, Colter stops. There's no sign of Guzman. Just an\r\n          empty marble lobby. A lone CLERK restocks timetable\r\n          brochures at a display.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          25.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          A guy just came through here. Did\r\n          you see where he went?\r\n\r\n                         CLERK\r\n          (not looking up)\r\n          Lots of guys come through here.\r\n          Windows look out over the station's parking lot. There's no\r\n          sign of Guzman out there.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          He was just here. A Middle Eastern-\r\n          looking guy.\r\n          Through the platform doors comes Derek, followed by the\r\n          College Kid. Derek heads for the parking lot, while the\r\n          College Kid mills around the newspaper stand.\r\n          A muffled COUGH.\r\n          Colter spins. Sees a door marked \"MEN'S ROOM.\"\u009d\r\n\r\n          INT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Pushing open the door, Colter discovers a row of 1930's-era\r\n          sinks and stalls. An intercom crackles to life:\r\n\r\n          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          The train to Philadelphia will be\r\n          four minutes late... The train to\r\n          Philadelphia will be four minutes\r\n          late...\r\n          Colter's footsteps echo down the length of the deserted men's\r\n          room. The last stall door is SHUT.\r\n          From within the closed stall, comes the sound of VOMITING.\r\n          Colter edges closer.\r\n          A toilet FLUSHES. Guzman emerges from the stall. Looks\r\n          awful. Freezes when he sees Colter.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          All better now?\r\n          Guzman's face hardens. He goes to the sink to wash his\r\n          hands.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Don't much care for trains myself.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          26.\r\n          The bathroom mirror, of course, reflects back Sean Fentress's\r\n          face, not Colter's. Guzman does not seem to notice this\r\n          disparity. He picks up his briefcase and briskly walks out.\r\n          Colter takes an uneasy look at Fentress looking back at him\r\n          in the mirror, then follows Guzman out.\r\n\r\n          INT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Colter emerges in the lobby. Guzman is nearby. A bit\r\n          indecisive. Colter wanders over to the newspaper stand.\r\n          The STATION CLOCK reads 7:54 a.m.\r\n          Colter looks down at HIS WATCH: THREE MINUTES remaining.\r\n          What will Guzman do?\r\n          Guzman glances over at Colter, then heads through the doors\r\n          and back out on the train platform.\r\n\r\n          EXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Guzman sits on a bench. Colter stops nearby him.\r\n\r\n                         GUZMAN\r\n          I resent this. This is harassment.\r\n          You obviously work for someone.\r\n\r\n          FBI. CIA.\r\n\r\n                         (BITTER)\r\n          I expected this reception in your\r\n          country.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          How are you going to pull this off?\r\n          That bomb has a cell phone\r\n          detonator. And I don't see a pay\r\n          phone around here. So I'm betting\r\n          you got a phone on you with the\r\n          number already programmed in.\r\n\r\n                         GUZMAN\r\n          I have no idea what you're talking\r\n          about. I am an international\r\n          business man. An executive.\r\n          The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN\r\n          of an EXPRESS TRAIN approaching.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Open your briefcase. Prove to me\r\n          there's no phone in there.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          27.\r\n\r\n                         GUZMAN\r\n\r\n                         (STANDS UP)\r\n          I will prove nothing to you. Leave\r\n          me alone.\r\n          WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending\r\n          Guzman sprawling to the ground.\r\n          Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The\r\n          simulation's reality stuns Colter all over again.\r\n          Crouching down, Colter pops open Guzman's briefcase. Inside\r\n          is a corporate IDENTIFICATION BADGE with Guzman's name and\r\n          photograph on it. The company is Shell Oil.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n\r\n                         (READING)\r\n          \"Hasnan Guzman, Vice President,\r\n          Shell Oil.\"\u009d Must be a cover.\r\n\r\n          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          Philadelphia train now approaching.\r\n          Guzman groans in pain. Colter rifles through his briefcase.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Where the hell's your phone?\r\n          Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS.\r\n          Grabbing Guzman, Colter goes through his suit pockets. He\r\n          triumphantly pulls out GUZMAN'S CELL PHONE and steps back.\r\n          Guzman looks up at him, eyes moist with humiliation and\r\n          malice.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I thought so. Now let's see you\r\n          try to --\r\n          A distant THUD rattles the station windows. Colter pivots,\r\n          looks down the tracks. The first thing he sees is\r\n\r\n          THE EXPRESS TRAIN\r\n          Closing in on the station.\r\n          The second thing he sees, far beyond it, miles further down\r\n          the tracks, is the RISING PLUME of a HUGE EXPLOSION.\r\n          Colter looks back at Guzman in shock. Then down at Guzman's\r\n          cell phone. Which has remained off.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          28.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          You didn't do it.\r\n          Disbelief. As the din of the distant explosion is drowned\r\n          out by the ROAR of\r\n\r\n          THE ARRIVING EXPRESS TRAIN\r\n          With a cry of rage Guzman SPRINGS UP and PUSHES COLTER INTO\r\n          THE PATH OF THE ON-COMING EXPRESS TRAIN -- with a blast of\r\n          its horn, THE TRAIN RUNS HIM OVER.\r\n          Everything stops.\r\n          Like film celluloid catching fire in a projector, the world\r\n          itself BLISTERS AND BURNS INTO SEARING WHITE... into\r\n          smothering, forgetful SILENCE...\r\n          For exactly 2/3 of a second (1/3 of a second longer than\r\n          before), the same flickering after-image appears:\r\n\r\n          THIN LINES -- RADIATING OUTWARD --\r\n          This time they all connect into\r\n\r\n          THE SPOKES OF A WHEEL. A BICYCLE WHEEL.\r\n\r\n          INT. ISOLATION UNIT\r\n\r\n          The SOUND of MACHINERY STRAINING. Colter is SLAMMED back\r\n          into his seat -- back in the capsule. All he can do is hang\r\n          on and gasp for air.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Holy fuck!\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          Stabilize. Lower your pulse.\r\n          Colter opens his eyes. He's back in his military flight\r\n          suit.\r\n          The craft goes still. Cautiously, he releases his hands from\r\n          their grip on the seat restraints. He looks like he's\r\n          sweated off five pounds.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          Do you need to urinate?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          A fucking train just ran over me.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          29.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          Do you need to urinate?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          How are you doing this?

Derek, Guzman, the Old Man and the\r\n          College Kid head towards the exit doors.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n\r\n                         (STAGE WHISPER)\r\n          He's getting away...!\r\n          Colter moves aside to let them walk past.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n\r\n                         (CURT DISMISSAL)\r\n          Thanks for your help, ma'am.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Ma'am? How old do you think I am?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I don't know. Thirty two?\r\n          Her icy glare tells him he's guessed too high.\r\n\r\n          EXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING\r\n\r\n          The disembarking passengers exit the platform.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          The train is moving again. In the exit area, Colter watches\r\n          the station disappear. He's doing this all wrong.\r\n\r\n          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          Next stop New York Penn Station.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          39.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          The two screws rattle in the sink. Colter gazes up at the\r\n          half-opened ventilation shaft -- and at the edge of the\r\n          sinister bomb planted there.\r\n          Back down to the mirror. Sean Fentress's face. The most\r\n          baffling mystery of all.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          What happened, Fentress? Who are\r\n          you? How can I be you?\r\n          FLASHCUT -- Back in the isolation unit. On the monitor, the\r\n          glimpse of Goodwin's SHOULDER PATCH INSIGNIA. The unit\r\n          initials \"CAOC-N.\"\u009d\r\n          Back to scene. Colter churning over the thought.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          \"CAOC-N.\"\u009d What unit is that?\r\n          A KNOCK on the door.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Through the windows comes the blur of the EXPRESS TRAIN\r\n          whizzing past (the same train which previously ran over\r\n          Colter).\r\n          Emerging from the bathroom, Colter discovers Christina there.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Who were you talking to?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Leave me alone.\r\n          Colter walks off. Irked at his change in tone, she follows\r\n          him, carrying his messenger bag.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          My pleasure, okay? It's just that\r\n          you left your bag on your seat.\r\n          (trying to be cute)\r\n          It's a flagrant violation of rail\r\n          security, leaving a suspicious\r\n          package behind and all that. Maybe\r\n          you're the terrorist.\r\n          This is too much. Colter turns on her. Paranoid.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          40.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Terrorist? Why did you say that?\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          I was joking.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Stop joking. Who are you? Are you\r\n          an operative?\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          I had no idea you were so\r\n          thoroughly weird. I'm not entirely\r\n          sure I like it.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Why do you have sketches of\r\n          everybody on board? Are you part\r\n          of this?\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Part of what?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I can have you arrested. Maybe\r\n          that's the only way you'll drop the\r\n          bullshit and talk. Stay put. I'm\r\n          getting help.\r\n          She sees he's serious and drops her arch playfulness. Speaks\r\n          in a flat, sober voice.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Who am I? I'll tell you. I'm\r\n          twenty seven years old. I have no\r\n          savings and no health insurance.\r\n          He turns back. Waits. The more she speaks, the angrier she\r\n          gets.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Six months ago I moved back in with\r\n          my parents because I ran out of\r\n          money. I got A's in line drawing\r\n          and advanced oil painting but no\r\n          one's buying my stuff. Two weeks\r\n          ago I put away all my paints. My\r\n          little sketch book is the last\r\n          thing left. You see, I'm not a\r\n          artist. I'm a receptionist in a\r\n          law firm. The only thing I operate\r\n          is a phone switchboard.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          41.\r\n          The stark reality of her life.\r\n          The HORN of the FREIGHT TRAIN yanks his attention to the\r\n          windows. Up ahead are the row houses opposite which the\r\n          train exploded. Time is running down.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Now let me tell you about you. You\r\n          work at the New York Public\r\n          Library. You've been eyeing me for\r\n          months on this train but haven't\r\n          said a word to me. You're bland\r\n          and colorless and predictable. And\r\n          now I see you're delusional, too.\r\n          Colter doesn't hear her. He's still looking out the window.\r\n\r\n          COLTER'S POV\r\n          Above the row houses, a COMMERCIAL AIRLINER is climbing\r\n          serenely into the blue after take-off out of Newark Airport.\r\n          The view is wiped away as the FREIGHT TRAIN comes surging\r\n          past the windows. But the sight of the plane has already\r\n          caused something to click in Colter's head.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Son of a bitch. \"CAOC-N.\"\u009d That's\r\n          not army. That's Air Force.\r\n          Combined Air and Space Operations\r\n          Center. Nellis Air Force Base!\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Are you mocking me?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          They're running this whole thing\r\n          out of Nellis Air Force Base in\r\n          Nevada. Fucking Nevada!\r\n          Tears in Christina's eyes. That Colter would persist in this\r\n          delusion after what she's confessed about herself.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          (racking his brain)\r\n          What's there? What's on that base?\r\n          B-52s. KC tankers. Air Combat\r\n          Command. Predator Drones. Remote\r\n          operations.\r\n          (something to this)\r\n          This a remote operation.\r\n\r\n                         (FINALLY)\r\n          What if it is time travel?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          42.\r\n          A worried CONDUCTOR runs past them, talking rapidly into his\r\n          radio. We catch the words \"bomb threat.\"\u009d\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          What did he say?\r\n          A WARNING ALARM begins beeping. Passengers look around\r\n          uneasily. Christina, however, focuses her anger on Colter.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Do me a favor. Don't ever talk to\r\n          me again.\r\n          She drops his messenger bag at his feet and walks away.\r\n          Colter looks down at his watch. THE LAST SECONDS TICK AWAY --\r\n\r\n          5... 4... 3...\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Christina!\r\n          He grabs her -- she struggles against him --\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Get off me!\r\n          But he HOLDS HER TIGHT, shielding her with his body and\r\n          squeezing his eyes shut as --\r\n\r\n          THE EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE TRAIN -- EVERYTHING VAPORIZES.\r\n          Blinding light. Painful to look at.\r\n          Like a star exploding.\r\n          A dull, hollow sound of WIND rattling through an abyss.\r\n          And then the ghostly still life. Details flicker into view:\r\n          A bicycle. A stone wall. And next to it...\r\n          A woman.\r\n          It's Christina. Turning to look at us. A gentle, reassuring\r\n          smile.\r\n\r\n          INT. ISOLATION UNIT\r\n\r\n          Click -- click. Click -- click. The video monitor is\r\n          malfunctioning. It flickers on and off, revealing Colter's\r\n          face in and out of darkness.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          43.\r\n          The capsule is nearly shut down. The controls appear non-\r\n          functional. Ice crystals have formed over the circuitry.\r\n          Colter hugs himself, shivering. His breath is visible in the\r\n          capsule's tomb-like cold.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Goodwin? What's happening? Come\r\n          in. Can you read me? It's goddamn\r\n          cold in here.\r\n          He hits a few buttons. Almost at random. The VENTS which\r\n          had been blowing in air FALL SILENT.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Goodwin, I'm losing oxygen.\r\n          The monitor fizzles out. The light from the controls FADES.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Goodwin!\r\n          It's now COMPLETELY DARK.\r\n          He BANGS on the side of the capsule. Just a muffled thump.\r\n          A terrifying silence.\r\n          The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to\r\n          the floor of the capsule. Cursing. Some sounds of thrashing\r\n          around. Then...\r\n          The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's\r\n          activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit. It\r\n          begins to BLINK. Like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in\r\n          the sea. It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule.\r\n          Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the EXIT\r\n          HATCH. Using all his strength he TURNS...\r\n          But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed.\r\n          He gets to his feet. Can't stand up fully. The capsule is\r\n          incredibly cramped.\r\n          Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS\r\n          in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS.\r\n          He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he\r\n          BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the\r\n          hull.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          44.\r\n          So, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft.\r\n          At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry.\r\n          Daunted by the complexity.\r\n          There's no time to lose. Using a miniature screw driver, he\r\n          begins unscrewing the monitor panel. His fingers are slow\r\n          and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out\r\n          of his hands.\r\n\r\n                         LATER\r\n          Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents. Colter, ice\r\n          crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently. Much of\r\n          the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed.\r\n          Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of\r\n          BATTERIES. They spark once... twice... Nothing.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Come on!\r\n          Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke.\r\n          He's burned his fingers.\r\n          But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT.\r\n          Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads\r\n          on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint\r\n          electric HUM.\r\n          FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws\r\n          the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the\r\n          craft.\r\n          Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does,\r\n          a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on:\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          -- four principle dialects of\r\n          Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-\r\n          Lebanese and North African. We\r\n          will now play you portions of each,\r\n          discussing the audible differences\r\n          between them.\r\n          CLIPS of SPOKEN ARABIC begin to play.\r\n          Colter continues reconstituting the computer. The monitor\r\n          fills with scrolling lines of COMPUTER CODE.\r\n          With an oddly low-tech CLANG, the heart of the machine\r\n          reawakens. The air vents come back to life. Heat starts to\r\n          return. The icicles begin to DRIP.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          45.\r\n          Colter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work.\r\n          The monitor switches to a real-time view of the LAB.\r\n          Goodwin's chair is there, but Goodwin is not in sight. In a\r\n          background distorted by the FISH-EYE LENS, various\r\n          technicians wander by.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Hello? Anyone out there? It's me.\r\n          He toggles an audio jack. Then a MAN comes walking up.\r\n          Frowns into the camera, as if through the foggy lens of\r\n          another world.\r\n          It's the MAN WITH THE PIPE. The elusive Bohemian scientist\r\n          whom Colter glimpsed once before. He will be known as\r\n\r\n          RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Can you hear me?\r\n          Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for\r\n          a moment as he adjusts it. Then puts on a headset.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Project designer initiating\r\n          sequence and drives check.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I'm here! I'm okay!\r\n          Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Is someone there?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Yeah. It's me. Colter.\r\n          Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Wow! It's you.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          The capsule lost power. It's still\r\n          pretty cold in here.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          We've been working towards you from\r\n          the other side. Nice to have you\r\n          with us again.

And then it occurs to Colter:\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          You're the inventor of this thing.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n\r\n                         (SHRUGS)\r\n          I prefer the term project designer.\r\n          And sorry for all the secrecy.\r\n          Goodwin will be thrilled you re-\r\n          established contact.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I don't want to deal with Goodwin\r\n          anymore.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Don't you understand? He's\r\n          torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't\r\n          you get me out of here?\r\n          Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to\r\n          deal with personnel issues.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Why would Goodwin have it in for\r\n          you?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          47.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          He's a remote operator. And remote\r\n          operators are risk averse pussies\r\n          who sit at control screens in the\r\n          rear while actual pilots like me\r\n          put their asses on the line in the\r\n          field.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          He seems pretty devoted to the\r\n          mission.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          And just what kind of mission is\r\n          this? Talk to me, man. Why won't\r\n          he let me save those people on the\r\n          train?\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Because they can't be saved.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Why not? I know what's going to\r\n          happen. I could take apart the\r\n          bomb. Stop the train.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Yeah but you'd be doing it in the\r\n          Source Code, not here. Not in our\r\n          own past.\r\n          Mystery upon mystery.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          What's the difference?\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          I'm not sure I should be telling\r\n          you this.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Telling me what?\r\n          Coaxing the scientist in him.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          It's quantum physics. Linear\r\n          algebra. Parabolic calculus. It\r\n          would take weeks to explain.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Is Source Code time travel?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          48.\r\n          Rutledge sighs. Looks at his pipe.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          It's gone out again.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Why can't I save those people on\r\n          the train?\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Think of it like this: events in\r\n          our past can never be undone.\r\n          Einstein proved that.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          So...\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          So Source Code opens up another\r\n          past for you. A parallel past. It\r\n          looks the same but it has no\r\n          intersection with our own world.\r\n          In essence, by sending you back, an\r\n          entirely new but utterly parallel\r\n          world is created. It looks\r\n          identical to ours, but nothing you\r\n          do there has any effect on this\r\n          reality.\r\n          At last some useful information. Colter races to process it.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          What happens to the Source Code\r\n          world after I leave it?\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          I don't know. You can never know\r\n          that because you're not there to\r\n          observe it. Maybe it vanishes.\r\n          Maybe not.\r\n\r\n                         (UNEASY)\r\n          I should tell them you're okay.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          What about the bicycle?\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          What bicycle?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I see it each time. Right after\r\n          the bomb goes off.

It's a girl from the\r\n          train. I don't know where any of\r\n          it is supposed to be, but --\r\n          Rutledge removes the pipe from his mouth.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Wait. You see all this after you\r\n          leave the train?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Yeah. Just for a split second.\r\n          Rutledge is stunned. Like he's discovered some strange new\r\n          property to his invention.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Please tell me you're not making\r\n          this up.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          No. It's there. What do you think\r\n          it means?\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          I don't know.\r\n          Rutledge looks off camera for a moment.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          They're here.

Goodwin\r\n          settles back into his seat, donning the headset.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          Welcome back. How are you feeling?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I'm alive.

A\r\n          fucking brick wall.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          Lower your pulse. The situation\r\n          has worsened. The fire on the\r\n          tracks caused one of the freight\r\n          cars to blow up and release some\r\n          kind of gas. As a precaution\r\n          they're having to evacuate all of\r\n          lower Manhattan.\r\n          Evacuate lower Manhattan? The enormity of this.

Let me think\r\n          for a second.\r\n          But Goodwin ignores him. Absorbed in paperwork.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          The freight car blows up from the\r\n          fire. It spews gas, or what could\r\n          be gas -- it might be chlorine, so\r\n          they can't take any chances.\r\n          Anxious now. Trying to make up lost ground.

The glint of a polished\r\n          leather shoe. The crisp click of someone uncapping a\r\n          fountain pen. The scenery rushing by -- the blur of trees,\r\n          the soft lavender of the morning sky. The swell and pull of\r\n          the mighty machine coursing over the rails.\r\n          If a train ride could ever be a sensory delight, this is it.\r\n          To Colter, every sensation has become even more pronounced,\r\n          more intensely real than ever.\r\n          CLOSE ON - HIS WATCH - A beep as he sets it to countdown\r\n          again from seventeen minutes.

The\r\n          neighborhoods have given way to Newark's industrial fringe.\r\n          Bringing him closer to the inevitable end.\r\n\r\n          CHRISTINA (V.O.)\r\n          I have a friend.\r\n          Surprised, he turns to find her there.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          She works at the New York Times.\r\n          Her name's Stephanie. She's just a\r\n          proofreader, but she wants to be\r\n          made a reporter. She's always\r\n          saying she needs a good story to\r\n          bring in so she gets noticed.\r\n          Something like this, with a crazy\r\n          paranoid angle could really\r\n          interest her.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Forget it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          62.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          She could do some poking around.\r\n          She's already quite suspicious of\r\n          the government.\r\n          Christina's dialing her phone.

You know\r\n          that story you're always looking to\r\n          write? I might just have something\r\n          for you. I met a guy. His name is\r\n          Colter Stevens. He says he's in\r\n          the army. He flies helicopters in\r\n          Iraq, but now they've put him into\r\n          a secret project called Source\r\n          Code. Maybe you can look into it a\r\n          bit, okay? Call me.\r\n          She hangs up. Pleased with herself.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          She'll call back. Just wait.\r\n          None of it will do Colter any good, but he manages a smile.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Thank you, ma'am.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHS)\r\n          Ma'am?

TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Colter enters the tiny space. Christina is reluctant to\r\n          follow him into the bathroom.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          You said you wanted to know.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Can't you just tell me?\r\n          He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in\r\n          next to him.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Try anything and I'll kill you.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Shut the door.\r\n          As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          What are you doing?\r\n          He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          It's up here.\r\n          He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the\r\n          sink. She's not quite tall enough to see into the\r\n          crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest\r\n          of the way.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          (startled, feels his hands\r\n\r\n                         ON HER)\r\n          What are you --\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Just look.\r\n          Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat\r\n          as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          64.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Is that...?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Acetone Peroxide. It's a liquid\r\n          explosive. There's fourteen\r\n          cannisters of it. Simple\r\n          detonator. Cell phone signal\r\n          closes the circuit and boom.\r\n          He lowers her. An incredulous beat.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Did you put this here?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          No. It was someone else.

TRAIN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          The bathroom door opens and Christina walks quickly away.\r\n          Mounting fear. Colter falls into step behind her.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          It won't matter.

This train's\r\n          already been blown up.\r\n          She backs up. Scared of him. Every right to be.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          You wanted to know.

I've got to\r\n          get off.\r\n          Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule. She's\r\n          stabbing at the door release button.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          Why won't it open?!\r\n          Her phone is RINGS. They both stop.

Recognizes the terrain. Looks down at\r\n\r\n          HIS WATCH --\r\n\r\n          50 SECONDS.\r\n          It's awful. Unbearable. He dashes towards the bathroom --\r\n\r\n          INT.

Jumps up on the sink.\r\n\r\n                         THE BOMB\r\n          Sits in the semi-darkness, faintly illuminated by the\r\n          bathroom's fluorescent light. As he grabs hold of the bomb,\r\n          he hears --\r\n\r\n          CHRISTINA (O.S.)\r\n          Colter...?\r\n          Working fast, he unhooks the leads on the detonator, rips\r\n          away gaffing tape -- jostling the cannisters of explosives --\r\n\r\n          CHRISTINA (O.S.)\r\n          Colter, I have to tell you\r\n          something.\r\n          -- and pulls off the detonator cell phone.

What does that mean?\r\n          She stops.

Colter's eyes light up in\r\n          amazement -- the DISPLAY SCREEN is showing the name and\r\n          number of the bomber. But before he can read what's there,\r\n          Christina's voice finds its way to the back of his brain:\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          According to the notice, you were\r\n          killed in action two months ago.\r\n          The world stops.\r\n          A SEARING PAIN SLAMS INTO him.

The grumble of another,\r\n          unseen wounded soldier:\r\n\r\n          SOLDIER (O.S.)\r\n          Never any damn leg room on a plane.\r\n          An ALARM begins beeping.\r\n\r\n          FLIGHT MEDIC (O.S.)\r\n          Hey, this guy's crashing...\r\n\r\n          FADE TO BLACK.\r\n          Silence and darkness.

The Jack of Clubs.\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          Captain...?\r\n          The playing card flickers, separates into pixels, then\r\n          dissolves.\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          Captain, allow me to introduce\r\n          myself.

A blinking\r\n          cursor.\r\n\r\n          FADE TO BLACK.\r\n          A tiny APERTURE opens... revealing CHRISTINA. And the\r\n          bicycle. And the stone wall. The strange, recurring vision.\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          Captain?\r\n          The sound drives away the image, replacing it with\r\n\r\n          THE JACK OF CLUBS\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          Captain, just tell me what you see.\r\n          Just look and speak.\r\n          Groggy breathing.

ISOLATION UNIT\r\n\r\n          On Colter's face. A deep, cold knot in his stomach.\r\n          Shuddering in fear. The truth before him now. Crouching\r\n          there, a nightmare, ruling over him.\r\n          On the MONITOR, Goodwin looks into the camera. Assessing the\r\n          situation.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          69.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          Are you comfortable?

Impatient. He flips\r\n          a switch. A blocky COMPUTER VOICE, something out of the\r\n          1970s, comes on:\r\n\r\n          COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)\r\n          Hearing Test.

We've traced\r\n          it to central Asia.\r\n\r\n          ON THE MONITOR\r\n          A grainy VIDEO shows an arid, wind-swept plateau of a far-\r\n          away desert. It is twilight. A MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER, his face\r\n          hidden by a hooded cloak, sits cross legged before a\r\n          flickering camp fire and a tea service.\r\n          The fighter rises, picks up a rocket-propelled grenade\r\n          launcher, and approaches the camera. The wind whips his\r\n          black robes. The figure looks slight. Almost spectral. It\r\n          begins speaking to the camera.\r\n\r\n                         MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER\r\n          (on camera, in accented\r\n\r\n                         ENGLISH)\r\n          By now you have suffered a taste of\r\n          divine vengeance. God willing, you\r\n          will soon suffer another.\r\n          Colter does not raise his head. No idea whether he's even\r\n          listening.\r\n\r\n                         MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER\r\n          These attacks will show you that\r\n          you will never be safe. You can\r\n          secure your borders. But what can\r\n          you do against one of your own\r\n          citizens? One who looks like you,\r\n          who is blameless, living already\r\n          among you, who takes eighty million\r\n          of our dollars, a trifle, and\r\n          carries out our bidding? You\r\n          cannot stop this. Time has run\r\n          out.\r\n          The image freezes. Then switches back to the live feed of\r\n          Goodwin.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Let me talk to Rutledge.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          So you've decided to speak.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Rutledge.

Continues making notations.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          Frankly, Captain, we're\r\n          disappointed.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Find Rutledge! Now!\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          I have to say that we expected more\r\n          from you.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Stop! Stop reading from your\r\n          goddamn script!\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          Perhaps we overestimated your\r\n          abilities.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I swear to fucking Christ!\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          Please accept the criticism in the\r\n          spirit it was given. Perhaps a few\r\n          memory exercises would help.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I don't need your criticism and I\r\n          don't need your memory exercises,\r\n          you gutless freak. And by the way,\r\n          that bomb is detonated by a cell\r\n          phone. When activated, the phone's\r\n          display screen displays caller ID\r\n          information. Caller ID. I wonder\r\n          if that information would be useful\r\n          to Beleaguered Castle.\r\n          For a split second, Goodwin looks thrown. But the mask of\r\n          the cold clinician goes back up.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          72.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          Very well. We're ready for that\r\n          information.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          You'll have to send me back. I\r\n          didn't get a good look at it. But\r\n          I will next time.\r\n          Goodwin hesitates. Skeptical.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          What assurance do we have you'll be\r\n          able to read the screen before the\r\n          device detonates?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Goodwin, there's no time left.\r\n          Send... me... back.\r\n          Goodwin's pale, inscrutable face fills the monitor. His eyes\r\n          are unblinking. Unfeeling. Nothing behind them.\r\n\r\n          INT. TRAIN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Colter prowls the aisle feverishly. He scans the overhead\r\n          luggage rack. Peeks inside a bag. Doesn't see what he\r\n          wants. He looks all around... up the rows of passengers...\r\n          intently scanning...\r\n          There. The Computer Engineer. He's asleep. But clutched in\r\n          his hand is what Colter wants -- a CELL PHONE.\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON - THE COMPUTER ENGINEER - MOMENTS LATER\r\n          The train jolts slightly, waking him up. Looking down, the\r\n          Computer Engineer notices that his cell phone has vanished.\r\n          Across the aisle, a LATINA OFFICE MANAGER taps him on the\r\n          arm. She gestures down the aisle to\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Who's walking off with the guy's cell phone.

SECOND CAR - MORNING\r\n\r\n          The Computer Engineer hurries in. Colter is nowhere in\r\n          sight. He RUNS down the aisle and towards the next car.\r\n          PAN OVER to the DOOR of the CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT as it\r\n\r\n          CLICKS SHUT.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Doors are closing.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Don't you understand? I'm in it,\r\n          Goodwin. I'm calling you from\r\n          inside the mission. Inside the\r\n          Source Code.\r\n          A beat of stunned silence. The train begins moving.\r\n\r\n          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\r\n          Next stop New York Penn Station.\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          This contact is ill-advised.

Goodbye.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          No! Wait! Don't hang up! Forget\r\n          authorization. There's no time.\r\n          Soon you're going to find out what\r\n          happened on this train. And then\r\n          your own day is going to start.\r\n          But not until then. Right now it's\r\n          just you and me talking. And\r\n          you're a different Goodwin than the\r\n          one I'm going to go back to in a\r\n          few minutes. You're separate from\r\n          him. Separate worlds. Do you\r\n          understand?\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          I think so.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Good. Now there's a lot of secrecy\r\n          in all of this, and you have your\r\n          reasons for that.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          77.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER (CONT'D)\r\n          But here and now, just this once, I\r\n          need to ask you something. And you\r\n          need to tell me the truth.\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          I'd rather you not ask me anything,\r\n          Captain.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I'm going to ask it.\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          I should terminate this call.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Jesus, Goodwin, how can I get\r\n          through to you? You're not just a\r\n          soldier. Somewhere inside you're a\r\n          human being, too. Somewhere inside\r\n          you've got to know that this is\r\n          wrong. Source Code is wrong. And\r\n          if you can't grasp that, if you\r\n          just follow orders, then you're\r\n          just as much a prisoner as I am.\r\n          The car SHUDDERS as the EXPRESS TRAIN FLASHES BY. Quiet\r\n          returns as it recedes.\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          What's your question?\r\n          Surprised, Colter raises his head. Draws a breath.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Did I survive that helicopter crash\r\n          in Iraq?\r\n          Silence. Colter shuts his eyes.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Answer me. Did I survive that\r\n          crash?\r\n          Another pause. This is crushing Colter.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Goodwin.\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          Not physically.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          78.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          You did not physically survive the\r\n          crash.\r\n          A terrible chill comes over Colter. He swallows. Trying to\r\n          stay brave.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Not physically? Fuck. At least\r\n          give me an answer I can understand.\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          We've kept alive certain areas of\r\n          your brain.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          But... the capsule I'm in...\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          A manifestation. Your way of\r\n          making sense of it.\r\n          This is crushing. Colter fights back terror.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          You had no right.\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          As a soldier...\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I was a soldier. Then. But now?\r\n\r\n                         (WHISPERS)\r\n          After death?\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          It was the only way.

With a record\r\n          spinning on it. All we do is lift\r\n          up the needle. The music stops.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          And then what?\r\n\r\n          GOODWIN (V.O.)\r\n          Then we wait. Until another\r\n          mission. And the needle comes down\r\n          again. You won't remember any of\r\n          this. We'll start with the playing\r\n          cards. Electronic tones. Simple\r\n          memory exercises. Bit by bit,\r\n          we'll revive your cerebral\r\n          capacities once more.\r\n          The barbarism of it.

There are fewer controls. Even less light.\r\n          A shadow world.\r\n          The monitor is blank.

People like\r\n          your father with his struggling\r\n          farm. It can discover things like\r\n          unpaid property taxes. It can call\r\n          in his equipment loans or tie him\r\n          down for years in environmental\r\n          litigation. On the other hand, it\r\n          can pay him handsomely for mineral\r\n          deposits he never knew were there.\r\n          As distant and problematic as your\r\n          relationship was, surely you'd like\r\n          the chance to do something for him.\r\n          A beat of silent outrage from Colter.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Those after images I saw.

Colter slides it out.\r\n          Derek's WALLET. Intentionally left here. The same wallet\r\n          the College Kid gave back to Derek earlier.\r\n          Opening it, Colter pulls out Derek's DRIVER'S LICENSE.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Tears are\r\n          streaming down Derek's face. But he's not going to talk.\r\n\r\n                         DEREK\r\n          I would never hurt anyone. I have\r\n          a family. I guess you'll have to\r\n          kill me.\r\n          But Colter can't. He can't shoot him. He lowers the gun.\r\n          Disgusted with himself. Why can't he do it?\r\n\r\n                         GUZMAN\r\n          You see? You are a human being.\r\n          Speaking gently. Trying to calm him. Even as Colter feels\r\n          like he's failed.\r\n\r\n                         GUZMAN\r\n          This can be worked out. We can\r\n          listen to each other.\r\n          The temperature cooling. Derek's nodding with him.\r\n\r\n                         DEREK\r\n          Anything you want... Please...\r\n          The detonator CELL PHONE RINGS, startling all of them.\r\n          Confused, he answers the phone.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Hello.\r\n\r\n          CHRISTINA (V.O.)\r\n          Who is this?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n\r\n                         (STUNNED)\r\n          Christina?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          99.\r\n\r\n          CHRISTINA (V.O.)\r\n          Are you the guy who was sitting\r\n          across me on the train?\r\n           Colter looks at his watch. The countdown passes THREE\r\n\r\n          MINUTES. 2:59... 2:58...\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          How can you be calling this number?\r\n\r\n          CHRISTINA (V.O.)\r\n          My friend had it. From when you\r\n          called her -- to try and get me off\r\n          the train. Who are you? What do\r\n          you want?\r\n          Derek and Guzman cautiously lower their hands. Watching in\r\n          confusion.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I was trying to warn you.\r\n\r\n          CHRISTINA (V.O.)\r\n          About what?\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I'm not sure that it matters now.\r\n\r\n          CHRISTINA (V.O.)\r\n          Talk to me. I feel that something\r\n          terrible's going to happen. Do I\r\n          need to get off the train? Am I\r\n          going to die?\r\n          He can hear the b.g. noise of the train on the other end.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          I'm right here, okay? Don't be\r\n          afraid.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n\r\n                         (ANGUISH)\r\n          Why didn't I get off the train?\r\n\r\n                         (SIGHS)\r\n          I knew I should have driven in\r\n          today. But then there's the\r\n          bridges, right? You never know\r\n          when they'll be jammed.\r\n          That stirs something in the back of Colter's mind.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          What did you say?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          100.\r\n\r\n                         CHRISTINA\r\n          The bridges. You just never know\r\n          when they'll be jammed.\r\n          His heart starts racing.\r\n\r\n                         FLASHBACK\r\n          On the train. Earlier. Derek in his seat, on his cell\r\n          phone. Colter nearby, overhearing him:\r\n\r\n                         DEREK\r\n          Trust me, by one o'clock, the\r\n          bridge is going to be jammed...\r\n\r\n          BACK TO SCENE\r\n          Colter looks to Derek. His stomach sinks.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          \"By one o'clock, the bridge is\r\n          going to be jammed.\"\u009d That's what\r\n          you said. You knew. You knew\r\n          there was going to be an\r\n          evacuation. You knew before it\r\n          happened. All those people walking\r\n          across the...\r\n          The realization hits.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          They're going to bomb the bridges.\r\n          While they're full of people.\r\n\r\n                         ON DEREK\r\n          A slight flicker travels across Derek's face. Like a\r\n          disturbance on a surface of deep water.\r\n\r\n          CHRISTINA (V.O.)\r\n          What are you talking about. Who's\r\n          going to --\r\n          Over the phone comes the HORN from the passing FREIGHT TRAIN.\r\n          Colter presses the phone to his ear, trying to hear her.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          Christina? Just hang in there.\r\n          You'll be okay.\r\n          A HAND closes over his gun. Before Colter can react, Derek\r\n\r\n          TURNS THE GUN BACK INTO HIM --\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          101.\r\n\r\n          BLAM! BLAM!\r\n\r\n          DEREK SHOOTS COLTER TWICE IN THE CHEST.\r\n          Colter staggers back -- slumps to his knees. Guzman cries\r\n          out -- makes a run at Derek -- who spins and --\r\n\r\n          BLAM!\r\n\r\n          SHOOTS GUZMAN DEAD.\r\n          Spent shell casings roll to a stop on the tile floor. A\r\n          terrible silence.\r\n\r\n          CHRISTINA (V.O.)\r\n          What's happening? Are you okay?\r\n          Are you there?\r\n          Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call. He coldly\r\n          evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood. Then calmly\r\n          walks out.\r\n          As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on\r\n          his beeping WATCH --\r\n          Where the seventeen minutes have RUN OUT. And the world\r\n\r\n          BLEACHES WHITE...\r\n          In the haze comes the mystical vision again -- but deeper in:\r\n          THE STONE WALL now curves over our heads, becoming a TUNNEL.\r\n          CHRISTINA walks away from us -- down into the tunnel. The\r\n          far end is ablaze in WHITE LIGHT.\r\n          We try calling to her. But our voice is weak and faint. She\r\n          continues towards the light... and we do not follow.\r\n\r\n          INT. ISOLATION UNIT\r\n\r\n          The monitor is dark. Everything is still. Colter in his\r\n          seat. For long seconds we watch his face.\r\n\r\n          INT. ENGINEERING LAB - NELLIS A.F.B. - DAY\r\n\r\n          A jarring transition. We are now away from Colter's P.O.V.\r\n          and in the real, physical environment of the Source Code\r\n          operations center.

Thank\r\n          you, sir.\r\n          When he hangs up, he turns to Goodwin and a few other\r\n          TECHNICIANS. Naked ambition courses through him.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Whether or not they can stop the\r\n          bridge attack, we came up with the\r\n          intelligence.

What's that you\r\n          have?\r\n          Goodwin opens an envelope and slides out a CITATION.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          The Army investigated Colter's\r\n          helicopter crash in Iraq.\r\n          Apparently he stayed behind to fly\r\n          protective cover for a disabled\r\n          convoy until he ran out of fuel.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          What's this, then? Some kind of\r\n          posthumous reprimand for reckless\r\n          flying?\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          No. It's the Silver Star.\r\n          Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's\r\n          breezy good humor.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          Send it on to his father.

But now the\r\n          Director of National Intelligence\r\n          is sure to want a closer look at\r\n          our program, and until we train up\r\n          another candidate, we'll need to\r\n          keep Colter around to demonstrate\r\n          it.\r\n\r\n                         TECHNICIAN\r\n          Oh.\r\n\r\n                         RUTLEDGE\r\n          This thing is much bigger than any\r\n          one of us. Goodwin, please clear\r\n          Colter's memories and re-initialize\r\n          Source Code.\r\n          Rutledge walks away. The technician gives Goodwin a look of\r\n          disgust. Goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the\r\n          envelope.\r\n\r\n          INT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Mission Control. Panels, consoles and screens. Goodwin\r\n          takes a seat at his workstation. He swings a microphone up\r\n          and goes to flip a switch.\r\n          Then stops. Unsure how to proceed.

We've kept too\r\n          much from each other.\r\n          An odd sensation comes over Colter.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          I usually report in at 0600. Today\r\n          I was there early. I was there\r\n          when the call came in. Your call.\r\n          His call?

There's no way... There's no\r\n          way you could have...\r\n          Goodwin just smiles.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n\r\n                         (PROTESTING)\r\n          How? The Source Code was a\r\n          parallel world! You told me so!\r\n          It's hermetically sealed. Nothing\r\n          I did on that train would have any\r\n          effect on this reality!\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          You were on the train. I was not.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          But...\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          We didn't know if any bleed-\r\n          throughs could occur. The\r\n          implications would be staggering.\r\n          That's why you were told to avoid\r\n          unduly influencing events.\r\n\r\n                         COLTER\r\n          You're saying I could have saved\r\n          those people?!\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          No. Not in our world. The time\r\n          currents are too strong. But minor\r\n          alterations, here and there, a\r\n          phone call, say, those might slip\r\n          through. We didn't know for sure.\r\n          But you proved it.\r\n          Colter is thunderstruck. Unable to grasp it.\r\n\r\n                         GOODWIN\r\n          I've been thinking about the things\r\n          you said on that call.

But, as you've\r\n          maintained, I do not.\r\n          The strange path of their relationship.

The capsule begins to shake.\r\n          Colter touches the monitor. His fingers imparting to the\r\n          last image of his world a quiet benediction.\r\n\r\n          INT.

But he looks on them\r\n          with an appreciation approaching joy.\r\n          For a moment he just sits there. Simply being alive in this\r\n          world. Attuned to the motion of the train. The sun on his\r\n          face. And across from him, oblivious, working away on her\r\n          sketch pad, is Christina.\r\n          The best sight of all.\r\n\r\n          INT.
