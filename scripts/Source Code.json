He's disoriented.\r\n          Slowly he turns his head to one side...\r\n          PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on\r\n          their morning commute into a city.\r\n          Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees\r\n          flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic\r\n          strobe pattern.\r\n          Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A\r\n          disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin\r\n          burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun.\r\n          His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually\r\n          wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble.\r\n          Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down\r\n          shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch.\r\n          It reads 7:40 a.m.\r\n          He swallows. A strange, creeping panic.\r\n          He has no idea where he is.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT.

A\r\n          red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather\r\n          NAME TAG reads: \"SEAN FENTRESS.\"\u009d\r\n          It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is\r\n          starting to freak him out.\r\n          He catches the scent of something.

It's a mirror image of the first car. But no,\r\n          the passengers are different.\r\n          Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom,\r\n          he instead opens it to find a CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT.

Who steps back,\r\n          aghast. His authority has vanished with Colter's life.\r\n          Goodwin shuts off the monitors. Silence fills the room.\r\n          Colter is dead.\r\n          Rutledge stares sorrowfully at Colter's body. Then at\r\n          Goodwin with burning hatred.\r\n\r\n<b>                         RUTLEDGE\r\n</b>          You're a murderer.\r\n          Goodwin offers his hands to the MP.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GOODWIN\r\n</b>          Go ahead and arrest me.\r\n          But the MP does nothing.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GOODWIN\r\n</b>          I'll be around. Whenever you want\r\n          me.\r\n          They part as he walks out of the room. A look of grim\r\n          satisfaction on his face.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          120.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING\r\n</b>\r\n          Christina walks past the bicycle parked against the stone\r\n          wall. She's about to enter a TUNNEL that goes under the\r\n          tracks. The same tunnel from Colter's vision.\r\n          She stops. Something tells her to turn around.\r\n          The bench where Colter sat is empty.\r\n          But three feet away... Colter is standing there. Still here.\r\n          Dumbfounded, he looks at his watch -- it remains at ZERO.\r\n          He looks all around. Trees stirring in the breeze. A bird\r\n          flies overhead. The crowd of passengers outside the station.\r\n\r\n<b>                         CHRISTINA\r\n</b>          You okay?\r\n          Colter turns to her. How can this be? He's afraid to even\r\n          speak. As if that alone could break the enchantment.\r\n          But the world is here. It goes on. That's all he knows.\r\n          Finally he swallows. Finding his voice.\r\n\r\n<b>                         COLTER\r\n</b>          You're right. The least I can do\r\n          is buy you coffee.\r\n          This pleases Christina, although she tries not to show it.\r\n\r\n<b>                         CHRISTINA\r\n</b>          Okay, well, come on then.\r\n          Walking forward, he joins her. The two of them disappear\r\n          down the tunnel.\r\n          A beautiful morning.\r\n\r\n<b>          FADE OUT.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n \r\n\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Source-Code.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Source Code</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Ben Ripley\" title=\"Scripts by Ben Ripley\">Ben Ripley</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Mystery\" title=\"Mystery Scripts\">Mystery</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Source Code Script.html#comments\" title=\"Source Code comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:16:51.531343"}
