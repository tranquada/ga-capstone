An old\n          plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and\n          tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded\n          diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off\n          the Shopping Network.\n          Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an\n          ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine\n          stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit.\n          You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer\n          drinker.\n          Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is\n          cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed\n          dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when\n          your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.   The\n          dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's\n          hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.\n\n<b>                              PERCY\n</b>                    Lord as my witness, Bob, one of\n                    these days that thing's gonna hit\n                    you back.\n\n<b>          WHACK!\n</b>\n<b>                              BOB\n</b>                    Whaddya talkin' about, Percy?
