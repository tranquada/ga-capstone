Photograph shakes. SOUND of a man MOANING \n               in anguish. The photograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER, \n               MORE compromising one. Then another, and another. More moans.\n\n                                     CURLY'S VOICE\n                              (crying out)\n                         Oh, no.\n\n               INT. GITTES' OFFICE\n\n               CURLY drops the photos on Gittes' desk. Curly towers over \n               GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his \n               breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes' \n               shiny desk top.\n\n               Gittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at \n               it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite \n               the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a \n               cigarette using a lighter with a \"nail\" on his desk.\n\n               Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist \n               into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts \n               to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left \n               a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos \n               of several movie stars askew.\n\n               Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He \n               is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually \n               bites into the blinds.\n\n               Gittes doesn't move from his chair.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         All right, enough is enough. You \n                         can't eat the Venetian blinds, Curly. \n                         I just had 'em installed on Wednesday.\n\n               Curly responds slowly, rising to his feet, crying. Gittes \n               reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly \n               selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of \n               more expensive whiskeys.\n\n               Gittes pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his \n               desk toward Curly.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Down the hatch.\n\n               Curly stares dumbly at it. Then picks it up, and drains it. \n               He sinks back into the chair opposite Gittes, begins to cry \n               quietly.\n\n                                     CURLY\n                              (drinking, relaxing a \n                              little)\n                         She's just no good.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         What can I tell you, Kid?

DUFFY & WALSH'S OFFICE\n\n               Noticeably less plush than Gitte's. A well-groomed, dark-\n               haired WOMAN sits nervously between their two desks, fiddling \n               with the veil on her pillbox hat.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         I was hoping Mr. Gittes could see to \n                         this personally.\n\n                                     WALSH\n                              (almost the manner of \n                              someone comforting \n                              the bereaved)\n                         If you'll allow us to complete our \n                         preliminary questioning, by then \n                         he'll be free.\n\n               There is the SOUND of ANOTHER MOAN coming from Gittes' Office.\n\n               Something made of glass shatters. The Woman grows more edgy.\n\n               INT. GITTES' OFFICE \u0096 GITTES & CURLY\n\n               Gittes and Curly stand in front of the desk, Gittes staring \n               contemptuously at the heavy breathing hulk towering over \n               him. Gittes takes a handkerchief and wipes away the plunk of \n               perspiration on his desk.\n\n                                     CURLY\n                              (crying)\n                         They don't kill a guy for that.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Oh they don't?\n\n                                     CURLY\n                         Not for your wife. That's the \n                         unwritten law.\n\n               Gittes pounds the photos on the desk, shouting;\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         I'll tell you the unwritten law, you \n                         dumb son of a bitch, you gotta be \n                         rich to kill somebody, anybody and \n                         get away with it.

OFFICE RECEPTION\n\n               He's now walking him past SOPHIE who pointedly averts her \n               gaze. He opens the door where on the pebbled glass can be \n               read: \"J. J.

Mr. \n                         Mulwray.\n\n               REACTION \u0096 GITTES\n\n               Looking up with interest from his racing form.\n\n               MULWRAY\n\n               Walks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender man in \n               his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising \n               fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. The \n               man turns the overleaf on the map.\n\n                                     MULWRAY\n                         In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, \n                         over five hundred lives were lost \n                         when the Van der Lip Dam gave way \n                         core samples have shown that beneath \n                         this bedrock is shale similar to the \n                         permeable shale in the Van der Lip \n                         disaster.  It couldn't withstand \n                         that kind of pressure there.\n                              (referring to a new \n                              overleaf)\n                         Now you propose yet another dirt \n                         banked terminus dam with slopes of \n                         two and one half to one, one hundred \n                         twelve feet high and a twelve thousand \n                         acre water surface. Well, it won't \n                         hold. I won't build it. It's that \n                         simple. I am not making that kind of \n                         mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen.\n\n               Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly \n               there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the \n               chambers and a redfaced FARMER drives in several scrawny, \n               bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause a commotion.\n\n                                     COUNCIL PRESIDENT\n                              (shouting to farmer)\n                         What in the hell do you think you're \n                         doing?\n                              (as the sheep bleat \n                              down the aisles toward \n                              the Council)\n                         Get those goddam things out of here!\n\n                                     FARMER\n                              (right back)\n                         Tell me where to take them!

RIVERBED \u0096 LONG SHOT\n\n               It's virtually empty. Sun blazes off it's ugly concrete banks. \n               Where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked \n               with weeds.\n\n               After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood \n               control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Mulwray \n               gets out of the car. Me looks around.\n\n               WITH GITTES\n\n               Holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the \n               flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover. \n               He watches while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of \n               the riverbed.\n\n               There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at \n               the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Trains the binoculars on him. Sun glints off Mulwray's \n               glasses.\n\n               BELOW GITTES\n\n               There's the SOUND of something like champagne corks popping. \n               Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into \n               the riverbed, and into Gitte's view.\n\n               MULWRAY\n\n               Himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound. Power \n               lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water \n               at his feet.\n\n               He moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound, \n               toward Gittes.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in \n               the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the \n               muddy banks.\n\n               Mulwray says something to the boy.\n\n               The boy doesn't answer at first. Mulwray points to the ground. \n               The boy gestures. Mulwray frowns. He kneels down in the mud \n               and stares at it. He seems to be concentrating on it.\n\n               After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly \n               back upstream \u0096 scrambling up the bank to his car.\n\n               There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of \n               blueprints or something like them. He spreads them on the \n               hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking \n               downstream from time to time.\n\n               The power lines overhead HUM.\n\n               He stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets \n               back in the car. He drives off.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Hurries to get back to his car. He gets in and gets right \n               back out.\n\n               The steamy leather burns him. He takes a towel from the back \n               seat and carefully places it on the front one. He gets in \n               and takes off.\n\n               POINT FERMIN PARK \u0096 DUSK\n\n               Street lights go on.\n\n               MULWRAY\n\n               Pulls up, parks. Hurries out of the car, across the park \n               lawn and into the shade of some trees and buildings.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Pulls up, moves across the park at a different angle, but in \n               the direction Mulwray had gone. He makes it through the trees \n               in time to see Mulwray scramble adroitly down the side of \n               the cliff to the beach below. Be seems in a hurry. Gittes \n               moves after him, having a little more difficulty negotiating \n               the climb than Mulwray did.\n\n               DOWN ON THE BEACH\n\n               Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear \n               crescent.\n\n               He looks to his left. There's a promontory of sorts. It's \n               apparent Mulwray has gone that way. Gittes hesitates, then \n               moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory in \n               order to be above Mulwray.\n\n               AT THE OUTFALL\n\n               Gittes spots Mulwray just below him, kicking at the sand.\n\n               Mulwray picks up a starfish. Brushes the sand off it. Looks \n               absently up toward Gittes.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Backs away, sits near the outfall, yawns.\n\n               BEACON LIGHT AT POINT FERMIN\n\n               Flashing in the dust.\n\n               CLOSE \u0096 GITTES\n\n               Sitting, suddenly starts. He swears softly. He's in a puddle \n               of water and the seat of his trousers is wet.\n\n               MULWRAY\n\n               Below him in watching the water trickling down from the \n               outfall near Gittes.\n\n               Mulwray stands and stares at the water, apparently fascinated. \n               Even as Gittes watches Mulwray watching, the volume and \n               velocity seem to increase until it gushes in spurts, cascading \n               into the sea, whipping it into a foam.\n\n               AT THE STREET \u0096 GITTES' CAR\n\n               There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper. \n               Gittes pulls it off, gets in the car and turns on the dash \n               light. It says:\n\n               \"SAVE OUR CITY! LOS ANGELES IS DYING OF THIRST! PROTECT YOUR \n               PROPERTY!

He notices other \n               flyers parked on a couple of cars down the street.\n\n               Gittes reaches down and opens his glove compartment.\n\n               INT.

Gittes pulls out \n               one.\n\n               He absently winds it, checks the time with his own watch. \n               It's 9:37 as he walks to Mulwray's car and places it behind \n               the front wheel of Mulwray's car.

Just \n                         listen a second, Duffy...\n\n               A stunning YOUNG WOMAN appears behind Gittes in his doorway. \n               She's shortly joined by a small, GRAY-HAIRED MAN. They listen, \n               unseen by Gittes.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (continuing)\n                         ...and then they stop and they read \n                         a little Confucius and they screw \n                         some more and they stop and they \n                         smoke some opium and then they go \n                         back and screw some more and they \n                         stop again and they contemplate the \n                         moon or something and it makes it \n                         more exciting. So this other guy \n                         goes home to screw his wife and after \n                         a while he stops and gets up and \n                         goes into the other room only he \n                         reads Life Magazine and he goes back \n                         and he screws some more and suddenly \n                         says excuse me a second and he gets \n                         up and smokes a cigarette and he \n                         goes back and by this time his wife \n                         is getting sore as hell. So he screws \n                         some more and then he gets up to \n                         look at the moon and his wife says, \n                         'What the hell do you think you're \n                         doing?\n                              (Gittes breaks up)\n                         ...you're screwing like a Chinaman.'\n\n               Gittes hangs onto Sophie's desk laughing his ass off. The \n               little Gray-Haired Man winces. When Gittes looks up he sees \n               the Young Woman, apparently in her late twenties.

Has he been out long?\n\n                                     SECRETARY\n                         Since lunch.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Gee whiz.\n                              (he glances at his \n                              watch)\n                         And I'm late.\n\n                                     SECRETARY\n                         He was expecting you?\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Fifteen minutes ago. Why don't I go \n                         in and wait?\n\n               Without waiting for a response, he does. The Secretary half \n               rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door.\n\n               MULWRAY'S INNER OFFICE\n\n               The walls are covered with commendation, photos of Mulwray \n               at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas \n               and reservoirs in the city. On the desk is a framed, tinted \n               photo of Evelyn in riding clothes.\n\n               Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in \n               the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he \n               does.\n\n               He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly \n               examining the top. He tries one of the drawers and it doesn't \n               open.\n\n               He reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens.\n\n               He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. He opens it, riffles \n               through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. Drops it, \n               finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a \n               Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. Then,\n\n               He flips through them, reads one notation in Mulwray's neat \n               hand:\n\n                      \"Tues. night. Oak Pass Res. 7 channels used.\"\n\n               Gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent \n               pane. He quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the \n               drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of Mulwray's glasses \n               off the desk top when he does. He catches them, puts them on \n               the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens.\n\n               RUSS YELBURTON\n\n               Enters the room. An anxious Secretary is right behind him.\n\n                                     YELBURTON\n                         Can I help you?\n                              (extending his hand)\n                         Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the \n                         Department.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (equally pleasant)\n                         J.J. Gittes. And it's not a \n                         departmental matter.\n\n                                     YELBURTON\n                         I wonder if you'd care to wait in my \n                         office?\n\n               This is more a request than an invitation. Gittes nods, \n               follows Yelburton out, through the outer office to his offices \n               down the hall.\n\n                                     YELBURTON\n                              (continuing; as they're \n                              going)\n                         You see, this whole business in the \n                         paper with Mr. Mulwray has us all on \n                         edge.\n\n               INT. YELBURTON OFFICE\n\n               Smaller than Mulwray's, he has most noticeably a lacquered \n               marlin mounted on the wall. There are a couple of other \n               pictures of Yelburton with yellowtail and other fish he's \n               standing beside.\n\n               There's also a small burgee of a fish with the initials A.C. \n               below it, tacked onto the wall.\n\n                                     YELBURTON\n                         After all, you work with a man for a \n                         certain length of time, you come to \n                         know him, his habits, his values, \n                         and so forth. Well either he's the \n                         kind who chases after women or he \n                         isn't.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         And Mulwray isn't?\n\n                                     YELBURTON\n                         He never even kids about it.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Maybe he takes it very seriously.\n\n               Gittes winks. Yelburton chuckles appreciatively, loosening \n               up a little.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         You don't happen to know where Mr. \n                         Mulwray's having lunch?\n\n                                     YELBURTON\n                         I'm sorry, I --\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Well, tell him I'll be back.\n\n               Gittes spots a card tray on Yelburton's desk.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (continuing)\n                         Mind if I take one of your cards?  \n                         In case I want to get in touch with \n                         you again.\n\n                                     YELBURTON\n                         Help yourself.\n\n               Gittes fishes a couple off the tray, puts them in his \n               handkerchief pocket. He goes out the door, nearly running \n               into a man who is standing by the Secretary's desk, about \n               GITTES' age only a head taller and a foot wider, dressed in \n               a plain suit that fits him about as well as a brown paper \n               bag.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Mulvihlll, what are you doing here?\n\n               OUTER OFFICE \u0096 YELBURTON, MULVIHILL AND GITTES\n\n               Mulvihill stares at Gittes with unblinking eyes, remains by \n               the desk.\n\n                                     MULVIHILL\n                         They shut my water off, what's it to \n                         you?\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         How'd you find out?

Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.\n\n               He hands the Chinese Butler a card from his wallet. The Butler \n               takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing in the \n               doorway.\n\n               Gittes stands, and sweats, watching a Japanese GARDENER trim \n               a hedge. There's a SQUEAKING SOUND. Gittes moves a few feet \n               off the porch.\n\n               POV \u0096 GARAGE\n\n               A chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with a \n               chamois.\n\n               Steam rises off the hood. The squeaking has obviously come \n               from the chamois.\n\n               CHINESE BUTLER\n\n               In doorway.\n\n                                     CHINESE BUTLER\n                         Please.\n\n               Gittes looks behind him.

A \n               maid is cleaning in the den. They pass through it out some \n               French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with \n               running water.\n\n                                     CHINESE BUTLER\n                         You wait, please.\n\n               Gittes is left standing by the pond. It's suddenly very quiet \n               except for the runnning water. The pond is over-flowing. \n               After a moment, the Gardener comes running back. He smiles \n               at Gittes, probes into the pond.\n\n               There's something gleaming in the bottom of it. Gittes notes \n               it.\n\n               After a moment, the Gardener drops the long probe, the waters \n               recede.\n\n               EXT.

Bad for glass.\n\n               The Gardener nods, and is off, leaving Gittes staring at the \n               object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming.\n\n               He looks at the tool the Gardener was using, hesitates, picks \n               it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the \n               gleaming object.\n\n               He then spots Evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the \n               trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holds onto \n               it for poise.\n\n               Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside \n               of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair.\n\n               She's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks \n               younger than she did in the office.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Yes, Mr. Gittes?\n\n               Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn.

Look, \n                         Hollis seems to think you're an \n                         innocent man.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Well, I've been accused of many \n                         things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.\n\n               Again he laughs a little nervously.

Whoever \n                         put her up to it, didn't have anything \n                         against me. They were out to get \n                         your husband. Now if I see him, I \n                         can help him.

Go on down.\n\n               Gittes drives past the Guards, through the gate, along the \n               reservoir. He spots a police car and an unmarked one as well.\n\n               Gittes stops and gets out of the car. Several men with their \n               backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the \n               reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently \n               dredging for something.\n\n               One of the men turns and sees Gittes.

Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet \n               to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying \n               to keep the corpse from hearing them.\n\n                                     ESCOBAR\n                         It looks like he was washed the entire \n                         length of the runoff channel. Could \n                         he swim?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Of course.\n\n                                     ESCOBAR\n                         Obviously the fall must have knocked \n                         him out.\n\n               Evelyn nods slightly Escobar coughs. A coroner's assistant \n               wheels the body out of the office.\n\n                                     ESCOBAR\n                              (continuing)\n                         This alleged affair he was having. \n                         The publicity didn't make him morose \n                         or unhappy?\n\n               OUTSIDE THE CORONER'S\n\n               Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and \n               listening. At this question, he rises and looks through the \n               doorway.\n\n               Escobar sees him, ignores him.

They go through a couple of outer \n               doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer \n               hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like \"only in \n               L.A.\" and \"Southern Cafeteria.\"\n\n               Gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking \n               questions.

SUNSET BOULEVARD \u0096 GITTES \u0096 DAY\n\n               He's parked on an overpass. The sign HOLLENBECK BRIDGE on \n               one of its concrete columns. Gittes looks down into the \n               riverbed below.\n\n               FROM THE BRIDGE\n\n               Gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its \n               contents strewn down river from the bridge. Below him, lying \n               half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank \n               of the river is a sign that proclaims \"OWN YOUR OWN OFFICE \n               IN THIS BUILDING $5000 to $6000\" which was used as a roof of \n               sorts. Downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a Ford \n               seat cushion, an Armour lard can, etc. The trashy remains of \n               Shuhardt's home.\n\n               Gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near \n               the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud. Gittes \n               pulls it out, swearing.\n\n               He begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears \n               the vaguely familiar SQUISHY CLOP of something.\n\n               Clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little Mexican \n               Boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy \n               bank.\n\n               They look at one another a moment.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (calling out to him)\n                         You were riding here the other day, \n                         weren't you...?\n\n               The Boy doesn't answer.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (continuing)\n                         Speak English?...

The horse snorts. The Boy rides slowly on.\n\n               EXT. RIVERBED \u0096 DUSK\n\n               Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the \n               storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes. It is headed above \n               toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is setting.\n\n               EXT. GITTES IN CAR \u0096 NIGHTFALL\n\n               Winding his way up a section of the Hollywood Hills. He picks \n               up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by the driver's \n               windwing.\n\n               GITTES IN CAR \u0096 MOVING\n\n               Along the flood channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows \n               the channel with the car spotlight. He turns at a fork in \n               the road which allows him to continue following the flood \n               channel.\n\n               FURTHER UP \u0096 MOVING\n\n               The road is narrower. Gittes drives more slowly. Foliage is \n               overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.\n\n               STILL FURTHER \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               The road is dirt. Heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus \n               are everywhere. It is very still. Another turn and a pie-\n               shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be \n               GLIMPSED.\n\n               POV \u0096 CHAIN-LINK FENCE\n\n               Over the road, bolted. It says \"OAK PASS RESERVOIR. KEEP \n               OUT. NO TRESPASSING.\"\n\n               The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel \n               and down into it, making access along the channel itself \n               impossible.\n\n               Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the \n               spotlight.\n\n               A lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole \n               illumination.\n\n               There is only the eerie SOUND of the tension WIRES HUMMING.\n\n               Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood \n               channel itself.\n\n               ON THE OTHER SIDE\n\n               Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick Foliage \n               toward a second and large chain-link fence. Lights from the \n               reservoir still higher above can be SEEN.\n\n               Suddenly there is a GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Gittes dives into \n               the flood control channel, which is at this point about four \n               feet deep and six feet wide. There is the SOUND of men \n               scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating. \n               Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.\n\n               He waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there is \n               another SOUND now. An echoing growing sound. It puzzles \n               Gittes. He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.\n\n               GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over \n               him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging \n               into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the \n               overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. But the force of \n               the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's \n               brought rudely to the chainlink fence. It stops him cold. \n               He's nearly strained through it.\n\n               Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing \n               water by means of the fence itself.\n\n               Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and \n               makes his way toward his car.\n\n               AT GITTES' CAR\n\n               He fishes for his car keys, looks down. One shoe is missing.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (grumbling)\n                         Goddam Florsheim shoe, goddammit.\n\n               He starts to get into his car but Mulvihill and a SMALLER \n               MAN stop him. Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning \n               his arms, holding him tightly. The smaller man thrusts a \n               switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left \n               nostril.\n\n                                     SMALLER MAN\n                              (shaking with emotion)\n                         Hold it there, kitty cat.\n\n               CLOSE \u0096 GITTES\n\n               Frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead \n               gleaming on the silvery blade.\n\n                                     THE SMALLER MAN\n                         You are a very nosey fellow, kitty \n                         cat... you know what happens to nosey \n                         fellows?\n\n               The Smaller Man actually seems to be trembling with rage \n               when he says this.

Okay, lose their \n                         noses.\n\n               With a quick flick the Smaller Man pulls back on the blade, \n               laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes \n               screams.\n\n               Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat.\n\n               Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood \n               from getting on his clothes.

Gittes leans on the \n               open door of his car and in to Evelyn. He talks quietly but \n               spits it out.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Okay, go home.

She stares at \n               Gittes for a long moment. Then he gently tugs the car door \n               closed.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Mr. Gittes.\n\n               He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn \n               looking after him.\n\n               INT.

He sees \n               a photographic display of \"THE HISTORY OF THE DWP. THE EARLY \n               YEARS\", along the wall. He stops as he spots a photo of the \n               man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier. He is \n               standing high in the mountains, near a pass. The caption \n               reads \"JULIAN CROSS. 1905\".\n\n               Cross is strikingly handsome.\n\n               Gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing Evelyn's \n               check. He looks at the corner of it, his thumb pressing down \n               under the middle initial C, then he looks back to the photos.\n\n               The Secretary returns.\n\n                                     SECRETARY\n                         Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some \n                         time.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Well I'm on my lunch hour.

He opens the \n               book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically.\n\n               INSERT PLAT BOOK NORTHWEST VALLEY\n\n               Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward \n               the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a \n               strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and \n               property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or \n               coughs to cover the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped.\n\n               EXT. ROAD \u0096 GITTES DRIVING \u0096 DAY\n\n               Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying \n               groves, narrower roads.\n\n               He passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard. There \n               is a \"SOLD\" sign on the collapsing barn.

Gittes has paused at this \n               dried-up intersection. There is a \"SOLD\" sign on a drug store. \n               Gittes looks OFF SCREEN.\n\n               Coming INTO VIEW above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud \n               of purple smoke. Gittes heads in that direction.\n\n               Gittes parks at the edge of the field. About twenty yards \n               away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid \n               off it.\n\n               Billowing lavender clouds are belching forth.\n\n               Several CHILDREN are watching the man at work.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (to one of the Children)\n                         Say, pal, what's he doing?\n\n                                     CHILD\n                         Making some rain.\n\n               Gittes nods, walks over to the man who is elaborately busying \n               himself with the intricacies of his machine.

There are a couple of \n               mailboxes.\n\n               Gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent.\n\n               As he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be \n               SEEN, coming more and more INTO VIEW, row upon row of avocado \n               and walnut groves, their foliage heavy. The few structures \n               in the distance are white-washed, and well kept, right down \n               to the white-washed stones that mark the pathway to the home. \n               Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank.\n\n               Gittes drives through a gate that has \"NO TRESPASSING\" and \n               \"KEEP OUT PRIVATE PROPERTY\" signs neatly printed on it.\n\n               He drives down the road into the grove.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes. He \n               puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees. By contrast \n               with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful, their \n               heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze.\n\n               Then a SHOTGUN BLAST abruptly strips bare the branches of \n               the tree he'd been staring at.\n\n               EXT. AVOCADO GROVES \u0096 DAY\n\n               Gittes is shocked. He looks behind him. Riding on horseback \n               down the field in the direction he had just driven is a Red-\n               Faced Man in overalls. His hat blows off his head. He does \n               not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used. Gittes' \n               lane of retreat is denied him. He guns the car, and takes \n               off down one of the orchard lanes.\n\n               MOVING WITH GITTES\n\n               The dirt lane is rough. As Gittes nears the end of it, a \n               Younger Man on a mule blocks the exit.\n\n               Gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the \n               trees, heading down one of the cross-lanes. Here he's pursued \n               by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires. Gittes yells at \n               it.\n\n               ANGLE ON GROVE\n\n               Two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the lanes \n               toward a dust trail rising above the trees. They've spotted \n               it. Clearly it's from Gittes' car.\n\n               This hide-and-seek chase between one man on horseback, one \n               on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and \n               across the orchard lanes until Gittes' front tire and radiator \n               are ruptured by another SHOTGUN BLAST.\n\n               Gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese \n               and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of \n               the heavy fruit onto Gittes and the car.\n\n               Gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches \n               over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one of \n               the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle \n               with. The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back \n               with his crutch. The two of them manage to pound Gittes to \n               the ground within moments, where the Crippled Farmer continues \n               to whack away at Gittes with the crutch.\n\n               The older Red Faced Farmer with the shotgun and the Man on a \n               mule ride up.\n\n                                     RED FACED FARMER\n                         All right, quit it! Quit now! Search \n                         the man, see if he's armed.\n\n               Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger \n               Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes. Gittes \n               is badly banged up and half out on his feet. They toss his \n               wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. on the ground.\n\n                                     RED FACED FARMER\n                         I said see if he's armed, not empty \n                         his pockets.\n\n                                     BIG FARMER\n                         He ain't armed.\n\n               Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily.\n\n                                     RED FACED FARMER\n                         All right, mister.

He has trouble \n               catching his breath. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in \n               the back with his crutch.

In one wing, \n               the men are playing pinochle, some are playing dominoes, one \n               elderly gentleman sits by himself carefully peeling an orange.\n\n               In an adjacent parlor several white-headed ladies work on a \n               quilt.\n\n               Gittes grabs Evelyn's hand.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (quietly)\n                         They're all here.

There \n               are titles. \"LAWN BOWLING\". \"BRIDGE\". \"FISHING\". \"CROQUET\". \n               Below them are the names of the guests, entered under certain \n               activities, for certain days.\n\n               After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (continuing; indicating \n                              the ancients around \n                              them)\n                         You're looking at the owners of a \n                         50,000 acre empire.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                              (astonished)\n                         They can't be.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         They may not know it but they are.\n\n               Gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the \n               quilt.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Hello, girls.\n\n               Two of the ladies giggle.

In it is the head of a fish among \n               the rest of the crazy quilt pattern.

Would you \n                         care to come this way? Someone wants \n                         to see you.\n\n               Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking \n               taut and a little drawn. Evelyn is beside him. She gestures \n               as if there's someone behind Palmer.\n\n               Gittes rises.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         See you later, Emma.\n\n               He walks toward Palmer who waits for him to walk in front.\n\n               AT THE ENTRANCE HALL \u0096 MULVIHILL\n\n               Is waiting. He's got his hand in his pocket. Evelyn looks to \n               Gittes.\n\n               The four of them stand there, Mulvihill towering over \n               everyone.\n\n                                     MULVIHILL\n                         Come on I want you to meet somebody, \n                         Gittes.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (glancing from Palmer \n                              to Mulvihill)\n                         Can we leave the lady out of this?\n\n                                     MULVIHILL\n                              (a little uncertain)\n                         Yeah, why not?\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Okay, I'd like to walk her to her \n                         car.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         I'll stay.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (taking her by the \n                              arm)\n                         Get in the car.\n\n                                     MULVIHILL\n                         I'll see she makes it.\n\n               Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the mistake \n               of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back \n               to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's \n               jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket \n               covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating \n               him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly \n               pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red \n               and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor.\n\n               Palmer screams. Evelyn stands there astonished. Mulvihill's \n               gun has clattered to the floor.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (as Mulvihill hits \n                              the floor, to Evelyn)\n                         What are you waiting for? Get in the \n                         car!\n\n               Evelyn goes.\n\n               Mulvihill tries to get up again. Palmer starts to go for the \n               gun, nearly picking it up. Gittes slaps it out of his hand \n               and kicks it.\n\n               It goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the \n               wall.\n\n               Palmer goes screaming off into the night. Gittes turns back \n               to Mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses.\n\n               Gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience \n               of ancients behind him.\n\n               OUTSIDE\n\n               As Gittes walks down the pathway, he stops. Two men are coming \n               toward him. One of them is shorter, and has the nervous, \n               jerky moves of the man who slit his nose.\n\n               Gittes stops. The two men fan out and continue to move toward \n               him.\n\n               Gittes spots the two-tone shoes. He begins to back up.\n\n               Suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly \n               behind the two men. In a moment Evelyn's car is headed across \n               the lawn directly toward the two men, accelerating as it \n               gets near them. They look in disbelief, then dive for safety. \n               The car skids to a stop, fishtailing a little on the grass.\n\n               Evelyn opens the passenger door.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Get in.\n\n               Gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, tilting \n               the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes. Two \n               SHOTS ARE FIRED.\n\n               INT. CAR \u0096 EVELYN & GITTES\n\n               Evelyn looking straight ahead, driving. After a moment she \n               takes one hand off the wheel and rubs her left eye a little. \n               Gittes watches her. He smiles.\n\n               EXT. VERANDA \u0096 MULWRAY HOME \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette, staring \n               off into the night.\n\n               Evelyn comes out to the veranda, carrying a tray with whiskey \n               and an ice bucket on it. She sets it down. Gittes turns.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (watching her pour)\n                         Maid's night off?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Why?\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (a little surprised, \n                              he laughs)\n                         What do you mean, 'why?'

The \n               curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on \n               the side of the house.\n\n               He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch.\n\n               THROUGH THE WINDOW\n\n               Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living \n               room of the small house. In a moment he re-emerges back \n               through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and \n               pitcher on it.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Around to the side of the house. He runs into shrubbery and \n               a short picket fence.\n\n               He climbs over it, follows along the stucco wall to a series \n               of windows at the corner of the house. These all have shades \n               on them.\n\n               He can hear someone crying in the house. Someone else talking \n               alternately firmly and plaintively in Spanish. Here the \n               windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not \n               completely drawn.\n\n               There's an inch or so of space at the bottom.\n\n               THROUGH THE WINDOW\n\n               Gittes can see the servant again. Evelyn is pacing back and \n               forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment someone \n               rises INTO SHOT, obviously from lying on a bed. The figure \n               is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes \n               INTO VIEW. It is unmistakably the girl Gittes had last seen \n               with Hollis Mulwray.\n\n               Mulwray's girlfriend. She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking \n               in Spanish. Her words are not discernible but the tone is \n               bitter, anguished. A newspaper is strewn about the room.\n\n               Evelyn kneels. She insists that the girl swallow down some \n               pills.\n\n               The girl reluctantly does.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Continues to watch.\n\n               EXT.

It seems to have a momentary calming \n               effect on both of them.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                              (continuing)\n                         She's too upset.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         What about?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Hollis' death.

Not crying, but the \n               kind of deep breathing that comes from real hysteria.

Dust \n               particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes \n               sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone \n               table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets \n               closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside \n               the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. \n               Gittes walks on into the kitchen.\n\n               INT.

Her eyes are open, a stream \n               of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. \n               She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray.\n\n               Gittes kneels over her. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes \n               for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen \n               counter.\n\n               Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her \n               name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns, \n               carefully replaces the items in the purse.\n\n               He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, \n               which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves \n               across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar.\n\n               INT.

It's locked.\n\n               He reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case, \n               takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the \n               lock.\n\n               The Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at \n               Gittes.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Where's Mrs. Mulwray?\n\n                                     MAID\n                         No esta.\n\n               Gittes looks past the Maid to the center of the living room \n               where luggage is packed and neatly piled.\n\n               The Maid is actually in the process of throwing covers over \n               the furniture.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (indicating luggage)\n                         Is Mrs. Mulwray going someplace?...\n                              (no answer)\n                         on a trip?... vacation?...\n\n                                     MAID\n                         No esta in casa.\n\n               Gittes nods. He continues through the house and out back to \n               the veranda.\n\n               EXT. MULWRAY VERANDA \u0096 GITTES\n\n               Is unsettled. Sees the Gardener working by the pond. He \n               wanders a few yards in that direction.\n\n               GARDENER\n\n               Spots Gittes, half-bows, nods and smiles.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               In turn, nods, smiles.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Bad for glass.\n\n               GARDENER\n\n               Breaks into a big grin.

Points to the pond.\n\n                                     GARDENER\n                         Velly velly bad.\n\n               Gittes has moved to the pond. He kneels. Clinging to the \n               edge of it he can now see as he could have before if he'd \n               looked closely, a starfish.\n\n               CLOSE STARFISH\n\n               It has one leg missing. The fifth point on the star is just \n               beginning to grow back.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Touches the water, tastes it. He licks his lips, then spots \n               something glinting in the bottom of the pond.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         What's that... down there?\n\n               The Gardener peers into the pond.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (continuing)\n                         ...there.\n\n               The Gardener spots it. He rolls up his trousers, gets in the \n               pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching \n               the water.\n\n               He misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an \n               animal. Then he grasps it. He lifts it out of the water and \n               holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking \n               through the frame where one lens is shattered.\n\n               The Gardener seems surprised. Gittes looks at the glasses. \n               They are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun.\n\n               INT. MULWRAY HOME\n\n               Gittes holds the phone to his ear. On the telephone table, \n               lying on his handkerchief are the glasses.\n\n               The Maid hovers around over Gittes' shoulder, uneasily \n               watching him.\n\n                                     CROSS' VOICE\n                         Hello.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Have you got your checkbook handy, \n                         Mr. Cross?

BUNGALOW HOUSE \u0096 ADELAIDE DRIVE\n\n               Gittes pulls up in Mulwray's Buick.

You see, Mr. \n                         Gittes, most people never have to \n                         face the fact that at the right time \n                         and right place, they're capable of \n                         anything. Take those glasses from \n                         him, will you, Claude?\n\n               Mulvihill moves INTO VIEW. Extends his hand for the glasses. \n               Gittes doesn't move.\n\n                                     CROSS\n                         It's not worth it, Mr. Gittes. It's \n                         really not worth it.\n\n               Gittes hands over the glasses.\n\n                                     CROSS\n                         Take us to the girl. Either Evelyn \n                         allows me to see her, or I'm not \n                         averse to seeing Evelyn in jail. If \n                         I have to buy the jail. Hollis and \n                         Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen \n                         years. It's been too long, I'm too \n                         old.\n\n               EXT. CHINATOWN STREET \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               The streets are crowded. Here and there one can see Chinese \n               in traditional dress.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Driving slowly, spots Katherine with Ramon and luggage, nearly \n               lost in the crowd. They are walking toward a car parked near \n               a laundry truck.\n\n               Gittes sees them, keeps driving.\n\n                                     CROSS\n                              (suddenly)\n                         Stop the car. Stop the car!\n\n               Mulvihill tries to clobber Gittes. Gittes elbows him. The \n               car jumps the curb and hits a lamppost.\n\n               EXT. STREET \u0096 CROSS\n\n               Leaps out of the car shouting:\n\n                                     CROSS\n                         Katherine! Katherine! Wait!\n\n               Gittes is after him, grabbing him. Cross tries to swing at \n               Gittes with his cane. Mulvihill comes up behind Gittes and \n               the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match, the crowd \n               scattering, Mulvihill pulling his revolver, trying to hit \n               Gittes on the side of the head. The three men crash to the \n               pavement.\n\n               CURLY\n\n               Starts out of the car toward Gittes. Gittes sees him.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         No, Curly, get 'em out of here! Get \n                         'em out of here!\n\n               He bites Mulvihill's hand and furiously pounds it into the \n               sidewalk, shaking gun loose. Mulvihill and Gittes try for it \n               but someone else has it.\n\n               EVELYN\n\n               Holds the gun. She's shaking but apparently in control of \n               herself.\n\n               GITTES\n\n               Rises to his feet. Mulvihill starts to help Cross up.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         No, don't help him. Don't do anything.\n\n               Mulvihill doesn't move. Cross rises on his own. Evelyn holds \n               the revolver on him.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         She's gone.

Either that or tell me where \n                         she is.\n\n               Evelyn is backing up. Cross moving on her. Evelyn cocks the \n               pistol.\n\n                                     CROSS\n                         How many years have I got?... she's \n                         mine too.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         She's never going to know that.\n\n               There's the SOUND of a SIREN. Cross lunges toward her. Gittes \n               grabs Cross.\n\n               Duffy and Walsh are elbowing through the crowd. Gittes sees \n               them.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                         Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.\n                              (to Walsh)\n                         Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to \n                         bring the police department with \n                         you.\n\n                                     WALSH\n                         Jake, it's Chinatown.

She's \n                         not going anywhere.\n\n               There's a single GUNSHOT. Both men look surprised. Down the \n               block a uniformed officer has fired, standing beside his \n               double-parked car.\n\n               Duffy's sedan slows to a stop in the middle of the street. \n               It jerks a couple of times, still in gear, then comes to a \n               halt.\n\n               Gittes rushes to the car. He opens it. Evelyn falls out, \n               inert.\n\n               Blood is pouring from her right eye.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (yelling)\n                         No!\n\n               He holds onto Evelyn as Escobar and others hurry up.

I'll kill him, I'll \n                         kill the son of a bitch.\n\n               Several officers contain Gittes.\n\n                                     GITTES\n                              (to Escobar)\n                         Who is he, get his name?
