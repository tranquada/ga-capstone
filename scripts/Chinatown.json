Curly towers over \n               GITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his \n               breathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes' \n               shiny desk top.\n\n               Gittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at \n               it. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite \n               the heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a \n               cigarette using a lighter with a \"nail\" on his desk.\n\n               Curly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist \n               into the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts \n               to sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left \n               a noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos \n               of several movie stars askew.\n\n               Curly slides on into the blinds and sinks to his knees. He \n               is weeping heavily now, and is in such pain that he actually \n               bites into the blinds.\n\n               Gittes doesn't move from his chair.\n\n<b>                                     GITTES\n</b>                         All right, enough is enough.

Why don't I go \n                         in and wait?\n\n               Without waiting for a response, he does. The Secretary half \n               rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door.\n\n<b>               MULWRAY'S INNER OFFICE\n</b>\n               The walls are covered with commendation, photos of Mulwray \n               at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas \n               and reservoirs in the city. On the desk is a framed, tinted \n               photo of Evelyn in riding clothes.\n\n               Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in \n               the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he \n               does.\n\n               He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly \n               examining the top. He tries one of the drawers and it doesn't \n               open.\n\n               He reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens.\n\n               He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. He opens it, riffles \n               through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. Drops it, \n               finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a \n               Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. Then,\n\n               He flips through them, reads one notation in Mulwray's neat \n               hand:\n\n                      \"Tues. night. Oak Pass Res. 7 channels used.\"\n\n               Gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent \n               pane. He quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the \n               drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of Mulwray's glasses \n               off the desk top when he does. He catches them, puts them on \n               the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens.\n\n<b>               RUSS YELBURTON\n</b>\n               Enters the room. An anxious Secretary is right behind him.\n\n<b>                                     YELBURTON\n</b>                         Can I help you?\n                              (extending his hand)\n                         Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the \n                         Department.\n\n<b>                                     GITTES\n</b>                              (equally pleasant)\n                         J.J.

Gittes nods, \n               follows Yelburton out, through the outer office to his offices \n               down the hall.\n\n<b>                                     YELBURTON\n</b>                              (continuing; as they're \n                              going)\n                         You see, this whole business in the \n                         paper with Mr. Mulwray has us all on \n                         edge.\n\n<b>               INT.

Gittes dives into \n               the flood control channel, which is at this point about four \n               feet deep and six feet wide. There is the SOUND of men \n               scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating. \n               Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel.\n\n               He waits. The men seem to have passed him by. But there is \n               another SOUND now. An echoing growing sound. It puzzles \n               Gittes. He starts to lift his head to catch the direction.\n\n<b>               GITTES IN FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL \u0096 NIGHT\n</b>\n               Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over \n               him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging \n               into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the \n               overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. But the force of \n               the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's \n               brought rudely to the chainlink fence. It stops him cold. \n               He's nearly strained through it.\n\n               Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing \n               water by means of the fence itself.\n\n               Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and \n               makes his way toward his car.\n\n<b>               AT GITTES' CAR\n</b>\n               He fishes for his car keys, looks down.

The few structures \n               in the distance are white-washed, and well kept, right down \n               to the white-washed stones that mark the pathway to the home. \n               Towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank.\n\n               Gittes drives through a gate that has \"NO TRESPASSING\" and \n               \"KEEP OUT PRIVATE PROPERTY\" signs neatly printed on it.\n\n               He drives down the road into the grove.\n\n<b>               GITTES\n</b>\n               Pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes.

Here he's pursued \n               by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires.

The Crippled Farmer begins to bang Gittes on the back \n               with his crutch.

He makes the mistake \n               of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back \n               to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's \n               jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket \n               covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihlll, beating \n               him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly \n               pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red \n               and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor.\n\n               Palmer screams. Evelyn stands there astonished.

Gittes slaps it out of his hand \n               and kicks it.\n\n               It goes flying down the hall, at least thirty feet; hits the \n               wall.\n\n               Palmer goes screaming off into the night. Gittes turns back \n               to Mulvihill who starts to get up, then collapses.\n\n               Gittes goes out the front door, ignoring the excited audience \n               of ancients behind him.\n\n<b>               OUTSIDE\n</b>\n               As Gittes walks down the pathway, he stops.

He begins to back up.\n\n               Suddenly there is a pair of headlights flashing brilliantly \n               behind the two men. In a moment Evelyn's car is headed across \n               the lawn directly toward the two men, accelerating as it \n               gets near them. They look in disbelief, then dive for safety. \n               The car skids to a stop, fishtailing a little on the grass.\n\n               Evelyn opens the passenger door.\n\n<b>                                     EVELYN\n</b>                         Get in.\n\n               Gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, tilting \n               the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes.

Hollis and \n                         Evelyn kept her from me for fifteen \n                         years. It's been too long, I'm too \n                         old.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Mulvihill comes up behind Gittes and \n               the three of them begin an awkward wrestling match, the crowd \n               scattering, Mulvihill pulling his revolver, trying to hit \n               Gittes on the side of the head.
