COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, NORTH CAROLINA. DAY\n\n               ON A BLACK SCREEN: Credits.\n\n               A RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMER\u0092S) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE LANGUAGE.\n\n               A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES: shrouded in a blue mist \n               like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small \n               town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to \n               the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack.\n\n               Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack.\n\n               A ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked \n               forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a \n               stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian. \n               Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the \n               ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet, \n               the blood pouring from his nose.\n\n               His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge.\n\n               A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes \n               down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary \n               field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants \n               grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and \n               its two exotic passengers passes by.\n\n               The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the \n               severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self-\n               conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts \n               of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt \n               to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by \n               her. An angel in this wild place.\n\n               Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to \n               translate into English:\n\n                                     SWIMMER\u0092S VOICE (V.O.)\n                         You will be lonely. You will howl \n                         like a dog as you walk alone. You \n                         will carry dog shit cupped in your \n                         hands. You will be smeared with dog \n                         shit. Your spirit will wane and \n                         dwindle to blue, the colour of \n                         despair... \n\n               As the Cabriolet passes, SWIMMER takes the ball an with a \n               whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. The game \n               resumes. Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, \n               sticks and fists flailing.\n\n               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. NIGHT\n\n               A SIDE OF BEEF turns on a huge barbecue. The battered teams \n               eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, \n               illuminated by a roaring bonfire. Swimmer is sewing up a \n               gash in Inman\u0092s cheek as he continues to translate:\n\n                                     SWIMMER\n                         ...This is your path.

The Monroes are introduced to \n               various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the \n               crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from \n               Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's \n               preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches \n               Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches, \n               and winces with pain.\n\n                                     SWIMMER\n                         So keep your head still.\n\n               Sally collects plates for the Monroes. Hands them to Ada and \n               her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware. Esco takes \n               a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it. Monroe \n               pluckily follows suit.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                              (to Swimmer)\n                         Anyway, there won't be any war. And \n                         if there is, they say it won't last \n                         a week.\n\n                                                END OF CREDITS AND FADE TO:\n\n               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN\n\n               CAPTION: PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA. JULY 30TH, 1864. IN THE FOURTH \n               YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR.\n\n               A STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT \n               surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty.\n\n               A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into \n               open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE \n               CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON \n               THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in \n               the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The \n               Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and \n               it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world \n               of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches.\n\n               IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water \n               for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a \n               large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the \n               stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole. \n               Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling.\n\n               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN.\n\n               A dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes \n               burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose.\n\n               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN.\n\n               Young OAKLEY, freshly recruited, approaches a group of men, \n               like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina \n               Regiment. He doles out breakfast. Inman, loading his heavy \n               LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry. Oakley serves \n               another, ROURKE, last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain. \n               Oakley keeps his head low as he serves.\n\n                                     ROURKE\n                         Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys \n                         keep store hours. They ain't open \n                         yet.\n\n               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN\n\n               Shadows and shapes. A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It \n               reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay \n               team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked \n               to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels.\n\n               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN\n\n               A RABBIT, scared up, darts along the trench. Rourke sees it, \n               beckons to another Cold Mountain boy, Butcher.\n\n                                     BUTCHER\n                         That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him!\n\n                                     ROURKE\n                         I'm not firing, start the damn war \n                         off.\n\n               Butcher chases after the rabbit, Rourke in raucous support.\n\n               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN\n\n               The crouching man has wrapped FUZE WIRE around the last \n               barrel, and now retreats, paying out the wire as he does so, \n               as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards behind him.\n\n               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN\n\n               Rourke weaves through the gun emplacements, laughing.\n\n                                     ROURKE\n                         That's my rabbit!\n\n               Great sport. Inman, fifty yards away, looks over, amused, \n               goes back to his gun.\n\n               INT. TUNNEL. DAWN\n\n               The fuze wire is lit. It fizzes towards the barrels.\n\n               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN\n\n               Rourke is running BUT NOW THE GROUND BUCKLES UNDER HIM AND \n               HE'S BEING LIFTED SLOWLY INTO THE AIR, the earth swelling.\n\n               AN APOCALYPTIC EXPLOSION. FOUR TONS OF DYNAMITE RIP THE GROUND \n               OPEN IN A CRATER 135 FEET LONG, 90 FEET ACROSS, 30 FEET DEEP.\n\n               HORSES, GUNS, MEN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES AND THROWN UP INTO THE \n               AIR.\n\n               INMAN DISAPPEARS UNDER DIRT AND DEBRIS.\n\n               Pandemonium. The Confederates are in complete disarray. The \n               Federals pour forwards across NO MANS LAND, through the \n               peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. They \n               flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a \n               dense and impenetrable WALL OF SMOKE.\n\n               THEN THEY'RE INSIDE THE GREAT GASH OF CRATER AND CAN'T GET \n               OUT AGAIN, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud.\n\n               The Confederates regroup. Orders are yelled. Chaos developing \n               into battle.\n\n               The Confederates begin firing into the crater. Guns and mortar \n               wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death \n               trap.\n\n               Inman gets to his feet. Oakley with him, and rushes through \n               the smoke to the pit, emptying his LeMats into the crater.\n\n               LATER: A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the attack. Bodies \n               falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their \n               comrades even tighter. The Confederates make a pincer movement \n               outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in. It's \n               Medieval.\n\n               No escape.\n\n               THE CONFEDERATES jump into the pit to engage the Federals. \n               Hand to hand fighting. Too close for rifles, just bayonets, \n               and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that \n               hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which \n               does a terrible damage. Primitive. Unutterable carnage. Men \n               killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against \n               soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. An oozing \n               layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning \n               in slick.\n\n               YOUNG OAKLEY loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case, \n               clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with \n               a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal.\n\n               INMAN GOES AT IT. He's a warrior, punching and stabbing and \n               firing. A coldly efficient killer. He's grabbed from behind \n               and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle.\n\n               He falls and lands on top of Oakley, and he and his Federal \n               opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their \n               pillow. The slaughter continues over and around them, the \n               sound, the sound of hell and madness. The boy has his arm \n               around Inman, like lovers.\n\n               LATER: The Confederates run after the retreating Union \n               soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. Inman stands, \n               the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. The \n               crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. The victors are \n               yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. Butcher comes alongside \n               Inman.\n\n                                     BUTCHER\n                         That was something! That's hell and \n                         we've been there! Kicked old Nick's \n                         asshole.\n\n               A WOUNDED BLACK SOLDIER sits up as Butcher celebrates.\n\n               Butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket. \n               He looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons,\n\n               tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not \n               loaded. The wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself \n               like a crab away from Butcher. Inman yells at him, appalled.\n\n                                     BUTCHER\n                         You got a charge?\n\n               He picks up another musket. It fires. The wounded Federal \n               slumps back, dead.\n\n               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DUSK\n\n               THE AFTERMATH. The dead being piled up for burial, divided \n               into allegiance. Wounded prisoners able to walk are led away.\n\n               A great deal of casual looting. Of boots, of equipment, of \n               personal items. Inman sees a soldier in the crater, lining \n               up wounded Federals, putting their heads in a row. THE MAN \n               EXTRACTS A HAMMER FROM HIS BELT AND, SATISFIED HE HAS AN \n               ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENT, PROCEEDS DOWN THE LINE, SMASHING EACH \n               SKULL.\n\n               Inman turns away, sees another Rebel, extravagantly costumed, \n               a strange FIDDLE head protruding from his knapsack. This is \n               STOBROD THEWES. He's bent over a dead Federal, examining his \n               mouth. He reaches behind his back and roots around in the \n               knapsack, producing A PAIR OF PLIERS, WHICH HE INSERTS INTO \n               THE CORPSE'S MOUTH. He's yanking away when A SWINGING BOOT \n               connects with his head and knocks him to the ground.\n\n               Startled, he looks up to see Inman hovering over him.\n\n                                     STOBROD\n                         That's gold in his mouth he got no \n                         need for.\n                              (shrugs)\n                         We take his boots.\n\n               He examines his fiddle for damage. Some orderlies pass, \n               lifting OAKLEY away on a gurney.\n\n               Oakley's pale as a maiden, the life leaking from him. Inman \n               walks a way with him. Oakley looks up, desperate to be brave.\n\n                                     OAKLEY\n                         I got a few. You saw?\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I saw.\n\n                                     OAKLEY\n                         I know you don't recognise me. I'm \n                         Mo Oakley's boy.\n                              (Inman finds this \n                              incredible)\n                         It's okay. I was thirteen when you \n                         all left. Am I going to die?\n\n               Inman flicks his eyes to the Orderly, whose look confirms \n               the boy's wounds are certainly mortal.\n\n               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT\n\n               Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them, \n               the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, \n               groans.\n\n                                     OAKLEY\n                         I'd like to hear some music while I \n                         go.\n\n               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT\n\n               Inman walks around the campfires. He hears some fiddle music. \n               It's Stobrod.\n\n               Stobrod sees Inman. Inman stares, his expression an \n               instruction, the turns and walks away.\n\n               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT\n\n               Stobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman.\n\n                                     STOBROD\n                         What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's \n                         one I play.\n\n                                     OAKLEY\n                         Play me something sweet. Like a girl's \n                         waiting for me.\n\n               Stobrod looks at Inman, confused.\n\n                                     OAKLEY\n                         Play me something like there's nothing \n                         to fear from a merciful Lord.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                              (to Stobrod)\n                         You heard him.\n\n                                     STOBROD\n                              (nervous)\n                         I only know a couple of tunes.\n\n                                     OAKLEY\n                         Like when you're thirsty up at \n                         Bishop's Creek and the water is so \n                         cool.\n\n               Inman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play.\n\n               Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, \n               increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone \n               else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in.\n\n                                     OAKLEY\n                         I'm reaching Cold Mountain before \n                         you.\n\n               Stobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly \n               puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod. \n               The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away.\n\n               INT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT\n\n               A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone, \n               rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A \n               FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps \n               the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next \n               to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches \n               Inman, who makes a stand.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         Don't get up, soldier. You are \n                         mentioned tonight in my report. You \n                         are a credit to the Highlands, to \n                         North Carolina and to the Cause.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                              (tight)\n                         Do you have news, sir, on my \n                         application for transfer?\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         I know. A bloody day. It's what our \n                         General said: Good thing war is so \n                         terrible else a man might end up \n                         liking it too much.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         Sir. It was my understanding the \n                         medical corps was desperate for \n                         volunteers.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         Right now, soldier, it's me who is \n                         in need of volunteers. There's a \n                         dozen Yankees in that stand of trees \n                         between us. Stuck there from the \n                         retreat. Come daylight they can shoot \n                         us down for sport.\n\n               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT\n\n               A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others, \n               including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to \n               one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide \n               arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to \n               the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the \n               ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses.\n\n               He slithers over them.\n\n               They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN \n               FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing. \n               Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate \n               lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting \n               against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep.\n\n               As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the \n               Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his \n               rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing \n               him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another.\n\n               The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party \n               and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from \n               the trees.\n\n               A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate \n               trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A \n               BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed \n               at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own \n               lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the \n               trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold \n               your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost \n               home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly \n               he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him.\n\n               Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty \n               yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK.\n\n               He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying \n               on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly \n               fade to black, all sound fading with them.\n\n               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. 3 YEARS EARLIER. DAY\n\n               A WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge. Men \n               are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below \n               which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the \n               workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a \n               rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke \n               and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around \n               and Oakley, barely a teenager.\n\n               Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, \n               ADA amongst them. She has the circumspect air of the blue \n               stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, \n               the men's radar for her every move. Inman watches her as \n               Sally Swanger approaches.\n\n                                     SALLY\n                              (to Ada, as Monroe \n                              moves off)\n                         Ada, how are you settling in?

NIGHT\n\n               INMAN, ON A GURNEY, carried, someone with a cloth to his \n               neck, which is soaked through with blood. They start to run \n               with him, heading for the field hospital, worried that he \n               will die before the wound can be staunched, cauterized.\n\n               Throughout, A STRANGE MUSIC PLAYS, discordant notes jangling:\n\n               EXT.

Sally comes out to look. \n               It's Ada riding next to one of the farmhands, a second boy \n               keeping watch over the piano.

In \n                         Charleston I was called a thistle, \n                         twice, by two different men.

BOTTOM FIELD, SWANGER FARM. DAY\n\n               Inman's working in the field, stripped to his undershirt, \n               hot work, wielding a scythe. He hears something and looks up \n               at the edge of the lane, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO, which is \n               still strapped to the cart. She briefly raises a hand to \n               Inman, then nods to the farmhand who sets them on their way \n               again. Inman smiles, waves back, watching as the cart rumbles \n               off down the track.\n\n               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT\n\n               It's pouting with rain. INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE, ADA IS PLAYING \n               THE PIANO.\n\n               Men and women crowd into the parlour, in best clothes, \n               celebrating the completion of the Chapel. Inman is outside \n               on the porch, his coat soaked, water pouring off his hat. He \n               looks at Ada. She finishes. Monroe steps in front of the \n               applause, smiling. His words of thanks leak through the window \n               to Inman, who stands, watching, listening.\n\n               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT\n\n               Monroe circulates, with Ada. He nods at a group of men, who \n               congregate in one part, not mingling. Their leader, TEAGUE, \n               might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a \n               black crow in the corner, eyes flashing. Ada doesn't know \n               them. Esco comes by. Monroe puts a hand on his arm.\n\n                                     MONROE\n                         Esco, our friends there --\n                              (indicating Teague \n                              and co.)\n                         -- they helped build the Chapel?\n\n                                     ESCO\n                         That's Teague and his boys.

One time the \n                         Teague family owned the whole of \n                         Cold Mountain.

Inman walks up the path \n               to the farmhouse, its borders flowering and pretty, a slave \n               woman weeding. He knocks on the door.

DAY\n\n               Monroe and Inman and Ada touring the farm. It's a biggish \n               property, over three hundred acres. And well-tended by the \n               dozen slave farmhands who work it, some of whom are dotted \n               about in the landscape. Rolling mountains dominate the view.\n\n                                     MONROE\n                              (expansive)\n                         I want to get sheep into this field. \n                         A big field doesn't look right without \n                         sheep. You're a lucky fellow, Mr. \n                         Inman, you've had this view all your \n                         life.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I think so.\n\n                                     MONROE\n                         It's a special view. I dragged my \n                         poor daughter to Cold Mountain from \n                         Charleston because of my Doctors -- \n                         they say my heart is weak -- so the \n                         air's meant to do me good. But it's \n                         the view I think heals.\n\n               Ada walking behind, comes alongside the two men, threading \n               her arm into her father's but, by so doing, also arriving \n               next to Inman.\n\n                                     MONROE\n                         I have to get on my visits.

DAY\n\n               From the window Ada watches the Cabriolet head towards town.\n\n               At the piano, she unwraps the leather lace from the package \n               of music. Inside the first book of music, there's a \n               DAGUERREOTYPE OF INMAN with his LeMats, a typical Confederate \n               pose. Some of the music has left its imprint on the picture, \n               the notes like a melody over Inman's face. Ada picks them \n               out on the piano.\n\n               The ebullient sound of Shape Singing. A noisy choir letting \n               rip --\n\n               INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, MAY 20TH, 1861. DAY\n\n               -- THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SINGING, MEN TO ONE SIDE: WOMEN TO \n               THE OTHER. Monroe conducts, sings. Inman is there, as is \n               Ada. He fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls.\n\n               The door bursts open. Young OAKLEY, apologetic nod to Monroe, \n               sits at the back, then leans forward, as the singing \n               continues, to say something to Rourke, who says something to \n               Butcher, the news spreading like wildfire. Rourke gets up, \n               leaves. Butcher gets up next, follows. Another man. Another.\n\n               Depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the \n               older men are singing and one side of the church is \n               practically empty.\n\n               Inman, remains, fixed on Ada. Who does not look round.\n\n               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY\n\n               Those left in the congregation now spill out into what has \n               become a melee as the NEWS OF SECESSION goes up. Enormous \n               excitement, particularly among the boys, who now seem \n               curiously attractive to the girls. Inman blinks out into the \n               sun, Ada finds him. They're awkward as they watch other \n               sweethearts embracing.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Well, you have your war.\n\n               TEAGUE AND HIS MEN COME RIDING UP THE STREET, their horses \n               clearing a path amongst the celebrating crowd.

We'll \n                         watch your sweethearts.\n\n               And he spurs on his horse, his fellow Home Guard falling in \n               behind, riding on over the ridge. Inman walks to Ada.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         You might be safer back in Charleston.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         But then who'll be waiting for you?\n\n               She puts a hand on his arm for a second. They both want to \n               get to the point of declaration but don't know how. They \n               stand, people noisy around them, those about to leave, those \n               about to be left.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I'm going to walk back inside the \n                         Chapel.\n\n               And he does so, making his meaning clear for her to follow.\n\n               INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY\n\n               Inman walks inside. Stands with his back to the door. It \n               opens and closes. Inman turns.

Inman sits at a bench.\n\n               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY\n\n               Monroe and Ada come into town in their cabriolet. They pass \n               under banners proclaiming the Confederate cause: Old Rip's \n               Awake! Watch out Yankees! The trap draws up by the Cold \n               Mountain General Store.

His room is \n               like a monk's cell. Nothing in it. Inman's trunk is packed.\n\n               He's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside \n               the boot, the other blacking it. There's a knock at the door.\n\n               He opens it. It's Ada. He abruptly closes the door on her.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY, ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY\n\n               Ada waits outside. She's not sure what's happening. Then \n               Inman opens the door. He's buttoning his shirt. His boots \n               are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished. Somebody \n               walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl. They separate \n               as the man passes them. They're tender, awkward.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         I found you this book.

It's the RECRUITMENT \n               PARADE and brings Rourke and Butcher racing down the stairs.\n\n               Inman pulls away from Ada as the boys hurtle for the front \n               door.\n\n                                     ROURKE\n                         Let's go!\n\n               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY\n\n               Rourke, Butcher, and then Inman appear in the doorway of the \n               Rooming House, and then fall in with the motley crew of \n               Volunteers AS THEY MARCH BY WITH THE BAND AND THE ENLISTED \n               SOLDIERS. The town is out to wish them well, parents, younger \n               brothers, sweethearts walking alongside their brave men. Ada \n               comes to the door of the Rooming House. Inman looks back and \n               sees her, but almost immediately loses her in the crowd.

It's a cauldron, and those able smash through \n               the wooden walls to make a breathing hole. Some have their \n               heads thrust out like crated poultry. INMAN IS IN THERE, \n               neck bandaged, its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace. \n               The light plays black and white through the boarded sides of \n               the boxcar, flashing on Inman's face as he drifts in and out \n               of consciousness. He focuses and sees the strange head of \n               STOBROD'S FIDDLE. Stobrod is serenading him, accompanied by \n               an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man, PANGLE, whose \n               grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic, \n               grim world. Inman is panicked, puts a hand to push the fiddle \n               away. His voice is a croak, spoiled.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I'm not dying.\n\n                                     STOBROD\n                              (to Pangle)\n                         What'd he say?\n\n                                     PANGLE\n                         Says he ain't about to die.\n\n                                     STOBROD\n                              (to Inman)\n                         Truth to tell they say you are, \n                         Soldier. We'll meet again, in the \n                         better world.\n\n               He changes his tune, and the tempo, finding a foot-slapping \n               rhythm, the two musicians grinning at each other. Inman lapses \n               back into unconsciousness. The rhythm becomes a hammering \n               sound...\n\n               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY\n\n               -- AS A MAN HAMMERS A TINTYPE OF HIS SON'S FACE into the \n               wooden porch of the Chapel, where it joins many other \n               portraits of those lost to the war. Monroe presides. One of \n               the slaves from Black Cove holds the ladder for the bereaved \n               father. Other families wait, with their own daguerreotype to \n               mount. It's a memorial service without bodies.\n\n               Riders approach. Home Guard. Teague brings his horse up \n               alongside Monroe at the Chapel door, tips his hat in \n               condolence to the bereaved families. With him is a young, \n               intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider, BOSIE, his hair \n               long, a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown.

At a bend they meet \n               a couple of riders, TWINS, from Teague's Home Guard, riding \n               furiously past them. Monroe reins in the trap and lets them \n               thunder past before continuing on their way home.

Ada has already taken the \n               reins and has driven up to the house. THE BARN IN WHICH THE \n               SLAVE FAMILY HAD LIVED IS ON FIRE. Monroe catches one of the \n               women, remonstrates with her. She's upset, distressed, one \n               of her sons comes back, pushes Monroe to the ground. They \n               hurry away. Monroe gets up, hurries to the fire.\n\n               A FIGURE SWINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE FLAMES, HANGING FROM A \n               BEAM.

Rows of beds, the wounded and the dying, are lodged \n               between some vestiges of the room's former glory.\n\n               SOME LOCAL WOMEN, conscious of their duty to the cause, are \n               brought through by an exhausted doctor, who's lost all his \n               grace. The windows are open, but it's still insufferably \n               hot, the muslin curtains barely moving.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         Most of these men will be dead by \n                         the morning or, if they're stubborn, \n                         by nightfall. I have other men outside \n                         in the quadrangle waiting for the \n                         beds.\n\n               The women try to process this, the attitude.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         So, any kind word will be a blessing.\n\n               One woman is overpowered by the stench, gags.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         It's the heat. I'm sorry. They rot.\n\n               The women begin to approach the beds.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         Don't pray. If they're not God fearing \n                         you can stir up a hornet's nest.\n\n               MRS. MORGAN, nervous, decent, sits next to INMAN. His mouth \n               is moving. She doesn't know what he's saying.\n\n                                     MRS. MORGAN\n                         I'm sorry, you want water?\n\n               She bends to him again. His voice is a faint croak.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         Pigeon River. Little East Fork.\n\n               The Doctor is on his exit, stops at the bed.\n\n                                     MRS. MORGAN\n                         I'm sorry. I don't know what he's \n                         saying.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         They ramble. Names of loved ones.\n\n                                     MRS. MORGAN\n                              (listening to Inman)\n                         Pigeon River. Is that a place? Cold \n                         Mountain?\n\n               The Doctor shrugs, not a detective, moves on, stops at the \n               man in the next bed. Has a brief look, calls to a nurse.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         This man is dead.\n\n               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Monroe and Ada are outside, a picnic at the summer table, \n               autumn leaves blowing up around them. Nearby the charred \n               skeleton of the barn. Ada gets up, clears away.\n\n                                     MONROE\n                         Thank you.\n                              (staying her for grace)\n                         For your Providence, Oh lord, we \n                         thank you.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Amen. That was the last of the ham.\n\n                                     MONROE\n                         It was delicious.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         I have to learn how to cook.\n\n                                     MONROE\n                         I was going to say something in \n                         Chapel. Perhaps some of the womenfolk \n                         will volunteer.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         I can't have people coming here and \n                         cooking for me!\n\n                                     MONROE\n                         It's my fault. I should have raised \n                         you less like a companion and more \n                         like a young woman. I'm sorry.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         I'm not sorry, but I don't know how \n                         we'll get through another winter.\n\n                                     MONROE\n                         Will you play me something? Something \n                         peaceful while I look over my sermon.\n\n               Ada takes the dishes away. He gets out his papers, his pen \n               and ink.\n\n               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK\n\n               ADA PLAYS THE PIANO. Chopin's Prelude in E Minor. Outside in \n               the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign \n               chair, and is hunched over his notes. The door of the parlour \n               is open and the music floats over to him as he works.\n\n               Ada plays. A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN appear at the window. Then \n               the steady drumming of a summer shower.\n\n                                     ADA\n                              (still playing)\n                         Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with \n                         you!\n\n               She plays some more. Monroe hasn't come in. The rain splashes \n               on to the window..\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Daddy, come inside before you drown!\n\n               After a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes \n               to the door. She stands at the doorway. MONROE'S SERMON IS \n               CAUGHT IN THE WIND AND BLOWS AROUND HIM, THE INK RUN TO\n\n               ABSTRACTIONS, his hand dropped and visible to Ada as, with \n               dread, she approaches. SHE CATCHES THE SODDEN PAPERS, CHASING \n               AFTER THEM, THEN REACHES HER DEAD FATHER.\n\n               He's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass \n               eyed. She leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs, \n               oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down \n               the lane.\n\n                                     ADA (V.O.)\n                         Dear Mr. Inman...\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT\n\n               INMAN'S FACE as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Mrs. \n               Morgan, the hospital volunteer, sits by Inman's bed. She \n               holds ADA'S UNOPENED LETTER, badly weather damaged, the pages \n               stuck together, the writing blurred where the ink has run.\n\n                                     MRS. MORGAN\n                         It's come to you by way of Virginia.\n\n               There are various dates, which she decodes.\n\n                                     MRS. MORGAN\n                         It's not too recent -- written this \n                         past winter. I'm afraid I can't read \n                         who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman,\n\n               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT\n\n               Ada is writing at her father's desk. A lonely room.\n\n                                     ADA (V.O.)\n                         -- I'm still waiting, as I promised \n                         I would, but I find myself alone and \n                         at the end of my wits --\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT\n\n               Mrs. Morgan reads to Inman, trying to decipher the letter:\n\n                                     MRS. MORGAN\n                         -- at the end of my wits, so now I \n                         say to you, plain as I can, come \n                         back to me. Come back to me is my \n                         request.\n                              (can't read the next \n                              bit)\n                         Then something I can't read, \n                         something, come back to me.\n\n               Inman is very still. Then, eyes glinting with determination, \n               gives a TINY NOD.\n\n                                     OFFICIAL (O.S.)\n                         By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor \n                         of this great state of North Carolina: \n                         any soldier turned deserter is guilty \n                         of treason and shall be hunted down \n                         like a dog. \n\n               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY\n\n               Ada walks down the hill from the Chapel. There is an absence \n               of young people, but the older folk are gathered round the \n               General Store where a UNIFORMED OFFICIAL is reading from a \n               document.\n\n                                     OFFICIAL\n                         -- Any man takes in a deserter is \n                         likewise guilty of treason.\n\n               The Official is flanked by Teague, Bosey and the twins, puffed \n               up with self-importance. Ada has to walk around him to enter \n               the store.\n\n                                     OFFICIAL\n                         The Home Guard is powered to enter \n                         any place it sees fit, without notice \n                         or constraint. Names of all deserters \n                         will be posted in every town, \n                         published in every newspaper.\n\n               INT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY\n\n               The Official continues outside as Ada enters. Ada approaches \n               Mrs Castlereagh, the owner.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Is there a letter for me?\n\n                                     MRS.

There's \n               another, more furtive, transaction to take place. Mrs \n               Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were \n               narcotics. Ada tears at the wrapping. It's a parcel of books.\n\n                                     MRS. CASTLEREAGH\n                         If folks knew I was taking deliveries \n                         from the North.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         I know.

Already one boy gone, another \n                         with his leg took off at the knee. \n                         That's enough.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         What do you hear?\n\n                                     MRS.

GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY\n\n               Ada emerges, almost collides with Teague. She wriggles past \n               him, tries to make her package invisible.\n\n               EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM - DAY\n\n               IT'S WINTER. A solitary RIDER jogs his horse through the \n               frost, towards Black Cove farm.\n\n               Ada is working at a handpump, failing to coax water from the \n               well. She's wrapped in blankets. The farm is somewhat unkempt \n               and so is she. The hem of her skirt is frayed. She rips at \n               it tearing off a strip of material, which she binds around \n               the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism. Then she \n               looks up to see the horseman approaching. It's Teague. Ada \n               immediately heads inside the house.\n\n               Teague arrives at the house, takes a brace of RABBITS from \n               his saddlebag. He heads for the gate. The gate needs oiling, \n               the path is overgrown, he looks at the pump handle, the \n               abandoned pitcher.\n\n               Ada opens the door, pinning her hair.\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                         It's taken me too long, but I've \n                         come to pay my respects.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Thank you.\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                              (hands over the rabbits)\n                         I reckoned you might need fattening \n                         up.\n\n               Ada takes them.

DAY\n\n               EVERYWHERE SIGNS OF PROFOUND NEGLECT, like a Grimm's fairy \n               tale of a deserted house. The fields are overgrown with weeds, \n               the gardens abandoned. The chickens have deserted the henhouse \n               and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the \n               packed dirt.\n\n               Sally and Esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the \n               chickens, and knock at the door.\n\n                                     SALLY\n                         Ada!

Ada is there, crouching \n               in her hidey-hole, a blanket on the ground, her book. She \n               wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed.\n\n                                     ESCO\n                         Will you look at the state of this \n                         place!\n\n                                     SALLY\n                         Poor soul.

As the rooster approaches, Ada shudders, tries to \n               shoo it away without alerting her presence. Ada peers through \n               the boxwood as Sally and Esco close the gate and recede. The \n               rooster comes at her again. She rises up, kicking out at it, \n               while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her. Ada runs \n               from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which \n               continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house.\n\n               INT.

Now she shucks off the \n               dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement. There \n               isn't one, so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket \n               for something less dirty.\n\n               INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM.

She opens a wardrobe, finds one of \n               his coats, puts it on. It's much too big, and she rolls up \n               the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in \n               a swivel mirror.

Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a \n               pair of boots. He accumulates a little pile.

The trick of the glass and the \n               watery disc of the well surface. A buzzing in Ada's ears, \n               something like a distant music.

SUNKEN FOREST. DAY\n\n               Inman finds himself in A SUNKEN FOREST OF PINE. He moves \n               warily, his beard longer, his figure gaunt, his clothes \n               weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal.\n\n               He hears DOGS BARKING IN THE DISTANCE, FAINT SHOUTS. He picks \n               up his pace, skirts round the swampy lake.\n\n               EXT. CAPE FEAR RIVER. DUSK\n\n               Inman comes to the bank of a HUGE RIVER. The water, as the \n               light begins to go, is the color of mud, with bubbles, \n               belching to the surface, full of ugly prominent. Inman is \n               almost jogging now, an ear tracking his still distant \n               pursuers. The river is too wide to contemplate swimming and \n               now it begins to curve left, forcing him -- against his \n               judgment, to circle back. He approaches A SMALL JETTY.\n\n               A sign: Ferry $5. Yell Loud.\n\n               On the far bank there's A CABIN ON STILTS above the highwater \n               mark. Inman calls out, reluctantly, his voice still a kind \n               of growl. Then again.\n\n               A TINY FIGURE steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping \n               into a small canoe. The canoe heads against the current, the \n               rower's back bent with the effort. As the canoe approaches, \n               Inman sees that the ferryman is, in fact, A YOUNG GIRL, not \n               eighteen. She doesn't look at him. He produces five dollars. \n               She eyes the bill with contempt.\n\n                                     FERRYGIRL\n                         For five dollars I wouldn't give a \n                         parched man a dipper of this \n                         riverwater.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         Sign says ferry, five dollars.\n\n                                     FERRYGIRL\n                         This look like a ferry? My Daddy's \n                         dead, or gone off to the Federals, \n                         don't matter which. I'm the way across \n                         now.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         What's the name of this thing?\n\n                                     FERRYGIRL\n                         Nothing but the mighty Cape Fear \n                         River, is all.\n\n               A dog barks in the distance. Getting closer. Inman turns to \n               the sound. The Ferrygirl is well aware of her leverage.\n\n                                     FERRYGIRL\n                         Nobody crosses this water unless \n                         they're running from someplace. Some \n                         cross one way, some the other: makes \n                         no difference, they're all running. \n                         You want to wait for your friends?\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I can give you thirty dollars script.\n\n                                     FERRYGIRL\n                         Let's go.\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Hey! Hey! Wait!\n\n               Inman is astonished to see VEASEY stumble out of the trees. \n               His head is shaved, his face bruised and swollen, his clothes \n               castoffs and ill-fitting, cinched at the waist with rope. He \n               stumbles towards Inman, urging him to get on with the journey.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         Keep going. We're both in trouble.\n\n               He gets straight into the canoe.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         No. Get out.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         It's Homeguard. Made me tell them \n                         all about you.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I should have shot you when I had \n                         the chance.\n\n               Shouts, more barking. Inman jumps in the canoe, and they're \n               off. The Ferrygirl turns the boat around, rows them away \n               from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for \n               the thousandth time.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         I'm not looking for revenge, by the \n                         way.

Which was hard. \n                         I was vain about my hair.\n                              (to Ferrygirl)\n                         I had good curls. But I deserved it. \n                         I'm the Reverend Veasey. Have I seen \n                         you in church?\n\n               Inman sits, scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers. The \n               sun is sinking fast.\n\n                                     FERRYGIRL\n                         I'm saving for a cowhide, and when I \n                         get it I aim to get a saddle made, \n                         and when I get me a saddle I'll save \n                         for a horse, and when I got a horse \n                         I'll throw on the saddle, and then \n                         you won't see my sorry ass round \n                         this swamp again.\n\n               She has no love for the river. Another gurgle of viscous \n               bubbles around the canoe.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         What's that?\n\n                                     FERRYGIRL\n                         Catfish. 'gator. Keep your hand in \n                         the boat. Already looks like some \n                         critter chewed his neck.\n                              (she looks at Inman)\n                         Thirty more dollars, we can go to \n                         the cabin. I'll pull this dress over \n                         my head.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                              (excited)\n                         Have we got thirty dollars?\n\n               A sharp sound, a tiny thwack of ball on meat. The Ferrygirl \n               SUDDENLY SLUMPS BACK and falls into the water.\n\n               Veasey grabs out at the oar, but it goes, too. The girl sinks \n               quickly, A BLOODY GAP to the side of her head. Inman, on his \n               knees and stretching, can't help her. Then a second noise as \n               A HOLE THE SIZE OF A FIST appears in the canoe, just at \n               waterlevel. Water pours into the canoe. Dogs bark, and now \n               FIGURES are visible at the jetty. HOME GUARD. One of them \n               has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot. Inman \n               can see him sighting the rifle. They lie flat in the canoe.\n\n               ANOTHER GREAT FIST OF WOOD is gouged out. Now the boat is \n               almost full of water. Veasey spits out a foul mouthful. INMAN \n               ROCKS THE CANOE AND LETS IT TURN OVER ONTO THEM, Veasey \n               surfaces from under it, clutching the wood as a raft, but \n               the canoe CATCHES INMAN A BLOW TO HIS HEAD and he sinks. \n               Veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong, \n               holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets the \n               current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, then \n               up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver its \n               assault, another shot into the boat, another into the water \n               near to Veasey's arm.\n\n               THE GIRL'S BODY comes by them, carried by the river, the \n               dress billowing out almost covering her head. The sun has \n               gone, the light fading, the canoe sliding downriver away \n               from their aggressors.\n\n               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CAPE FEAR. NIGHT\n\n               In the moonlight, the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and \n               Veasey drags a half-drowned Inman to land, both of them \n               retching with the vile river water. AN ALLIGATOR eases into \n               the river not ten feet from where they lie, lungs heaving. \n               They get up. Veasey to his feet, Inman to his knees.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         You okay?\n\n               Inman nods, coughs. And Veasey AIMS A KICK at Inman's head, \n               knocking him back into the mud.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         Jesus, god!\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         I figure that righteous, given our \n                         history.

DUSK\n\n               Ada arrives in the kitchen. They've got it under control \n               now, scrubbed and orderly. She puts the sack down next to \n               another one. Her hands are calloused, the finger nails cracked \n               and ruined, stripes of earth under them.

RIVER, EN ROUTE TO SALISBURY. DAY\n\n               Inman stands in the river, hoping to catch a fish, trying to \n               concentrate.

Inman \n               splashes out of the water, pushes Veasey down, silencing \n               him. The riders pass.\n\n               Veasey spots something shining in the grass, picks it up. \n               IT'S A LONG TWO-HANDED SAW.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         Hey!

Veasey follows, experimenting \n               with the saw's music when flexed. Inman stalks on.\n\n               EXT. NEAR A FORD. DAY\n\n               Inman way ahead, full of purpose.

That's either in \n                         the Good Book or I made it up.\n\n               Inman suddenly stops, scowling, puts up a hand, listens.\n\n               Inman carefully scouts the track then, with great caution, \n               edges towards the river bank.\n\n               A HEAVY SET MAN labours in the water. He's contemplating THE \n               HUGE BLACK CARCASS OF A BULL which has slipped into the ford \n               and died.

Ain't that sweet?\n\n               SHE PULLS INMAN TO HIS FEET, KISSES HIM, THEN TURNS HER BACK \n               AND LIES FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE, HER BARE ASS UNDULATING IN \n               THE AIR.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         You just get on and ride me all the \n                         way to China.\n\n               He doesn't move, except to sway, eyes glazed. She turns.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         You shy?

He's in a swoon, \n               surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her \n               head. ON CUE, THE DOOR CRASHES OPEN AND HE'S STARING DOWN \n               THE BARREL OF JUNIOR'S SHOTGUN.\n\n               As Lila turns, Junior KICKS HER violently in the head, \n               knocking her over.\n\n                                     JUNIOR\n                         You little bitch! Look at you! Cover \n                         yourself up!\n\n               NEXT HE SWINGS THE SHOTGUN BARREL AGAINST THE SIDE OF INMAN'S \n               HEAD. Inman falls back. Junior goes to the door and whistles.\n\n               AND WITH THAT THE ROOM FILLS UP WITH A GROUP OF HOME GUARD \n               BRISTLING WITH WEAPONS AND PURPOSE. THEY SEIZE INMAN, DRAG \n               HIM OUT AS JUNIOR SPITS AND KICKS AT HIM.\n\n               INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT\n\n               Lila enters the smokehouse, hand to her bruised head. VEASEY'S \n               ON THE FLOOR, WITH DOLLY ASTRIDE HIM, HIS ARM CRUSHING A \n               NAKED MAE INTO AN EMBRACE.

JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT\n\n               Veasey led out, a CHAIN GANG waiting -- a bedraggled \n               collection of prisoners, slaves, deserters -- and now INMAN. \n               Veasey is joined to the line. It starts to rain.\n\n               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY\n\n               Ruby and Ada at the door of the Swanger house. They both \n               wear Monroe's clothes by now, like two little men. THEY'RE \n               CARRYING A SMALL SACK, A PIE UNDER A CLOTH.

A PATH. DRIVING RAIN. NIGHT\n\n               The Home Guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain \n               tips down. Between the horses, unprotected and drenched, \n               their prisoners trudge along the muddy path. Inman and Veasey \n               among them. Veasey has grown some beard.\n\n               AN OLDER MAN COLLAPSES, lies where he falls, not moving.\n\n               There's a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him. He \n               picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man. He \n               doesn't move.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         He's dead.\n\n               The horses plough on. Inman shouts to BROWN, the leader.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         This man's dead!\n\n               Nobody pays any attention. He has to drag the body.\n\n               EXT. VEASEY TOWN. DAY\n\n               THE HOME GUARD ESCORT THE PRISONERS PAST VEASEY'S OLD CHURCH.\n\n               More days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners, \n               Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced. The \n               Home Guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the \n               prisoners to a horse rail.\n\n               Citizens go by, Veasey knows them all. Some of them spit \n               contemptuously at the Deserters. None of them recognise \n               Veasey.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         Am I so altered that they don't see \n                         me?\n\n               Somebody walks by with a young child.\n\n               Veasey looks at Inman.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         I christened that child.\n\n               The child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away \n               from the chain gang by his mother. One of the other prisoners, \n               SHEFFIELD, leans in to Inman, his voice low.\n\n                                     SHEFFIELD\n                         I'm looking to get out of this.

One of the \n               women is pregnant. Veasey studies the group, sees the pregnant \n               woman, recognizes her.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                              (mesmerized)\n                         That's Rebecca.

She \n               turns at the sound of her name, stops, is confused. She sees \n               Veasey and approaches, appalled at his condition.\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                         Mas?\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         Is it well with you?\n                              (Rebecca nods)\n                         I've been repenting for what I did. \n                         I've walked the road of atonement.\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                         Your curls is all gone.\n\n               THE GUARD KICKS HIM.\n\n                                     GUARD\n                         Hey!\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                              (holding his head, to \n                              Rebecca)\n                         God Bless you.\n\n               Rebecca, reluctant, rejoins the other slaves, walks away \n               with them, but then turns back to look at Veasey. She clearly \n               cares about him. And seeing her has somehow broken his heart.\n\n               He turns away from Inman, towards Sheffield.\n\n                                     VEASEY\n                         I'm with you. I got a baby coming.\n\n               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY\n\n               THE CHAIN GANG TRUDGES DOWN THE TRACK, horses on either side \n               of them, steep banks forming a V for the railroad. A TRAIN \n               IS COMING. Brown rides up to the prisoners, herds them off \n               the track. The train approaches quite slowly -- the boxcars \n               full of wounded soldiers. Some of the Home Guard dismount, \n               take out pipes. The prisoners wait, one of them sits down.\n\n               Sheffield says something to Veasey, who casually yanks up \n               the sitting prisoner. Inman suddenly understands what's going \n               to happen. The train is almost on them.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         No!\n\n               But it's too late. SHEFFIELD JERKS FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE \n               TRAIN, PULLING ALL THE OTHERS WITH HIM, their reluctance \n               tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming \n               train.\n\n               SOMEHOW THE CHAIN GANG GETS ACROSS THE TRACK, stumbling and \n               chaotic, the chains yanking tight, then loose, the tight \n               causing a collapse, the loose a recovery.\n\n               They run alongside the train, blocking themselves from the \n               fire of the Guard, Sheffield screaming tactics -- and then, \n               as the train starts to pull past them, they run up the bank, \n               now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit.\n\n               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIN THE HOME GUARD HAVE REMOUNTED \n               THEIR HORSES AND ARE RIDING HARD ALONGSIDE IT. Then they \n               have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top \n               of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along \n               the ridge. Sheffield's yelling with adrenaline, Veasey joins \n               in, elated. One of the guards raises a rifle, steadies himself \n               on his horse, FIRES. He catches Veasey, who crumples, spinning \n               round and falling down the bank, until Inman uses all his \n               strength and practically lifts him in the air. The chain \n               recovers and works back up the bank.\n\n               But then A SECOND BULLET catches another prisoner and this \n               time the effect is catastrophic -- THE WHOLE GANG JUST FLIPS \n               OVER AND PLUMMETS DOWN THE BANK. The Home Guard approach, \n               firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch \n               by the side of the track. Until all movement ceases. Inman \n               has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely, almost \n               completely covering his face. Brown arrives, considers the \n               carnage.\n\n                                     BROWN\n                         Get these sacks of shit under the \n                         ground.\n\n               INT. BARN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN\n\n               Ada's milking. It's barely daylight. She's slowly becoming a \n               country girl. Ruby appears in the doorway.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         Someone's been in the corncrib.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         You sure?\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         It's a coon or possum. Scratched out \n                         a fist hole in the side. This place! \n                         I'm telling you -- we grow, others \n                         eat. I'll go into town, take the \n                         last of the cider and trade for a \n                         trap.\n\n               INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY\n\n               Ada is in Monroe's bedroom, looks out as Ruby goes off to \n               town, jugs of cider swung either side of the horse. Ada goes \n               over to Monroe's closet, pulls out some clothes.\n\n               EXT. THE WINTER GARDEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY\n\n               Ada buttons Monroe's dress coat and completes the SCARECROW \n               she's spent the day making, save for the hat, which she now \n               fixes on, pushing in a hat pin to secure it. She's made a \n               stern black thing and steps back to consider it.\n\n               Horsemen come riding along the lane. It's Teague and his \n               men.\n\n               He doesn't stop but raises his hat to Ada.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY\n\n               Ada looks out at the Winter Garden. From that distance it \n               really does look like her father out in the field, arms \n               outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him. She finds \n               it unbearable, her tears coming, runs out into the fields, \n               attacks the scarecrow, pulling off the hat, the clothes...\n\n               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. MORNING\n\n               THE SOUND OF TINY BELLS. A misty drizzle. A GOAT snuffles \n               around in the freshly turned dirt: A hand, pale and wet, \n               protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies \n               of the murdered Chain Gang.\n\n               SOMETHING SHIFTS UNDER THE DIRT, breaking the surface. Inman \n               wedged under three or four corpses -- their limbs and chains \n               wrapped around him, has regained consciousness. He coughs, \n               can't breathe properly, tries to work himself some air, \n               spitting out dirt. He makes a noise to distract the goat, \n               rattling the chains. Inman rears up, the bodies slithering \n               off him, but even then the animal only retreats a yard or \n               two. VEASEY SLIDES FACE UP, A BULLET IN HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A \n               MYSTICAL THIRD EYE. Inman feels a surprising loss and \n               tenderness. He heaves again, groaning with the pain of new \n               and old wounds.\n\n               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY\n\n               Ruby rides back from town along the river. An ugly looking \n               trap tied over the horses and three or four bulging sacks. \n               By an abandoned mill she sees the Home Guard under the trees.\n\n               She slows up.\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                         What you looking to catch?\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         What?\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                         With that trap.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         We got some critter stealing our \n                         corn.\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                         Still but the two of you up there, \n                         is it?\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         You know it.\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                         When we get a cold night, camped \n                         out, trying to keep the rule of law, \n                         protecting girls like you from \n                         Federals and deserters, that's a \n                         thought warms us\n                              (to his men)\n                         ain't it? -- the two of you up there \n                         on my Grand-daddy's farm, dressed in \n                         men's clothes.

She rides around the bend -- she's not far \n               from the Swanger farm.\n\n               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY\n\n               Goats, their bells tinkling, munch around the tracks. One of \n               them turns at a noise -- a GROTESQUE VISION -- A MOVING, \n               SEETHING MOUND OF DIRT. It's Inman, inching along the \n               embankment, the chain of dead bodies in tow, a macabre tug \n               of war. He considers the goats, they consider him. He rears \n               up and finds himself STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN.\n\n               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY\n\n               Sally is pinning out white sheets, they're filling out like \n               sails in the afternoon wind. Ruby rides up. Sally seems a \n               little vexed to see her. She walks down to the gate.\n\n                                     SALLY\n                         Ruby...\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         I'm not stopping, Sally. I'm not \n                         snooping neither. Just you should \n                         know Teague and his boys are lurking \n                         down by Pigeon River, the old mill.\n\n                                     SALLY\n                              (after a beat)\n                         You tell Ada that was a good pie.\n\n               Ruby rides off. Sally watches, then goes inside the house, \n               her energy changing immediately, as if she might faint.\n\n               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. AFTERNOON\n\n               HARSH WHISTLES. A secret place, in the heart of a forest. \n               There's the answering sound of SMALL BELLS, a chorus of them. \n               Inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter. Goats \n               appear, they herd around the figure dragging the litter. \n               IT'S AN OLD WOMAN, silver haired, her face a leather map, \n               her clothes leather, everything about her like old leather. \n               HER NAME IS MADDY.\n\n               She and Inman round a bend and there's Maddy's house -- AN \n               OLD CARAVAN, long grown into the ground and plaited with \n               vines and creepers. Inman tries to sit up. An old whiskered \n               BILLYGOAT butts up against Inman, knocks him down. Maddy \n               pays no attention to the struggle, heads inside her caravan.\n\n                                     MADDY\n                         Mind that Billy, he's the jealous \n                         kind.\n\n               She emerges, with a bowl of water, rags, washes his face, \n               pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to \n               the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal. Inman is \n               barely conscious, he groans, trying to defend himself.\n\n                                     MADDY\n                         Pay no attention to me.

She rides past the winter garden, \n               admires THE SCARECROW -- WHICH NOW PARODIES ADA, the same \n               outfit she once wore to visit Inman, the same dress, same \n               hat.

He's referring there to \n                         us.\n                              (to Esco)\n                         So you won't care if we take a look \n                         around?\n\n                                     ESCO\n                         What I gotta give you? A chicken? A \n                         lamb?\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                              (shrugs)\n                         Sure.\n\n                                     ESCO\n                         Right then.\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                         Thing is -- you got one barrel and \n                         there's five of us. Not a fair fight.\n\n               BOSIE SUDDENLY DROPS OFF HIS HORSE, ROLLS ON THE GROUND.\n\n                                     BOSIE\n                         Bogey Man! Bogey Man!\n\n               Esco is momentarily distracted and, in that instant, Mo kicks \n               out at him, knocking the gun from his hands, which fires \n               into the air, a shocking sound.\n\n               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY\n\n               Ruby and Ada digging a trench by the smokehouse, laying in \n               the pale heads of cabbage. They hear the distant shot.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         What's that?\n\n               They stop. Listen. Look at each other, start running.\n\n               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY\n\n               Jo sets on Esco, knocking him-backwards into a sheet, where \n               it gets twisted, while Jo kicks and punches, little spots of \n               blood staining the sheet with each blow. MO PULLS OUT HIS \n               SABRE AND RUNS ESCO THROUGH, LEAVES THE SABRE IN DEEP, PINNING \n               ESCO TO THE SHEET, THEN SPINNING HIM ROUND IN THE SHEET SO \n               THAT IT TIGHTENS. A stain grows out from the blade, huge and \n               spreading. Teague walks to Esco.\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                         You're harbouring deserters. I can \n                         confiscate every animal on this farm, \n                         every plate, every sheet, every little \n                         pellet of chicken shit -- I can \n                         confiscate your old lady's asshole, \n                         so don't offer me a bird.\n\n               Sally runs out, screaming. She tries to pull out the sabre.\n\n               MO REVERSES HIS RIFLE AND CLUBS HER TO THE GROUND.\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                              (sharply)\n                         Hey!\n\n               Mo backs away. Sally is screaming. She watches, helpless, as \n               Esco dies in front of her, the sheet growing a darker red.\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                         You got your bait. Set it on the \n                         hook.\n\n               BOSIE, SMILING, FETCHES A ROPE FROM HIS HORSE, ALREADY NOOSED \n               AT ONE END. HE FLIPS THE LOOP OVER SALLY'S HEAD.\n\n               INT. BARN, SWANGER FARM. DAY\n\n               ELLIS AND ACTON SWANGER emerge from their hiding places, \n               unable to bear the sound of their mother's screams. They're \n               carrying an axe, a pitchfork, mad for revenge.\n\n               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY\n\n               BOSIE IS DOING SOME SORT OF DANCE ALONG THE FENCE RAIL. He's \n               very graceful, his hair flying, his hands out, one finger \n               nail extremely long, his boots stamping down on the fence.\n\n               UNDER HIS STOMPING FEET, THE RAIL POST IS PRESSED ON SALLY \n               SWANGER'S THUMBS. She can't scream any longer, because the \n               noose has practically strangled her. The rope's tied off to \n               Bosie's horse, which yanks on the noose with every slight \n               movement. Sally is prostrate in the dirt.\n\n               Her two boys come running from the barn. TEAGUE CASUALLY, \n               SHOOTS ELLIS WITH HIS RIFLE. BOSIE LETS ACTON GET ALL THE \n               WAY TOWARDS HIM AND THEN SHOOTS HIM FROM A YARD AWAY, THE \n               GUN SUDDENLY SPRINGING INTO HIS HAND. AS ACTON FALLS, BOSIE \n               DOES A FLIP TO DIVE OFF THE POST AND LAND ON HIS FEET NEXT \n               TO ACTON'S BODY.\n\n               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DUSK\n\n               Ada and Ruby, riding together on the horse, arrive at the \n               Swangers.\n\n               SALLY IS STILL PINNED UNDER THE FENCE POST. The noose around \n               her neck has been tied off to the post so that she can't \n               move. There's a bloody sheet draped over the edge of the \n               well. Blood on the ground. Ruby heaves at the fence.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         I can't get this damn thing off her.\n\n                                     ADA\n                              (at the well, looking \n                              down)\n                         Dear Lord in heaven.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         Ada, I can't get this off her!\n\n               Ada runs over. They struggle, can't lift it. Sally's lips \n               are moving.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         What darling? What?\n\n               She bends down, listens to her. Looks up at Ada.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         She's saying don't bother.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Wait!\n\n               She grabs a thick log off the stack, staggers back and in a \n               second they've inserted it into the fence and levered it up \n               and away from Sally's hands. They fall back onto the dirt.\n\n               Ruby cradles Sally. Ada nods towards the well.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         There's someone down there. I think \n                         it's Esco.\n\n               Ruby looks over at the well, then at Ada.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         This world won't stand long. God \n                         won't let it stand this way long.\n\n               INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY\n\n               An exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs, \n               wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary \n               store. Inman wakes up. He finds himself in a small cot, \n               wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck. He doesn't know \n               where he is or how long he's been there.\n\n               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY\n\n               Maddy's sitting on a stool. There's a circle of stones where \n               her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it. Inman emerges \n               from the caravan. He's pale and unsteady.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         How long have I been sleeping?\n\n                                     MADDY\n                         Not long enough.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I can't stop here.

Cut short my \n                         young life? Sit down before you fall \n                         down.\n\n               She calls over a little goat. It ambles over affectionately \n               and nuzzles into her hand. She strokes it and scratches under \n               the chin. The creature gets increasingly tranquil.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         How long you been up here?\n\n                                     MADDY\n                         What year are we?

I've seen \n                         most of the world anyway, Richmond \n                         in the North, south almost to \n                         Charleston. You're going somewhere \n                         or you are somewhere, what's the \n                         difference?\n\n               She's still stroking the goat.

I can't \n                         abide a chicken, but a goat gives \n                         you company and milk and cheese and \n                         then, when you need it, good meat.\n\n               In a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has SLIT \n               THE THROAT OF THE GOAT, putting the bowl underneath its neck \n               to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as \n               if it were only surprised and not dying.\n\n                                     MADDY\n                         So you've been fighting?\n\n                                     INMAN\n                              (as if he might break)\n                         I could be at killing for days \n                         sometimes, in the hand to hand, my \n                         feet against the feet of my enemy \n                         and I always killed him and he never \n                         killed me.\n\n                                     MADDY\n                         He gave it a try, to look at you.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I guess he did.\n\n                                     MADDY\n                         See I think there's a plan. There's \n                         a design. For each and every one of \n                         us.\n\n               During this she's shucked the skin off the goat with the \n               authority of someone who's done this a thousand times.\n\n                                     MADDY\n                         You look at nature, a bird flies \n                         somewhere, picks up a seed, shits \n                         the seed out, a plant grows. Bird's \n                         got a job, seed's got a job.\n\n               And the goat is now thin and pink, eyes bulging, a piece of \n               meat.\n\n               INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. EVENING\n\n               A woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which \n               pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling \n               in a pan.\n\n               INMAN IS EATING LIKE A MAN POSSESSED, WRAPPING THE MEAT IN \n               CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH. Maddy watches \n               him, adds another mound of meat to his plate.

She hands him a \n               bulging goatskin satchel.\n\n                                     MADDY\n                         That's medicine and goatmeat.

Inman nods, \n               knows that she doesn't want a fuss, although he wants to \n               make one, and turns himself, heads away from the caravan.\n\n               EXT. WOODS. DAY\n\n               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. A TURKEY calls. And again.\n\n               JUNIOR is hunting. He creeps through this clearing, eyes \n               peeled for the turkey, gun at the ready. His dog growls, and \n               he puts a hand over its mouth. He listens. Another call.\n\n               Junior moves, without sound, in its direction, stops for \n               several seconds under a tree, listening. He looks up. INMAN \n               IS PERCHED IN THE TREE. THE PISTOL FLASHES IN HIS HAND.\n\n               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY\n\n               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman drags Junior's corpse in to the \n               yard. The dogs whine and slobber over the body. Inman goes \n               straight into the Smoke House.\n\n               INT. SMOKE HOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY\n\n               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman reaches behind the stove and \n               retrieves his bag. He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram, \n               opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers, \n               as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing.\n\n               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY\n\n               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman emerges with his bag, LeMats at \n               the ready. The women are all keening over the corpse, as it \n               a saint had passed away. Dogs, women all howling. A chicken \n               bobs in, investigates the glob of blood on Junior's skull.\n\n               Inman walks away, doesn't look at the women, who don't look \n               at him.\n\n               INT. RUBY'S ROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN\n\n               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Ruby wakes up. Looks out of the window.\n\n               Ada, also woken, comes into Ruby's room. STOBROD IS OUTSIDE \n               WITH PANGLE, VIOLIN AND BANJO. Ruby opens the window, \n               scowling. Stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food, \n               points at Pangle in his new coat. Pangle waves.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         Get on back where you came from!\n\n               Stobrod and Pangle smile and hurry away.\n\n               EXT. PATH IN HILL COUNTRY. DAY\n\n               WINTER SETTING IN. Inman, increasingly a stick figure in the \n               landscape, wasted and fragile, trudges along through fallen \n               leaves. He still limps from the leg irons. No shelter \n               anywhere. He unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat \n               meat and corn bread. He walks and eats, fishes out a lozenge, \n               tries to swallow it, washes it down with a drink from his \n               flask. Opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease \n               into his neck and ankle. The path splits. He doesn't know \n               which way to go, A CROW repeatedly caws off to the left and, \n               taking it as a sign, Inman goes in that direction.\n\n                                     ADA (V.O.)\n                         My love for Heathcliff resembles the \n                         eternal rocks beneath\n\n               INT.

SMALL WOOD. NIGHT\n\n               DRIVING RAIN. Inman shelters under a huge tree, whose split \n               trunk provides a mean shelter. He inserts himself into the \n               cleft of it, a black thing in a black tree, like a troll. He \n               stands, shivers, sodden, desolate.\n\n               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT\n\n               A LITTLE CABIN. Its lights coming through square windows \n               like a chinese lantern. Inman considers it, the risk versus \n               the shelter.\n\n               The sleet still pelts down on him and he decides to approach.\n\n               Closer he can hear a sound coming from the house. IT'S A \n               BABY'S INCESSANT CRY. HE SEES A YOUNG WOMAN WALKING ROUND \n               AND ROUND IN THE ROOM, CLUTCHING THE BABY WRAPPED UP IN A \n               QUILT.\n\n               Inman knocks hard on the door. The light from the lamp goes \n               out, although the fire still gives the room a clear glow.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I'm one man alone.

I'll \n                         be on my way come morning.\n\n               No answer. Inman accepts this as a rebuttal, and trudges \n               back towards the road.\n\n                                     SARA (V.O.)\n                         I've got a rifle.\n\n               Inman turns.

The \n               baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it. \n               The woman is already at the little stove. She turns to him. \n               She's painfully beautiful. But sad and fragile. Inman, despite \n               himself, is mesmerized.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         Thank you.\n\n                                     SARA\n                         I'm alone here, as you can see, with \n                         my baby.

Never saw \n                         his boy.\n\n               She never once looks at him.

Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire.\n\n               He picks up the onion, bites into it.

She carries a pile of clothing, a \n               pair of boots. It's still wretched outside, she hugs the \n               house, the porch barely offering shelter. INMAN FOLLOWS, \n               with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his \n               arm. She hands him the clothes.\n\n                                     SARA\n                         You look about his size. He was \n                         another man straight up and down.\n\n               There's a palpable attraction between them, so that every \n               exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge.\n\n                                     SARA\n                         I don't even have a blanket.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I got a blanket.\n\n                                     SARA\n                         I'll leave you the lamp.\n\n               By the dim light, Inman peels off his clothes, sets to work \n               with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean. \n               He can be seen from the window and finds himself turning \n               away to pull off his pants.\n\n               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT\n\n               Sara sits at the cot, still singing to the baby, then gets \n               up, goes to the window, sees Inman dressing, walks to the \n               door, lets it open a little, but not so as she can be seen.\n\n                                     SARA\n                         They fit?\n\n                                     INMAN (O.S.)\n                         Pretty much.

SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT\n\n               Inman settles down into the corncrib. He's cold and everything \n               is damp and lumpy and uncomfortable. He pulls his thin blanket \n               around him. The wind is howling. He levers himself up, looks \n               at the house with its warm invitation, can almost feel Sara \n               in there. He reluctantly settles down again.\n\n               HE HEARS A NOISE, STEPS APPROACHING. HE REACHES FOR THE LEMATS \n               UNDER THE BLANKETS.\n\n                                     SARA\n                         Will you come inside?\n\n               She stands in a shift, a blanket over her shoulders. Her \n               body under the cotton very clear to him. She turns and goes \n               back inside.\n\n               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT\n\n               Inman comes in.

I'll try.\n\n               He sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then \n               removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers. There's \n               an electric space between them. Then Sara begins to cry, \n               pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him.\n\n               SHE SOBS, SHUDDERING IN THE BED.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         I'll go.

A \n               FIDDLE PLAYS HEAVY WITH YEARNING...\n\n               INT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. CHRISTMAS DAY. NIGHT\n\n               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing \n               hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering \n               it. They're in the abandoned Mill, a derelict space, which \n               has been cheered up with some rudimentary Christmas \n               decorations. Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost \n               completely white. Some token presents. Pangle is picking at \n               a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, GEORGIA, \n               with a harmonica. As they play:\n\n                                     PANGLE\n                              (of Sally)\n                         She don't speak.\n\n                                     STOBROD\n                         She can't speak.

Ruby sits next to Ada, fiddles with her bracelets, \n               slips one from Ada's wrist and slides it over her own.\n\n               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN.

Inman watches, pulling on his \n               shirt, shivering, then his boots.\n\n               Sara is standing in front of the hogpen, as if to protect \n               the animal, but one of the soldiers, PISTOL, barges her to \n               one side, toppling her, and opens the gate, starts herding \n               the hog out into the yard. A second soldier, NYM, emerges \n               from the cabin, carrying Ethan. Sara starts up, struggles \n               with him, is again knocked down.\n\n               INMAN HAS TO WATCH AS THEY DRAG HER OVER TO A FENCE POST AND \n               ROPE HER TO IT THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OFF THE BABY AND LAY IT \n               ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD.\n\n               Then Sara starts to scream.\n\n               Inman is dressed. Boots on. He looks back at the yard. The \n               men sitting, smoking, prepared to wait, their breath coming \n               out in gusts in the freezing air. Flakes of snow fall.\n\n                                     PISTOL\n                         We got all day.\n\n                                     SARA\n                         My baby's sick! Cover him up! He's \n                         shaking! Have some pity.\n\n               A third Federal, BARDOLPH, chases after the chickens, gathers \n               them up.\n\n                                     SARA\n                         I got nothing. I swear.\n\n               Nym gets close to her, putting his rifle to her chest.\n\n                                     NYM\n                         That ain't necessarily so.\n\n                                     SARA\n                         Yes! Take me inside! Let's all go \n                         inside! Take my baby inside and then \n                         we'll do whatever you want.\n\n               Nym unties her. Pistol has a rope around the hog and now \n               leads it towards the horses.\n\n                                     SARA\n                              (screaming)\n                         There's nothing! You take that hog \n                         I'm as good as dead. Cover up my \n                         boy!\n\n               She's wailing, an unbearable ululation. NYM SLAPS HER, TWICE, \n               HARD.\n\n               INT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY\n\n               The door is kicked open. Nym pushes Sara inside, kicks the \n               door shut, REVEALING INMAN STANDING BEHIND IT.\n\n               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY\n\n               Bardolph, a chicken in his arms, goes over to the baby.\n\n                                     BARDOLPH\n                         This is ready to get a fit going. \n                         It's shuddering. It's gone blue.\n\n                                     PISTOL\n                              (to Nym)\n                         How long does he want? Hey! Leave \n                         some for the rest of us.\n\n               Pistol heads towards the cabin. As he approaches the door, \n               Bardolph rearranges the blankets to, cover the baby. Pistol \n               opens the door. Nym is on top of Sara. Pistol laughs, enters, \n               and is clubbed down by Inman, who steps out onto the porch, \n               while SARA SHRUGS OFF THE BODY OF NYM, HIS THROAT CUT.\n\n               Bardolph looks up to see Inman walking towards him. Bardolph \n               has left his weapon by the fence.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         Move away from the baby.\n\n               Bardolph obeys, terrified. Sara runs out, collects Ethan, \n               gives a little moan of anguish, runs back inside the cabin.\n\n                                     BARDOLPH\n                         Don't shoot.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         Take off your boots.\n                              (Bardolph does so)\n                         Take off your pants, and your shirt.\n\n                                     BARDOLPH\n                         Don't shoot me, please. We're \n                         starving. We haven't eaten.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         You'd better get running before you \n                         catch your death of cold.\n\n                                     BARDOLPH\n                              (nods, terrified)\n                         Thanks, thank you. I will.\n\n               AND THEN A SHOT RINGS OUT AND HE CRASHES TO THE GROUND, DEAD.\n\n               Behind Inman, Sara stands with a rifle.\n\n               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. LATE DAY\n\n               THERE'S A HUGE FIRE GOING, WITH A CAULDRON HUNG OVER IT. THE \n               HOG HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM A TREE, BLOOD DRIPPING INTO A \n               BOWL.\n\n               There's a sense of ritual and order: the chapters of \n               transforming the hog into food.\n\n               Sara is inside the cabin, the door open onto the yard. She \n               holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight.\n\n               She tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed. She \n               puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside.\n\n               Now Inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side \n               of the spine to make two sides of meat. Now Sara is holding \n               up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. Now she's \n               rendering the fat into lard. Now Inman's salting the two \n               hams. Now Sara's washing the intestine. She sings all the \n               while -- I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and \n               my bride bed full of blood -- they don't really converse. \n               Inman continues to work.\n\n               Sara goes back inside to Ethan's crib. Inman glances back, \n               but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable. THE BABY IS \n               DEAD. She looks at it. She takes it up in her arms. Kisses \n               its forehead.\n\n               Makes a strange stifling noise. Inman doesn't look at her.\n\n               She comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate, \n               serves it up to Inman, gently touching him as she does so. \n               Then serves out food for herself. Inman starts to eat.\n\n                                     SARA\n                         Good?\n\n               Inman nods. She collects up the knapsacks, including Inman's, \n               and goes back inside the house with them. Inman squats, \n               eating, glancing back towards the cabin. There's the sudden \n               shocking report of a revolver.\n\n               Inman, knowing what it is, goes slowly towards the house and \n               its two dead bodies. His own face is a rictus, the eyes thin \n               slits. If he gave into his grief it would never cease.\n\n               INT. SARA'S CABIN. DUSK\n\n               From the house, the silhouette of Inman working outside in \n               the day's dying light, snow falling around him. He's digging \n               a grave.\n\n               Inside the house, TWO BUNDLES, the small body wrapped in a \n               blanket, the other wrapped in the bed's patchwork quilt.\n\n               EXT. CABBAGE PATCH, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK\n\n               Still snowing. Ruby trudges past Ada who is digging out a \n               couple of heads of the buried cabbages.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Do you think he's dead?\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         Who?\n\n                                     ADA\n                              (shrugs)\n                         This snow.

Ada stares into the distance where\n\n               EXT. WILD COUNTRY. LAST LIGHT\n\n               -- the snow falls down on Inman. He's hardly visible in its \n               gusting waves. Just a thin black question mark, hunched over \n               the elements, moving slowly forwards...\n\n               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY\n\n               THE SNOW HAS STOPPED. It's left a carpet on the ground.\n\n               Stobrod, Pangle and Georgia emerge from the Old Mill. THEY \n               MAKE HEAVY FOOTPRINTS as they set off up the hill towards \n               the mountain.\n\n               EXT. PATH IN THE MOUNTAINS. DAY\n\n               Inman comes sliding down a crumbling slate hill and onto the \n               path. He cornea to a place where the path suddenly drops \n               away to reveal a view of the geography. And there, finally, \n               in the distance, Inman can see the blue ridge. Somewhere in \n               there is home, is Ada. He goes on.\n\n               EXT. SLOPES OF COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY\n\n               Pangle walks too close to Stobrod and steps on the back of \n               his boot which promptly detaches itself from Stobrod's foot.\n\n               Stobrod turns -- and with a raised finger -- pushes Pangle.\n\n               PANGLE FALLS IN THE SNOW, ARMS SPREADEAGLED, AND SMILES.\n\n               EXT. PIGEON RIVER BEHIND THE OLD MILL. DAY\n\n               SOME HORSES CLUSTER around the Stobrod party's footprints.\n\n               Bosie swings acrobatically over his horse, to hang over the \n               tracks, then up again into his saddle, looks at Teague. The \n               Home Guard plod slowly forward in the direction of the tracks.\n\n               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING\n\n               A CLEARING, fringed by poplars. Stobrod is making a fire.\n\n               Pangle appears with an armful of firewood, his big grin a \n               fixture. Then Georgia appears. He's carrying A SMALL BUCK, \n               frozen and covered with snow.\n\n                                     GEORGIA\n                         What d'you reckon?

They're \n               lying like petals of a flower around it. Suddenly Georgia \n               sits bolt upright, grimaces, gets up stumbles away from the \n               fire, toward a stand of trees, from which come the vivid \n               sounds of violent nausea.\n\n               EXT.

Ada comes in \n               doesn't know how to help her friend, who shows no emotion.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         I told Georgia he can stop here, \n                         sleep in the barn. He's got nothing \n                         inside him. He'd walk out of here \n                         and die in the snow.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         He can milk the cows. I was worrying \n                         about that. It'll be dark in a couple \n                         of hours. I's ten hours climb from \n                         here.

Ruby is \n               rigid. Ada stops embracing her.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         We should get going.\n\n               She's tying up the kit.

COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING\n\n               THE SNOW IS FALLING HEAVILY. RUBY AND ADA TRUDGE UP THE\n\n               MOUNTAIN, dressed in Monroe's clothes, hats pulled down, \n               leading the horse, which is loaded up with tools and supplies. \n               A choice of paths. They start up one, then Ruby decides \n               against it, consults the map, and they reverse, pulling the \n               horse back and then yanking it up the other path.\n\n               EXT. PI STRUCTURE, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT\n\n               Ruby and Ada have made a fire. They sleep under a stone \n               structure, which forms a natural pi shape, the fire in the \n               entrance, the snow caught in its light.\n\n               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING\n\n               Ada and Ruby arrive at the scene of murder.\n\n               Pangle is keeled over at the old Poplar, snow covering him. \n               Only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him.\n\n               Ada brushes some of the snow from his face, revealing the \n               death wound, then lays a hand in blessing on his head.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         I don't understand.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         Maybe Teague's took him. They did \n                         that with the Swanger boys -- didn't, \n                         they? -- dragged them into town, \n                         then strung them up as warning... \n                         it's snowed since, so I can't read \n                         the story on the ground.\n\n               Ada fishes out Pangle's banjo from the snow. It's broken and \n               the strings hang slack.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         Let's dig.\n\n               LATER -- and RUBY FINISHES OFF THE GRAVE, hammering in a \n               stone to mark the place. Ada walks away towards the creek, \n               to wash her hands. She bends and rinses her face.\n\n               As she looks up SHE SEES STOBROD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE \n               CREEK; half-in, half out of the water, slumped against a \n               tree, blood everywhere, staining the crust of snow which \n               covers him.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Ruby! Ruby!\n\n               Ruby arrives at Ada, looks to where she's looking, walks \n               straight into the creek, all her love contained in the urgency \n               with which she hurtles to her father, oblivious to the \n               freezing water. She puts a head to his chest, seeks out a \n               pulse at his wrist. Calls back to Ada.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         He's still breathing!\n                              (to Stobrod)\n                         God damn! Daddy; Daddy -- it's Ruby. \n                         Don't you die on me again.\n                              (to Ada)\n                         He's still breathing!\n\n               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. AFTERNOON\n\n               A mean fire burns by the creek. RUBY TURNS A KNIFE IN THE \n               FLAMES. Stobrod's back is exposed. Just by the shoulder blade \n               is an ugly grey and purple bulge the size of a crabapple. \n               Ruby turns to Ada, who is helping.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         Pack a pan full of snow. I need good \n                         clean water, boiled up.\n\n               She cuts the skin and prises out a slug which she drops in \n               the snow and rolls around to clean. Stobrod doesn't move. He \n               could be dead. Ada loads the pan with snow.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Let's get him home. We have herbs \n                         there and it's warm.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         He'll die first. He's got hardly no \n                         blood left in him.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         He'll die lying here.\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         There's a place further on up. Used \n                         to be. Old Cherokee place. There's \n                         good water right by it.\n\n               Ada puts the snow-packed pan on the fire.\n\n               EXT. BY THE OUTLIER'S CAVE, COLD MOUNTAIN. AFTERNOON\n\n               Squirrels frolic. Teague sits on the trunk of a fallen tree.\n\n               He feeds the squirrels, looking straight ahead where the \n               mouth of a cave winks back at him.\n\n               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. AFTERNOON\n\n               THE TWO WOMEN EMERGE FROM A STEEP TUNNEL OF TREES IN A \n               CHESTNUT GROVE. There's a stream and, up on the bank, A \n               CLUSTER OF BLACK CONICAL HUTS, made up of chestnut logs, \n               abandoned and slightly sinister looking. They approach one \n               of the huts, its door long lost. The snow has drifted in. A \n               second hut has a door which they pry open. It's dark and \n               cold, but apparently still weatherproof. They get Stobrod \n               off the horse and carry him inside, then come out again to \n               unload the horse of its remaining load.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         This horse is weary. He's ready to \n                         give up the ghost.\n\n               Ruby picks up the blankets and provisions and goes back inside \n               to her father. Ada takes the horse to another hut and, despite \n               his great reluctance, pushes him inside.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Good boy.\n                              (she blows into his \n                              nostrils, calming \n                              him)\n                         That's warmer, isn't it.\n\n               Ada wouldn't even recognize this practical, hardy woman she's \n               become. Stringy and of few words. She sets off towards the \n               tree tunnel, passing Stobrod's hut.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         I'm getting firewood.\n\n               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. DUSK\n\n               Inman approaches the Killing Ground. He studies the ground, \n               finds Pangle's grave. Blood has left its black writing in \n               the snow and he finds first where Stobrod has been, where \n               the bullet had been removed, then the journey away, still \n               tiny, telltale spatters of blood, and the hoof prints and \n               boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse. He puts his \n               hand into the ashes of Ruby's fire, can't feel any warmth. \n               It's getting dark. He takes a drink from the stream, shudders \n               at the cold.\n\n               INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT\n\n               The fire burns, a pall of smoke. Stobrod lies on the ground, \n               swathed in blankets. Coughs. Ruby sits next to him, wipes \n               the hair from his forehead. Ada opens her eyes, looks, closes \n               them, listens to the fire, a strange squeaking as it burns.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         That wood -- that sound when it burns \n                         that mean more snow?\n\n                                     RUBY\n                         Yes, it do, country girl.\n\n               EXT. TRACK, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAWN\n\n               First light. The sun creeps up, a red streak of dawn. Inman \n               walking, his head bent to the tracks. He walks quickly, even \n               as the terrain gets more steep. As he bends to the snow -- \n               where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print -- A FLAKE \n               OF SNOW LANDS ON HIS HAND. Then a second. He looks up. The \n               snow falls.\n\n               He starts to move more quickly, racing the snow as it seeks \n               to erase the tracks. The snow thickens.\n\n               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING\n\n               In the Chestnut Grovel A DOZEN WILD TURKEYS pick their way \n               across the snow. A shotgun lines up its sight at one of them.\n\n               The trigger is squeezed. An explosion of feathers.\n\n               EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING\n\n               Inman hears the shot. Then a second, the sound ricocheting \n               around him. He can't quite identify its source but he runs \n               again, heading for the Chestnut trees he can see above him.\n\n               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING\n\n               Ada collects the two turkeys, the first creatures she's ever \n               shot. Doesn't quite know how to hold them. She straightens \n               up and sees, at the other end of the tree tunnel, backlit by \n               the morning sun, THE SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. She drops the \n               turkeys tires to reload the shotgun.\n\n               Inman comes down the tunnel, approaching the hunter he sees \n               through the snow at the other end of it.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Turn round and go back where you \n                         came from.\n\n               Inman is bewildered by this woman's voice in a man's outfit, \n               keeps walking, peering through the snow. Ada fires a warning \n               shot. Inman, still some distance, suddenly understands.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         Ada?

Then he turns again, \n               completely lost, without compass.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         If I knew where to go I'd go there.\n\n                                     ADA\n                              (finally recognising \n                              him)\n                         Inman?\n\n               He nods. They don't know how to speak to each other, just \n               stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in \n               their throats. Eventually --\n\n                                     ADA\n                         You'd better come with me.\n\n               And with that, she starts to sob, and sob.\n\n               VERY HIGH ANGLE: Inman walks towards Ada.

They're packing up, all \n               their clothes in layers. Inman prepares the horse. Ruby and \n               Ada carrying bundles out of the huts.

MORNING\n\n               And then the two women are off, little men in their outfits, \n               tramping off in the snow. Inman watches.\n\n               EXT.

THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY\n\n               Inman has roped Stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a \n               steep slope. Behind him, their hooves muffled by the snow, A \n               GROUP OF RIDERS JOIN THE TRAIL, IN SLOW BUT STEADY PURSUIT.\n\n               Inman walks on, apparently oblivious to who's behind him. He \n               and Stobrod are some distance from broken ground, a fringe \n               of trees.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                              (quietly to Stobrod)\n                         Don't look round.\n\n                                     STOBROD\n                         Got it.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         How many men does he have?\n\n                                     STOBROD\n                         There were five. You can't reason \n                         with that man.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                              (takes off his gloves)\n                         I got a conversation stopper.\n                              (they're getting closer)\n                         Closer we get to that broken ground \n                         the better.\n\n               Inman opens his coat. Stobrod looks at the Lemats. They're \n               at the edge of the trees.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         You hold on tight, do you hear? When \n                         I say three, look round, nice and \n                         slow.\n\n                                     STOBROD\n                         Okay.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         One, two, three.\n\n               Stobrod looks round. Inman doesn't. Teague has some new bodies \n               in his entourage but they're all dead. A SPARE HORSE HAS \n               THREE CORPSES HUNG OVER IT, ANOTHER HORSE DRAGS A MAKESHIFT \n               LITTER WITH A COUPLE MORE, SOUVENIRS OF THEIR CAVE VISIT. \n               Teague waves.\n\n                                     TEAGUE\n                         God damn! You're a hard fucker to \n                         put down.\n                              (they approach)\n                         Good directions to that cave from \n                         the fat boy -- saw the squirrels, \n                         sat on the tree made some friends, \n                         brought some back with me.\n\n               His riders begin, quite casually, to fan out.\n\n               IN ONE MOVEMENT, INMAN SLAPS THE FLANK OF THE HORSE. WHICH \n               CAREERS DOWN THE TRACK, THEN TURNS AND FIRES, TWICE, BEFORE \n               PITCHING HIMSELF INTO A ROLL TOWARDS THE TREES. HIS FIRST \n               SHOT KNOCKS JO FROM HIS HORSE, THE SECOND MO, WHO FALLS INTO \n               THE SNOW, BLEEDING FROM THE GROIN AND SCREAMING. The riderless \n               horse gets tangled up with the others.\n\n               Inman is in the trees, shots around him. He doesn't move \n               away from, but towards the riders inside the line of trees. \n               Grayling charges him, riding into the trees. INMAN SHOOTS \n               HIM, THEN RUSHES FROM THE TREES, FIRING, MISSING BOSIE, WHO \n               RIDES AWAY, EVIDENTLY NOT RELISHING THE FIGHT, AND THROWS \n               HIMSELF AT TEAGUE, WHOSE HORSE IS BUCKING WILDLY. Teague's \n               carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. Inman yanks \n               the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the \n               shotgun barrel of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol \n               almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. TEAGUE'S CHEST \n               OPENS OUT AS HE'S THROWN OFF THE HORSE. Mo is still screaming.\n\n               Inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to \n               Teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow \n               under him.\n\n               Inman studies him, picks up the Spencer carbine, turns to \n               look where Bosie has gone, steps up onto Teague's horse, \n               reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate Teague, \n               LEANS OVER AND SHOOTS HIM DEAD. He turns the horse in the \n               direction Bosie had headed. He can't see horse or rider, but \n               in the stand of Hickory Trees ahead, THE GUSTS OF STEAMING \n               BREATH betray them both. He rides slowly towards the stand \n               of trees.\n\n               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY\n\n               Ada and Ruby walking. They hear the shots. Ada turns and \n               starts to run through the snow, her hat flying from her head.\n\n               EXT. STAND OF HICKORY TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY\n\n               Inman's horse is parallel to Bosie, who is deep inside the \n               trees but also riding, slowly. It's like a dance.\n\n                                     INMAN\n                         Come out of there.\n\n                                     BOSIE\n                         No, sir.

INMAN HAS \n               ALREADY FIRED THE LEMATS AND THE BOY, SHOT IN THE HEAD, FALLS. \n               CAUGHT BY ONE STIRRUP THE HORSE BOLTING. INMAN WATCHES, STOCK \n               STILL, THEN MAKES A COUGH, AS IF CLEARING HIS THROAT, AND A \n               THIN MIST OF BLOOD SPRAYS FROM HIS MOUTH.\n\n               EXT.

Stobrod, barely conscious, hanging \n               halfway down its flank, held on by the ropes.\n\n               Ada hurries on, taking the shotgun from Ruby, who tends to \n               her father.\n\n               EXT. A GROVE OF TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY\n\n               Ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses. She hardly \n               stops to look at the bodies, just rushes on.\n\n               THE GROUND SIMPLIFIES AND SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM OF A GROVE. A \n               STEEP INCLINE, THE SUN LOW AND IN FRONT OF HER. SHE SEES A \n               BRILLIANT FRAME OF BLACK TREES, AND THEN A SUDDEN FLURRY OF \n               ANGRY CROWS FLYING TOWARDS HER. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL IS A \n               SMALL HIEROGLYPH OF A MAN.\n\n               FINALLY, THE IMAGE FROM THE SWANGER WELL EXACTLY AS SHE FIRST \n               SAW IT.\n\n               THE FIGURE RAISES A HAND, BRIEFLY, THEN PITCHES FORWARD INTO \n               THE SNOW.\n\n               She runs, her heart broken, towards the body of Inman. He's \n               dead, the red flag of his life ebbed, away in the snow. Ada \n               falls to her knees and pulls him over, the snow crusted on \n               his face, which she wipes away with great tenderness, then \n               sits, his head in her lap, as Ruby slowly comes up the hill \n               towards them.\n\n               A VIOLIN PLAYS, quite raucous.\n\n               INT.

DAY\n\n               A GIRL, about five or six, with Ada's curls, sits at the \n               table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled \n               bottle she offers it. She tries again. Ada comes in suddenly, \n               takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         You bring that lamb outside.\n\n               The girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field.\n\n               EXT. FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY\n\n               THE SOUND OF THE FIDDLE CONTINUING, JOINED BY A BANJO, It's \n               a glorious spring morning, Black Cove Farm at its most \n               luxuriant, the path edged with brilliant flowers. There are \n               more animals in evidence. The girl emerges from the house \n               and sees Ada in the field, surrounded by sheep. She hurries \n               over.\n\n               ADA IS EXPERTLY SKINNING A STILLBORN LAMB. The little girl \n               is horrified.\n\n                                     GRACE\n                         What are you doing!\n\n                                     ADA\n                         He came out dead, love.\n\n               She has the skin off the lamb, which lies like a little pink \n               cat on the ground. She approaches Grace, takes the live lamb \n               from her arms, the girl resistant, frightened.\n\n                                     GRACE\n                         Don't kill him!\n\n                                     ADA\n                         I'm not going to kill him. But we \n                         have to try something or else he's \n                         going to die.\n\n               She takes the skin and wraps it round Grace's lamb. Then \n               puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lamb's \n               mother.\n\n               It goes to the sheep and, after a few false starts, starts \n               to feed, accepted as a surrogate.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Isn't that a small mercy.\n\n               And A VOICE joins in with the fiddle and banjo.\n\n               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY\n\n               STOBROD is playing, on his repaired fiddle. His hair is now \n               completely grey. GEORGIA is playing the banjo and singing, \n               although. A SMALL CHILD with Georgia's reddish coloring keeps \n               invading his picking hand trying to join in. RUBY HAS ANOTHER \n               GEORGIA CHILD IN HER ARMS, but is also trying to serve food.\n\n               She passes Georgia and touches the top of his head. SALLY \n               SWANGER is pouring water from a jug, Ada emerges from the \n               kitchen, with a big pie, racing to the table.\n\n                                     ADA\n                              (laughing)\n                         Hot hot hot hot hot!!!\n\n               From behind her, Grace appears, carrying a jug of milk, puts \n               it on the groaning board of the table. Grace has a full plate \n               in front of her, picks up a fork to spear some meat.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         Grace Inman, nobody said eat.\n                              (then to Stobrod)\n                         Mr. Thewes...\n\n               The music stops. And there's quiet except for the sound of \n               animals: lowing, barking, braying, bleating.\n\n                                     ADA\n                         For good friends, good food, good \n                         family: for all our blessings -- Oh \n                         Lord we thank thee. Amen.\n\n                                     ALL\n                         Amen !\n\n               And they eat.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nCold Mountain\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Charles Frazier\u00a0\u00a0Anthony Minghella\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0War\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:47.625524"}
