Below them, close to a small \n               town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to \n               the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack.\n\n               Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack.\n\n               A ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked \n               forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a \n               stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian. \n               Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the \n               ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet, \n               the blood pouring from his nose.\n\n               His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge.\n\n               A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes \n               down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary \n               field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants \n               grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and \n               its two exotic passengers passes by.\n\n               The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the \n               severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self-\n               conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts \n               of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt \n               to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by \n               her. An angel in this wild place.\n\n               Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to \n               translate into English:\n\n<b>                                     SWIMMER\u0092S VOICE (V.O.)\n</b>                         You will be lonely.

The game \n               resumes. Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, \n               sticks and fists flailing.\n\n<b>               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN.

The battered teams \n               eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, \n               illuminated by a roaring bonfire. Swimmer is sewing up a \n               gash in Inman\u0092s cheek as he continues to translate:\n\n<b>                                     SWIMMER\n</b>                         ...This is your path.

The Monroes are introduced to \n               various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the \n               crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from \n               Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's \n               preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches \n               Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches, \n               and winces with pain.\n\n<b>                                     SWIMMER\n</b>                         So keep your head still.\n\n               Sally collects plates for the Monroes.

IN THE FOURTH \n</b><b>               YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR.\n</b>\n               A STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT \n               surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty.\n\n               A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into \n               open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE \n<b>               CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON \n</b>               THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in \n               the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The \n               Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and \n               it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world \n               of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches.\n\n               IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water \n               for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a \n               large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the \n               stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole. \n               Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling.\n\n<b>               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN.\n</b>\n               A dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes \n               burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose.\n\n<b>               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN.\n</b>\n               Young OAKLEY, freshly recruited, approaches a group of men, \n               like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina \n               Regiment. He doles out breakfast. Inman, loading his heavy \n               LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry. Oakley serves \n               another, ROURKE, last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain. \n               Oakley keeps his head low as he serves.\n\n<b>                                     ROURKE\n</b>                         Don't worry, son.

A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It \n               reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay \n               team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked \n               to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels.\n\n<b>               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES.

The Confederates are in complete disarray. The \n               Federals pour forwards across NO MANS LAND, through the \n               peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. They \n               flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a \n               dense and impenetrable WALL OF SMOKE.\n\n<b>               THEN THEY'RE INSIDE THE GREAT GASH OF CRATER AND CAN'T GET \n</b>               OUT AGAIN, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud.\n\n               The Confederates regroup. Orders are yelled. Chaos developing \n               into battle.\n\n               The Confederates begin firing into the crater. Guns and mortar \n               wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death \n               trap.\n\n               Inman gets to his feet. Oakley with him, and rushes through \n               the smoke to the pit, emptying his LeMats into the crater.\n\n               LATER: A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the attack. Bodies \n               falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their \n               comrades even tighter. The Confederates make a pincer movement \n               outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in. It's \n               Medieval.\n\n               No escape.\n\n               THE CONFEDERATES jump into the pit to engage the Federals. \n               Hand to hand fighting. Too close for rifles, just bayonets, \n               and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that \n               hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which \n               does a terrible damage. Primitive. Unutterable carnage. Men \n               killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against \n               soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. An oozing \n               layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning \n               in slick.\n\n               YOUNG OAKLEY loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case, \n               clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with \n               a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal.\n\n               INMAN GOES AT IT. He's a warrior, punching and stabbing and \n               firing. A coldly efficient killer. He's grabbed from behind \n               and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle.\n\n               He falls and lands on top of Oakley, and he and his Federal \n               opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their \n               pillow. The slaughter continues over and around them, the \n               sound, the sound of hell and madness. The boy has his arm \n               around Inman, like lovers.\n\n               LATER: The Confederates run after the retreating Union \n               soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. Inman stands, \n               the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. The \n               crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. The victors are \n               yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. Butcher comes alongside \n               Inman.\n\n<b>                                     BUTCHER\n</b>                         That was something!

The wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself \n               like a crab away from Butcher. Inman yells at him, appalled.\n\n<b>                                     BUTCHER\n</b>                         You got a charge?\n\n               He picks up another musket. It fires.

Of boots, of equipment, of \n               personal items. Inman sees a soldier in the crater, lining \n               up wounded Federals, putting their heads in a row.

This is \n               STOBROD THEWES. He's bent over a dead Federal, examining his \n               mouth. He reaches behind his back and roots around in the \n               knapsack, producing A PAIR OF PLIERS, WHICH HE INSERTS INTO \n               THE CORPSE'S MOUTH. He's yanking away when A SWINGING BOOT \n               connects with his head and knocks him to the ground.\n\n               Startled, he looks up to see Inman hovering over him.\n\n<b>                                     STOBROD\n</b>                         That's gold in his mouth he got no \n                         need for.\n                              (shrugs)\n                         We take his boots.\n\n               He examines his fiddle for damage. Some orderlies pass, \n               lifting OAKLEY away on a gurney.\n\n               Oakley's pale as a maiden, the life leaking from him. Inman \n               walks a way with him. Oakley looks up, desperate to be brave.\n\n<b>                                     OAKLEY\n</b>                         I got a few.

I was thirteen when you \n                         all left. Am I going to die?\n\n               Inman flicks his eyes to the Orderly, whose look confirms \n               the boy's wounds are certainly mortal.\n\n<b>               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT\n</b>\n               Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them, \n               the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, \n               groans.\n\n<b>                                     OAKLEY\n</b>                         I'd like to hear some music while I \n                         go.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Inman gets to his feet and walks away.\n\n<b>               INT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT\n</b>\n               A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone, \n               rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A \n               FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps \n               the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next \n               to his bedroll.

There's a \n                         dozen Yankees in that stand of trees \n                         between us. Stuck there from the \n                         retreat. Come daylight they can shoot \n                         us down for sport.\n\n<b>               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT\n</b>\n               A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others, \n               including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to \n               one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide \n               arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to \n               the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the \n               ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses.\n\n               He slithers over them.\n\n               They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN \n               FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing. \n               Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate \n               lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting \n               against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep.\n\n               As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the \n               Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his \n               rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing \n               him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another.\n\n               The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party \n               and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from \n               the trees.\n\n               A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate \n               trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A \n               BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed \n               at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own \n               lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the \n               trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold \n               your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost \n               home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly \n               he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him.\n\n               Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty \n               yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK.\n\n               He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying \n               on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly \n               fade to black, all sound fading with them.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Men \n               are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below \n               which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the \n               workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a \n               rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke \n               and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around \n               and Oakley, barely a teenager.\n\n               Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, \n               ADA amongst them.

DAY\n</b>\n               THE CHAIN GANG TRUDGES DOWN THE TRACK, horses on either side \n               of them, steep banks forming a V for the railroad. A TRAIN \n               IS COMING. Brown rides up to the prisoners, herds them off \n               the track. The train approaches quite slowly -- the boxcars \n               full of wounded soldiers. Some of the Home Guard dismount, \n               take out pipes. The prisoners wait, one of them sits down.\n\n               Sheffield says something to Veasey, who casually yanks up \n               the sitting prisoner. Inman suddenly understands what's going \n               to happen.

SHEFFIELD JERKS FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE \n               TRAIN, PULLING ALL THE OTHERS WITH HIM, their reluctance \n               tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming \n               train.\n\n               SOMEHOW THE CHAIN GANG GETS ACROSS THE TRACK, stumbling and \n               chaotic, the chains yanking tight, then loose, the tight \n               causing a collapse, the loose a recovery.\n\n               They run alongside the train, blocking themselves from the \n               fire of the Guard, Sheffield screaming tactics -- and then, \n               as the train starts to pull past them, they run up the bank, \n               now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit.\n\n<b>               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIN THE HOME GUARD HAVE REMOUNTED \n</b>               THEIR HORSES AND ARE RIDING HARD ALONGSIDE IT.

Sheffield's yelling with adrenaline, Veasey joins \n               in, elated. One of the guards raises a rifle, steadies himself \n               on his horse, FIRES. He catches Veasey, who crumples, spinning \n               round and falling down the bank, until Inman uses all his \n               strength and practically lifts him in the air. The chain \n               recovers and works back up the bank.\n\n               But then A SECOND BULLET catches another prisoner and this \n               time the effect is catastrophic -- THE WHOLE GANG JUST FLIPS \n               OVER AND PLUMMETS DOWN THE BANK. The Home Guard approach, \n               firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch \n               by the side of the track. Until all movement ceases. Inman \n               has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely, almost \n               completely covering his face.

She \n               holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight.\n\n               She tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed. She \n               puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside.\n\n               Now Inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side \n               of the spine to make two sides of meat. Now Sara is holding \n               up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. Now she's \n               rendering the fat into lard. Now Inman's salting the two \n               hams. Now Sara's washing the intestine.

He walks quickly, even \n               as the terrain gets more steep. As he bends to the snow -- \n               where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print -- A FLAKE \n               OF SNOW LANDS ON HIS HAND. Then a second. He looks up. The \n               snow falls.\n\n               He starts to move more quickly, racing the snow as it seeks \n               to erase the tracks. The snow thickens.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Teague's \n               carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. Inman yanks \n               the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the \n               shotgun barrel of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol \n               almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. TEAGUE'S CHEST \n               OPENS OUT AS HE'S THROWN OFF THE HORSE. Mo is still screaming.\n\n               Inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to \n               Teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow \n               under him.\n\n               Inman studies him, picks up the Spencer carbine, turns to \n               look where Bosie has gone, steps up onto Teague's horse, \n               reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate Teague, \n               LEANS OVER AND SHOOTS HIM DEAD. He turns the horse in the \n               direction Bosie had headed. He can't see horse or rider, but \n               in the stand of Hickory Trees ahead, THE GUSTS OF STEAMING \n               BREATH betray them both. He rides slowly towards the stand \n               of trees.\n\n<b>               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY\n</b>\n               Ada and Ruby walking. They hear the shots. Ada turns and \n               starts to run through the snow, her hat flying from her head.\n\n<b>               EXT. STAND OF HICKORY TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY\n</b>\n               Inman's horse is parallel to Bosie, who is deep inside the \n               trees but also riding, slowly.

There are \n               more animals in evidence. The girl emerges from the house \n               and sees Ada in the field, surrounded by sheep.
