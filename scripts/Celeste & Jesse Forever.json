CELESTE'S DRIVEWAY- 10 MINUTES LATER 7\r\n                         \r\n           Celeste and Jesse stand in the driveway of Celeste's house.\r\n           There is a bit of a linger.\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           Well, I'm exhausted.\r\n                         \r\n                          JESSE\r\n           Me too.\r\n                         \r\n           Celeste walks to her front door with her key and Jesse heads\r\n           towards the side gate with his key. It is now obvious that he\r\n           is living in her guest house.\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight,\r\n           how's the heat in there?\r\n                         \r\n                          JESSE\r\n           Oh, it's fine.

So\r\n           make sure your thingys, your\r\n           sculptures, whatever...are out of\r\n           the way.\r\n                         \r\n                          JESSE\r\n           Got it.\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           Night.\r\n                         \r\n                          JESSE\r\n           Night.

CELESTE'S HOUSE-MORNING 8\r\n                         \r\n           Celeste's morning symphony is under way. She sits in front of\r\n           a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 4\r\n           neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television\r\n           tuned to CNN. She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads\r\n           the paper, watches TV, and surfs the internet. She is clearly\r\n           a culture vulture. Jesse walks by outside his studio and does\r\n           the \"C and J\" sign to Celeste. She does it back\r\n           instinctively. Is it weird that we hang out so much? She\r\n           shakes it off and titters. She's being ridiculous; it's fine.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          9 INT. COFFEE BEAN- MORNING 9\r\n                         \r\n           Celeste walks in, dressed impeccably. Again, in all black.\r\n           She is in a rush, on her Blackberry, bombarded with a hefty\r\n           pre-work crowd. People are in some semblance of a line,\r\n           waiting to order.\r\n           13.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Celeste spots a man in a business suit, taking advantage of\r\n          the confusion and cutting in front of a woman at the head of\r\n          the line. He orders.\r\n                         \r\n                          BUSINESS MAN\r\n           Large coffee, please.\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           Excuse me, sir?\r\n                         \r\n          The business man pretends to not hear her.\r\n                         \r\n           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)\r\n           Sir? You?\r\n                         \r\n          She taps him on the arm. He turns around.\r\n                         \r\n           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)\r\n           You do realize that you just cut in\r\n           front of a lot of people.\r\n                         \r\n                          BUSINESS MAN\r\n           Oh.

Celeste wants\r\n          to let it go, but she can't.\r\n                         \r\n                          BUSINESS MAN\r\n           Well, she was looking at the\r\n           pastries, I didn't think she was\r\n           ready to order.\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           Well, it's not just her. It's\r\n           everyone behind her too. So, if you\r\n           want to ask all these people if\r\n           it's okay to cut in front of them\r\n           because you are late, be my guest.\r\n           Just don't assume that your time is\r\n           more important than everyone\r\n           else's.\r\n                         \r\n          The business man gets his coffee.\r\n           14.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          BUSINESS MAN\r\n           Have a nice day.\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           (sotto) Prick.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          10 INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-MORNING 10\r\n                         \r\n           Pop Form Headquarters looks like the future. No walls, just\r\n           large glass slabs, separate the offices from each other.\r\n                         \r\n           Celeste is on camera, in the middle of conducting a live\r\n           satellite interview for MSNBC.\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           American culture is dying. We have\r\n           an unrelenting appetite for\r\n           processed junk food, talentless pop\r\n           stars like Riley Banks and recycled\r\n           movie franchises like Transformers.\r\n           The more we consume crap, the more\r\n           we want crap.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          11 INT.

And I think my business is\r\n           taking the hardest hit of all. It's\r\n           brutal.

Have you been\r\n           to those weed pharmacies? They're\r\n           killing me. I gotta branch out.\r\n           Maybe start working in\r\n           methamphetamines? Or maybe teach\r\n           pre-school. I always wanted to do\r\n           that. I love kids.\r\n                         \r\n           Skillz is distracted by something.\r\n                         \r\n           SKILLZ (CONT'D) (CONTD)\r\n           Sorry, I know this is serious talky\r\n           time but would you look at the\r\n           fucking seat on that girl?\r\n           18.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          We see a girl's apple bottom butt stuffed into blue jeans.\r\n                         \r\n           SKILLZ (CONT'D) (CONTD)\r\n           THAT is a party.\r\n                         \r\n          Jesse does not laugh.

Yeah, sure.\r\n                         \r\n          Celeste gets up and is immediately fixated by his hair.\r\n                         \r\n           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)\r\n           Yeah, Skillz kinda made me do it\r\n           and from the get go, she was way\r\n           into...what are you looking at?\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           No, nothing.

HATFIELD'S RESTAURANT-NIGHT 16\r\n                         \r\n           Jesse is on a date with Yogurt girl. It's clear he's hasn't\r\n           been doing a lot of talking.\r\n                         \r\n                          YOGURT GIRL\r\n           So I was in school but then I\r\n           dropped out because I really wanted\r\n           to work in fashion but it's really\r\n           hard to find a paid internship? So\r\n           I went back to school and now I\r\n           work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm\r\n           really looking to make money doing\r\n           something I love? But I'm sure the\r\n           universe is looking out for me and\r\n           when the time is right, the right\r\n           thing will come along, you know?\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          17 INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 17\r\n                         \r\n           Celeste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the\r\n           outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a\r\n           woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the studio door\r\n           shuts. Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldn't do that.\r\n           Would he?\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          18 EXT. CELESTE'S GARDEN- NEXT MORNING 18\r\n                         \r\n           Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats\r\n           breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines.\r\n           This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks'\r\n           new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be.\r\n           Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head,\r\n           \"yeah, I get it.\" She turns it off.\r\n                         \r\n           Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at\r\n           the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally,\r\n           a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He\r\n           is alone. Phew.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          19 INT. BORDER'S BOOKS-LATER THAT DAY 19\r\n                         \r\n           Celeste, Beth, Tucker and Jesse browse as a foursome for\r\n           books.\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           Where is it? They told me it would\r\n           be in new releases...\r\n           26.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Celeste searches frantically for her book. She peeks around a\r\n          corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading \"More New\r\n          Releases.\" Three copies of her book, \"Shitegeist\" appear in\r\n          the very bottom row, barely visible. She is disappointed.\r\n                         \r\n           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)\r\n           That's what I call placement.\r\n                         \r\n          She grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the\r\n          front of the store.\r\n                         \r\n                          BETH\r\n           Well you probably shouldn't steal\r\n           it. Even if it is yours.\r\n                         \r\n          Celeste marches to the Oprah's Book Club table and swiftly\r\n          replaces the center display book with her own.\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           There.\r\n                         \r\n                          BETH\r\n           But you don't have the \"O\" on your\r\n           cover, you can't do that!\r\n                         \r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           Yes I can.\r\n                         \r\n          Jesse and Tucker arrive and see the book.\r\n                         \r\n                          JESSE\r\n           There you guys are...you're on\r\n           Oprah's Book List??

She gently\r\n           shuts the door. She looks around, not knowing what to do with\r\n           herself. She focuses on a crack in the wall, she looks closer\r\n           and then grabs the wall, thinking she might faint. She\r\n           silently begins to sob, mouth open, eyes shut tight. She\r\n           collapses on the wall. She is in silent turmoil. Is this\r\n           really happening?\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          36 INT.

So thanks for\r\n           that, Mrs. Weinberg.\r\n                         \r\n          Wedding guests look uncomfortable.\r\n                         \r\n           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)\r\n           But the truth is, I would go\r\n           anywhere for Beth. She's my best\r\n           friend. And I'm so happy for her.\r\n           Senior year of college, we had a\r\n           tradition. Every Sunday, come rain\r\n           or shine, Beth and Tucker would\r\n           meet me and Jesse at the Bishop\r\n           with a 12-pack of Miller High Life,\r\n           the champagne of beers, and we\r\n           would meet to talk about what was\r\n           important in the world, you know,\r\n           Heidegger's influence on hip-hop.\r\n           Or the feminist duality on \"Melrose\r\n           Place.\" Life's big questions. Beth\r\n           and Tucker were just friends then\r\n           but there was always something\r\n           there. Just an ease they had with\r\n           each other. Jesse and I spent years\r\n           trying to get them together,\r\n           unsuccessfully.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n           94.\r\n                         \r\n           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)\r\n           But we all remained friends and\r\n           watched as Tucker dated the most\r\n           slutty, vacuous and vile girls on\r\n           the planet.

And that was beautiful\r\n           Beth. And none of us could be\r\n           happier about it; they were\r\n           perfect. At last. Love wins.\r\n                         \r\n           Wedding guests clap. They think it's over. It's not.\r\n           Celeste looks at Jesse in the crowd.

So that's...yeah, our\r\n           timing was not as good, I guess.\r\n           Beth and Tucker, you are lucky to\r\n           be best friends. Work hard and\r\n           respect that. It doesn't come\r\n           easily. Be patient, don't always\r\n           think you're right. And if you are,\r\n           it doesn't fucking matter anyway.\r\n           Fight for it, everyday, I wish I\r\n           had.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          93 EXT.
