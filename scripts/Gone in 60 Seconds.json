LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT\n\n\tThe streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew\n\tof a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los\n\tAngeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars\n\texcept -\n\n\tA '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500\n\n\tSilver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air\n\tscoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool\n\tbefore dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then\n\tSOMEONE approaches...\n\n\tThrough the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ...\n\tHe's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer\n\tthat refuses to fade ...\n\n\tThis is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's\n\tquite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern\n\tCalifornia ...\n\n\tMemphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert\n\tcrash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ...\n\tAdmiring it ... Adoring it ...\n\n\tBut then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver -\n\tATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for:\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON\n\t\tYou gonna steal her or kneel down to\n\t\ther and pray -- ?\n\n\tMemphis looks at him, still enthralled...\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)\n\t\tI know, I know ... It's Eleanor ...\n\t\tJust take her, slick. - -\n\n\tAnd Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ...\n\tNo one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his\n\tcoat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the\n\tdoor ...\n\n\tWatch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another\n\tpocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION\n\n\tA RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small\n\tsocket-like device - is pressed into the\n\tignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles\n\tlike a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds.\n\n\tHe takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the\n\tdeck. Bruce Springsteen's \"Ramrod\" wails from the coaxials.\n\tAnd Memphis floors it... And off they tear...\n\n\tThe look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand\n\tre-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones,\n\tfixed and fumy ...\n\n\tHe slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in\n\tbehind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ...\n\n\tOn they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort...\n\n\tExcept that, from seemingly out of nowhere --\n\n\tA POLICE CAR\n\n\tappears behind them...\n\n\tAnd Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races\n\tthrough a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And\n\tDonny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their\n\trespective vehicles...\n\n\tThe UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tProblem, Officer?\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n\t\tYes. You're under arrest -- ?\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tFor running a stop sign?\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n\t\tFor Grand Theft Auto -\n\n\tAnd off of Donny's look --\n\n\tWe go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding\n\ttoward him, sirens wailing...\n\n\tQUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning\n\tharbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music\n\t... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ...\n\n\tMemphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis\n\tgutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy\n\tpursuit ...\n\n\tAnd now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson,\n\theading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of\n\tcruisers himself ...\n\n\tMemphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up\n\tahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so\n\tfast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ...\n\n\tGuns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and\n\ta PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on\n\tto the roadblock ...\n\n\tAnd, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis\n\tbangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake --\n\tAnd the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And\n\tMemphis takes the HARD LEFT ...\n\n\tAnd he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower\n\tGrand... Looking down ...\n\n\tHe can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being\n\tchased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER,\n\tthe Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ...\n\n\tLanding with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.\n\n\tEXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER\n\n\tRescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His\n\tleg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny\n\tAstricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ...\n\n\tA POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps\n\n\tDETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK\n\n\tof G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck\n\tis mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility\n\tfool you - the man's a street viper ...\n\n\tCastlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS..\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINGS\n\t\tAstricky. And Jackson. No sign of\n\t\tRaines...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tWell, then it's all for naught,\n\t\tain't it, Hawkings?\n\n\tCastlebeck looks out over the mess ... And then looks up...\n\tBecause, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked. It is the\n\tShelby. With Memphis leaning against its hood...\n\n\tCastlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. So he walks\n\ttoward it, hand on hip...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tI know you --\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tYou know my back -\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tYou want to come along quiet?\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tHow's Atley -- ?\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tLeg's all banged-up. He made a\n\t\tstupid play ... He'll limp around\n\t\tthe yard up at Folsom. But\n\t\tAstricky will be there to take\n\t\tcare of him. With their priors,\n\t\tthey're looking at a serious bounce --\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tLet them go --\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tHow's that?\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tLet them go. And I'll leave ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tYou'll leave -- ?\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tYou don't have anything on me. A\n\t\tmisdee auto-theft. I got no record.\n\t\tI'll be out in three days, and back at \n\t\tit. Or you let them go, and I give\n\t\tyou my word. I'm gone. And without the\n\t\tringleader ... Your tee-times have\n\t\tjust grown exponentially...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tI don't golf...\n\n\tAnd they stare at each other, as Castlebeck considers.\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)\n\t\tI do this. And I see you again. I'll\n\t\tcome after you with everything I got.\n\t\tyou won't be able to steal a glance\n\t\tat a blind man without me by your side ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tYou have my word...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tGet out of here, then. Now.\n\n\tAnd Memphis makes to get into the Shelby...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tLeave the car, Randall ...\n\n\tMemphis nods ... Takes one last look at the Shelby... Sorry to \n\tleave it behind ... And he runs off into the mists of Lower\n\tGrand ...\n\n\tCastlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tArright, let lim go. Cite him for\n\t\trolling the stop ... And cite old\n\t\tAtley for driving to endanger ...\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWKINGS\n\t\tWhat are you talking about, Rollie? We're\n\t\tspringing 'em? Just like that?\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tJust like that. Quit your bellyaching,\n\t\tHawkings ... And let's wrap this up ...\n\n\tAnd off of Donny's surprised look, as Springsteen wails to\n\tcrescendo and we\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. INDEPENDENCE, CALIFORNIA - DAY - 6 YEARS LATER\n\n\tSome 400 miles North of Los Angeles, Independence is a one\n\thorse town, and the horse has died...

You understand -- ?\n\n\tTom starts to say \"not really\". Instead, he nods. Memphis takes a\n\troot beer from an old-style machine. He goes out ... front ... To\n\twhere an old Denver Pyle-coot - BUDGY - sits on a bench, smoking\n\tan unfiltered Lucky ... Memphis sits beside him, pets the \n\t200-year-old DOG that lounges nearby...\n\n\t\t\t\tBUDGY\n\t\tJust can't find good help these days --\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\t\t(re: cigarette)\n\t\tThose things'll kill ya, Budgy --\n\n\t\t\t\tBUDGY\n\t\tThey won't have a chance.

Or Kip goes in that box.\n\t\tThat was the deal ... Goddamn, it ...\n\t\tThat was the deal ...\n\n\tMemphis is by a TABLE SAW... He flicks it on. The electric MOTOR\n\trumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ...\n\n\t\t\t\tCALITRI (cont'd)\n\t\tWhat are you doing -- ?\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tTell you what I'm not doing: I'm not\n\t\tgonna let you get into my Kool Aid...\n\n\tAnd Memphis is on him... They go rolling about in grunts and\n\tgroans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table saw\n\tdrowning out the sounds of combat ...\n\n\tCalitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the\n\tlethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's\n\twrist, straining, the point inches from his eye\n\n\tANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last\n\tgasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a\n\tsmall CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl\n\takimbo ...\n\n\tBoth men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself\n\tout inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...\n\n\tHe crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on\n\tthe younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair\n\tand tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into\n\tthe floor ...\n\n\tOnce, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ... Memphis gets to his\n\tfeet, nose bloody. He catches his breath. Only the door opens ...\n\tAnd Atley is there ...\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON\n\t\tJesus, man ... What'd you do?\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tMy version of \"take this job and shove\n\t\tit...\"\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON\n\t\tAre you crazy? You throw down with The\n\t\tCarpenter? You got a grudge against\n\t\tyour life?\n\n\tBut before Memphis can respond, there are APPROACHING ENGINE\n\tSOUNDS from up the alleyway -- as A PANEL VAN arrives. Memphis and\n\tAtley look at the wall-clock. 8:05. A glance to the unconscious\n\tCalitri ...\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON (cont'd)\n\t\tNow you done it. And with you\n\t\tgone - who'll save Kip the next\n\t\ttime ... ?\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tThis is all about there not being\n\t\ta next time, Atley --\n\n\tAnd the two men hold the look... And the van doors slam, as Digger\n\tand Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... Atley goes to the\n\tunconscious Calitri ... And he picks him up, straining under the\n\tdead weight ... Dragging the don over to\n\n\tTHE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops\n\tCalitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the\n\tcoffin. He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and\n\tButz are there -\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON\n\t\tHello, boys -- !\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\tHey! What happened? Did they make it\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON\n\t\tThey did not. A tragedy.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\tMr. C. around?\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON\n\t\tHe's napping. He said to take it away...\n\n\tAtley gestures to the coffin. And they pick it up, move it to the\n\tvan...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\tThat'll do ya. Tell Mr. C. we was by.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tAbsolutely.\n\n\tAnd they are gone ... And Atley turns to Memphis\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON\n\t\tDing Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tPoint-five ...\n\n\tAnd he holds out his hand ... And they shake ...\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON\n\t\tGet outta here, Memphis --\n\n\tAnd Memphis does ... Nods to Atley...\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tThank you...\n\n\tAtley nods ... Memphis walks out to the loading dock... Atley\n\twatches him go ...\n\n\t\t\t\tATLEY JACKSON\n\t\tHoo-boy.\n\n\tEXT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP - LOADING DOCK\n\n\tMemphis walks to the battered Eleanor ... As Pearl Jam's\n\t\"Rearviewmirror' crunches and a CAR comes motoring up to him. It's\n\tANOTHER 167 SHELBY. ANOTHER ELEANOR, a \"For Sale\" sign pasted on\n\tthe back window. It's being driven by Kip...\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tWhat are you doing here?\n\n\t\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tI saw her get smashed-up on the TV.\n\t\tKnew there was no way he was gonna\n\t\taccept her ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tWhere'd you find this one?\n\n\t\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tYa gotta keep tabs on your \"Eleanors\",\n\t\tMemphis.

An UNMARKED\n\twith Code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens ... Memphis considers\n\t... He could make another run ... But the looks at Kip... Enough\n\tis enough ... He pulls over ...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIP (cont'd)\n\t\tWhat are you doing? You can outrun\n\t\thim...\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tIt's over. The dumb shit is over ...\n\n\tThe unmarked pulls up behind him...

Showing stuffed holster ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tIt's finished, Randall. Get out of\n\t\tthe car... You, too, kid...\n\n\tMemphis starts to get out. When Castleback's RADIO crackles.\n\n\t\t\t\tRADIO (O.S.)\n\t\tWe have suspect vehicle matching description\n\t\tat the Woodburn Scrap and Metal ... Repeat:\n\t\tthe suspect vehicle has just been\n\t\tapprehended at the Woodburn Scrap and Metal,\n\t\t190 Street and Campanza ...\n\n\tCastlebeck frowns, goes to his radio. Memphis looks at Kip.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tI reported it ...\n\n\tMemphis is impressed...\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tNot bad\n\n\tANGLE - CASTLEBECK at his car, on the radio ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tDispatch, what's the license on\n\t\tthe suspect vehicle... ?\n\n\t\t\t\tRADIO (O.S.)\n\t\tLicense is California 6-1-4 HSO.

A vanity\n\tplate that says - MY 67 ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\t10-4.\n\n\tAnd he goes back over to Memphis ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)\n\t\tLooks like we live to fight another\n\t\tround. You're free to go ...\n\n\tMemphis can barely believe it. Castlebeck leans down, to Kip:\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK (cont'd)\n\t\tYour brother's a clever man and a\n\t\ttalented thief, Kipling. But as role\n\t\tmodels go, you should observe the man,\n\t\tnot the thief ...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tYes, sir ...\n\n\tCastlebeck sighs...\n\n\t\t\t\tMEMPHIS\n\t\tDon't look so glum, Detective. It's a\n\t\tbeautiful day, the birds are singing,\n\t\tand there's a container ship on\n\t\tPier 14, that's guaranteed to bring you glee ...\n\n\tCastlebeck nods ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE CASTLEBECK\n\t\tI want you gone, Randall.

The boys are huddled together...\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRROR MAN\n\t\tPoor Toby, man...\n\n\tA few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE SPHINX \n\t\tIf his premature demise has, in some way,\n\t\tenlightened the rest of you as to the\n\t\tgrim finish below the glossy veneer of\n\t\tcriminal life, and inspired you to change\n\t\tyour ways, then his death carries with it\n\t\tan inherent nobility.

Digger and Butz slide\n\tthe casket from the van, parked before an ALREADY DUG GRAVE.\n\n\tAs they move the casket, a KNOCKING from inside. A POUNDING. And\n\tmuffled CRIES.
