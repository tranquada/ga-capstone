Tell us what we're up against. \n\nGolden \n(V.O.)\n In it's simplest terms? The end of Mankind. One asteroid, one  \nmile wide or bigger, impacts the Earth with the equivalent force \nof all the  nuclear weapons in the  world, times a thousand. Half \nour population will die within 24  hours from tidal waves and \nheat pulses. The other half won't be so lucky. In the  end, it \nwill be men  eating the flesh of other men. \n(beat)\n It's not the end of the  world, General, the world - Earth - \nwill still be here. But there will be no  life - maybe \ncockroaches and  some resilient strands of bacteria. \n\nTemple Well, that's really positive, Dan. The President just got \noff the phone  with the Russians. They're just about to launch a \nnew Mars Probe on the biggest  rocket in the world.  Golden and \nthe N.A.S.A.

Enough punch in their \nopinion - not to break it up -  but to slow it down enough to \nmiss Earth's orbit. \n\nGolden \n(V.O)\n Their launch date is set for next month.\n\nTemple They're going to move it up.\n\nGolden \n(V.O)\n To when?\n\nTemple Sixteen hours from now.\n\nAll the N.A.S.A. Technicians CLAMOR at once.\n\nGolden \n(V.O)\n What are they gonna do, glue, spit, and scotch tape it together?  \nEven if they get a nuke out to the asteroid, a surface nuclear \ndetonation is not  going to work.  The only way is to split the \nthing in half and hope the two pieces  slide past us. \n\nTemple Thank you for bringing up the impossible, Dan.\n\nColinswood People, the President's joining us, Mr. President?\n\nPresident \n(V.O)\n Well, this has been a tough day. The media's all over this.  \nThey're going to get nothing. Telling the public we might all be \ndead in  eighteen days achieves nothing but panic. \n\nGolden \n(V.O)\n Mr President, finding this speck in the sky is a very hard thing  \nto do unless you have the exact co-ordinates. There are only \ntwelve telescopes  powerful enough  to see it right now. You've \ngot a full moon goin' for four days -  makes it all but \nimpossible to see..

Quincy has \ncoke bottle  glasses and a 198 I.Q.\n\nQuincy Look: set a fire cracker off in your open palm, you get a \nthird degree  burn. Close your fist, It'll do some serious \ndamage. If we can get a nuke deep  in one of the asteroid's fault \nlines, she'll split in two, like a diamond. \n\nGolden You're all looking art us like we're crazy. We're not.\n\nSkip Dan, our currant shuttle fleet is too old and too slow.\n\nGolden What I'm going to tell you is a breach of national \nsecurity and could  land me in jail, but in eighteen days there \narnt' gonna be any jails,  so....We're not gonna use a  current \nshuttle.

Oh, that boat down \nthere with a  thousand horsepower diesel!\n\nGreenpeace Leader How can you wake up every day and look at \nyourself in the  mirror?\n\nHarry The same way you did when you blow-dried your hair this \nmorning. And you  used a curling iron, I betcha. Did you know \nmost electricity's from burning oil?  I'' stop drillin' when the \nworld - stops usin' it. Bennie, start 'er up! \n\nGreenpeace Leader Wait........\n\nHarry Can't wait! I'm a businessman! Those goons over there gave \nme 57 mil. to  find oil and they ain't leavin' till I do!

Chick nods to \nA.J., who engages  the gears. The PIPE STRING turns at FULL \nSPEED. The new drill pipe descends ten  feet into the hole, \nthen....\n\nThe torque rips the NEWLY ATTACHED PIPE from the drilling string. \nThe drill  spins freely.\n\nA.J. hits the \"stop! lever and stares at Harry.\n\nThe roughnecks converge around the wellhead.\n\nA.J.

This place looks like \n\"Q's\" weapons shop from the James  Bond movies as funded by every \ncompany on the fortune 500 -- \n\nHuge, clinically clean, dominated by MASSIVE ROCKET ENGINES. \nTECHNICIANS in  white coats and hairnets work on a variety of \nequipment. \n\nTECHNICIANS hunch over a ROVER VEHICE, not the golf cart used on \nthe moon. This  is low, squat, sturdy, with an enclosed airlocked \npassenger compartment. \n\nQuincy The \"Armadillo\" - our fourth generation rover. It carries \na six-cell  solar engine with 824 horses. This was a joint \nventure with the Germans. \n(winks)\n  It's designed by Porsche. \n\nQuincy motions to TWO TECHNICIANS. They roll over a ROBOTIC ARM \non a gurney,  powered by an ELECTRIC MOTOR. The robotic arm is \nconnected to an OIL DRILLING  BIT. \n\nHarry Where's the Kelly?\n\nQuincy This baby works without one.\n\nHarry How does it work?\n\nHarry starts to inspect the bit.\n\nQuincy It works through a series of complexly designed \ndifferential gears.\n\nHarry's face tightens, as he studies the bit further --\n\nHarry This is my Patent.\n\nQuincy \"Drilling Power Transfer Without Conventional Hydraulics,\" \nby Harry S.  Stamper. You registered it with the U.S. Patent \nOffice last year. \n\nHarry You stole it.\n\nQuincy We just borrowed it, Mister Stamper.\n\nQuincy unpockets a remote control panel and presses a button. The \ndrill bit  presses down into a block of concrete and begins to \nrapidly CHEW through it, as  Harry marvels at the realisation of \nhis design.\n\nQuincy \n(cont'd)\n We built this arm to mine ice from the moon -- greatest  \ndiscovery in space in thirty years.\n\nHarry What'd this cost?\n\nGolden Ten million.\n\nQuincy Twenty-our million.\n\nHarry Boy, I'm in the wrong line of work.

No torque adjustment, no pressure release valve....a big \nhunk of junk.\n\nQuincy We're working on that.\n\nHarry What happens if you hit gas? You have three seconds. Drill \nfaster, run  like hell, or pray. \n(beat)\n Time's up. You're dead., The rig just blew. \n\nGolden Gentlemen, gentlemen, wait a second. The crux of the \nmatter....\n\nHarry Hang on. I betcha everyone in this room has a PH.D.\n\nGolden Or three....\n\nHarry I left school after tenth grade. I earned my PH.D every day \noffshore  drilling holes. You can't get it in a book. Drilling \nholes is about instinct -  about smellin' it. Drillin' holes is \nan art. You want the crux of the matter?\n(beat)\n You stole my  patent, and you don't have a goddamn idea how to \nuse it. As for this piece o'  crap, don't insult me. \n(walks around the rig)\n I'll rebuild it - the right way - and drill the  hole for you. \n\nGrace Uhm, pop, could we discuss this...?\n\nHarry Just give me a space suit.\n\nGolden You won't need one.

The guys \nhop down, turning  on their PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS. Bear begins \noff-loading 20-foot long DRILLING  PIPES. \n\nHarry takes readings from a SEISMIC INSTRUMENT. Pulls out a SOIL \nSAMPLER, a  small shovel on a telescoping shaft. He digs it in \nwith his boot. Clang. It  doesn't dig in at all. He walks around, \nstabbing it into the ground. CLANG.  CLANG. \n\nChick exchanges nervous looks with Bear and Max. \n\nHarry Bedrock. Whole goddamn place is Bedrock. \n\nHarry examines the ground. Not satisfied. He finds a spot he \nlikes; digs an \"X\"  in the soil with his boot. \n\nHarry \n(cont'd)\n Here. Fire up the Bad Boy bit. \n\nChick, Max and Bear go into action. Max screws the Bad Boy bit \nonto the first  drilling pipe. Bear hoists the pipe up to the \nDRILLING MECHANISM, muscles it  onto the DRILL DRIVE, then clamps \nit on. \n\nHarry plugs a TEE and GOLF BALL into the craggy surface. He \nwaggles his club, a  5-IRON HEAD, screwed onto the soil sampler's \nshaft. \n\nPitts What's he doing? \n\nChick Wildcatters are superstitious, Colonel.

It's  turning, but not drilling. \nBear and Max approach the drill hole. \n\nBear What in hell's down there?\n\nHarry Chick, bring 'er up!\n\nChick throws it in reverse. The DRILLING ARM reverses out of the \nhole. The Bad  Boy bot comes up CHEWED TO SHREDS. Harry and the \nguys examine the drill bit.  Everyone exchanges a worried look. \n\nMax The dream.

The \nalumniium gurney is smashed, mangled. \n\nSharp Three on that side, the rest over here. \n\nThey hoist the nuclear device and carry it to the drilling hole. \nThey plug one  end of the nuke in the drilling hole and lift the \nother. The NUKE begins to  insert down the hole. Suddenly Sharp \ntries to grab a TUBULAR PIECE OF ALUMINIUM  from the broken \ngurney. \n\nSharp \n(cont'd)\n Stop...! \n\n-- rams it into the wheels of the NUKE'S RATCHET-WHEEL DELIVERY \nSLED. The nuke  stops inserting into the hole. Sharp inspects the \nREMOTE DETONATOR. \n\nSharp \n(cont'd)\n The remote's shot. \n(looks up)\n It'll have to be manually  detonated. \n\nChick What's that mean? \n\nPause. \n\nHarry Means one of us ain't leaving. \n\nINT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL \n\nGolden addresses the room. \n\nGolden The situation: the hole is drilled but the remote \ndetonator is not  functional. One of the crew is going to stay \nbehind and....\n(deep breath)\n  ...manually detonate the device. \n\nGolden looks over at Grace. She is stunned. The news is just \nsinking in. \n\nGolden Don't stay for this. \n\nGrace I'm not leaving. \n\nTemple In 18 minutes we will be at Zero Barrier. \n(to Grace)\n Your father better  be a man of his word. \n\nINT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - CABIN \n\nPAN FROM HARRY...to A.J. to...to Chick....to Lev...to Bear. \nEveryone is huddled  inside the cabin. \n\nThe SMASHED REMOTE DETONATOR, a 2000-foot spool-drum of \nELECTRICAL WIRE and a  KNIFE sit on the table. \n\nSharp \n(stoically)\n I'd trade places with any one of you. But we need two people  to \nfly this mother back. So, we either all stay or you guys draw. \n\nSharp raises a BUNDLE OF ELECTRICAL WIRES in his hand. The crew's \ngoing to draw  straws. The highest tension yet. No one breathes, \nno one moves. \n\nSharp Who's first? \n(no response)\n Clockwise then. \n\nSharp holds the WIRE STRAND BUNDLE in front of Lev. \n\nLev stares at it. He smiles nervously and reaches...and draws. \nThe strand is  LONG. Lev exhales. Next... \n\nChick, Chick stares at the bundle, sweating. He grabs a strand. \nPulls slowly.  LONG. He exhales. Next... \n\nBear. He stares at the bundle, thinking, choosing. He grabs and \npulls quickly,  decisively. LONG. Two strands remain, and two \nmen, Harry and A.J. It's A.J.'s  turn.... \n\nA.J. stares at the wire strands - not a bundle now. A.J. shifts \nin his chair.  The matter will be decided on this last pull. A.J. \nlooks at Harry. They lock  eyes. \n\nHarry Your turn. \n\nA.J. I ain't gonna draw against you Harry. \n\nChick \n(starts to get up)\n I can't watch this. \n\nHarry \n(stern, hard)\n Sit down, Chick. \n\nChick sits down. Harry looks at A.J. \n\nHarry Draw. \n\nA.J. stares at the two strands. Gets used to the idea. He reaches \nand begins to  pull. Stops. Chooses the other strand. And pulls. \nIt is SHORT. A.J. stares at  the SHORT STRAND OF WIRE in his \nhand. We see a fear on his face that gets  covered by a small \nsmile. \n\nA.J. Well, I guess I won. Now I'm the guy who gets to save the \nEarth. \n\nA.J. takes off the half medallion. Harry takes off his half \nmedallion. \n\nA.J. We said we'd join these after we drilled the hole. It just \nain't gonna be  on Earth. \n\nThey slide the two halves together to make a whole. Harry and \nA.J. exchange a  long look. \n\nINT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - COCKPIT \n\nWatts flips switches.

Harry and A.J. \nalligator-clamp the end of the  wire spool-drum onto the nuke's \nDETONATION DEVICE. \n\nA.J You never answered my question. \n\nThey finish attaching the wire. \n\nA.J. pulls the piece of TUBULAR ALUMINIUM out of the nuke's \nratchet wheel  delivery sled. The NUKE descends downhole, slowly \nspooling out wire from the  SPOOL DRUM. \n\nA.J. About Grace, Harry. \n(laughs nervously)\n I know it ain't gonna happen now,  but....if things were \ndifferent...What would you say...? \n\nHarry walks back toward Freedom. A.J. follows. \n\nHarry I always wanted a son. And if I had....I'd want him to be \nlike you. \n\nHarry hands him the pipe section. \n\nHarry \n(cont'd)\n You're going to need some magic in the world. You can marry  \nher, A.J. \n\nA.J. laughs, being told at this dire time in his life. He looks \nat Harry with a  hint of bittersweet smile. \n\nA.J. Mean \"could have...?\" \n\nHarry No. Go home, A.J. Marry Grace. \n\nA.J. I'm not going home Harry. \n\nWith one hand, Harry stabs the airlock door, and then with a \nsmall pipe clamp,  rips A.J.'s air tubes off. \n\nHarry It's my hole, I drilled it, and I'm staying with it till \nthe end. \n\nHarry grabs him, throws his kicking, screaming body into the \nairlock. A.J. is  choking. \n\nHarry \n(cont'd)\n She's always going to be my little girl. \n\nThe door shuts automatically. Harry is now alone. \n\nINT. SHUTTLE FREEDOM - AIRLOCK \n\nA.J. explodes from the airlock into the cabin. \n\nA.J. Goddamn it, HARRY....! \n\nA.J. lunges for the airlock. \n\nSharp grabs A.J. with his good arm, helped by Bear..holding him \nback. \n\nA.J. LET ME GO....LET ME GO....!! \n\nSHARP YOU HAVE NO OXYGEN...YOUR TUBES ARE RIPPED...LET IT \nGO....!! \n\nA.J., sobbing, furious, POUNDS on the AIRLOCK WINDOW, staring at \nHarry outside. \n\nA.J. \n(pounding on the door)\n HARRY!! \n\nHarry turns and walks back to the drilling hole. Sharp looks at \nhim. \n\nSharp This guy really is a hero.... \n\nINT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL REAR ROOM \n\nSkip Director? It's Mr. Stamper. He wants to talk to his \ndaughter. \n\nGolden looks over at Grace. Their eyes meet.... \n\nA N.A.S.A. Tech hands Grace a mike and exits. She stares at the \nstatic on the  monitor. Harry's face fades in and out. Grace \nknows something is very wrong from  her father's strained, tired \nface. She forces a smile. INTERCUT with Harry  inside the \nArmadillo\n\nGrace Daddy. \n\nHarry \n(V.O.)\n Grace. I...\n(sighs)\n This is so hard for me.

So pure. \n(swallows  hard)\n I remember something I read once...\"The world is a fine \nplace...and worth  fighting for.\"  looks at Earth, smiles)\n Gracie, I'm just an iron-ass-warrior doin'  what's best. \n(pause)\n Take care of A.J. I'll look in on you from time to time.... \n\nHarry pulls off the video link. Grace's monitors go black. Grace \ntouches the  monitor, as Harry's face fades away. \n\nHer knees buckle. She sinks to the floor. \n\nEXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE \n\nHarry looks at the detonator in hand. \n\nHarry You have three minutes and I'm not waiting. \n\nINT.
