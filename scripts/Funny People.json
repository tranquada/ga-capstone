BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT\n\n          GEORGE SIMMONS, 42, sits in a giant living room watching bad\n          television on a 70-inch flat screen TV. He looks bored and\n          empty. After a few beats he pauses the TV, and picks up the\n          phone.\n\n          GEORGE\n          (on the phone)\n          Hey, it's George Simmons, I'm\n          coming in.\n\n          INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT\n\n          Shots of George doing stand up on stage at a comedy club.\n          The place adores him. We see quick images of him after the\n          show interacting with people. He is clearly a very famous\n          comedian.\n\n          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          George has sex with a girl in her early twenties.\n\n          INT. BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT\n\n          George sits back down, the thrill of his performance is gone,\n          he is bored and alone again. He hits play on his TV and\n          begins watching his show from the same spot it was at before.\n\n          MUSIC UP:\"WITH A LITTLE LUCK\" - PAUL MCCARTNEY\n\n          BEGIN CREDIT SEQUENCE\n\n          INT. BEL AIR HOME - BEDROOM - DAY\n\n          GEORGE wakes up in a large, clean, modern house. He is all\n          alone. We get the feeling that he hired someone to decorate\n          his house. It is very nice, but doesn't seem personal to him\n          at all. It feels new, with all the gadgets, but a little\n          cold. On the kitchen table is a stack of scripts he is\n          supposed to read.\n\n          EXT. GEORGE'S HOME - MORNING\n\n          George hits balls in his home batting cage. Then we see him\n          driving golf balls inside there. In the background we see\n          his modern, space ship looking house. It is enormous.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n\n          INT.

MEDICAL TOWER - DAY\n\n          George gets out of his car and walks towards the tower. Two\n          COLLEGE STUDENTS walk over.\n\n          COLLEGE STUDENT\n          Hey George, can I get a picture\n          with you?\n\n          GEORGE\n          Sure buddy.

DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n          George sits in the doctor's office staring at the photos of\n          the doctor with his beautiful young children. DOCTOR STEVENS\n          enters and sits down. He takes a deep breath.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I like those lunestas. They really\n          put me to sleep without giving me\n          the sleeping pill hangover I get\n          from the restorils.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3.\n\n          GEORGE (COIN ' D )\n\n          (BEAT)\n          I try not to take them too often.\n          Just when I know I have to get up\n          early.\n\n          DOCTOR STEVENS\n          George there are some\n          irregularities in your blood\n          work...\n          George's face turns white. He knows what this means. The\n          doctor keeps talking but the sound keeps coming in and out--\n          it is now all a jumble of words.\n\n          ANGLE ON GEORGE'S POV\n          We see photos of the doctor's family, his graduation\n          certificates, files of other cases, odd doctor's office art,\n          a picture of him skiing with his family. He keeps talking,\n          but now we hear nothing.\n          MUSIC UP - \"MY SHIT's FUCKED UP\" BY WARREN ZEVON\n\n          EXT. MEDICAL TOWER - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          George walks down the stairs towards the parking lot in a\n          daze. An ASIAN GIRL and her MOTHER and BROTHER see him and\n          start screaming.\n\n          GIRL\n          Oh my God. Can you take a picture\n          with me?\n\n          GEORGE\n          Yeah, sure.\n          She puts her arm around him. Her little brother jumps in\n          too.\n\n          GIRL\n          Thanks. You are the funniest.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Thanks, pal.\n\n          !NT. CAR - DAY\n          George drives home.

In the\n          family of Hodgkins disease. We\n          really don't have a treatment for\n          it. There are things we can try.\n          They're all very experimental in\n          nature.\n\n          GEORGE (V.0.)\n          I don't understand what this means.\n\n          DOCTOR STEVENS (V.0.)\n          I think you need to hope for the\n          best and prepare for the worst.

My daughter-in-law, she\n          ate turkey and then she had a\n          miscarriage.\n\n          IRA\n          I haven't heard about that. But I\n          may not be informed enough to\n          comment.\n\n          WOMAN\n          Well, you're not a doctor, so you\n          shouldn't comment.\n\n          IRA\n          You are correct, I am not a doctor.\n\n          INT.

BEL AIR HOME - DUSK\n\n          An Otis Redding song is playing as George walks around his\n          house in a daze, not sure how to process this. He doesn't\n          call anybody. There's nobody in sight. We see images of him\n          thinking about the unthinkable and the life he's lead.\n          He sits in his office, surrounded by photos of himself at\n          difference ages. It builds to a sequence of him going\n          through stacks of old photos and watching videos of himself,\n          reviewing his life, trying to make sense of what it all\n          meant. We see clips of his good movies and his last bad\n          movie. On the wall is a poster of a buddy film which shows\n          him and another famous comedian.\n          ON-SCREEN -- home video of George at college. George is\n          hanging out with his friends. They are acting goofy, having\n          the time of their lives. George looks very young, skinny,\n          and carefree. Life has never been better.

IRA'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n          Ira sits with one of his roommates, LEO, who is also an\n          aspiring comedian. They sit across from each other, kicking\n          around joke ideas they have, trying to write new ones. We\n          see an entire pitch session play out.\n          Ira's joke pitches are all over the place. He clearly hasn't\n          figured out what his stage persona is yet.\n\n          IRA\n          I was thinking about doing\n          something about how I'm not good\n          looking and I'm not bad looking.\n          I'm just good looking enough that\n          if I had a good personality, it\n          could put me over the top. If that\n          was the case.\n\n          LEO\n          Yeah, something about how the\n          uglier you are, the better the\n          personality you need. And the\n          hotter you are, the stupider you\n          can be.\n\n          IRA\n          I had a joke once about how you\n          never see incredibly hot, blonde,\n          homeless women. Because someone\n          will always take care of that kind\n          of woman. That woman could be the\n          dumbest person on earth and she\n          will survive in this world.\n\n          LEO\n          Maybe something like... you can be\n          hot and stupid and survive in the\n          world.

The place goes crazy. He does some\n          of his normal routine and the audience laughs and is very\n          appreciative.\n          As George continues his act, it starts getting darker and\n          darker until he is talking about death and the lack of\n          meaning in it all.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Ah life. What does it mean?\n          sometimes life makes perfect sense.\n          And then you `come'.\n\n          ON IRA\n\n          IRA\n          He's killing the crowd.

Crazy\n          shit happens. You've got to be\n          nice to each other. You never know\n          what's going to happen.\n          Ira passes George as he heads onto the stage.\n\n          GEORGE (CONT'D)\n          Sorry I sucked it up out there. At\n          least they are well rested for you.\n          Ira, takes the stage. He starts trying to do his act, but he\n          is unsure of himself and unable to figure out how to take the\n          weird energy of the room and spin it to his advantage. He\n          basically bombs. We reveal Chuck and his date watching,\n          looking miserable.\n\n          IRA\n          I'm not good looking. I'm not bad\n          looking. I'm just in the middle.\n          And if I had a personality that was\n          Jut good enough, it would put me\n          over the edge.\n          The joke fails. We reveal George also watching him bomb,\n          amused by his struggle. He sees something he likes in Ira.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          13.\n\n          EXT. PARKING LOT\n\n          Ira walks to his car. In the spot next to him is an enormous\n          Suburban SUV parked in a spot meant for compact cars. It is\n          so close to Ira's car that it isn't possible to open the\n          door. He hears some banging and odd wails from in the car.\n          Ira knocks on the window. We see that George is sitting in\n          his car in a world of pain. He's clearly been crying. The\n          knock startles him. He turns to Ira.\n\n          IRA\n          Sorry, man. I didn't mean to\n          disturb you. I just can't open my\n          door. There's no room.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Oh I'm sorry. Let me pull out.\n          George pulls the car back ten feet.\n\n          GEORGE (CONT'D)\n          (calling to Ira)\n          Hey man, you had some funny shit\n          tonight.\n\n          IRA\n          Thanks!\n\n          GEORGE\n          Man, that audience hated you. They\n          really did not like you. They liked\n          your buddy, who looked exactly like\n          you but was funnier. Man, that's\n          going to haunt you. You're going\n          to wake up in six months and think\n          about this night.\n\n          IRA\n          Well, I'll probably bomb worse\n          tomorrow and forget about this one.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I'm just fucking with you. You had\n          some funny jokes in there. Good\n          writing.\n\n          IRA\n          Well, obviously, I'm a... you\n          know...I grew up on your shit, man.\n          George just stares at him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          14.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Alright, pal. Don't worry. Only\n          two hundred people saw that\n          tonight. I'll see you later.\n          George pulls out, turns the car around, and as he passes by\n          Ira, he steers his car as if he's going to run him down, and\n          starts screaming...\n\n          GEORGE (CONT'D)\n          You're gonna die!!! I'm gonna kill\n          you!\n          Then he smiles at Ira and drives off. Ira smiles. This is\n          the greatest thing that's ever happened to him.\n\n          INT.

You want to talk\n          to me while I try to go to sleep.\n          Ira doesn't know what to make of this.\n\n          IRA\n          I guess so.\n\n          INT.

I'm sorry. It\n          was just so clear that you were not\n          going to get it done. I figured\n          you wouldn't mind.\n\n          IRA\n          That is crazy. That is super\n          crazy.\n\n          GEORGE\n          It was great. It was crazy great.\n\n          IRA\n          How can that even happen? I guess\n          I understand the first one, but why\n          would the second one do it? You\n          probably stink of the first girl.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          25.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Well, we took a steam shower\n          together.\n\n          IRA\n          What?\n\n          GEORGE\n          she had never seen a steam shower\n          before, I told her she should enjoy\n          it.\n\n          IRA\n          She wouldn't fool around with me\n          because she said she had a\n          boyfriend.\n\n          GEORGE\n          She told me that too, but she says\n          I was on her and her boyfriend's\n          list of people she was allowed to\n          screw. You'd be surprised how many\n          women have me on that list.\n\n          IRA\n          I should get going.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Just talk to me before I fall\n          asleep. I'm weird. I don't like\n          being alone. You should crash in\n          one of the rooms. You're too drunk\n          to drive home. I won't try to fuck\n          you, I just fucked two women and\n          I'm kind of done.\n\n          IRA\n          I may have to whack it in your\n          guest room.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Whack away, I don't give a shit.\n\n          (BEAT)\n          Hey, you were funny tonight. I\n          could see how you could get good.\n\n          IRA\n          Thanks. That was fun. It was rare\n          that I get to play to more than\n          twenty-five people.

My dad always seemed\n          annoyed with me. He'd always crack\n          me on the head. You would not see\n          it coming. I spent my whole\n          childhood trying to make my dad\n          laugh so he wouldn't smack me. But\n          he was an awesome guy. He was the\n          coolest. He just got annoyed with\n          me. Do you like your parents?\n          They can't be that bad, because\n          you're not that funny.\n\n          IRA\n          They're bananas. And always broke.\n          They got divorced ten years ago,\n          but they both act like it just\n          happened last week. They hate each\n          other. They always put me in the\n          middle of it. I always wanted them\n          to say, \"We don't want you to\n          suffer through this, so we're just\n          going to handle it ourselves.\"\n          They never would do it. They would\n          always make me feel their pain all\n          the time. I would never do that\n          for my kids. Because it's like\n          they._`.re kids. And no matter how\n          many times I tell them to leave me\n          out of it, they never do.\n          Ira notices that George is very close to falling asleep.\n\n          IRA (CONT'D)\n          I'll let you crash.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          27.\n\n          GEORGE\n          No, keep going.

So...\n          (knows he's a sleeping\n          pill at this point)\n          I work at a supermarket at the deli\n          counter. I hate it, but the\n          money's actually pretty good.\n          Better than you'd think. But I'd\n          rather do comedy full-time if I\n          could.\n          The camera pulls back as Ira continues to talk, and we begin\n          to HEAR George snoring, as Ira continues to talk anyway.\n\n          INT.

Some weird\n          thing, almost nobody has it. All\n          these are experimental.\n\n          IRA\n          Are you fucking with me?

I don't feel weird\n          around you. I don't want to be\n          treated like a guy who's going to\n          die.\n\n          IRA\n          I don't know, man. I don't think\n          you want to go through this alone.\n          I think you've got to tell people.\n          Your family. Your friends.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Actually, the reason why I only\n          told you is I need you to do me a\n          favor.\n\n          IRA\n          What? Anything, man.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I can't imagine suffering through\n          the final stages of this.

And I thought\n          maybe tonight, I would take a bunch\n          of sleeping pills, and when I slept\n          you would put a bullet in my head.\n\n          IRA\n          I can't do that!\n\n          GEORGE\n          I'll give you fifty thousand\n          dollars in cash.

But I bet you have a\n          lot of unfinished business with\n          your friends. Wouldn't it make you\n          feel a lot better to get your\n          affairs in order? What do people\n          do at this moment Don't they have\n          to do stuff?\n\n          GEORGE\n          I don't want to do anything. I\n          just want to be in the moment and\n          live every day the best I can. As\n          soon as I confront it with\n          everybody, everything's changed and\n          I can't get back.\n\n          IRA\n          Everything has changed. At some\n          point you're going to get really\n          sick and you need your friends and\n          family around you. I'm sure\n          there's a lot of business, estate\n          issues, I don't know. Maybe you'll\n          feel better than if you just deal\n          with everything. Where are your\n          parents?\n\n          GEORGE\n          P4y parents would drop dead if I\n          told them what was happening.\n          They're in their 80s. They don't\n          have to go through this. I'll make\n          sure they find out at the last\n          possible second.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          42.\n\n          IRA\n          Friends?\n\n          GEORGE\n          I don't think I do. I thought I\n          did. I got a lot of people I know,\n          shoot the shit with, fuck around\n          with. But I realized when this\n          happened I'm not close to anyone.\n          I had no one to call. My\n          friendships are Hollywood\n          friendships. When I was lying in\n          bed I couldn't think of one person\n          I wanted to share this with. Maybe\n          it's me, maybe I never got close to\n          anybody.\n\n          IRA\n          I think if you talk to people you'd\n          find out a lot of people care about\n          you. You're kind of old already, I\n          mean, compared to me. I'm sure you\n          touched a lot of people's lives.\n          You can't spend the rest of your\n          days making phoney phone calls\n          alone in your room.\n\n          GEORGE\n          The only reason I did that was\n          because I couldn't sleep. And I\n          had no one to call.\n\n          IRA\n          Well maybe that's the problem.\n          Maybe if you told more people you'd\n          have more people to call. You\n          can't just talk to me about it, I\n          don't know what the fuck I'm\n          talking about. You're the first\n          person I've known who's sick. I'm\n          not good at it.\n          (eyes beginning to well\n\n          UP)\n          You've given me diarrhea, I'm\n          nervous about you and I'm in over\n          my head.\n\n          GEORGE\n          (his eyes begin to well\n\n          UP)\n          Don't cry in front of me, man. I\n          can't start that.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          43.\n\n          IRA\n          I'm sorry.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Seriously. I can't...I can't have\n          you do that.\n          George really begins to cry.\n\n          GEORGE (CONT'D)\n          Please don't do that.\n\n          IRA\n          (tears streaming down his\n\n          FACE)\n          I won't do it, I promise, man.\n          Ira wipes the tears from his face. New tears immediately\n          come out.\n\n          IRA (CONT'D)\n          That was first and last time. I'm\n          not even crying anymore.\n\n          GEORGE\n\n          (CRYING)\n          You're still crying.\n\n          IRA\n          (tears coming down)\n          I don't think I am. I think I'm\n          not anymore. I'm not sure what\n          you're talking about.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Okay, as long as we got that\n          straight.\n          George takes a napkin and puts it over his face.\n\n          IRA\n          I'm sorry, George. I really don't\n          know what to do, I don't know how\n          to help you.\n\n          GEORGE\n          (his face still in the\n\n          NAPKIN)\n          No, you're right. I really should\n          tell some people. It just sucks,\n          man. It just sucks. And they're\n          going to feel so bad, I don't even\n          want to look at them and tell them.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          44.\n\n          GEORGE (CONT'D)\n          I'd rather drop dead. of a heart\n          attack and have someone else make\n          the calls. I have to make those\n          calls? This is a nightmare. This\n          is a total nightmare.\n\n          IRA\n          Do you want me to call them, and\n          tell them what's going on?\n\n          GEORGE\n          Yeah.\n\n          IRA\n          Fuck. I was hoping you were gonna\n          say no.\n\n          INT. IRA'S BEDROOM\n\n          Ira is on the phone. There is a paper with a bunch of\n          numbers in front of him.\n\n          IRA\n          (into the phone)\n          Hi, this is Ira, I'm a friend of\n          George's. He asked me to call you.\n          His roommates are making a commotion outside. Ira covers the\n          receiver.\n\n          IRA (CONT'D)\n          Will you guys shut the fuck up?\n          Shut the fuck up!\n          Ira slam the door.\n\n          IRA (CONT'D)\n          (into phone)\n          I'm sorry. I have some news about\n          George.\n\n          TELLING FRIENDS SEQUENCE\n\n          INT. LIVING ROOM\n\n          George sits with THREE COMEDIANS. They are all laughing and\n          telling old sex stories from george's younger days. Ira sits\n          with them and listens and laughs along.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          45.\n\n          GEORGE\n          So I left the phone off the hook so\n          he could hear me doing it.\n\n          COMEDIAN #1\n          That's very gay.\n\n          COMEDIAN#2\n          No, it was a buddy thing. It was\n          very heterosexual.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Admit it, you were masturbating.\n\n          COMEDIAN#2\n          Of course I was whacking it. What\n          else am I gonna do, not whack it?\n\n          GEORGE\n          And I kept making her talk and say\n          crazy shit just to make him laugh.\n\n          COMEDIAN #2\n          I think at one point you said, \"Say\n          my hog is the biggest you've ever\n          seen.\" And then there is this long\n          pause.\n\n          COMEDIAN#3\n          That's a bad sign. If it was big\n          at all she wouldn't have paused.\n\n          COMEDIAN #1\n          Remember you used to have that joke\n          about how you used to only date\n          midgets because your dick looked\n          bigger in their little hands.\n          They all laugh.\n\n          COMEDIAN #2\n          Yeah, you used to get all the\n          girls, man.\n          Suddenly the air is out of the room, and it is awkward and\n          sad.\n\n          INT. LIVING ROOM\n\n          George is talking to an EX-MANAGER and his WIFE.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          46.\n\n          EX-MANAGER\n          And I feel horrible about it, but\n          the truth is, I was having some\n          issues with gambling, and you were\n          doing so well-and so I took a\n          million dollar check you got in\n          from the studio and I used it to\n          clear up some debts. And I did it\n          with the intention of paying you\n          right back before you noticed. But\n          you never noticed, and I just never\n          got around to paying you back.\n\n          INT. LIVING ROOM\n\n          Allen Covert yells at George for abandoning him.\n\n          COVERT\n          You fucking blew us off. You\n          cocksucker.\n\n          INT. LIVING ROOM\n\n          George is talking to his sister, LISA.\n\n          LISA\n          You have to tell mom and dad.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I will tell them, but right at the\n          end. I don't want them to go\n          through all this. I can't put them\n          through this.\n\n          LISA\n          I wish I wasn't so mad at you. I\n          want to be there for you, but I am\n          so mad at you.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I wish I was a better brother.\n\n          LISA\n          You weren't even a brother. You\n          just left when I was a little kid.\n          You left me there all alone, and\n          you never treated me like a sister\n          again.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          47.\n\n          GEORGE\n          You live so far away. I visited\n          you in Kansas a few years ago.\n\n          LISA\n          That was six years ago, and you\n          were only there because you had a\n          concert. My five-year-old has\n          never even met you.\n          George does not know what to say.\n\n          LISA (CONT'D)\n          And I wanted to bring her, but then\n          I thought she would just fall in\n          love with you and get attached, and\n          then what? I didn't want to do\n          that to her.\n\n          INT. KITCHEN\n\n          George and Ira talk in the kitchen while making beverages.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Thanks a lot, pal. This is\n          everything I didn't want to happen.\n          It's like being at my own funeral.\n\n          IRA\n          Afterwards you'll be happy you did\n          it.\n\n          GEORGE\n          No, I won't.\n\n          INT.

You're still physically\n          doing well, and that's not going to\n          last forever. You should do\n          something active. Go to Colorado,\n          or Tahoe, or something. Or do\n          something crazy. Go to Switzerland,\n          or Sweden, or wherever they have\n          mountains.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          50.\n\n          IRA (CONT'D)\n          I don't know, I don't even ski, but\n          you do. Maybe you should do\n          something like that.\n          Ira notices George is falling asleep, so he talks more\n          quietly. He's gotten good at this.\n\n          IRA (CONT'D)\n          If it's too hard, we can just ski\n          for an hour or two a day, and then\n          get drunk at the bar. You can hit\n          on hot ski instructors, and then I\n          can masturbate in the room thinking\n          about you fucking hot ski\n          instructors.\n          He thinks George is asleep, so he walks out as he speaks.\n\n          IRA (CONT'D)\n          Whatever. It'll be fun to be in the\n          mountain air, fun to look at the\n          mountains. Maybe you shouldn't even\n          be here. We can hang out there as\n          long as you want, I got nothing to\n          do.\n          Ira closes the door.\n\n          INT.

Everything\n          worked out for the best.\n          We see this hurts George.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          51.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I screwed everything up.

SKI SLOPE - DAY\n\n          George and Ira are skiing. There is no music, no noise. It\n          is very peaceful. George stops in a spot where he is\n          surrounded in all directions by gorgeous, majestic mountains.\n          He looks around, taking it all in.\n\n          INT. SKI LODGE HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          George and Ira are watching videotapes of George doing stand-\n          up when he was much younger. He's really, really funny. And\n          very skinny, with a much more pronounced New York accent.\n\n          GEORGE\n          You know, I never got married. I\n          never had kids. I didn't get to do\n          a lot of things I thought I would\n          do. But I was pretty fucking\n          funny, right?\n\n          IRA\n          Come on, are you kidding me? We\n          all want to be you. Most of my\n          comic friends are just doing a bad\n          impression of you. People love\n          your shit.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Well, I made a lot of people laugh.\n          I guess that's something.\n\n          IRA\n          It's a lot.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Yeah.

JAM ROOM - DAY\n\n          George is singing a happy song with a bunch of musician\n          friends, like a Lou Reed/Velvet Underground (or Ramones/New\n          York Dolls/Clash/Warren Zevon/Paul McCartney) song. This\n          music plays over the following montage.\n\n          MONTAGE\n\n          EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n          George walks around his grounds, slowly. And one gets the\n          sense he's never looked around and seen where he lives\n          before. He likes it.\n\n          INT. IMPROV - NIGHT\n\n          George performs at the Improv. We see him gesture to a woman\n          that she can come up on stage and she hugs him. The crowd\n          erupts. She runs back to her seat. George continues with\n          his act.\n\n          EXT.

BACKYARD - NIGHT\n\n          George is walking around his yard at night. He's clearly\n          never walked the grounds at night. He seems at peace.\n\n          INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n          Lisa and her husband are now over, and George is talking to\n          them and playing with her two-year-old boy.\n\n          EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE\n\n          George is sitting with his parents. It is clear he recently\n          told them about his situation, and although there is sadness\n          in the air, they look happy to be close for the first time in\n          a long time.\n          George says something that makes his DAD laugh.\n\n          INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM\n\n          Ira is asleep on the couch. George walks over with a bowl of\n          ice cream. He whacks Ira a few times trying to wake him up,\n          but Ira keeps snoring. George sits down next to the sleeping\n          Ira and watches TV while eating his ice cream.\n\n          EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY\n\n           George and Ira play basketball.

I feel like I'm just\n          going to drop dead. Am I not going\n          to feel bad at all, and then one\n          day wake up dead? It's\n          disconcerting.\n\n          INT.

I would pay you,\n          certainly. I make, you know, about\n          a million dollars to write a\n          script.

And I\n          think people are expecting me to\n          evolve, and it's important to\n          evolve before they make a point of\n          asking me why I'm not evolving.\n\n          IRA\n          It's always good to keep breaking\n          new ground.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Is that something they taught you\n          at the deli.

The head of the studio\n          does a lot of drinking, I don't\n          think he finds that whole area\n          funny.

All comedy comes from\n          immaturity. Buster Keaton, Jerry\n          Lewis, the Marx Brothers, WC\n          Fields, Bill Murray, Steve Martin,\n          Charlie Chaplin. They were all\n          immature. They were all\n          knuckleheads. Who wants to see a\n          smart guy live his life normally?\n          What's funny about that?

You don't know if\n          they like you because you have\n          money or you're famous. Why not\n          take some time and get to know them\n          before ass-raping them.

This may be the\n          first one.\n\n          RACHEL\n          Oh I go out on them all the time.\n          I've been on a bunch of J Dates.\n\n          GEORGE\n          What's J Date?\n\n          RACHEL\n          It's a website where Jewish people\n          find each other.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          78.\n\n          GEORGE\n          So it's just a list of all the\n          Jewish people?

That\n          must be very satisfying.\n\n          RACHEL\n          It is, because, fixing the\n          environment is really about having\n          enough of a war chest to sue local\n          government and corporations so\n          they're forced to observe the\n          environmental statutes that are\n          already on the books.

How are you\n          feeling?\n\n          GEORGE\n          I'm hanging in there.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          82.\n\n          LAURA\n          I thought a lot about you after I\n          left.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Me too.\n\n          LAURA\n          Well the show is going to start in\n          a minute, I better get to my seat.\n          I just wanted to say hi. Don't be\n          too dirty tonight, you know that\n          makes me uncomfortable.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Now I have no jokes. Ira, you have\n          to do an hour and half.\n          She laughs.\n\n          GEORGE (CONT'D)\n          Come by after and give me the\n          review.\n\n          LAURA\n          Okay. Break a leg.\n          She exits.\n\n          IRA\n          You didn't tell her that you're not\n          sick anymore? Why wouldn't you\n          tell her?\n\n          GEORGE\n          I need you to do something for me.\n          After your set I gave you a seat\n          right next to her. During the\n          intermission I want yQ.u to tell her\n          I'm not sick anymore.\n\n          IRA\n          Me? Why do you want me to tell\n          her?\n\n          GEORGE\n          Because it's weird, and emotional.\n          I think she'll handle it better if\n          it comes from somebody else. And\n          then I can talk to her about it\n          afterwards.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          83.\n\n          IRA\n          That's weird.\n\n          GEORGE\n          She'll be happy. It's not weird.\n          You're the bearer of good news.\n\n          IRA\n          You had to do this to me right\n          before my set. Like I'm not\n          nervous enough.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          INT. THEATER\n\n          Ira is performing on stage, doing his set. He's doing really\n          well. This theater crowd is very enthusiastic about being\n          there and gives him the benefit of the doubt on most of his\n          jokes. As he continues his set, he gets more confident and,\n          for the first time in the film, we think he has the potential\n          to be a strong comic.\n\n          INT. THEATER - INTERMISSION\n\n           Laura is sitting in her seat by herself. Ira makes his way\n          across the aisle and sits down next to her.\n\n          LAURA\n          Ira. Oh my gosh. You were so\n          good.\n\n          IRA\n          You seem surprised.\n\n          LAURA\n          I don't know, you seemed so\n          nervous. But you were really solid\n          all the way though, and your ending\n          hunk really murdered.\n\n          IRA\n          Thank you. Hopefully George won't\n          be mad if I tired the audience out.\n\n          LAURA\n          I don't think he has anything to\n          worry about. They always go crazy\n          for him. Before he got famous, he\n          used to bomb all the time.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          84.\n\n          LAURA (CONT'D)\n          And that's when I think he was the\n          funniest. And now that everyone\n          knows him, it's a little too easy\n          for him, I think. No one was\n          funnier when the audience hated him\n          than George. He loved it.\n\n          IRA\n          So you guys were dating right when\n          he started doing well?\n\n          LAURA\n          Yeah. But you always knew he was\n          gonna do well. He had so much\n          charisma. He would walk into a\n          room and in ten minutes that whole\n          room would be about him. Even\n          before anyone knew who he was.\n\n          IRA\n          Where did you meet him?\n\n          LAURA\n          I was the hat-check girl at the\n          Improv. And I was acting. I used\n          to do guest spots on all those\n          shows, like Melrose Place, Beverly\n          Hills 90210. I always played the\n          bitch. I don't know why, but I was\n          on the top of the bitch list.\n\n          IRA\n          You don't seem like a bitch.\n\n          LAURA\n          That's because I was acting.\n\n          IRA\n          Sounds like fun days.\n\n          LAURA\n          It was, for awhile.\n          Reveal George in the wings trying to get a look at them from\n          a distance.\n\n          IRA\n          I don't know if you've heard, but\n          it looks like George's medicine is\n          working.\n\n          LAURA\n          What do you mean?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          85.\n\n          IPA\n          When George got sick they didn't\n          think they had any medicine that\n          would help, so they put him on\n          experimental medicine. And the\n          last time he went to the doctor\n          they couldn't detect his blood\n          disease. They think it might be\n          gone.\n          A moment as Laura takes this in.\n\n          LAURA\n          Why didn't George tell me?\n\n          IRA\n          He just found out. He doesn't want\n          to jinx it. He doesn't want people\n          to get excited, and then have it\n          come back again.\n          The lights go down.\n\n          ANNOUNCER (O.S.)\n          Ladies and Gentlemen. Here's the\n          man you came to see. George\n          Simmons.\n          The place EXPLODES.\n\n          IRA\n\n          (JOKING)\n          I thought everyone came to see me.\n          George begins his act. He could not kill harder. Or look\n          more healthy and charismatic. We can tell it is all a show\n          for Laura. Laura is completely thrown by this turn of\n          events.\n          The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more\n          positive, sympathetic light to Laura. He talks about being\n          sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious,\n          and also uplifting way. All of it is intended to make him\n          look like he has grown up and become wiser, and someone you\n          could trust and spend your life with.\n\n          INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTER THE SHOW\n\n          Laura is talking to George and Ira.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          86.\n\n          LAURA\n          I really don't know what to say.\n          It's not like you weren't good\n          before, but your act is so much\n          more sophisticated, but just as\n          funny. I've never seen you speak\n          so honestly on stage before. You\n          used to say these goofy jokes. It\n          was really something, you know, and\n          you should be really proud of\n          yourself.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Thanks. A lot has happened. And\n          at least I got some good jokes out\n          of it.\n\n          LAURA\n          Well, thanks for inviting me. I'm\n          really glad I came.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Ira and I are driving out of town\n          tomorrow, I thought maybe we could\n          stop by your place on our way out.\n          I want to see what the ranch looks\n          like, and meet your husband.\n\n          LAURA\n          My husband is actually in China for\n          another week, or so. He spends a\n          lot of time there helping American\n          businesses break into that market.\n          So you won't meet him this time,\n          but it would be great if you came\n          by. That would be fun. I'll give\n          you the tour.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Okay. We'll come by in the\n          morning.\n\n          LAURA\n          Okay.\n          An awkward beat. Laura gives Ira a hug goodbye, then hugs\n          George goodbye, trying to make it appear as if they have\n          equal weight.\n\n          LAURA (CONT'D)\n          Bye. I'll see you then.\n          She looks at Ira. As she exits--\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          87.\n\n          LAURA (CONT'D)\n          You were good too.\n\n          IRA\n          Why do we have to stop by there\n          tomorrow? The drive is long enough\n          as it is.\n          George opens up his wallet, gives Ira a thousand dollars.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Here's your money for tonight.\n          Good job.\n\n          IRA\n          I'm excited to see her ranch. I\n          hear it's delightful.\n\n          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Ira and George are in a room that has two queen-sized beds.\n          They each lay on their bed in the dark.\n\n          IRA\n          Why couldn't we have gotten two\n          different rooms?\n\n          GEORGE\n          What's the fun in that? You can go\n          pay for your own room, I don't\n          care.\n\n          IRA\n          So, what happened with you and\n          Laura? You seem to get along so\n          well. Why did you cheat on her?\n\n          GEORGE\n          I was young, stupid... and I liked\n          fucking girls. Why do you think I\n          cheated? You would do it too if\n          anyone would fuck you.\n\n          IRA\n          How many times did you cheat on\n          her?\n\n          GEORGE\n          Two or three times ...a week ...for a\n          couple of years.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          88.\n\n          IRA\n          Jesus.\n\n          GEORGE\n          It was awful. There was even\n          marriage talk. My parents didn't\n          want me to do it because she wasn't\n          Jewish. She was taking classes to\n          convert, even. I mean, how cool is\n          that? She was changing religions\n          to be with me. She knew more about\n          being a Jew than I did from those\n          classes. She was so cute when she\n          spoke Hebrew, it sounded so wrong.\n          George says the Jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent.\n\n          GEORGE (CONT'D)\n          And then one day, somebody told\n          her, I don't know who. And that was\n          that.\n\n          IRA\n          Why do you want to go see her\n          tomorrow? We could do something\n          productive like get some writing\n          done.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I like her. I love her. I miss\n          her. I just want to spend a little\n          time with her. I know nothing will\n          come of it. I just miss being\n          around her.\n          A beat. George starts clicking through Video On--Demand adult\n          movies.\n\n          GEORGE (CONT'D)\n          Anything looking good to you?\n\n          IRA\n          I don't want to watch adult movies\n          with you.\n\n          GEORGE\n          okay. You want to watch Juno?\n\n          IRA\n          Okay.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          89.\n          Juno begins playing.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. LAURA'S RANCH - DAY\n\n          George and Ira drive up to the house. It's a large one-story\n          house that is part of a ranch with a lot of land and a horse\n          stable.\n          They walk to the front door, ring the doorbell. George seems;\n          a little nervous.\n\n          IRA\n          You okay, buddy?\n\n          GEORGE\n          Yeah, of course I am.\n          Laura opens the door.\n\n          LAURA\n          Hi? We've been waiting for you.\n          Come on in.\n\n          INT. LAURA'S RANCH - CONTINUOUS\n\n\n          GEORGE\n          This place is beautiful.\n\n          LAURA\n          Thanks. We've been here for five\n          years. I think I just finished\n          decorating it.\n          She leads them through the living room into a huge open\n          kitchen. On the island, there is freshly squeezed lemonade,\n          chips and dip. She has over-prepared for their arrival.\n\n          IRA\n          Can I live here?\n\n          LAURA\n          of course, you can clean the\n          stables.\n\n          GEORGE\n          You have horses?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          90.\n\n          LAURA\n          Yes. Clarke, my husband, was a\n          real city boy. But for some reason\n          he loves horses. Of course I'm\n          lef t to take care of them. But\n          yes, we have three horses.\n\n          IRA\n          That's crazy, owning a horse. I\n          can't even keep a goldfish alive.\n\n          GEORGE\n          All right, well, we're ready for\n          the big tour. I want to see how\n          you live.\n          Suddenly, Laura's five-year-old daughter INGRID runs into the\n          room and she's pissed.\n\n          INGRID\n          Mom! You said you were coming\n          back! We're playing American Idol,\n          you're ruining the game!\n          Ira is shocked to see that Laura has a child. This\n          complicates a situation he already thought was getting too\n          complicated.\n\n          LAURA\n          I'll come right up. This is my\n          friend, George. And Ira.\n\n          INGRID\n          It's my turn to sing and you're\n          supposed to be the judge and you're\n          not in there and I'm very angry!\n\n          IRA\n          How old are you?\n\n          INGRID\n          Five. But I turn six very soon.\n\n          IRA\n          Really? Because I thought you were\n          like nine, about to turn ten.\n\n          GEORGE\n          She's very pretty.\n          (to Ingrid)\n          I like your hair.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          INGRID\n          I'm so sick of people telling me\n          they like my hair.\n          George is clearly not that good with kids.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Okay. I do not like your hair.\n\n          INGRID\n          Don't make fun of me.\n\n          LAURA\n          He's just joking Ingrid.\n\n          IRA\n          My hair. I have curly hair too.\n          Curly hair is the best.\n\n          INGRID\n          Last week my mom straightened it\n          and it almost went to the floor.\n\n          IRA\n          If you straighten my hair, I look\n          crazy. I look like the killer from\n          No Country for Old Men. Have you\n          seen that movie?\n          MABLE, Laura's ten-year-old daughter storms into the room.\n\n          MABLE\n          You guys left me all alone in the\n          playroom! If you're gonna leave\n          I'm just gonna go talk on the\n          webcam with Caroline.\n\n          LAURA\n          Don't be rude. This is Ira and\n          George.\n\n          MABLE\n          Oh, I know you. My mom watches\n          your movies all the time. But most\n          of them I'm not allowed to see.\n          George smiles at Ira--Laura's a little busted.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Oh, really? Do you like them?\n          Which one's your favorite?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          92.\n\n          MABLE\n          I don't know. I don't really like\n          the ones I'm allowed to see, but I\n          think I would like the ones I'm not\n          allowed to see.

I thought you had\n          a lot of energy, you're clearly\n          gonna make it to the final four,\n          and I love your outfit.

Then she stops the ATV and turns\n          around and kisses George.\n          George looks surprised, but happy. Laura just stares at him,\n          trying to decide what she makes of him now.

This town\n          seemed so perfect when we were\n          looking for a house. There's no\n          traffic, there's one coffee house,\n          one bookstore, one market. No\n          crime. But after you've lived her\n          a few years you hunger for another\n          coffee shop, a bigger bookstore,\n          and a little crime. It gets so\n          boring. And it's such a small\n          town, God forbid you miss one of\n          you kid's soccer games, they put\n          the scarlet letter on you.\n\n          GEORGE\n          it can't be that bad.

I\n          have to get up every morning at\n          six, drive my kids to school and\n          then I have 6 hours before I have\n          to pick them up. I have to yell at\n          them to do their homework, be a\n          taskmaster, then I make them\n          dinner.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          97.\n\n           LAURA (CONT'D)\n           It takes an hour to shower them and\n           put them to bed. And then it's\n          8:30 and I pass out. And it's\n           great, but tuck. And when both\n           kids are done with high school I'll\n          be 49 years old, and then I'll have\n           probably 6 very healthy years, then\n          I'll kind of slow down and then\n          I'll be an old woman. And that was\n          it. And it's great, but fuck.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I couldn't believe you moved out of\n          LA. You were getting some good\n          jobs as an actress. You got to\n          play the bitch on Melrose Place for\n          awhile and make out with Andrew\n          Shue. That was pretty good. Do you\n          miss it?\n\n          LAURA\n          Yes. Being a mom is very\n          fulfilling, but there are other\n          parts of me and every once in\n          awhile I go a little crazy.\n\n          GEORGE\n          How do you go crazy?\n\n          LAURA\n          I just get bored and depressed.\n          And you know how my PMS is kind of\n          out of control. This little boy\n          hit Ingrid in school, and his mom\n          acted like she didn't care at all,\n          so I told her to fuck off.\n          They both laugh.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Oh, that must have gotten ugly.\n          How long did that stay awkward for?\n\n          LAURA\n\n          (JOKING)\n          Always. That woman hates me. And\n          I hate her.

You've got a\n          great family and a great home.\n\n          LAURA\n          I'm so glad you're home, honey.\n          Laura gives Clarke a hug and a peck. Then Ira walks over.\n\n          IRA\n          What's taking so long with the\n          pizza?\n          Before anyone can say anything the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY appears\n          in the doorway.\n\n          PIZZA DELIVERY GUY\n          Hi. That'll be twenty-eight forty-\n          seven, please.\n\n          INT. KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING\n\n          Everyone is seated for dinner, including the kids.\n\n          IRA\n\n          (NERVOUSLY)\n          This is really great pizza. Thank\n          you very much.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          103.\n\n          IRA (CCNT'D)\n          It tastes just like New York pizza,\n          which is so surprising because you\n          can't get good pizza in Los\n          Angeles, so you wouldn't think you\n          could get it in Northern\n          California. But this really tastes\n          like New York pizza.\n          A long pause.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Sounds like your business is going\n          very well.\n\n          CLARKE\n          People never thought China would do\n          this much business with us, you\n          know, but it didn't seem like a\n          risky proposition for me. They've\n          got a billion people, we make all\n          kinds of cool shit in America,\n          they start finding out about it on\n          the internet and what-not. Sooner\n          or later they're gonna find a way\n          to get our shit.\n\n          LAURA\n          He speaks Chinese. For real.\n          Ingrid yells at something in Chinese.\n\n          CLARKE\n          You don't think they want new\n          mobile phones? A new X-box? I'm\n          trying to get access into North\n          Korea, no shit. That situation\n          could chance overnight. That is a\n          huge market waiting to be tapped.\n          It's already starting in Cuba.\n\n          IRA\n          My friend backpacked across China\n          and he caught some sort of virus or\n          something from what he ate. He was\n          sickforweeks. He still has it.\n          It'sthekind of thing you can't\n          getridof, you have it for the\n          restofyour life, but it stays\n          dormant.\n\n          CLARKE\n          So, George. How are you holding\n          up?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          104.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Uh...I'm hanging in there.\n\n          CLARKE\n          How are you feeling?\n\n          LAURA\n          He's doing really well. He's been\n          very strong.\n\n          CLARKE\n          It's a terrible situation. I'm so\n          sorry.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I appreciate that.\n\n          LAURA\n          He's been fighting the good fight.\n          His doctors are taking very good\n          care of him.\n          Ira can believe this conversation is happening.\n\n          CLARKE\n          You're a tougher man than me. I\n          don't know how I could go about my\n          day with that hanging over my head.\n\n          GEORGE\n          It just makes you appreciate every\n          moment. It brings things into\n          focus, you suddenly realize what's\n          important in life.\n\n          LAURA\n          Does anybody want seconds? Or\n          should I bring out the desert?\n\n          IRA\n          I'd love desert. What do you have?\n          Do you have any ice cream or cake,\n          or anything like that? I have a\n          real big sweet tooth right now.\n          Why don't we go into the kitchen\n          and do an ice cream bar with kids\n          right now? I've got a better idea,\n          I make a really good milkshake. We\n          should all go make milkshakes with\n          the kids right now in the kitchen.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          105.\n\n          TNT.

Have\n          you explored Eastern medicine at\n          all?\n\n          LAURA\n          Now's not the time to talk about\n          this.\n\n          CLARKE\n          I'm trying to help the man.\n\n          GEORGE\n          No, I haven't.\n\n          CLARKE\n          Hey. I'm the last guy who would\n          buy into that shit, but it works.\n\n          LAURA\n          He really is the last guy who would\n          buy into that shit.\n\n          CLARKE\n          Our country's only two hundred\n          years old. The Chinese have been\n          around for thousand of years\n          figuring this shit out. How I got\n          into it, I had acid ref lux and\n          nothing was working and then this\n          guy at work turned me onto a\n          Chinese doctor and he gave me some\n          herbs that tasted like dogshit, but\n          they worked.\n\n          LAURA\n\n          (NERVOUSLY)\n          I take herbs for my PMS. They\n          really helped.\n\n          MABLE\n          Daddy, you've been cursing a lot.\n          You owe me a dollar for every\n          curse. I think you owe me fifty\n          dollars.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          106.\n\n          INGRID\n          This conversation is scaring me. I\n          don't want George to die.\n\n          CLARKE\n          You girls can go play in the other\n          room. The Chinese have a completely\n          different way of looking at health.\n          They don't think doctors should\n          attack the diseases in the body,\n          they're all about trying to support\n          the body and make it stronger, so\n          the body can fight off the disease.\n          It works. I've seen it. I wish I\n          could find a way to mass-market\n          Chinese medicine in this country.\n          Someone's gonna do it and make a\n          fuck-load of money. Because these\n          people get old, really old. You\n          can't kill these people.\n\n          IRA\n          Either that or they're all young\n          and they just look like shit.\n          Clarke laughs.\n\n          CLARKE\n          This guy's funny. You should be\n          opening up for this guy. Hey, who\n          wants a drink?\n\n          EXT. RANCH - NIGHT\n\n          Everyone is taking a walk around the ranch. It is very\n          pretty outside.\n\n          CLARKE\n          I'm going to retire in seven years.\n          I'm done. I'm playing golf for the\n          next fifty years. Work hard now,\n          then get out. That's my plan. I'm\n          putting in the time. Then I'm\n          getting the fuck out. I don't like\n          working. I will do it. I like\n          what it gets me. But I don't like\n          it.\n\n          GEORGE\n          You ever see Laura act? She was\n          quite an actress in her day.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          107.\n\n          LAURA\n          George, stop.\n\n          CLARKE\n          That's what I hear. Can't say I\n          watched that much 'Melrose Place'\n          back in the day. She keeps telling\n          me to watch the videos but, you\n          know, I was never a big 'Party of\n          Five' fan.\n\n          LAURA\n          Well, I also ran a theatre company.\n          And it was down to me and Cameron\n          Diaz for 'The Mask.' I sacrificed\n          a lot for our family.\n\n          CLARKE\n          Okay, if you say so.\n          (a beat)\n          The Mask was a funny fucking movie.\n          You know what other movie Cameron\n          Diaz was great in? 'There's\n          Something About Mary.'\n          Laura looks livid at her husband's insensitivity and\n          disrespect. They keep walking.\n\n          CLARKE (CONT'D)\n          I love walking it off after a big\n          meal.\n\n          GEORGE\n          It's beautiful here at night.\n\n          LAURA\n          There's no pollution here like in\n          LA so you can actually see the\n          stars.\n\n          IRA\n          They are beautiful, but we have to\n          get going. We have a really long\n          drive to get back to Los Angeles.\n\n          CLARKE\n          You can't leave now, you won't get\n          back until daylight. You should\n          crash in the guest house. I'm sure\n          it not as fancy pants as where you\n          live, George, but it's better than\n          driving all night or crashing at a\n          hotel.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          108.\n\n          CLARKE (CONT'D)\n          And if you want to hang out\n          tomorrow I just installed six\n          flatscreens, we can watch all the\n          football games we want. And dog-\n          racing from Florida. There's a big\n          game tomorrow. Ira, you must have\n          played some ball in your day.\n\n          IRA\n          No, I'm just big-boned.\n\n          GEORGE\n          We probably should get some rest\n          before the drive. All right, show\n          us to our quarters, sir.\n\n          INT. GUEST BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT\n\n          George sleeps on the bed. Ira sleeps on a couch across the\n          room. The door slowly opens, Laura enters wearing a bathrobe.\n          She walks to the bed and quietly slips under the covers,\n          removing her bathrobe in the process. Without ever speaking,\n          she pulls the covers over both of them and begins to make\n          love to him. George is surprised but not completely shocked\n          and goes along happily with it.\n          ANGLE ON: Ira, he never wakes up.\n\n          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n\n          CLARKE\n          You sure you can't stay?\n\n          IRA\n          We really do need to get back. I\n          have to visit my mom. I can't miss\n          it. It's her birthday. Everyone\n          in my family is coming in from\n          across the country for it. She's\n          turning 65. It's very important we\n          get back for it.\n\n          LAURA\n          That's too bad, I wish you could\n          stay.\n\n          CLARKE\n          (very serious)\n          I wish I could say I was gonna see\n          you again, but I can't say that.\n          His eyes start to mist up.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          109.\n\n          LAURA\n          Clarke, don't. You don't need to\n          do that.\n\n          CLARKE\n          You know what? I think I do need\n          to do that. One thing I learned in\n          China from some Buddhist friends of\n          mine is it's important to have an\n          open heart, to live in the moment,\n          and to speak the truth to each\n          other. So I'd like to say to you,\n          George, that it was a great\n          pleasure to meet someone who had\n          such a big impact on my wife's\n          life. I really like you. And wish\n          we had more time to get to know\n          each other. And I wish you a\n          peaceful end to your journey. And\n          another great journey on the other\n          side of it.\n          Clarke hugs George.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I really don't know what to say. I\n          re- ally don't know what to say.\n\n          LAURA\n          That was beautiful, honey. Well\n          let me walk them to the car.\n          Ingrid walks over.\n\n          INGRID\n          Don't be sad. Ira told us that his\n          medicine is working and he's not\n          sick anymore.\n\n          MABLE\n          I think that was a secret.

He just took some medicine\n          and it's looking better. You can't\n          detect it in his blood, but it\n          could come back.\n\n          CLARKE\n          Is it looking better? Or is he\n          better?\n          (to Ira)\n          Is he sick anymore?\n\n          IRA\n          Well ...I don't how you define these\n          things-I'm not... sure.\n\n          CLARKE\n          is something going on here? Are\n          you getting your revenge on me\n          while I'm away? I came clean with\n          you, you can't come clean with me.\n\n          LAURA\n          You know what?

Was he\n          ever sick in the first place?\n\n          IRA\n          He was sick. He was very sick.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          CLARKE\n          Because if this is what you want,\n          I'll leave right now. I'm not\n          going to play these games. I'm\n          happy to leave. I'm not gonnna\n          have you put me on the cross\n          because I made some mistakes. You\n          guys enjoy each other. I could\n          give a fuck. If you need me, I'll\n          be at my apartment in China.\n          Clarke leaves.\n\n          INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Mable and Ingrid are asleep.\n\n          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Laura is alone in her room, crying.

Did you\n          guys do something?\n\n          GEORGE\n          We had sex in Clarke's office.\n\n          IRA\n          Why?\n\n          GEORGE\n          Because I love her. She's the best\n          thing that's ever happened to me.\n\n          IRA\n          But she has two kids, she's\n          married.\n\n          GEORGE\n          She's miserable.

We took\n          your car here. I have no way of\n          leaving.\n\n          GEORGE\n          This shit is deeper than you\n          understand. People get divorced.\n          People make mistakes and then they\n          fix them. That's how life works.\n          It's not a big deal. I know you're\n          still sad because your parents got\n          divorced. Well get the fuck over\n          it. Call a fucking cab and go\n          home.\n\n          IRA\n          So what are we gonna do?\n\n          GEORGE\n          You're gonna sleep in Clarke's\n          office.

My best friend Nancy grows\n          this stuff on a hill by her house.\n          You want some?\n\n          GEORGE\n          No, that stuff makes me paranoid.\n\n          LAURA\n          Not me. It makes me feel sharper,\n          Some people get tired, I get more\n          energy, more clear.\n\n          GEORGE\n          What's happening?\n\n          LAURA\n          What's happening? Whatever we want\n          to happen is gonna happen now. I'm\n          free.

Really? I mean, this\n          is fun, but I don't know how much I\n          can take. Hopefully they'll take a\n          nap at some point.

RESTAURTANT - DAY\n\n          George, Laura, Ira, and the kids are seated at a table. The\n          kids are coloring with crayons.\n\n          MABLE\n          Look what I did. I want this hung\n          up on the wall.\n          She shows them the picture, which is clearly not appropriate\n          for the wall: a picture of herself choking and dying.\n\n          MABLE (CONT'D)\n          The food here made me sick.\n\n          INGRID\n          Mama, I have to go to the bathroom.\n          Come wipe my butt.\n\n          LAURA\n          I have to talk to them for a\n          minute. Mable, go wipe your\n          sister's butt.\n\n          MABLE\n          She can do it. She's almost six.\n          That's weird.\n          Ingrid and Mable walk off together.\n\n          IRA\n          I wet the bed til I was eleven. It\n          wasn't even a mental thing. I just\n          got relaxed when I was asleep.\n\n          LAURA\n          I spoke to Clarke. He's going to\n          fly back to China tonight. I was\n          thinking about driving to the\n          airport and meeting him there and\n          telling him that when he comes\n          back, he should find another place\n          to live.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          117.\n\n          GEORGE\n          That's great. Are you okay doing\n          that?\n\n          LAURA\n          Yes. It's what I want. I just\n          need to figure out when we would\n          move down to LA. It might be\n          better to let the kids finish out\n          the school year because I have to\n          apply to the private schools in LA,\n          and I don't know if I missed the\n          deadline. Then I'd have to look\n          into the charter schools.\n          Sometimes these private schools, if\n          you give them a donation, they let\n          your kids in. Maybe you can stay\n          up here for part of the year if I\n          can't make it happen.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Sure. If I'm not shooting a movie,\n          or on tour or something, that would\n          be great.\n          Laura leans in and kisses George. George is not big on\n          public displays of affection. He kisses back, but you can\n          tell that he's very uncomfortable.\n          They hear the kids headed back to the table and quickly\n          separate.\n\n          MABLE\n          I made her wipe her own butt.\n\n          INGRID\n          I did it, but I don't know if I did\n          a good job.\n          (to George)\n          Look at what I drew. I drew a\n          picture of you. Look? Show Mama.\n          George holds it up. It is a picture of several people.\n\n          INGRID (CONT'D)\n          That's you. That's George. That's\n          Mommy. And Daddy. And me. And\n          Mable. That's all of us.\n          We see the picture, and it is everybody holding hands.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          118.\n\n          INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY\n\n          George and Ira are walking around a very small bookstore.\n\n          GEORGE\n          This is a small bookstore. They've\n          only got one Philip Roth book.\n          Didn't he write like fifty books?\n\n          IRA\n          So when are we going to go home?\n          You're not talking at all about\n          when we're going to go home.\n\n          GEORGE\n          She's going to talk to Clarke\n          tonight, and then she's going to\n          make a plan. We've got to get over\n          that hurdle.\n\n          IRA\n          Are you okay with everything? This\n          is happening pretty fast.\n\n          GEORGE\n          This is exactly what I wanted.\n\n          IRA\n          Okay.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I mean, she's cool, right?\n\n          IRA\n          She's nice. I don't really know\n          her very well.\n\n          GEORGE\n          She was kind of cooler when I knew\n          her back in the day. She's still\n          hot, but she was crazy hot back\n          then. Her attitude has changed a\n          bit. With the kids and all. Back\n          then she was really sexy, and all\n          about fucking. I know she's busy\n          with her life now, but it is a\n          little different.\n\n          IRA\n          Yeah, well when you have two kids\n          and a husband, and horses and\n          ducks, it's not all about fucking.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          119,\n\n          IRA (CONT'D)\n          That's just the hormones of youth.\n          I'm all about fucking. But I don't\n          expect to be when I get older.\n          I'll be occasionally about fucking,\n          which is normal. The fact that\n          you're all about fucking now is the\n          weird thing.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Well hopefully everything will work\n          out. If it doesn't, it just wasn't\n          meant to be.\n\n          IRA\n          What does that mean?\n\n          GEORGE\n          It means I'm going to give it a\n          shot. I'm excited, but I'm not\n          going to really know if it works\n          until we're in it. I hope I'm just\n          not in love with the person she\n          used to be.\n\n          IRA\n          She's about to leave her husband\n          for good. She has two kids.\n          You're not sure this is going to\n          work?\n\n          GEORGE\n          There's no way to ever be sure that\n          anything's going to work! I\n          couldn't live up here. She wants\n          me to live up here. I don't think\n          I can do it. Maybe a couple of\n          weeks a year.\n\n          IRA\n          Well, she'll live with you.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Do you think she means that she's\n          going to bring the kids too?\n\n          IRA\n          Of course. What else would she do?\n\n          GEORGE\n          I don't know, don't some men get\n          custody of the kids? Or they split\n          the custody? I like the kids, but\n          I've never lived with kids before.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          120.\n\n          GEORGE (CONT'D)\n          The young one's kind of cute, but I\n          don't think I can stand the old one\n          full time. There's too much going\n          on there. But I could definitely\n          tolerate the young one. She's\n          cute.

I'm not a\n          lacky, it's a job.\n\n          GEORGE\n          It's not a job, you're a tacky.\n          You're not even that fucking funny.\n          This gets Ira very mad.\n\n          IRA\n          Who cares? If being funny means\n          being like you, I rather be a\n          little less funny.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Mission accomplished.\n\n          IRA\n          You're the only person I know who\n          learned nothing from a near-death\n          experience! You actually went\n          backwards. All it did was it\n          brought out what a prick you are,\n          brought everything bad to the\n          surface. I liked you better when I\n          was sure you were gonna die.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          134.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I'm not going anywhere!\n\n          IRA\n          Everything is about you. You don't\n          even know where I live. You've\n          never asked me one question about\n          my life. How much can one person\n          talk about himself ? You never ask\n          me shit about anything!\n\n          GEORGE\n          Who are you to fucking judge\n          anyone? You're not my friend, you\n          just want my money. You just want\n          to get your foot in the door.\n\n          IRA\n          Fuck your money. Fuck you. This\n          has all been a huge mistake.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Wake me when we get home.\n          George climbs in the back seat and tries to go to bed.\n\n          INT./EXT. GEORGE'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n          Music up: Ted Hawkins' song \"Strange Conversation.\"\n          Ira drives George home in the dark. Neither one speaks.\n          We see images of different cities going by the window. Ira\n          thinks about all he's been through and the challenges ahead,\n\n          EXT. GUYS' APARTMENT\n\n          Ira pulls up to his apartment.\n\n          IRA\n          okay, I'm getting out. You have to\n          drive yourself home. I'm getting\n          out here.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Why didn't you drive me to my\n          house?\n\n          IRA\n          Because then I'd still have your\n          car.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          135.\n\n          GEORGE\n          You'll drop it off later.\n\n          IRA\n          There is no later! I'm not going\n          to ever talk to you again. So I\n          don't want your car.\n\n          GEORGE\n          So that's how it's going to be.\n\n          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE\n\n          George enters. There is an enormous pile of stuff to do on\n          his dining room table. Several stacks of scripts. One pile\n          has a big post-it note that says: \"READ THESE!\"\n\n          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE\n\n          George lies alone in bed, alone. Eyes wide open. It's\n          really bright in his room.\n          George hits a button. The shades automatically close. The\n          room goes dark.\n          Now he's in the dark with his eyes open. He turns on the TV\n          to go to sleep. It's the Today show. It's really happy and\n          morning-themed. The piece on the Today show is very suburban.\n          \"How to Clean Up Clutter.\"\n\n          ANCHORWOMAN (ON TV)\n          You know, when you've got a big\n          family, and you've got a lot of\n          clutter...\n\n          INT. GUYS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n          Ira is talking to Leo.\n\n          LEO\n          We rented out your room to Jay.\n          But you can crash on the couch if\n          you want.\n\n          IRA\n          Oh man, you got jerked off on that\n          couch.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          136.\n\n          JONAH\n          I fucking didn't cum on the couch.\n          Just sleep on it for a month, and\n          then we'll find some excuse to boot\n          Jay out.\n\n          IRA\n          Thanks. I'm sorry, I lost my way\n          for a while.\n\n          INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE\n\n          George reads one from a large pack of scripts. A few pages\n          in, he clearly doesn't like it. He puts it down, picks up\n          another one.\n          The large stack is clearly the ones he doesn't like.\n\n          INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n\n          Ira writes at a table.\n\n          EXT. STORE - DAY\n\n          George walks out of a store. A beautiful woman tries to chat\n          him up, but he lets her know he i.s\"busy and has to go. He\n          walks off. She looks disappointed.\n\n          INT. BAR - NIGHT\n\n          Ira talks to Daisy. They seem to be getting along well.\n\n          INT. IMPROVISATION - DAY\n\n          Daisy is performing on stage. She gets off and heads over to\n          Ira.\n\n          I HA\n          That was great.\n          She kisses him.\n\n          DAISY\n          Thanks.\n          The MANAGER walks over.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          13,.\n\n          MANAGER\n          Hey Ira, Federman got in a car\n          accident. Do you want to take his\n          spot?\n          George walks over with a young comedian of about Ira's age.\n          This young man has clearly taken his place.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Hey, how's it going?\n\n          IRA\n          Hey George.\n\n          GEORGE\n          This is Randy. He's funny, you'd\n          like his stuff. It's smart.\n\n          IRA\n          I'm sure I would. I look forward\n          to seeing it. Are you going on\n          tonight?\n\n          RANDY\n          I hope so.\n\n          MANAGER\n          (to George)\n          Do you want to go up? Ira was\n          gonna take Federman's spot, but we\n          can get you up if you want to?\n\n          GEORGE\n          No, that's ok. I don't want to\n          take Ira's spot. I'm just gonna\n          hang out tonight.\n\n          INT. IMPROVISATION - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          Ira is introduced. He walks onto the stage. We see George\n          walk to the very back corner of the club and sit down at a\n          table by himself.\n          On stage Ira does his act. He is much more comfortable than\n          we have ever seen him on stage before. He is no longer\n          searching for his comic identity. He has found a way to be\n          himself on stage, and tells jokes which are more personal\n          than we have seen before.\n          Not everything kills, but when something eats it he does not\n          seem thrown. Sometimes he seems amused.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          138.\n\n          ANGLE ON GEORGE\n          He watches from the back of the room. At first he does not\n          laugh, but then slowly starts laughing--but more at the\n          things Ira does in between jokes. We can tell that he is\n          proud of Ira and misses him.\n\n          INT. SUPERMARKET -- DAY\n\n          Ira is back behind the counter, working at the Deli with\n          Chuck and Gail. He doesn't look too unhappy to be there.\n\n          FEMALE CUSTOMER\n          Is the potato salad fresh?\n\n          IRA\n          I made it myself this morning.\n\n          FEMALE CUSTOMER\n          Is it good?\n\n          IRA\n          I stake my reputation on it.\n\n          FEMALE CUSTOMER\n          Okay. Give me a quart.\n\n          IRA\n          Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would\n          like a quarf'of potato salad.\n          The woman moves to the other side of the counter. We reveal\n          George standing there, holding his ticket.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Do you have any turkey that's\n          hormone-free?\n\n          IRA\n          Yes we do.\n\n          GEORGE\n          So this is where you work.\n\n          IRA\n          Back in the saddle.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I thought we were writing a\n          screenplay.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          139.\n\n          IRA\n          Well, you're not a very good\n          writing partner.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Or any kind of partner. You want\n          to make me a turkey sandwich and\n          talk to me? They give you breaks\n          around here?\n\n          INT. SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          There is a small seating area in the supermarket where people\n          eat food at the deli counter. George and Ira sit across from\n          each other.\n\n          GEORGE\n          In my travels, I have learned a lot\n          about Asia and Buddhism. And I\n          would like to be in the moment now\n          with you, and to tell you how sorry\n          I am, and how much I have\n          appreciated your friendship. And\n          even if we are not friends in the\n          future, I wish you well on your\n          journey.\n          Ira laughs.\n\n          IRA\n          That guy was a douche-bag.\n\n          GEORGE\n          But also kind of cool. It's a very\n          weird combination.\n\n          IRA\n          He was going to heal you with those\n          herbs, man. You get sick again,\n          you should call that guy.\n\n          GEORGE\n          I think most of what you said to me\n          was true. And I really am sorry.\n          I think I'm still not very\n          healthy...in my brain.\n\n          IRA\n          It's all right, man. You've been\n          through a lot.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          14 0 .\n\n          GEORGE\n          Well, I appreciate you trying to\n          help me. Even though it was kind\n          of an impossible task.\n\n          IRA\n          Is everything going okay? How are\n          you doing?\n\n          GEORGE\n          I am not doing well, but things\n          have certainly been worse. So, I\n          will be fine.\n\n          (THEN)\n          You were good the other night. I\n          hear you're getting regular spots\n          now.\n\n          IRA\n          I'm actually going up tonight.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Really? Any new jokes you're\n          working on?\n\n          IRA\n          Yeah, I've been trying to get off\n          my ass and do some writing.\n\n          GEORGE\n          What do you got?\n          Ira is surprised to hear him ask this, since he has never\n          asked this before.\n\n          IRA\n          I was thinking about doing a bit\n          about how I'm not very good\n          looking, but I'm not bad looking,\n          but I'm just good-looking enough\n          that if I had a good personality,\n          it might put me over the top.\n\n          GEORGE\n          You should do something about how,\n          when you date a girl, and you feel\n          really good and she likes you, and\n          then you see pictures of all her ex-\n          boyfriends, and they're all really\n          goofy-looking guys, and it's not\n          that you're good looking, it's just\n          that in this psychotic girl's eyes,\n          you're good looking?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          141,\n\n          IRA\n          And how all of her boyfriends look\n          like Lou Costello.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Why don't you say Dom Deluise?\n          it's a more current reference.\n\n          IRA\n          More current? What year was\n          Cannonball Run, 1978?\n\n          GEORGE\n          Okay, okay. What else you got?\n\n          IRA\n          I was going to talk about how I\n          haven't had sex in so long, that I\n          can't even remember my previous\n          sexual experiences so I can\n          masturbate to them.\n\n          GEORGE\n          You should say, now when I\n          masturbate, I have to think about\n          the last time I masturbated.\n\n          IRA\n          That's a good one. You can write.\n\n          GEORGE\n          You know, I always wanted to be\n          part of the comedy field.\n          As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira jokes\n          for his act, the first selfless act we've seen him commit in\n          the entire film. As their friendship rekindles, we...\n\n\n\n\n                                  THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunny People\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Judd Apatow\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:38.444130"}
