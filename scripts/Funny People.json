It is very nice, but doesn't seem personal to him\n          at all. It feels new, with all the gadgets, but a little\n          cold.

I spent my whole\n          childhood trying to make my dad\n          laugh so he wouldn't smack me. But\n          he was an awesome guy. He was the\n          coolest. He just got annoyed with\n          me. Do you like your parents?\n          They can't be that bad, because\n          you're not that funny.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          They're bananas.

They always put me in the\n          middle of it. I always wanted them\n          to say, \"We don't want you to\n          suffer through this, so we're just\n          going to handle it ourselves.\"\n          They never would do it. They would\n          always make me feel their pain all\n          the time. I would never do that\n          for my kids. Because it's like\n          they._`.re kids. And no matter how\n          many times I tell them to leave me\n          out of it, they never do.\n          Ira notices that George is very close to falling asleep.\n\n<b>          IRA (CONT'D)\n</b>          I'll let you crash.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          27.\n</b>\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          No, keep going.

That\n          must be very satisfying.\n\n<b>          RACHEL\n</b>          It is, because, fixing the\n          environment is really about having\n          enough of a war chest to sue local\n          government and corporations so\n          they're forced to observe the\n          environmental statutes that are\n          already on the books.

This theater crowd is very enthusiastic about being\n          there and gives him the benefit of the doubt on most of his\n          jokes. As he continues his set, he gets more confident and,\n          for the first time in the film, we think he has the potential\n          to be a strong comic.\n\n<b>          INT.

Hopefully George won't\n          be mad if I tired the audience out.\n\n<b>          LAURA\n</b>          I don't think he has anything to\n          worry about. They always go crazy\n          for him. Before he got famous, he\n          used to bomb all the time.\n\n<b>          (MORE)\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          84.\n</b>\n<b>          LAURA (CONT'D)\n</b>          And that's when I think he was the\n          funniest. And now that everyone\n          knows him, it's a little too easy\n          for him, I think. No one was\n          funnier when the audience hated him\n          than George. He loved it.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          So you guys were dating right when\n          he started doing well?\n\n<b>          LAURA\n</b>          Yeah. But you always knew he was\n          gonna do well. He had so much\n          charisma. He would walk into a\n          room and in ten minutes that whole\n          room would be about him.

And the\n          last time he went to the doctor\n          they couldn't detect his blood\n          disease.

He could not kill harder. Or look\n          more healthy and charismatic. We can tell it is all a show\n          for Laura. Laura is completely thrown by this turn of\n          events.\n          The content of George's act is meant to portray him in a more\n          positive, sympathetic light to Laura. He talks about being\n          sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark, hilarious,\n          and also uplifting way. All of it is intended to make him\n          look like he has grown up and become wiser, and someone you\n          could trust and spend your life with.\n\n<b>          INT.

I've never seen you speak\n          so honestly on stage before. You\n          used to say these goofy jokes.

It might be\n          better to let the kids finish out\n          the school year because I have to\n          apply to the private schools in LA,\n          and I don't know if I missed the\n          deadline. Then I'd have to look\n          into the charter schools.\n          Sometimes these private schools, if\n          you give them a donation, they let\n          your kids in.

Ira was\n          gonna take Federman's spot, but we\n          can get you up if you want to?\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          No, that's ok. I don't want to\n          take Ira's spot. I'm just gonna\n          hang out tonight.\n\n<b>          INT. IMPROVISATION - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\n          Ira is introduced. He walks onto the stage. We see George\n          walk to the very back corner of the club and sit down at a\n          table by himself.\n          On stage Ira does his act. He is much more comfortable than\n          we have ever seen him on stage before. He is no longer\n          searching for his comic identity. He has found a way to be\n          himself on stage, and tells jokes which are more personal\n          than we have seen before.\n          Not everything kills, but when something eats it he does not\n          seem thrown. Sometimes he seems amused.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          138.\n</b>\n<b>          ANGLE ON GEORGE\n</b>          He watches from the back of the room. At first he does not\n          laugh, but then slowly starts laughing--but more at the\n          things Ira does in between jokes. We can tell that he is\n          proud of Ira and misses him.\n\n<b>          INT. SUPERMARKET -- DAY\n</b>\n          Ira is back behind the counter, working at the Deli with\n          Chuck and Gail. He doesn't look too unhappy to be there.\n\n<b>          FEMALE CUSTOMER\n</b>          Is the potato salad fresh?\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          I made it myself this morning.\n\n<b>          FEMALE CUSTOMER\n</b>          Is it good?\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          I stake my reputation on it.\n\n<b>          FEMALE CUSTOMER\n</b>          Okay. Give me a quart.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          Mrs. Gail, this fine woman would\n          like a quarf'of potato salad.\n          The woman moves to the other side of the counter. We reveal\n          George standing there, holding his ticket.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          Do you have any turkey that's\n          hormone-free?\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          Yes we do.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          So this is where you work.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          Back in the saddle.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          I thought we were writing a\n          screenplay.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          139.\n</b>\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          Well, you're not a very good\n          writing partner.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          Or any kind of partner. You want\n          to make me a turkey sandwich and\n          talk to me? They give you breaks\n          around here?\n\n<b>          INT. SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\n          There is a small seating area in the supermarket where people\n          eat food at the deli counter. George and Ira sit across from\n          each other.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          In my travels, I have learned a lot\n          about Asia and Buddhism. And I\n          would like to be in the moment now\n          with you, and to tell you how sorry\n          I am, and how much I have\n          appreciated your friendship. And\n          even if we are not friends in the\n          future, I wish you well on your\n          journey.\n          Ira laughs.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          That guy was a douche-bag.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          But also kind of cool. It's a very\n          weird combination.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          He was going to heal you with those\n          herbs, man. You get sick again,\n          you should call that guy.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          I think most of what you said to me\n          was true. And I really am sorry.\n          I think I'm still not very\n          healthy...in my brain.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          It's all right, man. You've been\n          through a lot.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          14 0 .\n</b>\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          Well, I appreciate you trying to\n          help me. Even though it was kind\n          of an impossible task.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          Is everything going okay? How are\n          you doing?\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          I am not doing well, but things\n          have certainly been worse. So, I\n          will be fine.\n\n<b>          (THEN)\n</b>          You were good the other night. I\n          hear you're getting regular spots\n          now.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          I'm actually going up tonight.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          Really? Any new jokes you're\n          working on?\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          Yeah, I've been trying to get off\n          my ass and do some writing.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          What do you got?\n          Ira is surprised to hear him ask this, since he has never\n          asked this before.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          I was thinking about doing a bit\n          about how I'm not very good\n          looking, but I'm not bad looking,\n          but I'm just good-looking enough\n          that if I had a good personality,\n          it might put me over the top.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          You should do something about how,\n          when you date a girl, and you feel\n          really good and she likes you, and\n          then you see pictures of all her ex-\n          boyfriends, and they're all really\n          goofy-looking guys, and it's not\n          that you're good looking, it's just\n          that in this psychotic girl's eyes,\n          you're good looking?\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          141,\n</b>\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          And how all of her boyfriends look\n          like Lou Costello.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          Why don't you say Dom Deluise?\n          it's a more current reference.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          More current? What year was\n          Cannonball Run, 1978?\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          Okay, okay. What else you got?\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          I was going to talk about how I\n          haven't had sex in so long, that I\n          can't even remember my previous\n          sexual experiences so I can\n          masturbate to them.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          You should say, now when I\n          masturbate, I have to think about\n          the last time I masturbated.\n\n<b>          IRA\n</b>          That's a good one. You can write.\n\n<b>          GEORGE\n</b>          You know, I always wanted to be\n          part of the comedy field.\n          As the camera pulls back, George continues to pitch Ira jokes\n          for his act, the first selfless act we've seen him commit in\n          the entire film. As their friendship rekindles, we...\n\n\n\n\n<b>                                  THE END\n</b>\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Funny-People.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Funny People</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Judd Apatow\" title=\"Scripts by Judd Apatow\">Judd Apatow</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Funny People Script.html#comments\" title=\"Funny People comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:05:56.674445"}
