He will have been born\n               of a Bene Gesserit mother.\n--\n     The Reverend Mother continues speaking of the\n     Prophecy, but we do not hear it.

THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT\n\n     The EMPEROR is surrounded by crowds of COURTIERS in\n     his Throne Room.\n\n     Suddenly a GUARD enters from a small door and\n     quickly crosses to ANOTHER GUARD. A warning SOUND\n     begins. The Emperor turns nervously. Guards quickly\n     begin to clear the large room. Several women are\n     rushed toward us to a door beyond. One of the woman,\n     IRULAN, stops and turns back for a worried, caring\n     look to her father, the Emperor.\n\n                         IRULAN\n               Father.\n--\n                         EMPEROR\n               Irulan.\n\n     She sees that SARDAUKAR OFFICERS are surrounding him\n     now, speaking to him.

He stands in his elegant black\n     uniform, thinking.\n\n     The Reverend Mother is ushered in and the Sardaukar\n     Officers leave her alone with the Emperor.\n\n                         EMPEROR\n                    (quickly)\n               A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here\n               within minutes!\n\n                     REVEREND MOTHER\n               We felt his presence.\n\n                         EMPEROR\n               I shall want telepathy during his visit\n               and a report when we're finished.\n\n                     REVEREND MOTHER\n               Their minds are so....

One of the Guildsmen addresses the\n     Emperor through a translating device.\n\n                   TANKED GUILDSMEN #1\n               The Bene Gesserit witch must leave.\n--\n     The Emperor looks to the Reverend Mother.\n\n                         EMPEROR\n               Leave us.\n\n                     REVEREND MOTHER\n               Yes, my Lord.\n\n                         EMPEROR\n                    (after she has gone)\n               We are alone...\n\n8.   INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT\n\n     The Reverend Mother enters through doors and takes a\n     seat on a chair just outside the door. She closes\n     her eyes.\n\n9.   INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT\n\n     Inside the Emperor's chamber, the TANK-SUITED\n     GUILDSMEN are arranging themselves in a \"V\"\n     formation around the box. Suddenly the box opens,\n     slowly and beautifully revealing a huge, thick glass\n     tank. Inside the tank floats a THIRD STAGE NAVIGATOR\n     twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty,\n     pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper.\n\n     The tank is filled with swirling orange spice-gas,\n     and Guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic\n     chemical spills dripping from under the tank.\n     Suddenly the Guild Navigator swims towards the\n     Emperor. His head is enormous and fleshy, like a\n     huge grasshopper head -- the eyes are totally deep\n     blue. His voice is a high, fleshy whispering and an\n     intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the\n     tank translates into English and broadcasts it into\n     the room.\n\n                        NAVIGATOR\n               We have just folded space from Ix...\n\n                         EMPEROR\n                    (extremely nervous)\n               Yes?...

INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT\n\n     Outside the Emperor's chamber the Reverend Mother\n     sits, her eyes closed, straining.\n\n11.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND\nMOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT\n\n     A very blurred scene of the Emperor with the Guild\n     Navigator. She is not getting the English version\n     but a much different language version which is\n     fascinating to listen to. A lilting, sing-song\n     monologue.\n\n12.  INT.

I\n               have ordered House Atreides to occupy\n               Arrakis to mine the spice... thus\n               replacing their enemies the Harkonnens....\n               House Atreides will not refuse because of\n               the tremendous power they think they will\n               gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron\n               Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and\n               launch a sneak attack on House Atreides...\n               I have promised the Baron five legions of\n               my Sardaukar terror troops.\n\n                        NAVIGATOR\n               So the Harkonnens will rid you of House\n               Atreides...\n\n                         EMPEROR\n               Yes.\n\n13.  INT. HALLWAY - EMPEROR'S PALACE - NIGHT\n\n     Outside, the Reverend Mother is seeing the scene\n     mentally. She suddenly sees and flinches.\n\n14.  INT. THRONE ROOM - EMPEROR'S PALACE - REVEREND\nMOTHER'S MENTAL IMAGE - NIGHT\n\n     The Guild Navigator turns toward her and comes very\n     close to her.

The spice must flow... the\n               spice has given me accelerated evolution\n               for four thousand years... it has enabled\n               you to live two hundred years... the spice\n               helps make the sapho juice, which gives\n               the red-lipped mentats the ability to be\n               living computers... the secret side of\n               spice... the water of life.\n\n16.

Paul falls back. The shield edges CRACK\n     loudly as they touch each other.\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (inner voice)\n               What's gotten into Gurney? He's not\n               faking.\n     Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly\n     around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger\n     as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul\n     directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney\n     against the table, plunging at just the right moment\n     to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade\n     right at Gurney's neck.\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (strange shielded voice)\n               Is this what you seek?\n\n                         GURNEY\n                    (strange shielded voice)\n               Good... the slow blade penetrates the\n               shield... but look down.\n\n     Paul looks and sees Gurney's blade at his groin.\n\n                     GURNEY (CONT'D)\n               We'd have joined each other in death.\n               However, you did seem to finally get the\n               \"mood\".\n\n                          PAUL\n               Would you really have drawn my blood?\n\n                         GURNEY\n               If you'd fought one whit below your\n               abilities I'd have scratched you a good\n               one.\n\n     Paul stands and snaps off his shield as does Gurney.\n\n25.  BACK TO SCENE\n\n                          PAUL\n               Things have been so serious here lately.\n\n                         GURNEY\n               Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but\n               this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we\n               leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The\n               Harkonnens are real.\n\n     Thufir, Yueh, Gurney and Paul stare at each other\n     for a moment in silence. Dr. Yueh moves forward and\n     begins to take Paul's pulse rate and to collect\n     other data with a small black machine.\n\n                          PAUL\n               Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on\n               the worms of Arrakis?\n--\n                        DR. YUEH\n               I have obtained a filmbook on a small\n               specimen... only 125 meters long.\n\n                          PAUL\n               Only?!\n\n     They smile at each other.\n\n                        DR. YUEH\n               There are have been documented sightings\n               of worms as large as 450 meters in the\n               deep desert -- far from where we'll be in\n               Arakeen.... The desert belt and the south\n               polar regions are marked forbidden....\n               Why?\n\n                          PAUL\n               The storms and the worms. Is it true, that\n               the sand can blow at seven hundred\n               kilometers per hour?\n\n                          YUEH\n               It can render flesh to dust in minutes.\n               And these dry winds can generate\n               tremendous static electricity in the\n               atmosphere. Our body shields won't have\n               enough power to operate in the open air on\n               Arrakis.\n\n                          PAUL\n               Well, how do the Fremen survive there?\n\n                          YUEH\n               We don't know much about the Fremen...\n               They live in the deep desert... some of\n               them in the cities and they have blue-\n               within-blue eyes...\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (smiling)\n               The eyes -- yes, yes... saturation of the\n               blood by the spice -- melange. Could the\n               spice affect us in other ways?\n\n                         THUFIR\n               Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we\n               know the Harkonnens would not have given\n               up their CHOAM company contract so easily.\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (rising)\n               The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but\n               behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.\n--\n                         THUFIR\n               You will make a formidable Duke!\n\n     Paul bows.\n\n                     THUFIR (CONT'D)\n               Now remember... the first step in avoiding\n               a trap is knowing of its existence.\n\n                          PAUL\n               I know.  But if it is a trap then why are\n               we going?\n\n                         THUFIR\n               We have our new army.\n                    (in the same breath)\n               Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.\n\n     Thufir, noticing a SQUAD OF GUARDS at the other end\n     of the training room, calls out to them.\n\n                     THUFIR (CONT'D)\n               Clear and lock the room.\n\n     Gurney activates a series of locks.  LIGHTS GLOWS\n     above each doorway.\n\n                     THUFIR (CONT'D)\n               Activate a fighter.\n\n25C. ROBOT FIGHT\n\n     Suddenly a FIGHTER ROBOT lowers from the ceiling.\n     As the robot begins to rotate and go through several\n     frightening, complicated movements, Dr. Yueh places\n     a plastic device around Paul's neck.  He tightens it\n     around the Adam's apple above Paul's voice box.\n     Paul turns and emits a very strange, powerful sound\n     through the weirding module as he rushes towards the\n     robot.\n\n                         GURNEY\n                    (to Yueh)\n               Precise control....\n\n26.

HALLWAY - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT\n\n     Paul walks down the stairway.  In the distance,\n     moving troops are packing Atreides belongings.\n     Beyond, Paul sees some troops carrying a large\n     bull's head.  The horns are covered with dried\n     blood.\n\n                          PAUL\n               The bull that killed my grandfather... is\n               this an evil omen?\n\n     Suddenly, DUNCAN IDAHO appears from behind the giant\n     black head.\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (happily)\n               Duncan!\n\n                         DUNCAN\n               Paul.\n                    (they shake hands)\n               I was on my way to say goodbye to you.

I wish you were coming with us.\n\n                         DUNCAN\n               It's something for your father.  He wants\n               to talk to you.\n                    (places hand on Paul's chest)\n               I'll see you in Arrakis.

CLIFF WALL - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT\n\n     Paul walks to meet his father near the wall.\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (diffident)\n               Father.\n\n                        DUKE LETO\n               Thank you for joining me, Paul.\n                    (voice tired)\n               It will be good to get to our new home and\n               have all this upset behind us.\n--\n28A. (Deleted)\n\n28B. DUKE LETO AND PAUL AGAINST SEA\n\n     They look out over the sea.  A huge wave crashes\n     below.\n\n     The Duke turns to Paul.\n\n                   DUKE LETO (CONT'D)\n                    (inner voice)\n               My son.\n                    (out loud)\n               Thufir Hawat has served House Atreides\n               three generations....

The WIND blows the\n     Duke's hair and behind him stands the castle and the\n     green and black Atreides banner against the night\n     sky beyond.  The RAIN starts again -- lightly.  Paul\n     takes a closer look at the Atreides banner moving in\n     the wind.\n\n                        DUKE LETO\n                    (studying the dark sea below)\n               I'll miss the sea... but a person needs\n               new experiences... they jar something deep\n               inside, allowing him to grow.  Without\n               change, something sleeps inside us... and\n               seldom awakens... The sleeper must awaken.\n\n     Paul's attention goes to his father's hand where he\n     sees the Duke's signet ring.  Again he smiles at his\n     father.\n\n                                                FADE TO:\n\n29. through 29A.    (Deleted)\n\n30.  INT.

COURTYARD - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT\n\n     In a small stone courtyard, the back-lit figure of a\n     woman moves towards us through the heavy RAIN and\n     darkness. As she nears us, the large, protective\n     glowglobe overtakes her and in an instant we see a\n     beautiful woman -- JESSICA.\n\n                         JESSICA\n                    (inner voice)\n               I  know she has come to test him... no man\n               has ever been tested with the box... only\n               Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my son.\n\n     The doors open, she meets the Reverend Mother Gaius\n     Helen Mohiam (the Emperor's truthsayer) and takes\n     her back toward the Castle. The rain rushes loudly\n     into the storm drains.\n--\n34.  INT.

As the door opens he closes his eyes,\n     however, and he pretends to be asleep. Jessica and\n     the Reverend Mother enter and stand in the doorway\n     looking at him.\n\n                     REVEREND MOTHER\n               We'll salvage what we can... but I can\n               tell you.. dear God... for the father...\n               nothing.\n\n     Jessica turns to the Reverend Mother, stunned!

Desires don't figure in this! An\n               Atreides daughter could have been wed to a\n               Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. We\n               may lose both blood lines now.\n\n                         JESSICA\n               I vowed never to regret my decision.

DUKE LETO'S QUARTERS - CASTLE CALADAN - NIGHT\n\n     Under a dim glowglobe, the DUKE is writing a note on\n     a scroll-like piece of paper.\n\n     Finishing reading, the Duke seals the message in a\n     cylinder and presses his signet ring, with a red\n     hawk symbol of House of Atreides, into a hole, which\n     seals the cylinder with a swift HISSING.\n\n     He pauses, studying the metal tube. With a VOICE\n     COMMAND, he extinguishes the glowglobe above him. He\n     leans back in his chair as lightning flashes outside\n     the window.\n\n     FADE TO:\n\n35.  BACK TO SCENE\n\n     Paul enters the room and Jessica closes the door\n     behind them.\n\n                         JESSICA\n               Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius\n               Helen Mohiam.

The Reverend Mother speaks\n     to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training\n     which permits an adept to control others merely by\n     selected tone shadings of the voice.

The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and\n     sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some\n     time.

The\n     squood makes a tiny SCREAM, then Rabban drinks the\n     blood and bodily fluids.  He throws the empty\n     container of tiny animal meat into the dark water\n     trough running through the center of the room.\n     Across the room, TWO HARKONNEN SOLDIERS enter,\n     holding big guns on a BOY who is wearing white\n     pants.  The Baron smiles when he sees the boy, who\n     is deeply afraid.  The guards force the boy to\n     arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall\n     opposite the Baron.\n\n                          BARON\n                    (as the Baron watches the boy)\n               You're so beautiful my Baron\n               Your skin, love to me\n               Your diseases lovingly cared for\n               For all eternity.\n\n                          BARON\n               I will have Arrakis back for myself... he\n               who controls the Spice, controls the\n               universe... and what Piter didn't tell you\n               is we have control of someone who is very\n               close to Duke Leto.

Suddenly the\n     Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet\n     in the air.  It is a frightening sight.  He floats\n     down under the giant, humming electrical tube light\n     and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which\n     drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink\n     glow.  Feyd and Rabban watch nervously.  The\n     Attendants stand completely still with fear.\n\n     The Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands\n     petrified.  The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as\n     they step slightly backwards.  The boy begins\n     SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug,\n     located in his chest.  The violet flowers are bumped\n     and disarrayed by the violence which ensues.  Then\n     the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS\n     continue to roar.\n\n52A. through 52B.

On\n     the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and\n     filtering system. Tons of spice gas are being\n     converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of\n     machinery. From within a dark metal tunnel comes a\n     Guild Navigator. He exits the tunnel and swims\n     through the gas 1,000 feet to a six-dimensional\n     layered miniature replica of the entire Universe.\n     The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his\n     mouth which travels to one edge of the Universe and\n     changes into a likeness of the planet Caladan. The\n     Navigator turns and emits another piece of light\n     which travels to the opposite side of the Universe.\n     It changes into a likeness of Arrakis. The Navigator\n     begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the\n     stars and he emits SOUNDS and bursts of light into\n     the mass of stars and galaxies. The Universe begins\n     to vibrate and elongate, then to curve. Electrical\n     lightening traverses from Caladan to Arrakis as the\n     Universe bends into a U-shape. Arrakis submerges\n     deep into the light. The navigator swims to the\n     point where Arrakis disappeared. He begins to pull\n     and tear a hole in the Universe. Stars like sparks\n     and SOUNDS and rings of light appear, along with a\n     roaring WIND. The Navigator swims deep into this\n     hole through the rings of light. The Navigator\n     becomes more and more transparent, until he's lost\n     in darkness. The sounds fade.\n--\n58. through 60.     (Deleted)\n\n60A. EXT.

MOUSE MOON - NIGHT\n\n     The moon continues to spew out pieces of moving\n     images which are seen then disappear as fast as\n     sparks.  The broken, burning pieces float eerily\n     toward us over the undulating dunes below.  One\n     image floats closer.  It is a hand folded into a\n     fist.\n\n                       PAUL (V.O.)\n               I am only a seed...\n\n     The fist begins to open.\n\n                    DUKE LETO (V.O.)\n               The seed must grow.\n\n     The hand opens fully with slow blue fluid pulsating\n     out the very center of the palm.  The hand floats\n     eerily forward.\n\n                    DUKE LETO (V.O.)\n               The sleeper must awaken.\n\n139H.     EXT. WATER - NIGHT\n\n     The last image which passes is foaming and spitting\n     dark blue water.  As the image passes, the black\n     smoke trailing behind it obscures the picture to\n     blackness.\n\n140. EXT. ROCK - DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     Through the darkness we move to Paul's clenched\n     hand.  It opens, revealing the signet ring in the\n     very center of his palm.  Paul looks upward to the\n     moons of Arrakis.  He looks back to the ring, then\n     to his mother.\n\n                          PAUL\n               Listen to me!... you wanted to know about\n               my dreams... and I've just had a waking\n               dream... do you know why?...\n--\n                         JESSICA\n               Calm yourself/\n\n                          PAUL\n               The spice!

Rabban\n     tears out the cow's tongue and eats it.  Then he\n     exits through a door which closes behind him.\n\n147. INT. BARON'S QUARTERS - HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT\n\n     The Baron is flying wildly, circling the outside of\n     a large steel shower, while Nefud and a DWARF play a\n     strange instrument producing maniacal, perverse,\n     screaming MUSIC.  The Baron SEES Rabban enter, but\n     continues to fly around the shower.\n\n                          BARON\n                    (very excited)\n               Rabban!!... we're knee deep in Atreides\n               blood!

EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT\n\n     Another burst of LIGHTNING.  The distant rock seems\n     to have grown no larger.  Their muscles begin to\n     ache.

DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT (LATER)\n\n     Their breathing becomes very labored.  The sand\n     moves like slow water, forever rolling down and up.\n     Then they hear the worm, the low thundering HISS\n     shaking the tonnage of sand.  The thumper stops.\n     Paul turns.\n\n                          PAUL\n               Faster!!\n--\n                         JESSICA\n                    (screaming)\n               It's deafening!\n\n     Their bodies ache and they feel like dropping, yet\n     the cliff is still a good distance away.  The worm\n     SOUND grows louder and Paul turns to look.\n\n153. EXT. WORM - DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     A flash of LIGHTNING.  The worm is now coming toward\n     them.  The mound of sand over the worm is enormous\n     and is approaching at a terrifyingly fast speed.\n     The power of this worm is awesome.\n\n153A.     EXT.

DRUM SAND - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     All at once their feet tromp down on firmer sand.\n     The SOUND is very loud.\n\n                          PAUL\n               Drum sand!\n\n     The DRUMMING sound ECHOES deep within the ground.\n     Jessica falls.  Paul stops and drags her up.  They\n     run again.  The worm SOUND becomes unbearably loud.\n     Static electricity SPARKS giant bolts of pure white\n     LIGHTNING and the air turns to ozone.  Finally they\n     find rock.  Behind them the SOUND of the worm\n     changes.  They turn.\n\n154. EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     The gigantic head of the worm is just breaking\n     through the sand.  The mouth begins to open in an\n     eighty-foot circle of teeth and darkness.  The mouth\n     arches forward searching for them.\n\n155. EXT. BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     Paul and Jessica climb up and up inside a narrow\n     slit of rock.\n--\n155A.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     The worm's mouth climbs higher also but it cannot\n     penetrate the narrow opening in the rock.\n\n156. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT\n\n     Paul and Jessica have scrambled upwards a couple of\n     hundred feet.\n\n156A.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT\n\n     Still the worm stretches up to them.  Suddenly the\n     worm begins BANGING on the rock.  Huge SHUDDERS\n     drive through the black stone.  Over and over again\n     the worm mindlessly hits at the rock.\n\n156B.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT\n\n     Paul and Jessica crouch further back in the tiny\n     passageway of safety, but a solid back wall of rock\n     prevents them from moving back any more.\n\n156C.     INT. ROCK CLIFF - NIGHT\n\n     The breath from the worm is like a hurricane of\n     WIND.\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (inner voice)\n               Cinnamon... the spice!\n                    (out loud)\n               Do you smell it?\n\n                         JESSICA\n               Yes...\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (inner voice)\n               I know the secret.

ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     Suddenly a colossal section of the rock wall cracks\n     and topples off into the worm's mouth.  Instantly\n     the worm pulls back.  A huge FIRE roars deep within\n     the worm consuming the rock.\n--\n158. INT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     The worm now can get even closer to Paul and\n     Jessica.  It looms up again and crushes its mouth up\n     against the rock.\n\n158A.     EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     Another fissure opens, and suddenly half the rock\n     wall protecting them splits off entirely and\n     falls... taking Paul with it.\n\n158B.     EXT. WORM AND ROCK - NIGHT\n\n     ...against the worm.\n\n159. EXT. ROCK CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     Paul is knocked off the cliff and falls straight\n     down two hundred feet.  His feet skid along the face\n     of rock.  He bounces and brakes.  He hits and jumps.\n     He careens from one boulder, flies upside down,\n     rights himself then tumbles and skids into the sand.\n     Unhurt, he jumps up and scrambles up another part of\n     the rock to safety.\n\n160.

BASE OF THE CLIFF - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     The worm is just coming up again when distant\n     THUMPING is heard.  The worm, as if charmed by the\n     sound, turns and moves off towards it.\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (inner voice)\n               A thumper.\n\n161A.

CREVICE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT\n\n     Slowly Paul and Jessica enter, inching forward.  A\n     low moan of WIND comes up.  Paul can see nothing,\n     then suddenly he SEES stars above and SEES the hint\n     of stairs cut into the rock.\n\n                         JESSICA\n                    (whispering)\n               Man-carved steps.\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (whispering)\n               Yes...\n\n     They climb the steps and enter an extremely narrow\n     dark channel of stone.  As they make their way\n     through the rock, suddenly there is a burst of\n     lightning which illuminates a whole troop of Fremen\n     standing silently in front of them.\n\n164. EXT.

Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and\n     just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon,\n     Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls\n     again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar\n     helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat.\n     Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky\n     incline.\n\n165. EXT.

With a flash of her hand she reaches\n     out and swipes at the Baron's face.  He CRIES OUT in\n     pain.  She pulls his suspensor plugs and pushes him\n     back, then slowly shows him the tiny needle she\n     holds in her hand.  He spins crazily as he screams\n     from the poison.\n\n273. EXT.

EXT. ARRAKEEN - DAY\n\n     As the worms enter the Arrakeen basin they meet the\n     Sardaukar.  The Sardaukar don't have a chance -- the\n     worms suck them up by the hundreds.  The Fremen on\n     the worm's backs fire weapons, killing the few\n     Sardaukar the worms leave behind.\n\n275. EXT.

NEW SCENE\n\n     The worm, that Paul, Gurney and Stilgar are riding,\n     suddenly rears up.  Its mouth opens.  The Baron\n     appears as a tiny spinning shape.  He flies directly\n     into the mouth of this collosal worm and is\n     devoured.\n\n277. EXT.

GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY\n\n     Paul enters the Palace hall and the first thing he\n     sees is the giant bull's head.  The horns have been\n     blown off and the Atreides banner has been stuffed\n     and wired into the mouth.\n\n     A WIND moans through the Palace.\n\n     Paul turns.  Gurney and several guards bring in the\n     Emperor, Irulan, the Reverend Mother, Sardaukar\n     generals, Guildsmen, Feyd and Thufir.  The Fedaykin\n     and Fremen troops line the walls.\n\n     Paul's eyes meet Feyd's -- Feyd gives him an evil\n     smile.\n\n     Paul turns and looks at the Emperor, who stares back\n     defiantly.  Paul moves his gaze to Irulan, who\n     lowers her eyes.  He then sees his old teacher,\n     Thufir Hawat, whose tired eyes wander helplessly.\n--\n                          PAUL\n               Gurney...

Come.\n\n     Thufir approaches Paul, concealing the knife.  They\n     come face to face.  The Emperor seems strangely\n     tense at this moment.  Paul notices this.  He looks\n     Thufir over.\n\n                      PAUL (CONT'D)\n                    (inner voice)\n               A knife....\n                    (out loud)\n               In payment of the many years of service to\n               my family, you may know ask of me anything\n               you wish.  Anything at all.\n                    (quietly)\n               Do you need my life, old friend?\n\n     He turns his back on him.\n\n                      PAUL (CONT'D)\n                    (quiet)\n               It is yours.\n\n     Thufir's eyes grow sad and wide.\n\n                          PAUL\n               I mean this, Thufir.  If you are to\n               strike, do it now.\n\n     Thufir's hand rises, as Jessica gasps, but the old\n     Mentat pulls his heart plug out with a quick tearing\n     motion.  Paul turns and catches him as he sags.\n\n     His head lolls back and he looks up to Paul\n     urgently.\n--\n                     THUFIR (CONT'D)\n               Three... generations... of you...\n\n     His breath escapes him and he is dead.\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (to the guards)\n               Carry this noble Atreides warrior away.\n               Do him all honor.\n\n     The guards do as they are instructed.\n\n                          PAUL\n               Emperor Shadam the IV... there are Guild\n               Heighliners above us containing many Great\n               Houses of the Lansraad....

Let me see you or there\n               will be no spice.\n--\n     We move into very thick gas and there is a ROARING.\n     Suddenly Paul sees the Third Stage Navigator.\n\n                   PAUL (V.O.)(CONT'D)\n               You know what I'm about to say is true....\n               I have the power to destroy the spice\n               forever.\n\n     The Guild Navigator's mouth stretches back in a\n     horrible MOAN.  The moan becomes more pained and\n     grows louder and louder.\n\n283. INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY\n\n     The Guildsmen in the room are MOANING and SCREAMING\n     and swarming out towards the doorway -- the Fremen\n     stop them.  The Emperor and all are amazed and\n     frightened.  There is a long hush.  The old Reverend\n     Mother then turns and glares at Paul.\n\n                      PAUL (CONT'D)\n               Don't try your powers on me.

In time you perverted the\n               truth.  You sought to control human\n               breeding and intermix a select few\n               according to a selfish master plan.  How\n               little you understand.\n\n                     REVEREND MOTHER\n               You mustn't speak of...\n\n                          PAUL\n                    (using The Voice)\n               SILENCE!\n\n     The old woman is shot backwards by the power of his\n     shout.

They begin to circle\n     each other.\n\n     Paul smiles, circling still.  Suddenly, Feyd leaps,\n     his blade jabbing savagely outward, but Paul easily\n     evades it, moving away.  They begin to circle again.\n\n     He makes another pass at Paul that comes dangerously\n     close, but again, Paul is away, a frozen smile on\n     his face.\n\n                          FEYD\n               Why prolong the inevitable?  I will kill\n               you!  I will kill him!\n\n     Feyd smiles.  He lashes out biting Paul's hand.\n     Feyd LAUGHS in triumph.\n\n     Feyd leaps forward jabbing, his right hip also\n     forward.  Yet Paul, although a little slowly, again\n     reels away.  Again, Feyd thrusts.\n--\n     This time Paul jabs with his crysknife, but Feyd\n     moves away effortlessly.  Feyd counters and kicks\n     Paul to the ground.\n\n                          CHANI\n               Paul!\n\n     Paul is up instantly and he circles with Feyd.\n\n                          FEYD\n                    (smiling)\n               Who is the little one?  A pet, perhaps?\n               Will she deserve my special attentions?\n\n     Paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing.  Feyd grabs\n     his arm, and Paul his, the two men locked in a\n     straining clinch.  Feyd presses his right hip closer\n     and closer to Paul's body.  Paul strains to keep it\n     away.  Suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of Feyd's\n     girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges\n     powerfully with it at Paul, who just barely misses\n     taking it in his skin.  He throws Feyd back, but not\n     before Feyd's feet strike out, sending Paul to the\n     floor.  Feyd leaps onto him.\n\n                          FEYD\n                    (whispering)\n               You see... your death... my blade will\n               finish you.\n\n     Suddenly, Paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes\n     Feyd up and over.  He is on top of him in a flash.\n\n     Paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward\n     through Feyd's jaw.  Feyd's mouth opens as the knife\n     continues up through his tongue and through to his\n     brain.  Feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he\n     jerks dead on the floor.  Paul slowly gets to his\n     feet, breathing heavily.  Anger still seething in\n     him, Paul issues a SOUND -- a loud, horrible,\n     powerful sound, and Feyd's internal organs rupture\n     and the stone floor under him cracks open.  The\n     Fedaykin smile.\n\n                       FEDAYKIN #2\n               Usul no longer needs the weirding module.\n\n     Everyone stares in disbelief.  Paul looks to the\n     Emperor.\n\n                          PAUL\n               Now, I will tell you how it will be.\n               Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way\n               for an Atreides to take the throne.\n\n                         EMPEROR\n               I sit on the throne!!\n--\n                          PAUL\n               You will sit on a throne on Selusa\n               Secundus, your prison planet.

In the half-light of dusk,\n     thousands of Fremen watch the sky.  Giant golden\n     lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into\n     the sky illuminating the growing clouds.  Five\n     tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a\n     downpour of RAIN ON ARRAKIS.  The Fremen stand\n     awestruck as they are drenched with water falling\n     from the sky.\n\n285.
