He exits the tunnel and swims\n     through the gas 1,000 feet to a six-dimensional\n     layered miniature replica of the entire Universe.\n     The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his\n     mouth which travels to one edge of the Universe and\n     changes into a likeness of the planet Caladan. The\n     Navigator turns and emits another piece of light\n     which travels to the opposite side of the Universe.\n     It changes into a likeness of Arrakis. The Navigator\n     begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the\n     stars and he emits SOUNDS and bursts of light into\n     the mass of stars and galaxies. The Universe begins\n     to vibrate and elongate, then to curve. Electrical\n     lightening traverses from Caladan to Arrakis as the\n     Universe bends into a U-shape.

Gurney and several guards bring in the\n     Emperor, Irulan, the Reverend Mother, Sardaukar\n     generals, Guildsmen, Feyd and Thufir.  The Fedaykin\n     and Fremen troops line the walls.\n\n     Paul's eyes meet Feyd's -- Feyd gives him an evil\n     smile.\n\n     Paul turns and looks at the Emperor, who stares back\n     defiantly.  Paul moves his gaze to Irulan, who\n     lowers her eyes.

He lashes out biting Paul's hand.\n     Feyd LAUGHS in triumph.\n\n     Feyd leaps forward jabbing, his right hip also\n     forward.  Yet Paul, although a little slowly, again\n     reels away.  Again, Feyd thrusts.\n<b>--\n</b>     This time Paul jabs with his crysknife, but Feyd\n     moves away effortlessly.  Feyd counters and kicks\n     Paul to the ground.\n\n<b>                          CHANI\n</b>               Paul!\n\n     Paul is up instantly and he circles with Feyd.\n\n<b>                          FEYD\n</b>                    (smiling)\n               Who is the little one?  A pet, perhaps?\n               Will she deserve my special attentions?\n\n     Paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing.  Feyd grabs\n     his arm, and Paul his, the two men locked in a\n     straining clinch.  Feyd presses his right hip closer\n     and closer to Paul's body.  Paul strains to keep it\n     away.  Suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of Feyd's\n     girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges\n     powerfully with it at Paul, who just barely misses\n     taking it in his skin.  He throws Feyd back, but not\n     before Feyd's feet strike out, sending Paul to the\n     floor.  Feyd leaps onto him.\n\n<b>                          FEYD\n</b>                    (whispering)\n               You see... your death... my blade will\n               finish you.\n\n     Suddenly, Paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes\n     Feyd up and over.  He is on top of him in a flash.\n\n     Paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward\n     through Feyd's jaw.  Feyd's mouth opens as the knife\n     continues up through his tongue and through to his\n     brain.  Feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he\n     jerks dead on the floor.  Paul slowly gets to his\n     feet, breathing heavily.  Anger still seething in\n     him, Paul issues a SOUND -- a loud, horrible,\n     powerful sound, and Feyd's internal organs rupture\n     and the stone floor under him cracks open.  The\n     Fedaykin smile.\n\n<b>                       FEDAYKIN #2\n</b>               Usul no longer needs the weirding module.\n\n     Everyone stares in disbelief.  Paul looks to the\n     Emperor.\n\n<b>                          PAUL\n</b>               Now, I will tell you how it will be.\n               Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way\n               for an Atreides to take the throne.\n\n<b>                         EMPEROR\n</b>               I sit on the throne!!\n<b>--\n</b><b>                          PAUL\n</b>               You will sit on a throne on Selusa\n               Secundus, your prison planet.

EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - DUSK\n</b>\n     Paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing\n     wind.  Lightning and thunder begin.  Clouds begin to\n     form over the Palace.  In the half-light of dusk,\n     thousands of Fremen watch the sky.  Giant golden\n     lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into\n     the sky illuminating the growing clouds.  Five\n     tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a\n     downpour of RAIN ON ARRAKIS.  The Fremen stand\n     awestruck as they are drenched with water falling\n     from the sky.\n\n<b>285.

The blue becomes\n     darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the\n     night.\n\n<b>                         THE END\n</b>\n\nThis script was found in INFlow.
