HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON\n          \n          WALTER VALE, sixty-two, is standing by the window of his\n          modestly furnished Colonial house. He is holding a glass of\n          wine and peering out through the drapes.\n          \n          After a few moments an OLD CAR pulls up.

The doorbell\n          rings. Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass\n          down on the end table. And then he goes to the door and opens\n          it.\n          \n                                 WOMAN\n                    Mr. Vale?\n          \n                                 WALTER\n                    Yes.\n          \n                              WOMAN\n                    Hello.

He'll just be deported.\n          \n                               ZAINAB\n                    They had to leave Syria!

Let me\n                    talk to him then we'll have a\n                    better idea of his status and what\n                    our options are.\n          \n                              WALTER\n                    Is there anything I can do?\n          \n                                 MR. SHAH\n                    Visit him.\n          \n          The lawyer slides a card across the table. Walter takes it.\n          \n          \n          INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY\n          \n          Walter rides the subway. He looks down at the lawyer's card.\n          \n          \n          EXT. QUEENS - LATER\n          \n          Walter emerges from the subway into a very industrial\n          neighborhood. Factories and fences. He checks his piece of\n          paper and starts walking.\n          \n                    52\n          \n          \n          \n          \n          EXT. QUEENS - LATER\n          \n          Walter is still walking. The area is very deserted. He stops\n          and tries to locate a street address amongst the anonymous\n          factories. He checks his sheet of paper and continues\n          walking.\n          \n          \n          EXT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER\n          \n          Walter is standing in front of the DETENTION CENTER. It looks\n          like most of the other factories around it but perhaps with a\n          bit more barbed wire.\n          \n          He presses a button and the automated door slowly opens. He\n          walks inside.\n          \n          \n          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER\n          \n          Walter walks into a small brightly lit waiting room. A few\n          SODA MACHINES and TWELVE BLUE PLASTIC CHAIRS. In one corner\n          is a guard booth with THREE GUARDS. One FEMALE GUARD is\n          wearing a Muslim headdress. Walter approaches the window and\n          waits in line. The other people waiting comprise a mix of\n          nationalities: African, Latin American, Chinese, Indian.\n          \n          The Guard talks to a MAN in front of Walter. The Man has a\n          Slavic accent.\n          \n                              GUARD\n                    That detainee has been moved.\n          \n                                SLAVIC MAN\n                    To where?\n          \n                              GUARD\n                    I don't know.\n          \n                              SLAVIC MAN\n                    He was here yesterday.\n          \n                              GUARD\n                    But now he's not. That's all I\n                    know. You can call ICE. The number\n                    is on the wall. Next. Sir, step\n                    aside please.\n          \n          The Slavic Man reluctantly steps aside, staring at a piece of\n          paper. Walter steps up to the window. He sets a piece of\n          paper on the window sill.\n          \n                      53\n          \n          \n          \n                              WALTER\n                    Hi. I'm here to see Tarek Khalil.\n          \n          The Guard takes it.\n          \n                              GUARD\n                    You been here before?\n          \n                                WALTER\n                    No.\n          \n                              GUARD\n                    Can I see your license please?\n          \n          Walter takes out his wallet.\n          \n          \n          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER\n          \n          Walter is let through a large metal door. There is an X-RAY\n          MACHINE immediately in front of him.\n          \n          Walter empties his pockets and steps through.\n          \n          Walter waits for the sliding metal door to open. It does and\n          he steps into a small room. The door slides shut and he is\n          alone in the small white room until a door on the other side\n          slides open.\n          \n          He steps through and walks down a small hallway. On the left\n          side of the hallway are small, glassed in, meeting rooms for\n          lawyer consultations.\n          \n          Walter enters into a large bright room. It resembles a prison\n          visitation room. Along the perimeter of the room is a clear\n          fiberglass wall with twenty-five small cubicles. Each cubicle\n          has one seat and a phone. On the other side of the fiberglass\n          is another seat and a phone.\n          \n          Walter looks around the room at the VISITORS and DETAINEES.\n          \n          \n          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER\n          \n          Walter is still waiting. After a moment a door opens and\n          Tarek walks out wearing a blue jump suit. He sees Walter and\n          smiles.\n          \n          They each move toward the other and settle into a vacant\n          seat. They both pick up the phone as they sit down.\n          \n                              TAREK\n                    Walter.

I have a letter from\n                    her.\n          \n                              TAREK\n                    You can't give it to me. It has to\n                    be sent to me by mail. But you can\n                    put it up to the glass.\n          \n          Walter hesitates.\n          \n                              TAREK (CONT'D)\n                    Go ahead. Open it and place it up\n                    to the glass so I can read it. It's\n                    OK. It's allowed.\n          \n          Walter complies. He sets down the phone so that he can press\n          the letter up against the glass. Tarek reads the letter.\n          \n          Walter looks around the room, trying to give Tarek some\n          privacy. He watches the various immigrant families speaking\n          to one another. Tarek taps the glass and points to Walter's\n          phone. Walter picks it up.\n          \n                              TAREK (CONT'D)\n                    Thank you, Walter.\n          \n          Walter nods as he folds up the envelope and places it back\n          into his coat.\n          \n                              WALTER\n                    How are they treating you?\n          \n                               TAREK\n                    OK. The place is very depressing.\n                    There is no privacy.

Unsure what to say next. Finally\n          Walter's curiosity gets the best of him.\n          \n                              WALTER (CONT'D)\n                    Tarek, Zainab said you were denied\n                    asylum.\n          \n                              TAREK\n                    You mean when we came here?

We did everything they told\n                    us to.\n          \n          Walter can only nod, unsure of what else to say.\n          \n                              TAREK (CONT'D)\n                    Hey, could you tell Darren? I\n                    didn't call him.\n          \n          A GUARD walks past and taps Tarek on the shoulder and speaks\n          to him. We can't hear what is being said.\n          \n                              TAREK (CONT'D)\n                        (To Walter)\n                    I have to go.

Walter just stares back, also\n          unsure of what to do. They are caught in awkward moment.\n          Finally Walter manages a nod. She nods back and smiles. It is\n          the innocent smile of a child.\n          \n          Suddenly a female guard appears in the doorway and beckons\n          the Young Girl back inside.
