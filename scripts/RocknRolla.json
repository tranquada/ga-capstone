We SEE One Two and Mumbles get out of their\n      car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are\n      carrying an axe and bolt cutters. Inside, CHECHNYAN 2 slowly\n      opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the\n      window. TWO CHOPS and the window gives in. One Two leans\n      in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's\n      wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles\n      uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free.\n\n                              MUMBLES\n                There's another case, grab it.\n\n      One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1.\n      As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the\n      car by CHECHNYAN 2.\n\n                              ONE TWO\n                The bastard's still kicking.     Mace\n                him, mace him!\n\n      Mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays\n      mace everywhere, including into One Two's eyes.\n\n                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)\n                Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not me you idiot,\n                the Guerrilla!\n\n      CHECHNYAN 2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength\n      and is still pulling One Two into the car with him. We can\n      SEE Bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car\n      looking concerned.\n\n                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)\n                Shoot him, shoot him, the bastards\n                going to eat me!\n      Mumbles pulls out a revolver, sticks it in the window and\n      fires it into CHECHNYAN 2's leg. This just aggravates the\n      CHECHNYAN.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        ROCKNROLLA\n\n      WHITE Revision    -   6-6-07                                  67.\n\n92F   CONTINUED:                                                          92F\n\n                                  ONE TWO (CONT'D)\n                   In his arms!\n\n      Bang.\n\n                                  ONE TWO (CONT'D)\n                   Arhhhhhhhhhhh.

He pulls it out and\n      Mumbles cuts the chain. One Two can't see a thing.\n\n                                  MUMBLES\n                   Let's go, we've got it.\n\n                                  ONE TWO\n                   Give me a hand, you've blinded me!\n      Major confusion is setting in.

From out of nowhere a very\n      large CHECHNYAN arm shoots through the window and puts Mumbles\n      in a neck lock. The CHECHNYAN 2 is holding on and not letting\n      go.\n\n      The car tears across the road and enters a shop window that\n      has a mezzanine. The car comes to a halt on a precarious\n      ledge, it's dangling with the CHECHNYAN 2 still not letting\n      go.\n\n93    INT.

He is punch drunk with mace in his\n     eyes, but extracts a machine gun from under his jacket. The\n     boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but CHECHNYAN 1\n     is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are. He\n     lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who\n     all hit the deck. The magazine runs dry, CHECHNYAN 1 dips\n     into his belt to extract a fresh one. Mumbles see's his\n     opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to\n     him, runs at CHECHNYAN 1 and takes a massive swipe at his\n     head. CHECHNYAN 1 goes down, but he has already put in a\n     new magazine.

One Two gets confident and\n     starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2\n     is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his\n     eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will\n     remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he\n     almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to\n     him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming.\n\n     One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from\n     a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the\n     machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than\n     One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the\n     moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the\n     moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the\n     moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he\n     can see the moped being lifted over the wall. \"Oh shit.\"\n     This is where One Two's \"zone\" comes into play.
