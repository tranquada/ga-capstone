What looks like a\r\n   windowless MILITARY BASE surrounded by barbed wire fences\r\n   sits in the middle of the wasteland.\r\n\r\n   TITLE CARD: TOP SECRET RESEARCH LABORATORY.   ARCTIC CIRCLE.\r\n\r\n   At the GUARD GATE, two RUSSIAN GUARDS play poker using an\r\n   overturned barrel as a table.\r\n\r\n   Russian Guard 1 shows a five of diamonds... and four Aces.\r\n   The other Guard folds. Russian Guard 1 LAUGHS and drags in\r\n   the pile of coins.\r\n\r\n   While he SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN and does a celebratory dance, the\r\n   coins fly up into the air. Russian Guard 1 stops dancing and\r\n   sees that the coins are gone. He accuses the other Guard of\r\n   stealing them. Russian Guard 2 swears he didn't take them.\r\n\r\n   Russian Guard 1 grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly,\r\n   until it flies up into the air. They both look up to see\r\n   where it's gone. Then the metal barrel they were using as a\r\n   table flies up, knocking them over.\r\n\r\n   Russian Guard 2 looks up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNET SHIP\r\n   LOWERING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND HOVERING OVER THE LABORATORY.\r\n\r\n   A watchtower guard shouts. A door below opens as a bunch of\r\n   Guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship.\r\n   Then...WOOSH! All of their guns are pulled up towards the\r\n   ship, including the guards themselves, who are strapped to\r\n   their guns.\r\n\r\n   A SNOWMOBILE lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet.\r\n   Other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from\r\n   the ground.\r\n\r\n   Then--\r\n\r\n   THE ENTIRE LAB STARTS TO GET PULLED UP OUT OF THE GROUND.\r\n\r\n   CLANK! The lab makes contact with the ship. It flies up and\r\n   down, shaking the scientists and guards off. They fall to\r\n   the ground. The magnet ship flies away with their lab,\r\n   vehicles, and weapons.\r\n\r\n   The remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the\r\n   snow with the remnants of the damaged base. We see a porta-\r\n   potty door open. A Confused Guard is sitting on the can\r\n   reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident. He\r\n   closes the door.\r\n\r\n                                              MATCH CUT TO:\r\n          DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   2.\r\n\r\n\r\n   INT: AVL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n   SECURITY FOOTAGE of the research station named PX LABS being\r\n   carried away by the magnet ship plays on the screens at AVL\r\n   Headquarters.\r\n\r\n   We see the back of several heads watching the footage.\r\n\r\n   There's a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n                    SILAS\r\n          Three weeks and we're still no\r\n          closer to cracking this?\r\n\r\nNo response.\r\n\r\n                    SILAS (CONT'D)\r\n          Right... bring him in.\r\n\r\n                      LUCY (O.S.)\r\n          Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT: SUBURBAN STREET - DAY\r\n\r\nGru steps toward camera, holding some sort of menacing gun,\r\nwhich he loads and cocks. He pulls the trigger, which shoots\r\nout an inflatable unicorn balloon.\r\n\r\nSmiling, he ties it to the windowsill next to some others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT: GRU'S BACKYARD - DAY\r\n\r\nA banner reads: \"Happy Birthday Agnes!\" and a massive\r\nbackyard party is in full swing. The yard is decorated with\r\npink balloons and streamers, and a BOUNCY HOUSE shaped like a\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nAGNES and several other LITTLE GIRLS slide down a slide.\r\nThey are all dressed as princesses, but Agnes is dressed as a\r\nprincess riding a unicorn.\r\n\r\n                    AGNES\r\n          This is the best party EVER!!!\r\n\r\nEdith, dressed as a ninja, emerges from beneath a table and\r\nclimbs across the monkey bars as a series of jousts, blades,\r\nand boxing gloves come up from the ground underneath her.\r\nShe jumps down, narrowly avoiding a bear trap.\r\n\r\n                     EDITH\r\n          Haha!

One of the\r\ngirls pulls up a toy duck and then razzes the other girl, but\r\nthen a LIVE PIRANHA jumps out and eats the toy duck.\r\n\r\nA BOY and a GIRL sword fight. The Boy does a bunch of fancy\r\nmoves. The Girl waits for him to finish and then pounds him\r\non the head with a club.\r\n\r\nTwo kids in the background are on a see-saw made of bombs.\r\nAgnes runs into the middle of the yard and points offscreen.\r\n\r\n                     AGNES\r\n          Oh no!   A dragon is approaching!\r\n\r\nAll of the kids turn and see KYLE dressed as a dragon. He\r\nGRUMBLES and then they SCREAM and huddle around Agnes. Then\r\nMargo enters wearing a SUIT OF ARMOR and wielding a SWORD.\r\n\r\n                    MARGO\r\n          Fear not, for here come the gallant\r\n          knights to save us!\r\n\r\nShe gestures to a group of minions wearing tiny suits of\r\narmor and wielding various MEDIEVAL WEAPONS. The Kids CHEER\r\nas the minions charge toward Kyle. One accidentally hits\r\nanother with his sword. A fight ensues in which they use the\r\nmedieval weapons on each other.\r\n\r\nOne minion pounds another with a MACE. One Minion wanders off\r\nfrom the fight with his helmet on backwards, wildly swinging\r\nhis mace.\r\n\r\nAcross the yard, Gru is busy grilling burgers and talking on\r\nthe phone. Not happy.\r\n\r\n                    GRU\r\n          No, no, no! What do you mean she's\r\n          not coming?!

Hurts! Ah! Stop it!\r\n\r\nGru kicks the minion's helmet and chases him off with a\r\nspatula, sending him towards the party swinging his mace.\r\nGru SIGHS and returns to the call.\r\n          DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   4.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GRU (CONT'D)\r\n          Listen!

Turns and\r\nsees Agnes standing there.\r\n\r\n                     AGNES\r\n          Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess\r\n          coming?\r\n\r\nGru stares down at Agnes' big excited eyes. He opens his\r\nmouth to tell her the truth, but can't do it.\r\n\r\n                    GRU\r\n          Any minute now!\r\n\r\nAgnes squeals with excitement and runs off.\r\n\r\n                     AGNES\r\n          Yayyy!\r\n\r\nGru looks worried--what do I do now?    He signals two minions.\r\n\r\n                    GRU\r\n          Stall them.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT: BACKYARD - LATER\r\n\r\nA hand-painted piece of cardboard reading \"THE MAGIC SHOW\" is\r\nplaced on an easel. Agnes and all of the little kids sit in\r\na semicircle on the grass. Two minions dressed as magicians\r\nare doing a magic act with Edith as their assistant. One\r\nminion blows up a balloon and puts it in Edith's mouth. Then\r\nthe other whips out a CHAINSAW and fires it up, heading\r\ntoward her.\r\n\r\nMargo sees this and quickly intervenes.\r\n\r\n                    MARGO\r\n          Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright.\r\n          That's enough of the magic show!\r\n\r\nThe minions don't hide their disappointment.\r\n\r\n                     MINIONS\r\n          Awwww.\r\n          DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   5.\r\n\r\n\r\nMargo suddenly looks around as if she just heard something.\r\n\r\n                    MARGO\r\n          Wait, did you hear that? It\r\n          sounded like the twinkling sounds\r\n          of magical fairy dust.\r\n\r\n                    AGNES\r\n              (gasps)\r\n          It's the fairy princess!   She's\r\n          coming!\r\n\r\nMargo gasps and points up to the sky.\r\n\r\n                      MARGO\r\n          Look!\r\n\r\nEdith spits out her magic balloon in horror and we follow it\r\nup to reveal--\r\n\r\nGru. Dressed in a PUFFY PINK DRESS, fairy wings, glittery\r\neyelashes and tiara and magical wand.\r\n\r\nUp on top of Gru's house, the minions struggle to lower him\r\ndown on a rope. Edith's balloon floats by and distracts\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThey let go of the rope and Gru swings wildly, smashing into\r\nthe wall of the house and crashing to the ground.\r\n\r\n                      GRU\r\n          Aaaaaahh!\r\n\r\nHe stands up and tries to cover.\r\n\r\nAgnes SIGHS HAPPILY, in awe of the fairy princess.\r\n\r\n                    GRU (CONT'D)\r\n              (in falsetto)\r\n          It is I, Gru...zinkerbell!

Then a LITTLE GIRL raises her hand and speaks\r\nwith a lisp.\r\n\r\n                    LITTLE GIRL\r\n          How come you're tho fat?\r\n\r\nGru grits his teeth, then forces a smile and speaks with a\r\nhigh-pitched, dreamy voice.\r\n          DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    6.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GRU\r\n          Because my house is made of candy\r\n          and sometimes I eat instead of\r\n          facing my problems.\r\n\r\nThe girl starts to ask another question.\r\n\r\n                    LITTLE GIRL\r\n          How come you have-\r\n\r\nGru cuts her off with a puff of fairy dust to the face.

Time for cake!\r\n\r\nAs the kids run to the table, Agnes approaches Gru.\r\n\r\n                    AGNES\r\n          Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're\r\n          the best fairy princess ever!\r\n\r\nGru smiles.\r\n\r\n                    GRU\r\n              (in falsetto)\r\n          You are welcome, little girl.\r\n\r\nShe runs off, but quickly returns.\r\n\r\n                    AGNES\r\n              (whispers in his ear)\r\n          I know it's really you, Gru. I'm\r\n          just pretending for the other kids.\r\n\r\nShe runs off again to join her friends. Gru watches her go.\r\nCouldn't be happier. Then he is approached by JILLIAN, a\r\nheavily-Botoxed mom.\r\n\r\n                    JILLIAN\r\n          Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the\r\n          Party!\r\n\r\n                    GRU\r\n              (forcing a smile)\r\n          Hello, Jillian.\r\n\r\n                    JILLIAN\r\n          Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb\r\n          here, but my friend Natalie is\r\n          recently single, and...\r\n           DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   7.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the background, a homely NATALIE leans against a buffet\r\ntable and seductively raises her eyebrows at Gru.
