This is the \n               place that John Michael Kane was staying when he \"died.\"\n\n               And so begins, the investigation...\n\n               Now, since the presence of danger -- ie Wombosi's guys and/or \n               Treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene \n               could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're \n               not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene \n               is not finished.\n\n               The rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: Bourne \n               would have to be very nervous about being recognized. If he \n               was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever \n               \"social engineering\" needs doing.\n\n               Long version? Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods. \n               Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi.\n\n               Fast version? It's all results -- we see them execute a plan \n               rather than work it up. MARIE is already in the hotel. In a \n               hotel uniform? Posing as a guest? In any case, she looks \n               very much different than we've ever seen her before.\n\n               She gets close to the office. Hides. Waits. BOURNE calls the \n               desk from a pay phone. Asks for something. We see that some \n               sort of improvised booby-trap has been set inside the hotel \n               to start a fire. In the confusion -- MARIE -- very bravely -- \n               gets into the office.
