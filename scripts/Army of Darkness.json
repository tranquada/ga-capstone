Ash speaks to\n\t   the CAMERA with urgency:\n\t\t\t\t\t   ASH\n\t\t\t   Why would you say that I am\n\t\t\t   insane?  I wouldn't say that I've\n\t\t\t   lost my mind simply because I've\n\t\t\t   heard the voices and seen the\n\t\t\t   godless things moving in the\n\t\t\t   woods. If anything, I think more\n\t\t\t   clearly now than ever before. I\n\t\t\t   know now that there is such a\n\t\t\t   thing as a living Evil. A dark\n\t\t\t   and shapeless thing that lives\n\t\t\t   not in the spaces we know, but\n\t\t\t   between them. In the Dark. In the\n\t\t\t   night. And it wants the exact same\n\t\t\t   thing as you and I: a chance at\n\t\t\t   warm life on this Earth. It\n\t\t\t   doesn't care that is already had\n\t\t\t   that chance ...once. Now listen\n\t\t\t   closely because there isn't much\n\t\t\t   time. Listen and believe, because\n\t\t\t   it's all true.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   DISSOLVE TO:\n2\t  EXT.

The Necronomicon.\n\t\t\t   An ancient Sumarrian text, bound\n\t\t\t   in human flesh and inked in human\n\t\t\t   blood. It contained bizarre burial\n\t\t\t   rites, prophesies...and\n\t\t\t   instruction for demon\n\t\t\t   resurrection. It was never meant\n\t\t\t   for the world of the living.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   DISSOLVE TO:\n3\t  INT.

CAMERA rips through the\n\t   cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.\n\t\t\t\t\t   ASH (V.O.)\n\t\t\t   It got into my hand and it went\n\t\t\t   bad.\n6\t  CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t   twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.\n\t\t\t\t\t   ASH (V.O.)\n\t\t\t   So I lopped it off at the wrist.\n7\t  INT.
