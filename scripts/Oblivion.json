THE PLANET - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Huge mountains, destroyed STRUCTURES. Buildings\r\n          enveloped by flows of earth. Awe-inspiring beauty.\r\n\r\n                    JACK (V.O.)\r\n          They arrived almost half a century\r\n          ago. Aliens, Scavs, whatever you\r\n          want to call them. Their idea of\r\n          how-do-you-do was to blow up our\r\n          moon.\r\n\r\n          Giant waterfalls crash where lava cooled through iron and\r\n          concrete. Telephone polls half-buried in sand.\r\n\r\n                    JACK (V.O.)\r\n          Without her moon, the earth went\r\n          insane. Most were killed in the\r\n          floods, as the cities came down,\r\n          as everything caught fire. A year\r\n          later their ground troops landed,\r\n          to exterminate whoever was left.\r\n          A station wagon half protrudes from a lava flow. A\r\n          child's plastic flip-flops on the dash.\r\n\r\n                    JACK (V.0.)\r\n          They were probably surprised, what\r\n          we were willing to do, to survive.\r\n          We used the nukes.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          We won the war, but lost the\r\n          planet.\r\n\r\n          Low on the HORIZON, the TET rises with the sun. It's a\r\n          WHITE TETRAHEDRON (SIX-SIDED) SPACE STATION that circles\r\n          the earth once a day, like an artificial moon.\r\n\r\n                    JACK (V.0.)\r\n          Humanity had to flee the Earth.\r\n          We had to unlearn what it meant,\r\n          to call something our home. Now\r\n          we live on the Tet, our man-made\r\n          moon. A temporary home before the\r\n          next step. Everyone's there now.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Well, almost everyone.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2.\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          An ALARM chirps. A man's hand reaches out of bed,\r\n          silences it. The MAN swings his feet onto the floor. He\r\n          sits with his face in his hands, waking up. We hear a\r\n          SHOWER RUNNING. He looks up.\r\n          A WOMAN showers near him, only steamed glass walls\r\n          between them. She sees him, smiles at him, without\r\n          modesty. He looks back at her.\r\n          OVER TITLES. We watch a familiar morning routine:\r\n\r\n          INT. A HOME - MORNING\r\n\r\n          BATHROOM. The man flicks on a light, stares at himself\r\n          in the mirror. This is JACK. Early 40's, a good face\r\n          that enjoys rugged living. Tan and weathered skin. His\r\n          eyes are curious, kind, almost child-like.\r\n          The woman squeezes in next to him, VICTORIA. 30s, a tom-\r\n          boy shock of red hair, towel around her neck. She\r\n          brushes her teeth.\r\n\r\n          KITCHEN. Victoria watches the coffee drip, bites toast.\r\n          SHOWER. Jack lets warm water blast him in the face.\r\n          READY ROOM. Jack pulls a worn high-tech workman's suit\r\n          from a locker, revealing a photo taped to the door: It's\r\n          of him and Victoria, younger, in a white-walled high-tech\r\n          corridor, smiling eager at the camera. He stares at it\r\n          for a moment, closes the locker door.\r\n          KITCHEN. Victoria hands Jack his coffee. He kisses the\r\n          top of her head, heads out to work.\r\n\r\n          EXT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          He walks out onto the deck of a futuristic home perched\r\n          1,200 feet in the air, literally above the clouds. As\r\n          our minds are blown, Jack moves away from the glass-\r\n          walled home towards his BUBBLESHIP, a futuristic-cross\r\n          between a Bell 47 Helicopter and a jet fighter, and we\r\n          CRANE UP UP UP... INCREDIBLE VERTIGO until we're looking\r\n          down at this impossible structure. Jack, climbing into\r\n          his ship.\r\n\r\n          TITLE CARD: \"OBLIVION\"\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n\r\n          EXT. THE SKY - DAY\r\n\r\n          The SKY stretches to infinity above roiling planetary\r\n          cloud-cover. The BUBBLESHIP streaks through our frame,\r\n          dropping faster than free fall.\r\n\r\n          INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Through the canopy of the Bubbleship: The cloud cover\r\n          below seems to FALL UPWARDS at us, that's how fast we're\r\n          diving. There's a small worn BOBBLE-HEAD on the dash\r\n          which vibrates with the ship.\r\n          Jack is un-phased by the drop, touches a few controls.\r\n\r\n          VICTORIA (V.O.)\r\n          Good morning, Jack. I'll be your\r\n          flight attendant for the day.\r\n          This is day... three thousand two\r\n          hundred and twenty five, in case\r\n          you were wondering.\r\n          JACK is running instruments. A day at work..\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          Today we will be running support\r\n          on five Resource Gatherers working\r\n          the seaboard. Coordinates coming\r\n          to you... now. Please do confirm.\r\n          On Jack's heads-up display, five icons glow to life.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Yeah, I got 'em. You got 'em,\r\n          Bob?\r\n          The Bobblehead bobs.\r\n\r\n          INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          VICTORIA watches the Bubbleship's icon on a screen.\r\n          She's now wearing a work jumpsuit open over a man's\r\n          undershirt. She has a natural ease with tech and stress.\r\n          She sips her coffee, punches up a feed, multi-tasking\r\n          with cool.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          Drone perimeter defense is intact,\r\n          although one went offline last\r\n          night.

Same ole' same.\r\n          In front of Victoria, almost a hundred years of\r\n          technological advances. Most prominent a MAP overlaid\r\n          with environmental, meteorological, radiation levels...\r\n          Other screens stream cam-footage from the Bubbleship.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          Alright, you're blind in five,\r\n          four, three...\r\n          INTERCUT WITH JACK IN THE BUBBLESHIP.

Have a nice ride.\r\n          The Bubbleship HITS CLOUDS, goes completely blind. Just\r\n          vapor and water HAMMERING the canopy like bullets.\r\n          On the heads-up display, GPS numbers roll. The readouts\r\n          deal with climate, terrain below... Even in this hell,\r\n          Jack takes the controls, starts to pilot on instruments.\r\n          One of Victoria's boards flashes. She squints as a large\r\n          MASS forms near Jack's ship.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)\r\n          Jack, you got some weather on your\r\n          five, closing.\r\n          The Bubbleship is VIBRATING, buffeted.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          What do you call this?\r\n          What does a storm look like inside a storm? Like this.\r\n          The WALL OF WEATHER comes out of the wind and rain from\r\n          behind Jack's ship, simply eats it up.\r\n          Suddenly Jack's going end over end, helpless. Warning\r\n          lights flash. Jack punches controls that won't respond.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          (humming to himself)\r\n          \"I've got sunshine...\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED: ( 2)\r\n\r\n                          JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          on a cloudy day.

Mysterious\r\n          black sand dunes, active volcanoes, swirling orange and\r\n          gold sediment, steaming bright blue hot springs and rich\r\n          brown craters.\r\n          Jack takes a moment to marvel at it all.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          (under his breath)\r\n          \"Talkin' 'bout my girl...\"\r\n          Jack shifts the Bubbleship, in the distance a series of\r\n          RESOURCE-GATHERERS on the horizon.

A hundred tons of twisted metal just moved an\r\n          inch above him.

He\r\n          kneels, lifts one, blows dust off the cover: \"THE\r\n\r\n          EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS.\"\r\n          He steps back, admiring it... SNAP! A BEAR TRAP hidden\r\n          in the debris closes around his leg, piercing armor and\r\n          flesh. Jack has a second to process and a cable rises\r\n          from the debris, goes taught!\r\n          JACK is dragged through the dust inhumanly FAST, headed\r\n          towards a darkened alcove. He activates a LASER CUTTER\r\n          on his cuff, slices through the cable which WHIPS AWAY as\r\n          he brings his rifle up, FIRES rounds into the darkness.\r\n          INHUMAN SCREAMS.

SLAMMING into the far side. For a moment\r\n          dangling over the fall, then Jack hauls himself over the\r\n          far side.\r\n          ALIEN FORMS emerge from recesses. We get glimpses of\r\n          feathers, oily flesh, metal...

And then he's\r\n          FALLING... IMPACTS the ground. Can't get his air.\r\n          Staggering wildly to his feet, FORMS CLOSING...\r\n          Suddenly a DRONE blasts down through the ceiling hole.\r\n          Its lights turning night to day, its cannons FIRING.\r\n          In the STROBING FLASH of canon fire, we see SCAVS\r\n          INCINERATED.

Fire\r\n          and plaster dust fills the space.\r\n          Jack shields himself from the debris as the Drone ceases\r\n          firing, WHIRLS on Jack. The same awful moment as it\r\n          SCANS him.\r\n          Then it lifts away, is gone as quickly as it arrived.\r\n          And with its departure, the darkness comes again.\r\n          Silence, whatever was here is now gone.\r\n          Jack takes in the destruction for a hard beat: The ash\r\n          of an alien, burning paper twisting in the air.

She's leaning back in her command\r\n          chair, her feet propped on the console, also staring out\r\n          at the Tet. Strangely quiet.\r\n          In Jack's face a curious mixture of nostalgia, and\r\n          confusion... This small metal planet is his home.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Goodnight, folks... See you back\r\n          here tomorrow.

Through the\r\n          glass, he can see Victoria inside the Sky Tower. She\r\n          nods at him, a tense welcome home. He nods back.

Early in their tour, Victoria girlishly jumps\r\n          on the sofa with a pint of ice cream, laughing.\r\n          BEDROOM. Also early. Jack watches Victoria sleep,\r\n          brushes hair from her face, affectionate...\r\n          And the memory... SEEMS TO DISTORT. Suddenly becoming:\r\n          THE NEW YORK SKYLINE, seen through a cheap telescope.\r\n          Jack, pulling away from the telescope, happy, turning\r\n          to...

SKY TOWER, STORAGE AREA - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Rows and rows of shelves, mainly empty now. Jack and\r\n          Victoria have gone through almost all of what they needed\r\n          for a 5-year tour. Jack grabs a container of water.\r\n\r\n          INT. SKY TOWER, READY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Jack starts to hang up his workman's suit, pauses to\r\n          stare at the photo of a younger him and Victoria on the\r\n          Tet. They look so eager, so innocent.\r\n          He shifts slightly to where he can see out to the Tet\r\n          itself, sinking below the horizon.\r\n\r\n          INT. SKY TOWER 2, WORK AREA - DUSK\r\n\r\n          The area is devoted to DRONE REPAIR. Lifts, parts,\r\n          shelves, odds and ends of gear and weaponry, tables of\r\n          tools, a written-off DRONE at the back.\r\n           Jack comes in, glances at his newest arrival, the self-\r\n          beached DRONE 166. Even deactivated, it looks like\r\n           trouble, like pure evil.\r\n          He opens a drawer, slips THE EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS\r\n          into the drawer, shuts it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          20.\r\n\r\n          INT.

He hands it to her,\r\n          pleased, watching her reaction.\r\n          She opens it to reveal a small GREEN SEEDLING in a pocket\r\n          of fresh, rich soil.

The Pod\r\n          depressurizes with a sudden exhale of dead air. Jack\r\n          pulls back the pod door.\r\n          Inside, the woman lies in a gauzy sleep suit. Her hair\r\n          is matted. Her body looks frail, her skin translucent,\r\n          veins dark, lips blue, like a drowning victim.\r\n          Vika pulls her feeding tube, takes her pulse, checks her\r\n          eyes, lifting the lids.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA (CONT'D)\r\n          Lift her up, we have to get some\r\n          air into her.\r\n          JACK gets his arms around the woman, pulling her upwards.\r\n          FLUID seeps from her mouth...\r\n          And suddenly she's ALIVE, COUGHING, spewing fluid across\r\n          Jack and the floor. He sets her down as she painfully\r\n          wretches, then SUCKS IN AIR. Her eyes flutter open.\r\n          She's suddenly violently ill again. Instinctively, Jack\r\n          goes to hold her --\r\n\r\n                          VICTORIA (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (PROFESSIONAL)\r\n          No. Don't.

Looks up at both of them...\r\n          She tries to stand, disoriented by the glass walls, the\r\n          infinite vertigo that surrounds them. She falls to her\r\n          knees and stares with amazement down into the clouds.\r\n          Jack kneels beside her, puts a hand on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          You're safe.

The warm water spraying over their\r\n          three forms, soaking the woman's gauzy suit which clings\r\n          to her body. Water running across Jack and Victoria's\r\n          faces, their open eyes, locked on each other.\r\n          The water finally stops.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          We have to get her up to the Tet.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          I know.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA\r\n          I don't have the facilities here.\r\n          Once she's stable...\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          I know.\r\n          The glass door slides open behind them.

Then the DRONE FIRES itself off into the black\r\n          clouds, disappearing towards the earth below.\r\n          Jack stares after it; then he turns, looks across empty\r\n          space to the underside of the glass pool. Victoria has\r\n          just dived in. She swims laps, kicking hard,\r\n          bubblestreams peeling across her body. Exercise, not\r\n          pleasure.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

He looks at Julia\r\n          who hesitates, then she climbs on the back of the bike.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          I'll get to the antenna, send a\r\n          signal with my location.

What if I told you that I\r\n          had been to your radiation zones.\r\n          And what I found there...

Then GUNS the bike.\r\n          Beech stares after them, the rooster-tail of Jack's bike\r\n          racing away across the ruined landscape.\r\n\r\n                         SYKES\r\n          What makes you think he's any\r\n          different from the others?\r\n          Beech stares at him a moment, then back out.\r\n\r\n                         BEECH\r\n          She does.\r\n          Beech turns away.\r\n\r\n          EXT. THE RUINED EARTH - DAY\r\n\r\n          Jack pilots the electric bike across STAGGERING\r\n          BEAUTIFUL VISTAS... LANDSCAPES OF THE IMAGINATION. On\r\n          the back of the bike, Julia takes in the incredible\r\n          beauty around her.\r\n          Finally, in the shadow of a jagged mountain, the BIKE\r\n          slows and STOPS. Jack checks the charge: it's dead.\r\n          They climb off and Jack leaves the bike where it lies,\r\n          headed off on foot.\r\n\r\n                         JULIA\r\n          What happened...?\r\n          She's staring into the distance where an old WRECK of a\r\n          RESOURCE GATHERER lies shattered against a cliff-face.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          The Scavs brought it down ten\r\n          years ago.

CLIFF TOP - DAY\r\n\r\n          Jack and Julia reach the top of a high cliff, with what\r\n          looks like a METAL SPIRE protruding upwards at its edge.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          73.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          We PASS OVER them, staring down a familiar 1,200-foot\r\n          waterfall. Jack has returned to the top of the Empire\r\n          State, this time approaching from above.\r\n          Together, they climb DOWN the craggy rock face. Two tiny\r\n          figures against a massive backdrop, a mortal fall below.\r\n\r\n          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY\r\n\r\n          Jack is the first to drop onto the cracked cement of the\r\n          deck. He moves forward, pulling the plastic and\r\n          camouflage off the transmitter and repeater. He gets to\r\n          work on the repeater. It's old tech, hard to make it\r\n          talk to the Bubbleship.\r\n          Julia stands a ways off. For a moment, their gazes meet,\r\n          then he continues working.\r\n\r\n          INT. SKY TOWER, COMAND CENTER - DAY\r\n\r\n          Victoria is hard at work, processing the sound that\r\n          caught her attention. She has it playing through the\r\n          whole sky tower: The SOUNDS are broken, static-like,\r\n          almost ALIEN. Strange and guttural.\r\n          Fingers fly over controls, making adjustments. This time\r\n          the sounds parse into WORDS. A male and a female voice.\r\n          Almost apprehensive, she pulls an electronic filter,\r\n          overlays it on the signal, which suddenly drops into\r\n          perfect clarit : A recording of Jack and Victoria, from\r\n          a different patrol.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA'S VOICE\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHING)\r\n          .And I want a dishwasher, the\r\n          kind that you can put --\r\n\r\n                         JACK'S VOICE\r\n          I don't think they'll have those\r\n          on Mars, Honey.\r\n\r\n                         VICTORIA'S VOICE\r\n          Okay, fine.

The kind you can't\r\n          control. Her fingers SHAKING, BADLY, she plays the\r\n          recording, puts it on a loop.\r\n\r\n          TNT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS\r\n          The voices BOOM through the Sky Tower, over and over.\r\n          Frightening that their simplicity contrasts so much with\r\n          the effect they are having on Victoria who moves into the\r\n          main room, white as a sheet. She looks up as..\r\n          The Bubbleship lifts off from its platform and sails\r\n          into the sky. She watches it go, then rushes back\r\n          towards her station.\r\n\r\n          EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - DAY\r\n\r\n          Jack stares at the ESB Antenna, down at the repeater and\r\n          the line of code he hopes he's transmitting.\r\n\r\n                         JULIA\r\n          What will you do now?\r\n          Jack doesn't answer. He moves to the edge of the deck,\r\n          stares out, unwilling to meet her eyes.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          That old man is smart. Those fuel\r\n          cells, the way he's got them tied\r\n          in with your device...

He flops down in the dirt\r\n          at the top of the rise, bringing his weapon up.\r\n          JACK'S POV - DRONE 166. It lies smashed and smoking at\r\n          the bottom of an incline. Finally dead. The wind and\r\n          sand are beginning to whistle now, growing intensity...\r\n          Jack starts to stand... when a FAMILIAR SOUND makes him\r\n          turn.\r\n\r\n          THAT OF A BUBBLESHIP.\r\n          Jack hits the dirt as A BUBBLESHIP, just like Jack's,\r\n          screams overhead and lands next to the DRONE, in a moment\r\n          eerily reminiscent of the first scene of the film.\r\n          Below, a MAN gets out of the second Bubbleship. He wears\r\n          the same kind of suit as Jack. ANOTHER REPAIR MAN. He's\r\n          got a bandana wrapped around his lower face to shield him\r\n          from the sandstorm.\r\n          Jack reaches for his BINOCS, bring them to his face only\r\n          to find the lenses shattered.\r\n          Reaching the downed Drone, the MAN kneels next to it and\r\n          in a familiar fashion begins utilizing his tools to fix\r\n          Drone 166. He locks a damaged cannon back into place,\r\n          tightens it...\r\n          Jack suddenly realizes what the man's doing. He stands,\r\n          the wind now blasting in his direction, he starts running\r\n          down the hill towards the man.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          87.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey! Hey, wait! Stop! Don't\r\n          touch that Drone!\r\n          His words are eaten up by the wind and sand. He rushes\r\n          forward.\r\n          WITH THE REPAIRMAN. We only see his hands as he works on\r\n          Drone 166. He's very good. Even in the growing\r\n           sandstorm he clips out a ruined board, slots a new one\r\n          in. Runs a by-pass around a wire-bundle.\r\n          The Repairman's fingers go to a familiar switch to\r\n          activate the Drone...\r\n\r\n                         JACK'S VOICE\r\n          No! Wait!\r\n          The Repairman hears the voice, even as he flips the\r\n          switch. He LEAPS BACK, spinning around, his carbine\r\n          coming off his back, lined on Jack fifteen feet away who\r\n\r\n          STARES BACK AT HIM IN UTTER ASTONISHMENT.\r\n          JACK'S POV -- THE REPAIRMAN. Holding the weapon on him.\r\n          The man is Jack. A cleaner, newer, but identical version\r\n          of Jack... A CLONE.\r\n          Jack stares, transfixed. Now it all makes sense: The\r\n          Garbled transmissions, Victoria's last words, who or what\r\n          he really is, and is not.\r\n          Not so for Jack 2. He takes a step back, confused,\r\n          horrified.

A GARDEN - DAY\r\n\r\n          Well-tended. Thick ripe fruit hang on vines.\r\n\r\n          JULIA (V.0.)\r\n          The Tet arrived almost half a\r\n          century ago. And it changed our\r\n          world forever...\r\n          We're at CRATER LAKE, three years in the future.\r\n          The Grotto has been turned into a house, the ground has\r\n          been cultivated. Roses and yellow flowers grow near the\r\n          house. A SOLAR ARRAY powers the spot. All Jack's\r\n          scavenging has gone to very good use. There's a small\r\n          make-shift boat moored at the Lake's edge.\r\n\r\n          JULIA (V.0.)\r\n          It was probably surprised, what we\r\n          were willing to do, to survive.\r\n          Jack's basketball sits alone near the hoop.\r\n\r\n          JULIA (V.0.)\r\n          We had to unlearn what it meant,\r\n          to call something our home.\r\n          There's a familiar painting, hanging on the wall. The\r\n          girl in the field of wheat, yearning towards home.\r\n\r\n          JULIA (V.0.)\r\n          But we did. We started over. And\r\n          so here we are now, everyone\r\n          that's left...\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          109.\r\n\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n          JULIA is turning over a patch of ground for next year.\r\n          Next to her, A CHILD is digging her fingers through loam.\r\n          The CHILD looks up, stares across the water.\r\n\r\n                         JULIA\r\n          Well, almost everyone.\r\n          A MAN stands at the edge of the water, on the opposite\r\n          side. He wears the wrecked remains of a worksuit, and\r\n          carries a pack. It is Jack 2. He's aged three years,\r\n          his hair has grown, his boots are scavenged. He has\r\n          travelled a long way, and we know that as he stares\r\n          across the water, he knows exactly what he is looking at.\r\n\r\n                         CHILD\r\n          Who is that?\r\n          ON JULIA. It's been a long journey to this moment for\r\n          her as well. She smiles.\r\n\r\n                         JULIA\r\n          It's your father. Come on, let's\r\n          go pick him up.\r\n\r\n          END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nOblivion\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Joseph Kosinski\u00a0\u00a0Karl Gajdusek\u00a0\u00a0William Monahan\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:32:22.962191"}
