THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT\n\n\tBegin on black.  The sound of rain driving into trees. \n\tSomething wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through\n\ta forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN\n\tBROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and\n\tright, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his\n\tleft.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past\n\tsaplings and plunges on.\n\n\tEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT\n\n\tClose-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for\n\tair.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome,\n\tbruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark. \n\tStops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he\n\thears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and\n\traces on.\n\n\tEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT\n\n\tBROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's\n\tlength, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now\n\tthere's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps\n\tfallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes\n\tforward, never stumbling once.\n\n\tEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT\n\n\tBROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and\n\tstops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow\n\tcircle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the\n\twildly swaying trees.\n\n\tThere's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins\n\tround, bellows deep from his heart:\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tGod save the Queen!!\n\n\tAnd fires.\n\n\tNothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes\n\ton screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into\n\tempty space.  A pause.\n\n\tSlowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on\n\thim that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees,\n\twaving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol\n\tdrop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face. \n\tAnd now, for the first time, we see that his socks have\n\tfallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He\n\tshifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He\n\tgoes on staring into the dark.  Nothing. \n\tJust the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher\n\tand higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE TO BLACK.\n\n\tCAPTION: \"1864\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE IN:\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY (V.O.)\n\t\tI have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from\n\t\tBalmoral.  Her majesty has mentioned\n\t\thim, on one or two occasions, as being\n\t\ta most devoted outdoor servant to\n\t\tPrince Albert during his last days\n\t\tthere...\n\n\tJohn BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tThe screen is black.  As the camera pulls back, we discover\n\tthat we are looking at a black night-gown.\n\n\tQueen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an\n\telderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY (V.O.)\n\t\t... The depths of the Queen's sorrow\n\t\tremain impenetrable.  She has now\n\t\trestricted herself to a regime of such\n\t\tferocious introspection that we are\n\t\tall at our wits' end...\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRINCE ALBERT'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tA bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black.  His desk\n\tis laid out as if for work.  A VALET is brushing one of his\n\tsuits before laying it carefully on the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY (V.O.)\n\t\t... The Household continues, at her\n\t\tinstruction, to observe the rituals\n\t\tnow so familiar to her, in a vain\n\t\tattempt to render vivid that which can\n\t\tnever be revived...\n\n\tClose-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed\n\tcarefully beside a dish of freshly poured water.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tThe hairdresser is pulling VICTORIA's hair back into the\n\twidow's cape.  For the first time, we see her face.  It is\n\tset in a mask of severity.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY (V.O.)\n\t\t... It will not surprise you to hear\n\t\tthat she continues steadfast in her\n\t\trefusal to accept any public\n\t\tengagements, however trivial...\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY\n\n\tA bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal\n\tbed.  His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side.\n\n\tA somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed:\n\tDOCTOR JENNER, the Queen's physician.  He is placing\n\tpotions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table.\n\n\tBehind him, TWO MAIDSERVANTS are busy stripping and\n\tremaking the bed while another raises the window to air the\n\troom.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY (V.O.)\n\t\t... Family and staff expend all their\n\t\tefforts endeavouring to draw her out\n\t\tof this state of unfettered morbidity,\n\t\tbut to no avail.  Indeed, Doctor\n\t\tJenner will not undertake to vouchsafe\n\t\ther sanity, unless some remedy is\n\t\tfound...\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tVICTORIA is turning slowly around as a young ASSISTANT\n\tDRESSER completes the fastening on her black crepe dress.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY (V.O.)\n\t\t... We must hope, therefore, that this\n\t\tMr Brown will appeal to the Queen's\n\t\tsentimental, though deeply-held, view\n\t\tthat all Highlanders are good for the\n\t\thealth.  If she can at least be\n\t\tpersuaded to take the air, the\n\t\tprospect of further recovery may seem\n\t\tless remote...\n\n\tThe assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress. \n\tVICTORIA winces slightly.\n\n\t\t\t\tASSISTANT DRESSER\n\t\t\t(terrified)\n\t\tSorry, ma'am.\n\n\tEXT. THE SEA FRONT, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY\n\n\tWe glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads:\n\t\"ISLE OF WIGHT. 1864.\"\n\n\tA DRIVER stands against the sea front with a horse and cart\n\tbearing the Royal coat of arms.\n\n\tJohn BROWN leads his pony along the dockside, towards the\n\twaiting driver.  He is in his late thirties, fit, handsome\n\tand dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY (V.O.)\n\t\t... He is arriving by boat this\n\t\tafternoon, by which time it is hoped\n\t\tHer Majesty will be in a fit state to\n\t\tconsider riding out...\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S ROOM - DAY\n\n\tSIR HENRY PONSONBY, the Queen's Private Secretary, is\n\tsitting at his writing desk, completing a letter.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY (V.O.)\n\t\t... As to that decision, along with\n\t\tall others, we remain, as ever,\n\t\tprisoners of the Queen's grief.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tEver your devoted husband, Henry.\n\n\tHe folds the letter and slips it into an envelope.  He is a\n\tmiddle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine\n\tand with a civil servant's stoop.  As he looks up, we see a\n\twhite-stockinged FOOTMAN standing to attention by the door. \n\tPONSONBY hands the letter to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY (CONT'D)\n\t\tWindsor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tCAPTION: \"OSBORNE HOUSE, ISLE OF WIGHT\"\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tA series of windows are being slammed open by white\n\tstockinged FOOTMEN as members of the ROYAL FAMILY and UPPER\n\tHOUSEHOLD hurry by in silence, all dressed in mourning and\n\trushing to make the luncheon hour.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tQueen VICTORIA heads down the empty corridor with two\n\tladies-in-waiting, LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL, hurrying\n\talong a pace behind.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tMembers of the Royal family and upper household hurry into\n\tthe icy dining room and take their designated places at the\n\tluncheon table.  Everybody is dressed in mourning and\n\tnobody speaks.  Wind whistles through the open windows. \n\tSilence.\n\n\tAmong the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the\n\tPrince of Wales.  He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff\n\tdressed and balding.  He stands next to his young wife,\n\tPRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl,\n\ttrying to keep warm.\n\n\tAs BERTIE smooths down his thinning hair, DOCTOR JENNER\n\tbustles into the dining room, stands himself next to\n\tPONSONBY and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation\n\twith the Prince of Wales, entirely in whispers.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNER\n\t\tCongratulations, Your Royal Highness!\n\n\t\t\t\tBERTIE\n\t\tThank you, Doctor.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNER\n\t\tA boy, I hear.  Excellent, excellent.\n\n\t\t\t\tBERTIE\n\t\tYes.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAlbert Victor.  Eddie for short.  What\n\t\tdo you think?\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tA fine choice, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNER\n\t\tExcellent!\n\n\tEXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY\n\n\tJOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the\n\tcarrier bearing the Royal coat of arms.  The DRIVER leans\n\tin.\n\n\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n\t\tAre you riding up front?\n\n\tBROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tI'll stay with the pony, thank you. \n\t\tShe's all the way from Deeside and\n\t\tshe's not sure she likes you yet.\n\n\tThe DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tVICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep\n\tbreath.  LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tHow many?\n\n\tLADY ELY is slightly taken aback.\n\n\t\t\t\tLADY ELY\n\t\tThe Royal Family and senior members of\n\t\tthe household, ma'am.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tJust them?\n\n\t\t\t\tLADY ELY\n\t\tYes, ma'am.\n\n\tVICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps\n\tthrough the door.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tEveryone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in.  Acknowledging the\n\tother diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place.\n\n\tShe flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else\n\tsits and does the same.  The meal is served immediately by\n\twaiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony.\n\n\tIt's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables.  VICTORIA\n\tstarts eating heartily, straight away.  Everyone does the\n\tsame.\n\n\tOnly the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence.\n\n\tEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY\n\n\tThe Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on\n\tdown the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns\n\tstretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne\n\tHouse.  A few outdoor servants watch its progress\n\tcuriously.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tThe silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain\n\tpudding.  Immediately, servants appear at every place and\n\twhip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have\n\tfinished or not.  Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the\n\troutine.  DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNER\n\t\tWe're expecting Brown this afternoon,\n\t\tma'am.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tWhom?\n\n\tA beat.  VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with\n\ther napkin and rises.  Everyone else rises too.  Suddenly,\n\tthe Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS\n\tALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA (CONT'D)\n\t\tThat's a very pretty shawl you are\n\t\twearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBut you are not eating enough.  One\n\t\tmust not let vanity overrule one's\n\t\tappetite.\n\n\t\t\t\tPRINCESS ALEXANDRA\n\t\tYes, ma'am.\n\n\tVICTORIA nods earnestly.  Lost to the effect her words have\n\thad, she marches out again.  Behind her, she leaves\n\tPRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in\n\tfront of all the others.  BERTIE takes her hand and\n\tsqueezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.\n\n\tEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY\n\n\tThe horse-carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance\n\tand the DRIVER opens the doors.\n\n\tJOHN BROWN pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks\n\tthe time.  His eyes narrow critically.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tI was due at a quarter past one.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tYou're late.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n\tA few minutes later, JOHN BROWN strides down the long\n\tcorridor with PONSONBY at his side.  Their journey takes\n\tthem down an endless series of corridors, past servants and\n\thouseholders hurrying about their duties.  The presence of\n\tthe dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed\n\tportraits and busts that crop up along the way.\n\n\tBROWN and PONSONBY could not be more contrasted.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\t\t(in low tones)\n\t\tHer Majesty's routine at Osborne House\n\t\tis not as you will remember it.  The\n\t\tHousehold remains in full mourning and\n\t\tno-one is permitted to raise their\n\t\tvoice under any circumstances\n\t\twhatsoever.  As for the Queen's\n\t\troutine, she breakfasts at nine\n\t\tthirty, lunches at two,takes tea at\n\t\tfive thirty and dinner at eight forty\n\t\tfive.  No one is allowed to leave the\n\t\tbuilding while the Queen is at home. \n\t\tOn the rare occasions when she is out,\n\t\tyou may ask permission to leave, but\n\t\tonly with my consent. \n\t\tYou're to be ready to walk the pony at\n\t\tany time after ten o'clock.  You'll\n\t\tclean her outdoor things and do any\n\t\todd jobs as and when she requires.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tHow will I know?\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\t\t(surprised to be interrupted)\n\t\tI'm sorry?\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tHow will I know what she requires?\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tYou'll be sent a message.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tWho'll bring it to me?\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tHer Highness' Equerry.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tI need a man who knows where I am.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tI'm sure it won't be difficult to find\n\t\tyou.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tThat's not good enough.\n\n\tA beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tThen we'll have to see what can be\n\t\tarranged.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tAye, do.\n\n\tPONSONBY stiffens.  A beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tThere is to be no communication with\n\t\tother members of the household on\n\t\tmatters concerning the court except\n\t\tthrough myself or one of the\n\t\tEquerries.  No plans must be altered\n\t\tunless you are given prior authority\n\t\tby myself or a senior member of the\n\t\thousehold.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tI came down at the Queen's request. \n\t\tI'll take my orders from her.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tIn matters concerning the Household, I\n\t\tact on her behalf.\n\n\tBROWN takes the measure of him.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tDo you?\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tYes.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI do.\n\n\tBROWN glances up the corridor.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tSo, is passing wind out of the\n\t\tquestion or do I need permission for\n\t\tthat?\n\n\tPONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard.  They\n\treach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the\n\tinterview.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tAs I am sure you remember from\n\t\tBalmoral, you do not talk while in Her\n\t\tMajesty's presence unless Her Majesty\n\t\taddresses you directly.\n\n\tBROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks.  After a\n\tmoment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tBROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops.  PONSONBY\n\twaits by the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY (O.S.)\n\t\tMr Brown, ma'am.\n\n\tVICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her\n\tnumerous red boxes.  She scribbles furiously at a letter,\n\tunderlining and accenting words as she goes.  Finally, LADY\n\tELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear. \n\tShe carries on working.\n\n\tBROWN has time to survey the room.  Dominating everything\n\tare the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince\n\tAlbert glimpsed in the corridor.\n\n\tFinally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward. \n\tHe steps up in front of the desk and waits.  VICTORIA looks\n\tup and BROWN bows deeply.\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\tShe stares at him for a long moment without apparently\n\tregistering who he is.  He towers over her, in bright\n\ttartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black\n\tand knotted with tension.\n\n\tFinally, she finds her voice.  She sounds nervous and edgy.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tMr Brown.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tMa'am.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tYou are here safely.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tAye, ma'am.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tYou are well?\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tI am.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tAnd the pony?\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tShe's well, too.\n\n\tVICTORIA blinks at the sight of him.  His presence is\n\tbringing him back.  A beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tYour family sent cards.  It was much\n\t\tappreciated.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tI'm glad of it.\n\n\tIn an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds\n\tthe same severe note as at lunch.  But BROWN, unlike\n\tothers, seems unaffected.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tMy husband was always very\n\t\tcomplimentary in speaking of you.  He\n\t\twould have approved, I am sure, of my\n\t\tcalling on you in this way.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI trust it does not inconvenience you\n\t\ttoo much.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tI've no family, ma'am, apart from my\n\t\tbrothers and sisters.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tYes.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tYou have a brother in service here, do\n\t\tyou not?\n\t\t\t(furrowing her brow)\n\t\tI forget his name.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tArchie.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tYes.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tThat will be company for you.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tYes, ma'am.\n\n\tSilence.  VICTORIA starts to tire.  She takes a sip of\n\twater and spills a little on herself.  Flustered, she\n\tsearches for a hanky but cannot find one.  LADY ELY hurries\n\tup with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off.  BROWN\n\twatches all of this with genuine concern.  When VICTORIA\n\tfinally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN (CONT'D)\n\t\tHonest to God, I never thought to see\n\t\tyou in such a state.  You must miss\n\t\thim dreadfully.\n\n\tVICTORIA stares back in stunned silence.  PONSONBY coughs\n\tinvoluntarily.  LADY ELY freezes.  A beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tYou do not - he ... get him out.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tGet him out.  Get him out!\n\n\tSuddenly, BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the\n\troom.  LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts\n\therself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY\n\n\tSome minutes later, BROWN is angrily unpacking a trunk. \n\tHis humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary\n\tferocity with which he slams down every object.\n\n\tHis younger brother, ARCHIE, sits on the bed.  He's in his\n\tearly thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same\n\tdistinctive kilt and tweed.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCHIE\n\t\t\t(telling it fast)\n\t\tSo the day they arrive, she greets the\n\t\tSultan and his family with barely a\n\t\tword and then retires to her chamber. \n\t\tThe Sultan, not used to State\n\t\tOccasions without a head of State, is\n\t\tstanding in the lobby waiting for\n\t\tsomeone to tell him what to do.  But\n\t\tthe court is under strict instructions\n\t\tnot to talk in the corridors so nobody\n\t\tspeaks to him, not a living soul, for\n\t\tthe whole afternoon.  So now it's\n\t\tdinner and everyone's standing round\n\t\tthe table -- still not a word --\n\t\twaiting for Her Majesty to arrive. \n\t\tOne hour goes by, two, the Sultan's\n\t\tgetting a wee bit peckish to say the\n\t\tleast.  So finally, his wee laddy\n\t\tbreaks for the cold meats and stuffs a\n\t\tslice in his mouth.  Well, the uproar\n\t\twhen she heard.  You'd have thought\n\t\tsomeone had stolen the crown jewels.\n\n\tBROWN stares back, still pissed off.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tSo?\n\n\t\t\t\tARCHIE\n\t\tSo, there are rules.  Things you do\n\t\tand things you don't do.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tI was just telling the woman how I\n\t\tfeel, for God's sake.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCHIE\n\t\tYou don't tell Her Majesty how you\n\t\tfeel.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tI speak as I find, Archie.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCHIE\n\t\tNot down south you don't.\n\n\tBROWN slams a drawer shut.  ARCHIE lets it go and watches\n\this brother.  A beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tARCHIE (CONT'D)\n\t\tSo what did Ponsonby do when she\n\t\tstarted shouting?\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tI think he nearly ruptured his truss.\n\n\tA beat, then both men burst out laughing.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, SERVANT'S HALL - DAY\n\n\tThe clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants\n\thurry about with plates, knives and forks, laying the Upper\n\tServant's huge table for dinner.

OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING\n\n\tThe next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a\n\tcorridor on her way into the dining room.  VICTORIA\n\tsuddenly stops and stares out of the windows.  Her\n\tentourage are several steps past her before they realize\n\twhat's happened and scurry back to take up their positions\n\tbehind.\n\n\tNow we see what has caught her attention.  BROWN is\n\tstanding in the courtyard below, by his pony.  She watches\n\thim for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.\n\n\tEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON\n\n\tSome hours later.  It is now raining.\n\n\tA gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage\n\tfrom their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES\n\tfrantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas.

OSBORNE HOUSE, COURTYARD - DAY\n\n\tPONSONBY stands close to BROWN, shouting in his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tI thought I made myself perfectly\n\t\tclear.  You do not leave your room\n\t\tuntil Her Majesty requests it.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\t\t(eyes straight ahead,\n\t\t\t shouting back)\n\t\tWell, you tell Her Majesty from me, if\n\t\ther husband was here now, he'd have\n\t\thad her out of that house and getting\n\t\tsome air in her.  What the hell's the\n\t\tpoint in me being here otherwise?!\n\n\tFrom the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words.  A\n\tbeat.

OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT\n\n\tThe clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER\n\tSERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS\n\tprepare to serve soup.\n\n\tARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle\n\tnext to an empty seat.  A moment later, BROWN strides in.\n\n\tBut instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he\n\tgoes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself\n\tdown.  Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room\n\tstops and stares at him in silence.  BROWN fixes them with\n\ta look.\n\n\tAn elderly butler steps into the room and stares in\n\tamazement at BROWN.  A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET,\n\thurries up to intercede.\n\n\t\t\t\tBERTIE'S VALET\n\t\tMr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits\n\t\tthere.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tNot now he doesn't.

BERTIE'S VALET stares\n\ticily at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tBERTIE'S VALET\n\t\tThe order of seating at the Upper\n\t\tServant's table is arranged personally\n\t\tby the Queen herself.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tThat's a tautology lad.\n\t\t\t(unable to stop himself\n\t\t\t seriously explaining it)\n\t\tIf you say the Queen arranges\n\t\tsomething, you've no need to say she's\n\t\tdone it personally.  That's\n\t\tunderstood.\n\n\tBut as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't.  He\n\tstares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of\n\tthe under servants, who rushes over.  There is a hurried\n\texchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out.\n\n\tUnperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a\n\tsubstantial draft of whiskey.  He turns to the pretty\n\tassistant dresser, sitting to his right.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN (CONT'D)\n\t\tAre you dresser to Her Majesty?\n\n\tShe blinks nervously at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tASSISTANT DRESSER\n\t\tAssistant, sir, yes.\n\n\tBROWN tucks into his soup.  Everyone watches and waits.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tWhat's your name?\n\n\t\t\t\tASSISTANT DRESSER\n\t\tMary Taylor, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tHave I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?\n\n\t\t\t\tASSISTANT DRESSER\n\t\tI hope to go up next year.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tYou wouldn't happen to know what the\n\t\tQueen's reading for recreation, would\n\t\tyou, Mary?\n\n\tThe assistant dresser thinks for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tASSISTANT DRESSER\n\t\tLord Tennyson, sir?\n\n\tBROWN nods.  All conversation stops as the under servant\n\tbursts back in.  She halts at the door, looking blankly\n\tfrom Bertie's valet to the elderly butler.  A beat.  The\n\told man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the\n\ttable.\n\n\tBROWN looks up from his soup.\n\n\t\t\t\tBROWN\n\t\tAm I the only one eating?\n\n\tWith a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.\n\n\tINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tA few days later.  A morning \"drawing room.\"  Standing\n\tround the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY\n\tCHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS\n\tALEXANDRA.  All are dressed against the icy wind that\n\twhistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits\n\tknitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat\n\tbuttoned up to the collar.  PONSONBY has stationed himself\n\topposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. \n\tHe runs through the daily itinerary.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tLord Clarendon arrives, by invitation,\n\t\tat eleven o'clock, followed at twelve\n\t\tby a picnic in the grounds to\n\t\tcelebrate Princess Alice's birthday. \n\t\tDispatches, as usual, at two.\n\t\t\t(finishes, then coughs)\n\t\tThe Chancellor writes to say that, by\n\t\thappy coincidence, he will be in Cowes\n\t\tfor the weekend.  He asks if Your\n\t\tMajesty might grant him an audience.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tHe thought, perhaps, Your Majesty\n\t\tmight wish to be informed of the\n\t\tlatest developments in government.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tNo.  I shall be out walking.\n\n\tA beat.  BERTIE watches closely now.  PONSONBY coughs\n\tagain, nervous.\n\n\t\t\t\tPONSONBY\n\t\tThen perhaps Your Majesty might\n\t\tconsider it opportune if the Prince of\n\t\tWales were to meet him on your behalf?\n\n\tVICTORIA stiffens.  She speaks without turning.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tOn no account.\n\n\tPONSONBY gives up.  Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up\n\tthe reins.\n\n\t\t\t\tBERTIE\n\t\tMama, I really do think it's time we\n\t\tmade ourselves a little more ...\n\t\tavailable.\n\n\tVICTORIA carries on knitting.\n\n\t\t\t\tBERTIE (CONT'D)\n\t\tI think we must accept our position in\n\t\tthe country is not entirely unrelated\n\t\tto the continued absence of the\n\t\tMonarchy from public life.\n\t\t\t(silence)\n\t\tI thought perhaps we might consider a\n\t\tsmall gesture of some kind?\n\n\tVICTORIA looks up sharply.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tGesture?\n\n\t\t\t\tBERTIE\n\t\tI thought, a dinner for our\n\t\tambassadors perhaps?\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\t\t(cutting in firmly)\n\t\tNo dinners, Bertie.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tWhy are you dressed for outdoors?\n\n\t\t\t\tBERTIE\n\t\tIt's so infernally cold in here.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tCold is good--\n\t\t\t(calling across)\n\t\tIs that not so, Dr. Jenner?!\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNER\n\t\tI'm sorry, ma'am?\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tCold is good!\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNER\n\t\tExcellent, ma'am, excellent.\n\t\t\t(trying his hand)\n\t\tBut perhaps if her Majesty were to\n\t\tconsider accompanying her new-found\n\t\tphysical vigor with the benefits of\n\t\tmental activity...\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\t\t(becoming very agitated)\n\t\tWhy am I being lectured in this way?!\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNER\n\t\tForgive me, Your Majesty.

Least of all my son.  It was his\n\t\tirresponsibility that drove my husband\n\t\tto his grave.\n\n\tAn appalled silence.  With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs\n\tthe shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation\n\tin another direction.\n\n\t\t\t\tBERTIE\n\t\tIf it is inconvenient to Her Majesty,\n\t\tthen perhaps she might consider\n\t\tallowing the Prince of Wales to host--\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tI do believe they send so many boxes\n\t\tto taunt me. \n\t\tDoctor Jenner writes to them to say\n\t\tthat my nerves are in an extremely\n\t\tfragile state and yet they continue to\n\t\thound me with box after box after box\n\t\tafter box after box!\n\n\tSilence.  VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out\n\tat the view.  Having recovered her composure, she turns to\n\taddress them all.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA (CONT'D)\n\t\tI wish to take the Princesses for a\n\t\tswim.\n\n\tFor a moment, nobody believes what they have heard.

PRIVATE BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY\n\n\tThe doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen\n\tVICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck\n\tinto the freezing sea.  As she does so, the doors of the\n\tother machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise\n\tfollow her in.  Dignity does not allow them to shout out,\n\tbut their expressions of constipated agony are a picture.\n\n\tVICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little\n\tcircle.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tDon't potter, children.

OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY\n\n\tHalf an hour later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY and\n\ttwo FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and\n\tonto her horse.

He dresses almost dandyishly but\n\tspeaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance\n\tand cheek that is his key.  To cheers from his back\n\tbenchers, he sits.\n\n\tAs he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the\n\tLiberal benches.  GLADSTONE is different in almost every\n\trespect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.

She cannot\n\tbring herself to look at him and so does not notice how\n\tcarefully he is watching her throughout the interview. \n\tThis is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles\n\tto be as honest as possible.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tMy husband tried always to make me\n\t\tthink more subtly.  Of course he\n\t\ttaught me so much and I can never\n\t\trepay my debt to him, or the love I\n\t\tfeel, even now.  But, in truth, I\n\t\tthink I am someone who can only feel\n\t\tthings while they are alive to me. \n\t\tFor that reason, I know I do not have\n\t\ta subtle mind.  I know that.  But I\n\t\twork hard and I try to do my duty.\n\t\t\t(she hesitates; she is\n\t\t\t struggling now)\n\t\tHowever, I have noticed of late that\n\t\tmy feelings of grief are not so strong\n\t\tand -- that I find myself leaning more\n\t\tupon the comfort of living friends.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tFriends close to me now.\n\n\tShe stops herself.

If the good Lord sees\n\t\tfit to bring one into contact with\n\t\tcongenial fellow beings, one should\n\t\tnot analyze one's reaction too deeply. \n\t\tTo allow oneself to be comforted by\n\t\tsomeone else need not imply any\n\t\tdisloyalty to the memory of the loved\n\t\tone.\n\n\tSilence.

BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY\n\n\tThe next day.\n\n\tQUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with\n\tgreat vim and vigor.  The tune is some quaint Scottish\n\tballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice,\n\talmost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE\n\tLEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand\n\tin a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. \n\tIgnoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a\n\tquizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated.\n\n\tDISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards\n\toff, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician\n\tto his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This\n\tman is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his\n\tsmiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she\n\tbelts, until her children are drowned out completely.\n\n\tAnd then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops\n\tplaying and launches into one of her tirades.  The\n\tHOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back,\n\tbut DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.\n\n\t\t\t\tVICTORIA\n\t\tHow dare the Irish break with the\n\t\tAnglicans? \n\t\tIf Albert were alive today he would\n\t\tnever allow the Crown to give up\n\t\tChurch patronage.  No, the Irish must\n\t\tbe told, very firmly, to stay exactly\n\t\twhere they are.  It is the thin edge\n\t\tof the wedge, Mr Disraeli.

You, I thought,\n\t\tunderstood a widow's grief.\n\n\t\t\t\tDISRAELI\n\t\tForgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for\n\t\tthe nation, only for myself.  As Prime\n\t\tMinister I confess I miss your\n\t\tpresence, but that is only an\n\t\texpression of my own selfish desires\n\t\tand I should not burden you with it.\n\n\tThe Household waits.

Satisfied that he has found his\n\tquarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen\n\tdismount as quietly as they can.\n\n\tAs he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his\n\tside.
