LORD WALTON, a very grand man, sits at the table head. To\nhis right sits his assistant, GARETH. All are deep in thought. LORD WALTON\nfidgets with a pencil on the table. He raises his head as though about to\nspeak. Everyone looks up expectantly. And... LORD WALTON goes back to\nfidgeting. So does everyone else.\n\n                                                                          CUT TO:\n\nCREDIT.

MR BEAN'S STREET.     DAY\n\nMr BEAN comes out of his house, ready to face the world-\n\nHe walks up the street, tutting slightly at     a 'NO PARKING' sign he passes.\nThe street is totally car-free except for a     very visible lime green mini. A\npoliceman strolls by and glances down at a     pair of legs sticking out from\nunder it, next to a toolbox. He moves on,      satisfied that someone is mending\ntheir car.\n\nBEAN approaches the car     and whips out the fake legs he left there. He then\nunlocks the big padlock     that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside,\nfiddles with something     else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening\nspeed with a smug look     on his face.\n\nThe Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits.\n\nBEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if\nit has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound\nfault.\n\nBEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen ~ he goes at them at quite a\nlick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps\nviolently.\n\nBEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the\nproblem. Instead of having a car radio, BEAN has an old record player\nstrapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune.\n\nOn he drives, through empty streets - then JOLT - he's reached the glorious\nfamiliarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful\ntraffic.\n\nHeels not happy. He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. He\ntakes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight-\nline-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. He 'S\n\nsatisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley. It is such a\nperfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls.\n\nBut at the end of      the alley, the traffic's just as bad.     BEAN    notices he's\noutside Harrods.       There's a tail-coated Security Guard at    the    'front door.\nBEAN watches him      stroll a bit down the street - and takes    his    chance. He\nturns and drives      straight through the double doors, into    the    store.\n\n                                                                                            2\n\n\nINT.    HARRODS.   DAY.\n\nBEAN and his car whizz through the ground floor, past perfume counters and\nleather glove racks.\n\nCUT TO a Security Guard. As       he passes one of the counters, BEAN's little car\njust shoots behind him. The       Guard continues through the Children's section\nthere are giant elephants and      teddies, children's size cars, then two huge\nplastic tractors - and then,      stock still, strangely in harmony actually, the\nLime Green Mini with BEAN in      it. The Guard walks straight past.\n\nThe moment he is gone, BEAN shoots off again - but, damn!, spies another Guard\nand is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed. The theme\nsong goes CRAZY as the record player jumps.\n\n                                                                                 CUT TO:\n\n6 people waiting at a gilded lift. They hear a strange sound, and turn to see\nwhat it is. In fact, it's coming from inside the lift. When the lift doors\nopen, out shoots the Mini through the double doors and back into the street.\n\n                                                                                        3\n\n\nEXT.    KNIGHTSBRIDGE.     DAY.\n\nOut in the street, BEAN is faced by an accident. There are flashing lights, a\ncrumpled car, suggestions of hurt passengers. BEAN looks concerned.\n\n                                                                                 CUT TO:\nEXT.    THE STRAND.     DAY.\n\nAn Ambulance roars through the traffic. It reaches its hospital, turns off,\nand there, right smack behind it is the Mini. Cut in to see BEAN, smiling\nbroadly. He whizzes into Trafalgar Square, maybe even across it, sending\npigeons and tourists flying, and parks directly outside the statuesque\nNational Gallery. Of course, there's not another car there. Just the Gallery\nand the mini.\n\n                                                                                 CUT TO:\n\nEXT.    NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY\n\nBEAN    gets out of the car, takes out his bag - thinks a little, opens it and\ntakes    out a \"Doctor on Call' sign. To re-enforce it, he puts a bone in the\nback    window and a skull of the front seat. Happy with the arrangement, he re-\nlocks    the padlock and sets off smiling up the big, stairs to work.\n\nAs he does so, pan up the building, and into the window of the room where that\nBoard meeting was taking place.\n\n                                                                       CUT TO:\nINT.

It's the mental strain he inflicts on us all.\n             How is Professor Bradbury\n\nA grand gentleman, MR MORRISON, pipes up.\n\n                                  I'm MORRISON\n             Heels got the feeling back in his fingers - but his hands are\n             still stapled together.\n\n                                  LORD WALTON\n             Mmmm, and how far are we with the computer, Hubert?\n\n\n                                                                             4\n\n\n                                     HUBERT\n               Timothy is loading the final catalogue data as we speak,\n               Milord. An awful thing to say, but when the program's up and\n               running our, Mr. Bean will become a little less than ....\n               useful?\n\nA glimmer of hope.\n\n\n\nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    PORTRAIT SECTION - DAY\n\nBEAN wanders past three or four portraits and mimics the characters in them.\nHe passes a guard.\n\n                                        GUARD\n                           (not looking up from his book)\n                     Morning, Bean.\n\nThe GUARD sighs with boredom. He gets this from BEAN every day. As Bean\nmoves on, he treads on the heel of a tourist's shoe. It comes off- BEAN moves\non blithely.\n\n                                                                       CUT TO:\n\nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CARTOON ROOM ENTRANCE - DAY\n\nBEAN is passing the very special room where Leonardo Da Vinci's cartoon, 'The\nVirgin and Child', hangs, preserved by a very dim artificial light. There are\nsilhouettes of a few tourists in the room reverently studying the work,\nlistening to a female GALLERY GUIDE.\n\nBEAN dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing brings out a\ncoin. The coin drops and rolls into the special room. BEAN follows it into\nthe darkness.\n\n                                   GALLERY GUIDE\n\n                                    (hushed)\n                   ... by Leonardo Da Vinci. As you can see, the special light\n                   in here goes some way to protect the drawing from\n                   photodisintegration caused by gamma ...\n\nThe camera stays outside the room with the picture in view. We hear the\nsqueak of a tiny door open, then a click. The room is suddenly flooded in\nblazing white light. The onlookers gasp in horror.\n\n                                                                               5\n\nBEAN re-emerges from the room with his precious coin. As an afterthought he\npops his hand round the doorway and turns off the light. He scuttles away.\nThe GALLERY GUIDE shakes her head in total exasperation.\n                                                                      CUT TO:\nINT. NATIONAL GALLERY.

NATIONAL GALLERY.    ELEVATOR - DAY\n\nBEAN stands in the elevator silently with four other       people. He gives himself\na long squirt of breathfreshener. Then offers it to        the others, who politely\nrefuse him. So he stands still again. Pause. BEAN          then smells something\nunpleasant. He leans and has a little sniff of the        person to his left. All\nright there. Then he sniffs to his right, and reels        at what he smells. He\nagain takes out the breath freshener, and forces it       upon VINCENT, an elderly\ngentleman, who is mortified.\n\nAt this moment the elevator stops - BEAN and VINCENT get out and the camera\nfollows VINCENT as he heads for the boardroom door and enters. He is another\ntrustee. This dialogue is heard from behind the closed door.\n\n                                    VINCENT\n                   I'm sorry I'm late.\n\n                                       GARETH\n\n                   Why can't we just give him the boot for crying out loud?!\n\n                                                                               6\n\n                                    VINCENT\n                   Steady on, old man.

NATIONAL GALLERY.    CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nBEAN, with cup of tea, walks along a corridor. He can't not interfere for\ntidiness sake. One empty room he switches off the light. Another he shuts\nthe door.\n\nHe passes a computer room, with an open door where a big man is busily typing\nin a programme - BEAN looks at him snootily and heads on.\n\nHe approaches the door to his office. A sign reads: 'STORAGE & CATALOGUE'.\nThere is a huge padlock on the door. BEAN takes out a big key and enters his\ndomain.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    STORAGE OFFICE - DAY.\n\nBEAN enters. He's been here for years and made it his own. It's an odd\nlittle world. There's a framed picture of Shirley Bassey on his desk and\nAirfix planes hang from the ceiling. Also a large cosy armchair and a T.V.\n\nA pleasant Man in a suit, around 40, breezes in.\n\n                                    SUIT MAN\n             Ah Bean, I'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht.    Still Life.\n             Circa 1670. Can do?\n\nBEAN nods. This is what BEAN likes to do best. The camera follows as he\nturns sees the extraordinary sight behind him...\n\nHis office is just a tiny    corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet\nhigh and long, the walls    completely full of rack after rack of stored\npaintings. At the end of     the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts,\nmodern abstracts, men on    horses, classical maidens, Rodins, the lot. It's\nlike the giant storehouse    at the end of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\n                                                                                7\n\nBEAN sets off into it in his own eccentric way. He knows exactly where heels\ngoing. He climbs a ladder, like you find in a library - then pushes himself\noff, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners.\n\nHe has now reached the sculpture area, but    the painting heels looking for is\non the other side. He crosses the room by     using the sculptures as a kind of\nartistic obstacle course. In front of him     is the Burghers of Calais, a Rodin\nstatue of 5 prisoners in chains. He simply     walks across their 5 heads, like\nstones in a stream.\n\nHe then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as    a slide   and at the\nend of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern    thing.    He then\nbegins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the    mouths   as\nfootholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty    eyes as   finger\nholes.\n\nAfter a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he\nwalks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic\nsculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina, one step on to\nthe bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse,\nthree steps and now he's on the other side of the hall.\n\nHe then triumphantly pulls out a painting.     It's the one!,\n\n                                     SUIT MAN\n              What would we do without you!

(To the room) One final thing. Once again we have been\n              invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to second\n              one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly\n              modest collection - but it does include the most famous American\n              painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'. Any thoughts?\n\nCut to the trustees - they shake their heads and wrinkle, their noses, not\nvery interested. A 106 year old SIR RUPERT puts up his hand.\n\n                                   LORD WALTON\n              Yes. Sir Rupert.

DAY\n\nBEAN    walks along    the same corridor as before. Turns off another light. Then\ncomes    to the room    where he saw the Programmer. The computer, showing a Van\nGogh    portrait, is    on and no-one's there. BEAN, who hates wasted electricity,\ngoes    in to switch    it off.\n\nWe see the Van Gogh change to a pictorial representation of the Storage room -\nwith an arrow pointing to where the Van Gogh is located. BEAN is clearly\ngoing to be replaced by this programme. Or not ... BEAN searches for the\nplug, but it's under acres of desk - so he simply pulls a cable out of the\nback the computer. The entire system clicks off. At which moment the\nProgrammer comes back in.\n\n                                       PROGRAMMER\n                       What's happening here?\n\n                                            BEAN\n                       Ahm...\n\nWith a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement\nat the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess. And\na disastrous one. There is a ugly electrical fizzle. The screens come on\nwhite, then pop out completely.\n\n                                            BEAN\n                       Ah.... Ahm....\n\nBEAN realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable\ninto another circuit. The Van Gogh appears happily on the screen. BEAN and\nPROGRAMMER both give out a sigh of relief. BEAN smiles and leaves quickly.\nBut a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the Van Gogh slides\ndown the screen like a water-colour in the rain. The PROG difficult to\nbreathe.\n\n                                                                                          10\n\n                                                                                  CUT TO:\n INT.

Please remember the\n\n             Americans are looking for something quite high powered.     A\n             doctorate preferably...\n\nThere is a knock at the door. BEAN enters. LORD WALTON smiles. The rest of\nthe faces in the room are looking dangerously close to smug. BEAN is very\nnervous indeed.\n\n                                  LORD WALTON\n                                   (gravely)\n             Ah, Mr. Bean. Please take a seat for a moment.      I have some news\n             which will not, I'm afraid...\n\nThe phone rings. LORD WALTON answers. BEAN sits next to VINCENT and sniffs\nat him. VINCENT's breath hasn't improved.\n\n                                      LORD WALTON\n                                     (into phone)\n             Yes?     Put him on... Timothy. The computer ... Yes... When? How?\n             All    of it? Absolutely all of it? Did you back it up? How long\n             will    it ... ? Another six months. Fair enough. Come up here\n             will    you, dear boy.\n\nHe slowly hangs up. Everyone has got the gist of what has just occurred with\nthe new computer- The energy drains from them all as they contemplate another\nsix months with BEAN still on the staff. LORD WALTON coughs politely.\n\n                                  LORD WALTON\n             As I was saying, gentlemen. The Grierson Gallery. South\n             California. Great opportunity. Thousands-of miles-away though it\n             is. Doctorate or ( IMPISHLY ) no doctorate, perhaps\n\nAll get the message at the same moment and hurriedly scribble on their voting\nslips. The slips get handed down the line to LORD WALTON. We see that every\nsingle slip has 'BEAN' on it.\n\n                                     LORD WALTON\n             Mr. Bean.     Wonderful news.

The fat, bespectacled,\nPROGRAMMER puts his head round it.\n\n                                    LORD WALTON\n                                     (beaming)\n             Ah, Timothy.    You're sacked.\n\n                                                                             CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nBEAN rounds a corner and walks     towards us, imitating a bowlegged cowboy. The\nTheme from Bonanza plays. He      whips out his pair of imaginary six shooters,\nspins them on his fingers and     returns them to-their imaginary holsters, making\ngun sound effects. He's very      happy.-He passes the Security Guard - he draws\nhis gun on him - zero reaction     the Guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns.\n\nBEAN heads on through the gallery merrily - but suddenly, his good mood is\n\nbroken, when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition, called The\nUltra-Human Form. This worries him - and we soon see why - BEAN heads in to\nthe room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes, and the 3 girls are\nhaving a good giggle.\n\nBEAN quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the painting\nthey're inspecting.\n\nTwo girls then move on to the next painting - which unfortunately also has\nbreasts. BEAN stretches and just manages to cover them with his other hand.\n\nNow the third girl    heads on, so BEAN can drop the hand on the first painting -\nbut now has to try    to cover the breasts on the third painting, which is a real\nlong stretch away.     He can't quite make it, so he takes off his shoes, which\ngives him the extra    3 inches. Again, safe. Just.\n\nNow, all three girls leave the paintings - but, to BEAN's chagrin, head over\nto a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room. It's like the 3\nGraces, 3 naked women back to back. BEAN thinks fast. He quickly whips off\nhis\n\n                                                                              12\n\nBelt and rushes over to the statue, where he succeeds in looping it round to\ncover all six nipples.\n\nUnfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to the other\nside of the gallery. To BEAN's horror. Because at that moment we reveal what\nis on the other side of the room. A epic painting in the style of the others\n- with literally 40 graphically naked people.\n\nBEAN sprints across the room, stands on a chair, and desperately tries to\ncover a particularly lurid example of a gentleman's manhood.\n\nAt which    moment the teacher of the party and 40 other schoolgirls appear and\nscream in    chorus. BEAN thinks that it is the painting that has caused offence\nand is in    outraged agreement with them. He turns. Cut wide to reveal that\nthey are    screaming because he's beltless\ntrousers    have fallen down.\n                                                                          CUT TO:\n\nEXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.     AMERICA - DAY.\n\n8.30 am California time. A modern building with plenty of glass. Large,\nmodern sculptures are spotted around its grounds, including a dramatic one of\ntwo huge old cars, head down in the ground, backs protruding into the air.\n\nTHOMAS GRIERSON, owner of the gallery, wearing a slick expensive suit, walks\nwith DAVE LEARY and BERNIE, both in casual jackets and ties. GRIERSON is a\nvain, slightly pedantic and pompous man - maybe short - always just trying to\nshow he's Boss. The three are strolling towards the main entrance. Huge\nsign: 'THE GRIERSON GALLERY' with a silhouette of Whistler's Mother taken from\nthe painting, as an incorporated logo.\n\n                                      GRIERSON\n               Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in\n               the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less.\n\n                                       BERNIE\n               Great news.\n\nBERNIE is smooth and smiley. DAVID LEARY, Vice President, is a very pleasant,\nbut slightly worried man, knocking on 40. Too nice for his own good. The\nthree pass a lone MIME ARTIST wearing a cheap vac-form PRESIDENT CLINTON face\nmask. David can't help being just a little nice to him and finds himself left\nbehind. He scampers to catch up.\n\n                                                                                   9\nFirst, catching under the handle - then the couch, then\n\nFour other chairs - and finally the deep freeze.        No-one's going to get in\nthrough that door.\n\nBACK IN THE    HALL BEAN pushes the string    back inside the    letter box and slaps\nhis hand in    satisfaction. He locks the     door's enormous    padlock, looks about\ncarefully to    make sure no one's around,    and then hides    the key under a garden\ngnome on the    floor, standing amongst a    row of pathetic    pot plants.\n\n                                                            MIX THROUGH TO:\nINT.    AIRPORT.   RECEPTION DESK.   NIGHT\n\nThe lady checking in BEAN looks puzzled as she holds his passport. So he\npulls the shockingly stupid face. 0h yes, she sees, that's the guy in the\npicture. She hands him his ticket.\n\n                                   CHECK-IN LADY\n                Here we go, sir. You've been moved to l st. class. Apparently\n                your friends at the Gallery were so delighted that you're\n                finally on your way.\n\n BEAN is very touched.\n\n                                                                               CUT TO:\n\n INT.    AIRPORT LOUNGE - NIGHT\n\n BEAN enters the first class lounge. It's fairly empty, but BEAN still\n squeezes himself between an old lady drinking a cup of tea, and a very grand\n looking American military man in a business suit.\n\n The Grand Man lights up a cigar. This doesn't please Mr \"No Smoking BEAN.\n First, he waves the smoke away, in small, then big, then huge wafting\n motions. Then he tries, miming, to cut it up into segments and move them\n aside. The man pays no attention at all.\n\n BEAN puts a plastic mug over his face, like a gas mask and breathes heavily.\n The man looks at him - but doesn't give a damn\n\n BEAN now takes a paper bag - catches some of the smoke, and take it over and\n empties it into the dust bin.\n\n The Grand Man goes on smoking stubbornly.        He then sees a magazine rack and\n leaves his cigar as he goes to get one.\n\n                                                                                       13\n\n                                        DAVID\n\n               Sounds like a real coup, sir... getting this Doctor of ...\n\n\n                                      GRIERSON\n\n            Various things. Thank you. However, as you know, this is not an\n            inexpensive venture, and, financially speaking, we're in very\n            serious crap right now.\n\n He can't quite hide his tackiness.) DAVID holds the door for GRIERSON - then\n sees an old woman coming towards him. He waits for her to go through, and\n due to his sweetness, is again left behind. He rushes to catch up.\n\nThey are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop. DAVID exchanges\nsmiles with the cashier, ANNIE. Very bubbly, not very bright. The shop is\nfull of Whistler's Mother memorabilia - posters, cards, porcelain statuettes.\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n            So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your\n            home instead of some expensive hotel.\n\n                                     BERNIE\n            Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room.   Period.\n\n                                        GRIERSON\n            David?\n\n                                      DAVID\n            Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really\n            like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't\n            really er ...\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n            I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate\n            attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial\n            LOSS ...\n\n                                      DAVID\n              on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my\n              family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course\n              it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due?\n\nGRIERSON hands DAVID a piece of paper.\n\n                                      GRIERSON\n              Tomorrow.   You have a problem with that?\n\nPAUSE\n\n                                       DAVID\n              No. Perfect.   Looking forward to it.\n                                                                        CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.    LONDON . PHOTO BOOTH.    DAY.\n\nThe camera faces Mr BEAN sitting in a Photo booth. His face is totally\nimpassive for 1, 2, then 3 flashes. And then, just before the 4th flash, he\npulls the biggest, maddest face you've ever seen. Flash! He gives a little\n\nSatisfied giggle.\n\n                                                                        CUT TO:\n\n\n EXT.    THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY\n\n 7 p.m. California time. A pleasant suburban house. DAVID's car pulls into\n the drive. JENNIFER, his slightly Gothic 16 year old daughter, is kissing\n BRAD, her scruffy boyfriend. He sits astride a motor scooter. He has a\n bum-fluff moustache.\n\n DAVID gets out of his car and approaches them.\n\n\n                                   DAVID\n            Hi, Jennifer. How was school? (she doesn't break the kiss with\n            Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some\n            more.\n\n The two continue kissing as DAVID moves on. He's just about to head for the\n house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb. DAVID's wife, ALISON,\n has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss, CHARLES. They are\n laughing in the car as DAVID walks up.\n\n                                                                               15\n\nHe is slightly disturbed to see ALISON kiss CHARLES on the cheek before\ngetting out with her port folio. CHARLES smiles pleasantly on seeing DAVID.\n\n                                      CHARLES\n            Hello, David.\n\n                                    DAVID\n            Hi, Charles.

We've got a heavy load on at present.     How about you,\n            gallery going well?\n\n                                    DAVID\n            Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I\n            think it ....\n\n                                    ALISON\n            Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.\n\nAlison is the same age as DAVID, but seems to have lasted the course better -\nshe's confident, in good shape. The atmosphere is awkward. JENNIFER screams\nout. Her 8 year old brother, KEVIN has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed\nher and BRAD. ALISON goes over to sort them out.\n\n                                     ALISON\n            Kevin!   You stop that right now!\n\n                                      CHARLES\n            Great kids.     Good looking too.\n\n                                      DAVID\n            You think so?    Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know... okay,\n            looks-wise.\n\n                                      CHARLES\n\n            Take after their mother, huh?\n\n                                       DAVID\n            Ah ... absolutely.\n\nDAVID is not very happy here.\n\n                                                                               16\n\n                                                                          CUT TO:\n INT.

This weekend, why don't we just get\n            into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel. Like before\n            the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another Bambi.\n\nShe reaches across and picks up a little ceramic Bambi on a table next to the\ncouch.\n\n                                    ALISON\n            Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin\n\n                                    DAVID\n            Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's\n            coming to work at the Gallery, from England...\n\n                                       ALISON\n                                  (SUSPICIOUSLY)\n                                      Yeeees?\n\n                                    DAVID\n            And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a\n            while.\n\n                                      ALISON\n            There aren't hotels?\n\n                                    DAVID\n            Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for\n            him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all\n            that stuff.\n\n                                       ALISON\n                                    (POINTEDLY)\n            And what did you say?\n\n                                    DAVID\n            I said I'd check with you.\n\nShe looks at him piercingly.

A black London taxi is parked outside a terraced house\nwith its motor idling. Its driver looks fed up waiting. BEAN appears at a\ndownstairs window, motioning to his watch that he will not be long.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\nINT.   MR.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - DAY\n\nMR. BEAN is ready to leave his room.       Battered old\n\nsuitcase in hand, he checks the room from the doorway.\n\nEvery conceivable thing that can be opened - cupboards,\n\ndrawers, fridge -sports an oversized padlock.    Even\n\nBean's old G.P.O. phone has one on its dial.\n\nBEAN looks across to his TEDDY, who is lounging on a miniature chair, inside\nan up-sided cardboard box. The box is sits on an armchair. A hand-written\nsign, taped to its roof reads: 'TEDDY HOTEL' followed by three stars.\n                                                                            19\n\nA smaller sign informs us that the hotel is: 'FULL'. BEAN is just about to\nleave but stops to consider. Taking a felt tipped pen, he adds two more stars\non the hotel hoarding, as a treat.\n\nHe then, slightly, incomprehensibly, begins to tie string it around various\nobjects in the flat. The fridge - the corner of a chair, a couch leg.\n\n                                                                        CUT TO:\n\nINT.   MR.

He now turns his attention to the pieces of string\nhanging out the letter box in his door. Grabbing the bunch of them, he pulls.\n\nCUT TO back inside the flat. we now understand the string - as all the\nfurniture starts to move across the flat.

He takes the cigar - and quickly dunks it in the old woman's\ncup of tea.\n\nHe sits there, guiltlessly, as the Grand Man returns. Simultaneously, the man\ntries to suck the wet cigar, and the Old woman drinks the disgusting tea. A\nhorrid experience for both.\n\n                                                                        CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   AEROPLANE - DAY.\n\nBoarding time. BEAN enters the plane and turns    right, into the body of the\nplane. After walking right down the plane, he    is directed by a hostess back\nup to first. As he walks back, we notice the'    ridiculous contrast, from\ntotally cramped accommodation with hundreds of   children and muzak, to the\nelegance, and space of First class.\n\nBEAN couldn't be more thrilled.    There follows a sequence of short moments\nfrom this nightmare flight.\n\n1/ The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her ,luggage.    A hostess\nslides it into the compartment above her head.\n\n                                      OLD LADY\n               Be careful.   It's for my Grand-daughter.\n\nThe next instant BEAN comes up with his case. He opens the     same locker, and\ntries to fit his case in. Doesn't quite go - so he pushes     it violently. We\nhear crunching cracking sounds. Finally, it's almost there     - BEAN slams the\nlocker door. One final definitive, though muffled, smash.      The OLD LADY looks\nat BEAN suspiciously.\n\n2/ BEAN sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour? The Grand Man,\nwhose name is REYNOLDS. BEAN smiles merrily. The affection is not mutual.\n\nChampagne comes    round instantly. BEAN takes it, along with a small bowl of\nnuts, and clinks    glasses with his unsmiling partner. BEAN tries to impress\nhim by throwing    nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well\npractised art).     No response.\n\nBEAN then switches on the noisy overhead air blower. Then can't turn it down\nagain. It's very stuck. He manages however to push it away from his face -\nstraight into REYNOLDS' . REYNOLDS looks annoyed, BEAN guiltless.\n\n                                                                                 21\n\nThen 'BEAN has an idea. He takes a tissue out of his pocket, puts in his\nmouth, chews it into a spitball\n\nAnd rams it into the blower. Both of them are relieved. REYNOLDS picks up\nhis champagne to have his first proper sip. And whapp! The spitball, under\nhigh pressure, shoots\n\ninto it, sending champagne spraying all over REYNOLDS.     Not a good start.\n\n\n3/--BEAN is reading the in-flight magazine. There's an annoying sound. He\nlooks sideways - it is the headphones of the YOUNG BOY in the seat across the\naisle. He's fallen asleep with his headphones on. BEAN looks annoyed. Then\nsuddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he\ncarries. He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on purpose\nsimply cuts the wire of the boy's headset. That's better.\n\n4/ Night. Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool of\nlight. It's Mr BEAN still up, reading.\n\nBut even he is   wilting. His eyes close, and his body starts to waver towards\nsleep. Next to    him, REYNOLDS is in a total lying position - and\nunfortunately,   as BEAN slowly tips over, his mouth comes into direct contact\nwith REYNOLDS'   flies.\n\nFrom across the compartment, a hostess sees what's happening. She's shocked,\ncomes over and taps BEAN on the ,,shoulder. He shoots up, and nearly\nstrangles her in shock. She calms him down, shows him how to put his chair\nback - and leaves him to sleep. CUT ON....\n\n5/ REYNOLDS still asleep. With BEAN asleep completely on top of him.\nCompletely. His hand is spread on REYNOLDS' face. REYNOLDS' eyes open.         He\nsees what's happened. His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess.\n\n6/ Morning has broken. REYNOLDS is still trying to sleep - BEAN is wide\nawake. The Hostess approaches, and the MOTHER of the YOUNG BOY says her son\nisn't very well.\n\nBEAN decides to cheer him up. He mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel\nmore ill. Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of\npaper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them.\n\nHe then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his trick of\nthrowing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth. The boy is too ill\nto be impressed.\n\nBEAN tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy\nand then a tough American Cop. Nothing. Then he has an extremely fun idea.\nHe empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them.\n\n                                                                                22\n\nHe then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake REYNOLDS, when\nhe sees it's got a hole in it. No fun.\n\nMeanwhile, the Boy has taken out his sick-bag. BEAN is delighted - yes,\nthat's perfect. He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless\nbag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag. BEAN turns, grabs the\nbag from him - blows into it, puts it right into REYNOLDS' face at arms\nlength, and smacks his hands together. CUT at just the right moment.\n\n                                                                        CUT TO:\n\nINT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.     ARRIVALS - NIGHT\n\nThe traditional exit area. A random bunch of people are waiting - relatives,\nlimousine drivers - and, rather strangely, three 30 year old women dressed in\ncurly red wigs from the musical, 'Annie'.\n\nThe LEARYS are at the barrier. KEVIN has a cardboard sign with 'MR. BEAN'\nwritten on it. People are streaming out of the Arrivals gate. ALISON is not\nhappy. Actually no one is. JENNIFER looks particularly fed up.\n\n                                        DAVID\n\n             For all you know, he may be a very attractive young man.\n\n                                    JENNIFER\n             Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.

No-one's\n             asking you to go to bed with him.\n\nJENNIFER glares at him.

REYNOLDS strides ahead of him, a huge wet patch in a\nsemi-circle around his neck. BEAN comes to a moving walkways. He steps on to\nit sheepishly, thinking it's very daring and brave, gripping the handrail as\nthough he was travelling at 100 mph.\n\nBut soon he gains greater confidence. He stands up straight, both hands off\nthe rail. There are a couple of COPS leaning against a wall, chatting. BEAN\nnotices their guns. Slipping into role-play mode, he reaches into his breast\npocket, ready to bring out his imaginary shooter ... The last security guard\nhe tried this with just yawned ~ so BEAN thinks it's safe. But this time, the\nCOPS turn and stare at him tensely..\n\nFlustered by their interest in him, BEAN needs to get away. He turns,        but\nfinds that he is walking in the opposite direction, on the spot. The        COPS\nread this as suspicious behaviour and move towards him suspiciously.        BEAN\nturns to gets himself going in the right direction. The COPS follow.         BEAN\nruns. The COPS give chase.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\n                                                                                    24\n\nINT.

But you, you're a great listener,\n             ya know that?\n\nBEAN smiles politely. Taxi drives away. BEAN walks up to' the front porch,\nchecks the house number on his piece of paper and presses the doorbell. No\nanswer. Presses again. Still no answer ... Now where have they hidden the\nkey. He inspects things carefully.\n\nThe camera sees what he sees ... the     doormat, the flowerpot, the window-ledge\n... and then he spots a little stone     frog. BEAN smiles. Key hiding is\nsomething he knows about - and people     are pathetically obvious about it. BEAN\npicks up the FROG to reveal the front     door key. It glints in the porch-light.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.     HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nBEAN lets himself in.

Just as\nthe alarm goes off, for the splittest of a secondette, he turns the key in its\nslot ... and is safe.\n\nBEAN finds the switch and turns on the hall light. He switches it off again\n... then on. Then rapidly clicks it on and off repeatedly.Fun.\n\n                                                                                CUT TO:\n\nEXT.

He opens\nthe refrigerator and he studies the food on offer. Nothing he fancies ...\nthen BINGO!\n\nHe sees a little plate of 3 strawberries. He eats     one, then two, then pops\nthe third into his mouth. It tastes a bit off, so     he takes it out of his\nmouth, puts it back on the plate, closes the fridge    door, and exits ... just\nas DAVID comes out of the pantry. Close on BEAN's     hand as it comes round the\ndoor frame and turns off the light. DAVID, on the     move, stubs his toe on a\n\nchair. He groans in pain, limps to the fridge.        He spots the lone, already\nsucked strawberry and pops it into his mouth.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\nINT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.

He has\nforgotten to   turn off the brush and so it vibrates off    the sink and lands in\nthe toilet.    Bean fishes it out and places it back on    the shelf where he found\nit.

Very serious ... most of the time these days.\n\n                                    ALISON\n            Now what does that mean? My daughter wakes up with a strange man\n            in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing? (looks at his\n            tie) That tie's God-awful. Why do you wear it?\n\nDAVID is thrown.   He looks down at his tie.   JENNIFER looks grumpy.   KEVIN is\neating happily.\n\n                                                                               35\n\nBEAN enters, dressed, carrying a plastic carrier bag.    He acknowledges the\nfamily with a grunt and a smile.\n\n                                     DAVID\n            Ah, Mr Bean ...\n\n                                     BEAN\n            Excuse me.\n\n He moves to the phone, checks his watch and dials quickly.\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\n\n\n INT.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - ENGLAND - NIGHT\n\n The ancient G.P.O. phone starts to ring on a small table. (The following\n takes place in a matter of seconds).\n\n On the table are two, large, shiny, hard backed books, wedged up    at one end\n and sloping away at right angles to one another. Each book has a     pair of\n rulers set, parallel to one another, in Play-Doh. They each form     a canal.\n Between one pair of rulers sits a small box of salt. Between the    other pair\n is a miniature bust of BEETHOVEN. As the phone continues to ring     and\n vibrate the table, these items judder along the canal, an inch at    a time.\n\n The box of salt teaches the bottom of the book and topples over the edge of\n the table. ( The BEETHOVEN bust' teeters on the edge of its book). The salt\n lands in a plastic funnel, taped to the top of a bamboo stick. The bottom\n of the stick sits on the BBC 2 button of a T.V. remote control. Close-up of\n its infrared L.E.D. as it flashes once. The phone stops ringing.\n\n CUT TO: the T.V. comes on at the start of a documentary about grizzly bears.\n                                             A voice-over begins a narration.\n\n CUT TO: close on TEDDY sitting in his cardboard box hotel.    Flickering light\n\n from the T.V. plays on his face.\n\n                                                                              CUT TO:\n INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    KITCHEN - DAY\n\n Bean hangs up happily, then approaches the toaster, stuffs a pair of wet\n socks into it and pulls down the start lever. Satisfied, he now turns to\n the family.\n\n                                         BEAN\n               Now - can I help?\n\n  They just stare, dumb-founded.\n\n                                                                                      36\n\n\n                                                                              CUT TO:\n\n EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY\n\n DAVID and BEAN arrive at the car and get in.          DAVID heads out of the drive\n at a reasonable speed.\n\n BEAN suddenly yanks on the hand-brake. DAVID's head hits the windshield\n with a sickening thud. BEAN reaches for and fastens his seat belt. He\n looks to DAVID. DAVID gives BEAN a pained look. What planet does he come\n from? He fastens his own seat belt while BEAN wonders why it's all taking\n so long.\n\n                                                                              CUT TO:\n\n EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      CAR PARKING - DAY\n\n It's a rather fancy building. Like a little Guggenheim DAVID parks by a\n large, expensive, looking car. BEAN opens his door and it bangs-hard\n against the pristine body work.\n\n                                                                              CUT TO:\n\n\n INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      RECEPTION AREA - DAY\n\n As BEAN and DAVID enter through the swing doors they meet ANNIE, the very\n bubbly girl in charge of entrance tickets at the reception cum shop counter.\n\n                                         ANNIE\n               Two dollars please.\n\n                                         DAVID\n               Annie, it's me.\n\n                                       ANNIE\n               Oh, right, yeah. (to Bean) two dollars please.\n\n                                         DAVID\n               No, Annie, no.    This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with\n               us.\n\nBEAN frowns.    That word 'doctor'.\n\n                                                                           37\n\n\n                                    ANNIE\n            Oh, great. Usually we charge people two dollars to come in- but\n            for people who work here, that would be 730 dollars a year, which\n            is like, a lot of money, so we kinda like let them off. Hi.\n\nBEAN smiles at her.\n\n                                    ANNIE\n            He doesn't like to say much does he?\n\n                                    DAVID\n            Right first time.\n\n                             ANNIE\n            I can understand THAT. Neither do I.\n\nAs BEAN and DAVID move on, BEAN gives ANNIE a 1ittle wave. She waves sweetly\nback. She cocks her head to one side and watches him go. She likes Mr. BEAN a\nlot.\n\n                                                                      CUT TO:\n\nINT. GRIERSON GALLERY. GROUND FLOOR- DAY\n\nBEAN and DAVID arrive In the ground floor gallery. A few visitors are viewing\nthe paintings. The acknowledge ELMER, the huge, ex-army, Security Man, sitting\non a small chair by a wall, reading a newspaper. The pass two oldish ladies\ninspecting a painting\n\n                                    DAVID\n            You'll notice, our clientele is not totally young. I sometimes\n            worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep\n            aesthetic level.\n\n\nStay with the ladies as DAVID and BEAN head on.\n\n                                 OLD LADY 1\n            What do you think?\n\n                                  OLD LADY 2\n            0h yes - lovely - very nice.\n\n                                  OLD LADY 1\n               And what colour would you use for the curtains?\n\n                                                                           38\n\n                                  OLD LADY 2\n            Well, I thought the sort of blue in this one. (she points to a\n            gorgeous blue Matisse) And I thought the curtains in the bathroom\n            would be nice in this yellow ....\n\nAnd-they head on to a Van Gogh with a nice yellow in it.\n\nBEAN stops to admire a painting. It is Pre-Raphaelite in style, depicting a\nwoman reclined on a bed in a castle chamber. She is wearing a chastity belt\nfastened with a small padlock, her breasts are concealed under a draped flag.\n\nIt is a tasteful and romantic picture.\n\n                                        DAVID\n              Beautiful.    'HIS MISTRESS' by John Everett Millais, 1829 to 96.\n              Know it?\n\nBEAN shakes his head. It's the padlock he's interested in he points at it and\nsmiles. ANNIE walks up.\n\n                                        ANNIE\n              Excuse me.    Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you\n              upstairs.\n\n                                        DAVID\n              Thanks, Annie.\n\nANNIE walks off back the way she came, looking at BEAN approvingly over her\nshoulder.\n\n                                        DAVID\n              Better go.    Grierson hates people being late.\n\n                                        BEAN\n              Yes.   Ahm... think I'11 ...\n\nHe gestures that held like to tidy up a little. Brush his hair, etc. BEAN\nwaddles off after ANNIE clearly in need of relief. DAVID watches him go.\n\n                                        DAVID\n              Why me?\n\n                                                                             CUT TO:\n\nINT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY.\n\nBEAN is catching up with ANNIE. She notices him following and coyly smiles to\nherself. She stops, turns round and grins. She thinks he has come to say\nsomething to her.\n\n                                                                                  39\n\nBEAN stops dead in front of her - then turns sharp left into the men's\nwashroom. ANNIE's smile fades.\n\n\n                                                                             CUT TO:\n\nINT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   WASH ROOM - DAY\n\nBEAN    comes out of a booth. He tidies his hair and tie in a mirror. He pushes\ndown    the pressurised tap to wash his hands. It splashes terribly. The whole\nfront    of his trousers are soaked. The last thing you want when about to meet\nyour    new boss. Damn!\n\nThere now follow a quick, complicated piece of business.\n\n1/ BEAN spots a paper-towel dispenser. He turns towards it at just the moment\na man exits from a booth - BEAN turns back to the sink to hide his trousers,\nas the man swiftly does his hands, goes to the paper dispenser, and takes the\nlast towel. Damn again.\n\n2/ BEAN    now puts    his hope in a rolling    towel. But it's rather high. He has\nto jump    to try to    reach the trouser.     At which point Another Man enters.\nJumping    BEAN has    been caught in a very    weird position. He pretends he has\n.chosen    the Men's    Room as the place to    do his rather energetic exercise\nroutine.\n\n3/ As the man leaves, he then tries to blow the patch dry with his mouth.\nAnother Man enters. Again, BEAN is 1 compromised - pretends it's even more\nexercises. That man also enters a booth.\n\n4/ BEAN suddenly notices the hand drying machine! He turns it on. A healthy\nblast of warm air. Annoyingly, it's also rather too high. He tries jumping\nand bouncing to get his waist to the right height. It's not going to work.\nBrainwave! He climbs up on two sinks. Now the drier is blowing in exactly\nthe right place. BEAN sways to let the air cover the whole area. It's\nworking excellently.\n\n5/ At which moment, one of the men exits from         a booth and sees him in the\nmirror. BEAN is in an immensely compromising          sex-with-machine position. He\npretends he's there to change the light bulb         above, which he takes out calmly\nand polishes. The man leaves, BEAN smiles.           But as he exits, BEAN's face\ntransforms - he's totally scalded his fingers         on the scorching bulb.\n\n                                                                                   40\n\n\n6/ BEAN rushes to the sink, puts his fingers under the tap, pushes on the\nwater - and soaks himself all over again. At which moment, DAVID enters,\nexasperated.\n\n                                          DAVID\n                Come on!     Let's go!\n\n BEAN exits uneasily hunched to hide his wet patch.          They enter the corridor,\n and he spots a newspaper.\n\n                                                                              CUT TO:\n\n INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n BEAN and DAVID enter. It's        a warm, formal. office. On the wall behind the\n desk is a full-size, framed       poster of Whistler's Mother. On a white\n background, at the base of       the poster, a caption reads: 'THE GRIERSON\n GALLERY, HOME OF WHISTLER'S       MOTHER'. Elsewhere, the walls are full of\n paintings.\n\n GRIERSON and BERNIE look up from a computer screen at DAVID and BEAN, who\n is, rather weirdly, carrying a newspaper in fronts of his flies. GRIERSON\n approaches David, and shakes his hand.\n\n                                      GRIERSON\n               Ah, David. Finally. (CHECKS HIS WATCH DELIBERATELY ) And this\n               must be our professor from across the sea.\n\n                                       DAVID\n               Yes, this is Doctor Bean.\n\n                                        BEAN\n               Actually I'm not .... er ...\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n             This is Bernard Schimmel. Bernie the Doctor.\n\n BERNIE offers his hand. BEAN has to do a nifty handchange to free up the\n correct hand for the handshake. The newspaper stays firmly in place.\n\n                                THOMAS GRIERSON\n             Ah ~ the Tribune - mind if I just ....\n\nHe reaches out to borrow the newspaper. BEAN has to squeeze in right next to\nthe desk and sit behind it, before he can hand the paper over   thus ensuring\nthe continued invisibility of the wet patch. GRIERSON studies the paper for a\nsecond.\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n             Take a seat, gentlemen..... although before we settle - feast your\n             eyes on these.\n\nGRIERSON goes to a painting on a wall. DAVID and BEAN follow ~ BEAN about one\ninch from DAVID's back, walking in perfect rhythm.\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n             Arthur Rackham. Originals of course. Got four of them. Check\n             this out ... Venus and the Cat, Aesop's Fables. Isn't that\n             something?\n\nHe heads towards said illustration on adjacent wall - and BEAN and DAVID\nfollow, still totally glued together. A strange sight.\n\n                                       DAVID.\n             They're beautiful, sir.\n\n                                   GRIERSON\n             Maybe. Hell of a price, I'11 tell you.     Anyway - down to\n             business.\n\n They head back to the desk - but Bean, in a momentary lapse of concentration\n fails to follow. He's now stuck on the wrong side of the room, unable to\n turn around.\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n             Bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross-gallery\n             computer system. Dr Bean - would you like to look at this? Very\n             exciting stuff ....\n\n                                        BEAN\n             Ahm ... NO.\n\nGRIERSON is slightly surprised.   But they persevere.\n\n                                     BERNIE\n             What I'm doing, Dave, is developing the ultimate user-friendly,'\n             interactive public guide to the gallery.\n\nPunching buttons on the computer, he reveals wonderful maps of the gallery,\nand when clicking on sections of the map, graphic explanations of each rooms\ncontents.\n\n                                                                                 42\n\nMeanwhile.   Bean has spotted a fan on the other side of the room.    He moves\n\naround the room, always facing straight to the wall. When he reaches the fan,\nhe switches it on: unfortunately it's a rotating fan - so to keep the wind on\nhis trousers, BEAN has to do a strange, rhythmic dancing movement, following\nthe arc of the fan.\n\n                                       DAVID\n           It's very good Bernie.\n\n                                   BERNIE\n           But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work\n           oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the\n           program to every room in the gallery.\n\n                                     GRIERSON\n             Not bad, eh?    What do you think, Doctor?   Ah.... Doctor Bean?\n\n BEAN turns, shocked to    have been observed. He looks down at his trousers\n and, HOORAY!, they're    dry at last. He's delighted, and moves back across\n the road towards them,    hands in pockets, in a big, confident, groin-\n thrusting, dry-trouser    boasting walk.\n\n                                   GRIERSON\n             Well, thanks for dropping by. Enjoy your stay with our Vice\n             President and his family. They're simple people.-.but warm,\n             yes, Doctor?\n\n                                    BEAN\n           I'm not actually... um...\n\n                                   GRIERSON\n             ... Settled in yet. I know. Plenty of time. Bernie, perhaps\n             you'd like to take Dr. Bean on a tour of the gallery.\n\n                                      BERNIE\n           Absolutely.     This way, sir.\n\n BEAN displays his crotch proudly one last time before he and BERNIE exit.\n GRIERSON tries to fathom the strange man who just left.\n\n                                     GRIERSON\n           He's a genius, right?\n\n\n\n                                                                                43\n\n\n                                   DAVID\n           Ah...

ANNIE perks    up at the reception desk as DAVID, but\nespecially BEAN, approaches    from the gallery area. She has a pile of\ntissues near-by and draws a    heart on one of them. She arranges it on the\ncounter-top where BEAN could    not fail to see it on his way to the exit.\n\n                                      DAVID\n           Goodnight Annie.\n\n                                      ANNIE\n           Night.\n\nBEAN does not even notice her.

He drops the\ntissue in a bin as he exits.\n\nANNIE sighs her disappointment.\n\n                                                                        CUT TO:\nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   BY PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n(About 5 p.m.) BEAN and DAVID head for the parking lot. On the way, BEAN's\ninterest is drawn to the MIME ARTIST we met before in his Clinton mask,\nperforming his heart out in front of the Dead Cars sculpture. BEAN lingers.\n\nThe MIME accosts a woman, pretending to brush dust from her clothes, comb\nher hair etc. The MIME is a bit of a pain in the ass really. The woman\nquickly moves on.\n\nBEAN is intrigued. The MIME mimes climbing a ladder. BEAN goes up next to\nhim - and looks up. There's nothing there. He decides the MIME is a bit of\na tricky. This is confirmed when the MIME pretends he's locked behind a\npane of glass. BEAN simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass\nwall, and hits the MIME's nose.\n\n                                 CUT TO: DAVID watching bemusedly some way off.\n\nThe MIME is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last.    He\n\n takes a handkerchief from BEAN's pocket, and gets BEAN to guess which hand\n the hanky's in. It's not in the left. Not in the right. BEAN isn't the\n slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y from\n where it's tucked into the MIME's trousers - and heads away. As he moves\n off, the MIME touches h' on the shoulder. BEAN turns and the MIME starts a\n mocking gun duel. He draws his guns. BEAN is pretty unimpressed.\n\n The MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 He turns ....\n\n But now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all. In a brilliant piece\n of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold\n Schwarzenegger movie. He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a\n hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun. Then opens\n another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it.\n\n The MIME is getting very frightened. Then BEAN pulls up an imaginary stool\n to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun. The MIME begins to run away. BEAN\n twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the\n terrified MIME.\n\n                                                                             45\n\n Finally, in a BOOM that almost knocks BEAN out of his imaginary seat, he\n fires. 10 seconds delay, and the MIME falls in a very dramatic death, 50\n yards away.\n\nBEAN is happy - and heads back to the parking lot where DAVID, arms folded,\nleans against his car. DAVID gets into his car. BEAN opens the passenger\ndoor and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next-door (same\nas this morning).\n\n                                                                       CUT TO:\n\nEXT.   SHOPPING MALL.   PARKING LOT - DAY\n\nDAVID parks next to a beaten up convertible.\n\n                                      DAVID\n\n             Okay. I'll get some steaks. Alison loves steak ... Wine - good.\n             Candy? No candy. Alison hates candy. We gotta do this right,\n             Bean, or ... (looks at Bean) Just stay out of trouble, okay?\n\nBEAN nods.   DAVID gets out and heads for the mall.   Nearby woman tramp (BAG\nLADY) goes   through a trash can.\n\nBEAN tries to control himself but weakens. He plays with all the buttons and\nswitches on the dashboard; windshield wipers, lights. Then he notices a\nthrobbing noise ... He gets out of the car to investigate.\n\nBEAN swiftly locates the throbbing sound. The e-empty convertible has its\nengine running. BEAN notices the keys in the ignition. How stupid of\nsomeone. He turns off the engine and takes out the keys. There are several\npeople returning to their cars with groceries. BEAN offers the car keys to\nthem as if to say: \"Are these yours?\"\n\n[The following should take place at quite a speed, real drama.]\n\nThen suddenly, A ROBBER dashes towards BEAN from the direction ' of the Mall,\nweaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly\nfull of money. He wears jeans, a black polo-neck and, much to BEAN's delight,\n\na PRESIDENT CLINTON face-mask.      As far as BEAN's concerned, this is his old\nfriend, the MIME.\n\nROBBER throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets\nin - but he cant find the keys to start it. He frantically searches all his\npockets ...\n\n                                                                                  46\n\n\nBEAN leans into shot.     He holds out the keys, grinning.\n\n                                       ROBBER\n             Gimme the keys!\n\nBEAN runs away with them. Or doesn't! He is in mime mode - And runs on the\nspot, getting faster and faster. The ROBBER approaches this obvious madman.\nHe is quite a tough, scary, and scared individual.\n\n                                     ROBBER\n             I said, give me the keys!\n\nBEAN turns and holds out two hands, just like the MIME did to him. The\nperplexed ROBBER picks one hand. Wrong one. He then.... pulls a gun and puts\nit hard to MR BEAN in BEAN's face. Passers-by scream and fall to the ground,\nthe bag lady amongst them. Sudden harsh reality.\n\nBut not to BEAN. He simply takes the gun, and waves it in the ROBBER's face,\nticking him off for breaking the rules.\n\n                                     ROBBER\n             OKAY, OKAY - TAKE IT EASY!!!\n\nBEAN gestures the ROBBER to turn around. He does, sure this sicko is going\nsimply to shoot him in the head. But instead BEAN puts his back to the\nROBBER's back, and starts to count\n\n                                        BEAN\n              1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7,8, 9,10\n\nHe turns and gestures to the ROBBER it's time to draw.       By this time a crowd\nhas gathered.\n\n                                     ROBBER\n             But I haven't got a f.....\n\n                                        BEAN\n             Ssssh!!!!\n\nHe points out a small child, watching from behind a trash can.\n\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Their body language suggests a\ncertain closeness. DAVID is saddened. He hurries away.\n\n                                                                      CUT TO:\nEXT.   SHOPPING MALL.

Finally...\n\n                                      ROBBER\n                             Okay, okay, I'11 do it!\n\nHe draws. BEAN draws too. They fire. And BEAN really fires. To his\namazement. Onlookers scream. BEAN throws the gun away in startlement.\n\nThe ROBBER lunges for it ~ BEAN kicks it away, trying to help him avoid such a\ndangerous implement.\n\nThe ROBBER lunges at BEAN who throws the keys away over his shoulder. The\nROBBER has to scrabble under a car for them- BEAN thinks of final joke - and\nniftly swaps the ROBBER's bag, for one of the Old BAG LADY's bags. A few\ndollar notes spill out of it.\n\nWhen the ROBBER emerges with the keys, BEAN 's waiting to escort him to his\ncar. He opens the door - then spots a tourist hiding and puts his arm around\nthe ROBBER and gets him to take a photograph of them. BEAN removes the\nROBBER's mask as the picture is taken. Forgetting himself, the ROBBER smiles\nfor the camera.\n\nThe ROBBER, jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching Police car\nsirens, jumps in the car and drives away. BEAN waves goodbye to the\nconvertible as a couple of Police cars screech up. COPS jump out.\n\nDAVID approaches the scene with groceries and roses. What kind of hell has\nBEAN caused now? But instead of trouble, he sees the passers-by are getting\nto their feet, applauding BEAN and whistling! They crowd round the COPS\nexplaining what a hero BEAN has been.\n\nBEAN hands over the gun to a COP. He doesn't really understand what all the\nfuss is about. He notices the BAG\n\n                                                                            48\n\nLADY wandering away with her bags. Should he tell her that he has swapped one\nof them for the ROBBER'S? No. He's getting too much attention to be bothered.\nA COP comes up to BEAN. It is COP 1 from the airport scene.\n\n                                        COP 1\n                         Excuse me.    Mr. er ...

INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT\n\nClassic smoked filled room with street light cutting through half closed\nVenetian blinds. Two or three DETECTIVES slouched in the shadows.\n\nBRUTUS, the   huge    black detective from    earlier, sits opposite BEAN    at a table,\nsmoking. He    is    looking at a photo. A     close-up reveals it to be a    full length\none of BEAN   and    the ROBBER outside the    mall with the ROBBER's face    unmasked.\nBRUTUS eyes   BEAN    for a while. BEAN is     terrified. BRUTUS taps the     photo.\n\n                                         BRUTUS\n              It's Eddie Guardino.     Go pick him up.\n\nOne of the DETECTIVES lazily leaves the room.          BRUTUS leans forward on his\nelbows.\n\n                                      BRUTUS\n              Guardino fled the scene with 160 K, in a white plastic bag. We got\n              the car. We got the bag. And we got 20 pairs of stinking\n              pantyhose. (drags on his cigarette) Anything you wanna tell me?\n\nBEAN looks at h4-m blankly.       BRUTUS holds up the photo.\n\n                                      BRUTUS\n              'Fraid I'm gonna have to keep this.\n\nBEAN calmly takes the picture and tears it in half. He gives back the ROBBER\nhalf and puts the other half, with himself on, into his pocket. BRUTUS glares\nat him.\n\n                                         BRUTUS\n              Mr. Bean.

Something to get the key away from the\n              stupid cuckoo.\n\n BEAN scans the monitor screen: he spots a little frog at the bottom of the\n scene. His eyes light up. He takes the mouse and rapidly and repeatedly\n clicks on the frog.\n\n                                        BEAN\n                       Click, click, click, click, click ...\n\n The frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone.

Away from here.\n\n                                                                              52\n\n                                     DAVID\n             Look, Bean's history. I swear to you, he's packing as we speak.\n             And you can't leave. ( HE PICKS UP THE BAMBI ) I've got Bambi.\n             You never go anywhere without him. Please let's just talk.\n\n\n                                     ALISON\n             Okay. ( GHOST OF A SMILE ) Put Bambi down, and we'll talk.\n\nHe puts Bambi down on the side-table, on the flat surface of his CD player.\nBEAN appears again behind her, now looking even madder. Pointy hat, large\npointy ears made from melon peel, held in place by the rubber band stretched\nround his face ~ huge front teeth also cut from the melon. He grins\ngleefully.\n\nDAVID and ALISON just stare. BEAN is followed by KEVIN who wears the same ears\nand teeth.\n\n                                     DAVID\n             Look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to ... Jennifer -\n             could you turn that damn thing down.\n\nIt is quite loud. JENNIFER looks for the remote control. BEAN helpfully picks\nup a remote control from the sofa and points it across the room.\n\n                                     ALISON\n             No, that's not for the TV. That's for the ...\n\nToo late! BEAN punches a button and the lid of the CD\nplayer launches the Bambi into the air.\n\nDAVID sees it. In slow motion he dives dramatically and just misses it.         It\nsmashes on the floor.\n\nBEAN raises his eyes heavenwards, shakes his head and tuts.        He thinks DAVID\nis a real Butter Fingers.\n\nJENNIFER, upset, has found the TV remote and unintentionally switches from the\nVampire game to a TV channel. It's very loud.\n\nALISON gives DAVID a tearful look, and shakes her head.\n\n                                                                             CUT TO:\n\nEXT.

BEAN is sticking things in a picture\n album.\n\n                                        DAVID\n             Hi, am I disturbing you?\n\n BEAN gives him an affable smile. In a pause before he quite gathers himself\n to broach the difficult subject, DAVID asks a polite question.\n\n                                        DAVID\n             May I?\n\n BEAN acquiesces. He starts from the beginning, with pictures of him as a\n kid. Always standing on his own.\n\n Picture of BEAN with mop of frizzy hair, at 16.    DAVID smiles.   BEAN mimes\n stupid disco dancing.\n\n DAVID turns another page. It is a sequence      of pictures of BEAN at famous UK\n locations - Big Ben, Stonehenge, Buckingham     Palace, 10 Downing Street. They\n are .idiosyncratic because all taken by him     at arms length with his Polaroid\n - so he never quite makes it squarely into     shot.\n\n A whole page of Teddy. Then three pages of BEAN's mini with dates, on\n labels, going way back.\n\n Then a whole page of garden gnomes.\n\n                                      DAVID\n              None of your folks here - Family?\n\n BEAN starts to look for something in particular.      DAVID uses the pause to\n broach the awful subject.\n\n                                      DAVID\n              Look... the reason I came in here was to ... well... since you've\n              been here twelve all...\n\n BEAN has    found what he was looking for. It is the picture of the family\n that he    took from the landing on his first night here. What's left of the\n Polaroid    of himself, from the mall, that he rescued from BRUTUS, is stuck\n next to    it. He's even written - 'Bean & Family' - he doesn't realise there's\n anything    sad about it. But DAVID is rather moved. Pause.\n\n                                                                                 55\n\n                                      DAVID\n              Well, that's er...great. Look, I just came in ... (no, he cant do\n              it) ... to say good night. Okay?\n\nBEAN nods.    DAVID smiles and goes to the door.\n\nBE-AN waves good-bye a little rudely and gets back to the album. Even when we\nfeel sorry for him, he's a little rude. DAVID walks away, shaking his head.\n\n                                       DAVID\n              Spineless.\n                                                                          CUT TO:\n\nINT.   DAVID AND ALISON'S BEDROOM.\n\nThe first morning without ALISON.    \"She's Gone\" by Hall & Oats begins to play,\na song full of yearning.\n\nDAVID feels the other side of the bed.    No-one there.\n\nHe walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower. Then walks back into the\nbedroom - She's gone - I've got to learn how to face it \" He takes a towel\nfrom a cupboard and returns to the bathroom. He feels very alone.\n\nHe removes his pyjamas and gets into the steam-filled shower. - she's gone -\nshe's gone\" - but the camera moves to reveal that he is not alone after all.\nBEAN has, simply entered the shower, and is now happily soaping himself,\nwearing ALISON's shower cap. manly screams from the both of them.\n\n                                                                          CUT TO:\nINT.

DAY\n\n 10 am U.K.    time. (The following takes place in a matter of seconds) Close on\n the T.V. A    morning kids show blares out. A huge wardrobe stands four feet\n away from    a wall. There is a string tied to one of it's door handles,\n stretching    out of shot. The wardrobe seems to be leaning backwards at an\n angel. It     rocks slightly and creaks. (Feature its padlock).\n\n There is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet, see-saw\n fashion. One end of it is wedged under the wardrobe.\n\n BEAN's G.P.O. phone rings on the table and it's vibrations cause the bust of\n BEETHOVEN to fall over the edge of the table. It lands on the end of the\n ironing board. The Wardrobe groans as it is set off balance and falls\n against the wall with a heavy thump! and raising of dust. The string tied\n to its handle becomes taut.\n\nCUT TO: the T.V. plug in its socket. This end of the string is tied to it.\nThe string tightens and the plug is yanked out of the socket.\nThe T.V. screen goes blank. Shot of TEDDY in the cardboard hotel'.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.    CANTEEN.

David is still deep in\nthought.\n\n                                        DAVID\n\n              Well, they say there's only one way to get over this sort of\n              thing. Take it day by day. Keep working. Keep to your normal\n              patterns. That's the only hope. So let's just ... take today\n              shall we?\n\n                                                                                57\n\nBEAN nods.    He is not on David's emotional level here.\n\n                                      DAVID\n              I think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame.\n              She's all around you ... how do you fancy meeting her in the\n              flesh?\n\n Sure enough, all around are posters, and the silhouette of Whistler's\n Mother. BEAN nods, though fairly distracted by the slice of gherkin he's\n found in his bun and now picks out with his fingers.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\nINT.

THE WHOLE GALLERY - DAY\n\n BEAN and DAVID do the rest of the journey, in quick cuts - along corridors -\n in an elevator. A sense of expectation and excitement. En route, they are\n joined by ELMER, the huge Security Guard.\n\n The three arrive outside a large oak door. ELMER ceremoniously unlocks the\n door, all the time glaring at BEAN - who swallows hard. A light turns green\n and a buzzer sounds.\n\n Then there is the door to the inner sanctum. ELMER stares at BEAN as he\n unlocks it. Another light turns green and another buzzer sounds.\n\n                                      DAVID\n              As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.   Nobody\n              gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right?\n\n                                      ELMER\n              Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like\n              my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with\n              her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.\n\n                                                                                58\n\n\n                                      DAVID\n              You've known me five years Elmer.

It would only be a matter of time before I'm\n              calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're\n              my Sweety-Pie\" and I'm \"Coochie-Coo\". I'11 be back in 15.\n\nHe salutes, glares at BEAN and walks away.        BEAN and DAVID enters the room.\nBEAN looks warily back at ELMER\n\n                                      DAVID\n              You think he's tough you should see the size of the hunk that\n              works the night shift.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Keep your eyes closed. One final lock, one final key.\n\nDAVID unlocks double doors in a wall with a plastic key card. Buzz - click!\nThe camera holds on BEAN, his eyes tight shut. The lights go up on BEAN's\nface, a magical golden glow.\n\n                                          DAVID\n              Right.   Open now.\n\nCut round - and there is this beautiful and very famous painting, lovingly\nshot. Music. Atmosphere. Glory.\n\nBEAN opens his eyes and looks at the painting.\n\n                                          BEAN\n\n              Mmmmm. Nice.\n\n                                      DAVID\n              I'11 leave you with her for a few minutes. I'm sure you'll want\n              to give her a proper inspection. But whatever you do, don't leave\n              the room. Megasecurity, okay? Catch you.\n\nBEAN nods. DAVID leaves him.         BEAN is still for a while and then goes up and\ninspects it closely.\n\n                                                                                    59\n\nHe tuts disapprovingly as he spots dust on the bottom of the frame. He blows\nit away fussily. He steps back to admire the painting. There is dust up his\nnose and... SNEEZE - all over the painting!\n\nHe takes out his handkerchief and wipes the spittle off in panic. Then looks\nback at the painting. Unfortunately, there now seems to be a big blue mark\nright across Mrs Whistler's face..\n\nBEAN checks his handkerchief. Yes, there's wet ink all over it. He finds the\nleaking pen in his pocket. 0 God. He takes out his shirt, spits on it and\ntries to wipe the painting, but he can't make the shirt reach it. He takes\nthe painting down from the wall and has another go. NO GOOD! The ink just\nspreads right over Whistler's Mother's pure white collar.\n\nBEAN    now looks round in panic. What the hell can he do? He goes to the heavy\ndoor    - and looks out into the corridor. He hears someone coming, hides and\nsees    a young girl from the catering staff wheeling a slightly squeaky trolley\npast,    covered with a white cloth.\n\nHe goes back in - and has an idea.        He goes to a little table in the corner\nand begins to take thing off it.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT.     GALLERY.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY.\n\nThe    door opens, and    BEAN emerges, pushing what appears to be a trolley covered\nwith    a white cloth.     Although, if you look carefully, this trolley actually\nhas    no legs. It is     the painting covered with the table cloth. To make it a\nbit    more convincing,    BEAN makes an apt squeaky noise.\n\nHe proceeds along the thin corridor - and then sees another exactly similar\ntrolley coming right towards him.' A problem. As they get close, BEAN\nsuddenly pretends he sees something astonishing behind the on-coming man.\n\n                                            BEAN\n                                     (silently mouths)\n                What the ... !!!\n\nWhen    the   man turns, BEAN just twists his painting sideways and shoots past\nhim.     We   see the face of the deeply perplexed trolley-pusher when he looks\nback    and   BEAN is no longer there. He turns round to BEAN, who turns back to\nhim    with   a totally blank and innocent look. BEAN sees an elevator and heads\nfor    it.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\n                                                                                    60\n\nINT.

The bell dings.\n\n                           ELEVATOR VOICE\n                Second floor.\n\nBEAN manages to get the painting into trolley position before the doors open\nto a group of six very fat middle aged people. They all wear large badges\ndeclaring them to be members of a 'Diet Club'. They squeeze into the elevator\nalong both sides of BEAN's trolley. There is a very, very, THIN WOMAN behind\nthem who can't fit on.\n\n                                      THIN WOMAN\n                I guess I'll see you up there, guys.\n\nThe doors close. As the painting is wedged against the fat people's stomachs\non both sides, BEAN is able to let go of it and make a great show of checking\nhis watch. He nonchalantly, drums the fingers of both hands on the top of the\ntrolley'. The bell dings.\n\n                               ELEVATOR VOICE\n                Third floor.\n\nThe doors open. BEAN flips the painting onto its side and strolls out of the\nelevator. The 'Diet Cub, members stare, after him.\n\nBEAN heads on, squeaking - and at last sees what he's looking for.        A men's\nroom.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\nINT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.    MEN'S ROOM - DAY\n\nBEAN enters, relieved. It is small, just a little sink, a towel and a toilet.\nAbout a yard wide - but the picture fits in.\n\nBEAN starts to wash the painting very carefully and lo!! The ink starts to\ncome off. Massive relief. Then, alas, someone tries the handle of the door.\nBEAN speeds up. A knock. He peers out the keyhole. There are now 4 people\nwaiting. BEAN is very worried.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\n                                                                                  61\n\nINT.-GRIERSON GALLERY.     OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM - DAY\n\nPause. Then out comes BEAN, drying his empty hands, miming, \"Sorry, Sorry.\".\nWe see into the toilet. nothing there. No sign of the painting. BEAN turns\nsharply left.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\nEXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY\n\nDAVID is talking to BERNIE in the grounds.       We can see the side of the whole\ngallery in shot as they talk.\n\n                                        BERNIE\n             I was hoping DU.     Bean might take a look at my computer project\n             today.\n\n                                    DAVID\n              Yes. I'11 mention it to him.       But ... he's kind of his own guy,\n              you know?\n\n                                     BERNIE\n             Howls he getting on with the family?\n\n                                         DAVID\n             Ah. Fine.     It's good.   It's great.\n\n We will be slightly distracted by      the observation that Whistler's Mother,\n America's most valuable painting,      is at this moment balanced on a very thin\n ledge three floors up - where Bean      has put in, outside the Men's room\n window. A bird and then a couple       more birds perch on it.\n\n                                        BERNIE\n             And howls Alison?\n\n                                     DAVID\n             She's ... well, she's good.\n\n                                     BERNIE\n             Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.\n             Nice guy. Good looking.\n\n                                         DAVID\n             Yes, isn't he.\n\n                                        BERNIE\n\n             It's great when people who work together can become real friends.\n\n                                        DAVID\n             Isn't it?\n\n                                                                                   62\n\n                                     BERNIE\n             I like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even\n             though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that\n             way, huh?\n\nDAVID doesn't quite see what BERNIE is getting at but smiles politely.\n\nNow we see BEAN's plan -    he has emerged at a nearby window. He    can't reach\nthe painting at first.     So he stretches further and further out   the window.\nNo good. Finally he has     to go out on the ledge. He shoos away    the birds, who\nthen decide to settle on    him instead. Finally he gets a hand on    the painting.\nAs he does so, he loses    hold. He just manages to grabs a window    before he\nfalls.\n\n                                     DAVID\n             Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie -\n             always a subtle joy.\n\n                                      BERNIE\n             Thanks, David.   Always a pleasure.\n\nPeriod.\n\nBEAN is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the\npainting. It is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics. DAVID turns to go.\n\n                                        BERNIE\n             By the way. Don't     know what you think, Mr Vice President, but\n             I've been hinting    to the old man that someone's got to have the\n             balls to take some    sort of emergency measures around here - or\n             we're all in the\n             crap house. What     do you think?\n\n\n                                     DAVID\n             'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?\n\n                                    BERNIE\n             Not necessarily. That's where this ... ( POINTS TO HIS BRAIN )\n             comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll\n             hear soon enough.\n\nBERNIE grins and walks away. Bean does one final swing, and ....\n\n                                                                              CUT TO:\n\n                                                                                   63\nINT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.   STOREROOM - DAY.\n\nA small storeroom where Bean's wriggling bottom is just coming back through\nthe window. He has the picture and is safe.\n\nHe sets the picture down on a table.      Darn!   The birds have done their\nbusiness on it.\n\nHe maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a shelf. He\nchooses a can, too rusty to read its label, takes off the lid and sniffs.\nThis smells like the right sort of stuff. He pours the liquid on to a rag and\nrubs it on the face of Mrs. Whistler. The solvent effortlessly removes the\nink stain. Whistler's Mother looks as good as new.\n\nBEAN is so, so, relieved. But then he notices something else happening.      The\nliquid did not stop with removing the stain. It is now busy removing\nWhistler's Mother's face entirely. As Bean watches-in frozen horror,\nAmerica's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas.\n\nBEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought.     Removing the pen\nthat started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back    on Whistler's\nMother's 'face. He doesn't have much time. It shows. Where       once was a\nsublime oil painting, is now a biro line-drawing which looks    a little like\nDanny de Vito.\n\nBean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked. Unfortunately,\nthere's a nail there. The picture tears, Bean panics - it tears even more.\nTotal destruction.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\n\n\n INT.     GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY.\n\n\nBEAN Hurries down the corridor with his pseudo-trolley again, and a vaguely\nmad look on his face. He spots ANNIE at a drinks machine. She smiles sweetly\n(here comes her man) BEAN takes a sharp left into an adjacent corridor. ANNIE\nis hurt.\n\n                                       ANNIE\n               True love can be very hard.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\nINT.

He closes the doors and rests a moment to catch his breath.     He takes a\nstep into the room and freezes.\n\nThe    very fat 'Diet Club, people are seated at easels, paint brushes poised.\nThe    very THIN WOMAN is standing in the centre of the room in her underwear\nwith    a Greek urn perched on her shoulder. All eyes are on BEAN, who exits\nvery    quickly.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\nINT.     INNER SANCTUM.   WHISTLER ROOM DAY.\n\nBEAN gets back to the right rooms and closes the door desperately behind him.\n\nHe stands frozen for a second - and at that moment, a hand tries the door.\n\nBEAN leaps at it and stops. the handle turning. Then there's a knock. BEAN\nmoves the big table in front of the door - he's barricading himself in.\nThere's a famous Rodin sculpture in there - he shoves it along to block, the\ndoor as well. When he's succeeded, he leans hot and sweaty against it - and a\ndoor on the other side of the room calmly opens and .... DAVID walks in.\n\n                                     DAVID\n             Seems to be a problem with the door.(PAUSE) Where's the picture\n             gone?\n\n                                       BEAN\n             Ahm.....\n\n                                       DAVID\n             What?

I did it. I just go\n             out and tell them what happened - you're a madman from England and\n             you did this terrible thing and it's not my fault. That's right,\n             isn't it?\n\nBEAN nods, knowing he deserves his doom.\n\n             Perfect - and then they say - who left him alone with the\n             picture?\" And I say - \"me\". And they say \"you're fired\". And I\n             say ' right'. And so I get fired and you go to jail and no one's\n             any happier.\n\nBEAN shakes his head.\n\n             And then they say, \"firing David isn't enough - let's prosecute\n             him for negligence. And they prosecute me and it turns out I was\n             negligent and I go to jail, and my wife leaves me and my daughter\n             becomes a prostitute and I end up on Death Row sharing a cell with\n             Butch McDick, the infamous gay rapist - or worse, I end up in the\n             same cell as you!\n\nBEAN looks hurt.\n\n             No, no...Now, let's just be calm let's think about this calmly.\n             (he tries - and fails ... ) Oh Godigodigod! Okay, now wait.\n             Let's have another look at it.\n\nBEAN shows it to him.\n\n             Jesus!!! I'm already thinking back to 5 minutes ago as paradise.\n             5 minutes ago - just walking along, shooting the breeze with my\n             old pal Bernie.\n\nBEAN then he has a brilliant idea. He hangs the painting back up in the\nsecurity cupboard and closes the doors. Then he removes from his pocket a\nsmall note book.\n\n                                                                               66\n\n\n\nHe scribbles something on it, tears the page out, licks it and sticks it on\nthe cupboard door. It reads `OUT OF ORDER'.\n\n\n\n                                      DAVID\n             Brilliant.   Brilliant. Problem solved!\n\nBEAN is delighted.\n\n             Apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who opens the\n             cupboard will say -\"Look, someone's totally destroyed Whistler's\n             Mother- let's kill them\".\n\nBEAN is less delighted.\n\n              No - the most important thing is tbat no-one sees it.\n              Ever again!\n\nHe locks the cupboard with his plastic card key-\n\n               That's the first thing. Then ... that's the first thing....\n               Next ... next is the next thing which is... obviously... ritual\n               suicide. Look, let's get out of here.

Spread the       news. I think\n             decisive leadership has done the trick, don't      you?\n\n                                       DAVID\n             Yes, sir.   Yes, sir.   Congratulations. Marvellous thing.     Bravo.\n\n GRIERSON leaves.    DAVID turns to BEAN.\n\n                                        DAVID\n             Bean.   Do you drink?\n\nBEAN shakes his head.\n\n                                        DAVID\n              Neither do I.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   BAR - NIGHT\n\nIt is very late and very gloomy. Just a couple of loners staring into their\ndrinks. The BARTENDER is up one end of the counter, smoking and reading the\nsports pages. There is a T.V. on above the bar, showing baseball.\n\n                                                                                   69\n\nBEAN and DAVID are sitting up at the bar. The latter has had far too much\nwhisky and looks the worse for it. BEAN has a tall glass packed with fruit\nand paper umbrellas. We can guess how much he's had to drink by the way he\nhas difficulty finding the straw with his mouth. DAVID almost, but not quite,\nslurs his words:\n\n                                     DAVID\n             It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job -\n             lose you wife ... C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean?\n\nHe turns to BEAN who has the end of a straw up his nose.\n\n                                        DAVID\n             I guess not.\n\nHe fills his glass from a bottle.\n\n            You know, I don't get it. The New Artist     exhibition-this year -\n            people might not all have liked the dead    sheep, but ... the place\n            didn't look that empty to me. It wasn't     full but I saw people. I\n            just don't understand how the gallery can    be so bankrupt they have\n            to sell the Whistler.\n\nHe looks at BEAN who now has peanuts in each nostril.\nDAVID notices the BARTENDER looking at BEAN strangely ....\n\n                                      DAVID\n            He's English, okay?    You wanna make something of it?\n\nBARTENDER goes back to reading. DAVID searches for his last train of thought,\ntaking a huge swig from his drink.\n\n                                    DAVID\n            ... To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an\n            artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a\n            figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then,\n            I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the\n            problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before\n            I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels.\n\n                                                                                 70\n\n\nBEAN at that moment is keen to show DAVID his nut trick. He throws a peanut\nhigh into the air - and catches it in his mouth. Then does two. Then does it\nwith his eyes closed. Actually, it's rather impressive.\n\n                                    DAVID\n             Truth is, I disappointed her. I turned out to have no spine.\n             Spineless. A kind of medical miracle. Mr Flippy-Floppy. I\n             just don't seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself.\n             Too nice. I mean, I should never have let you come stay and I\n             should be handing you over to the police right now. Shall I\n             tell you something, Beanie ...\n\nBean has been interested all this, even looking to    check whether David does\nindeed have no spine. But now the baseball on the     TV is making it hard for\nhim to concentrate on-this important confidence.     He raises a finger, for\nDAVID to be quiet for a second. He blows a peanut     from his, nostril at the\nT.V. - it hits the button, and changes station to    a pleasant quiet-music\nstation.\n\n                                    DAVID\n             Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is?\n\n BEAN nods his head, very curious, listening hard.\n\n             This is it. Because you moved into my house, my wife has left\n             me. She might have done it anyway - but you were the ten ton\n             weight that broke the camel's spinal column.\n\nBEAN stares at DAVID - something is getting in he's actually registering this.\n\n             That's point one. And point two - is that you've destroyed\n             Whistler's Mother, which was' the last hope for the place where\n             I work. So within a week, I'm going to lose my job as well.\n\nBEAN nods, seriously dispirited.\n\n                                                                                 71\n\n                                     DAVID\n             So, you've totally and utterly destroyed my life. Do you\n             understand? You've put me in a position where it would have been\n             better if I'd never been born.\n\nHe puts his hand on BEAN'S shoulder.     BEAN looks down.\n\nVery sad. This is actually the first time in his life that he's realised that\nhis actions have really effected the life of another person. BEAN looks up\nsadly. Sad music plays.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   LEARY HOUSE.   DAVID'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nDAVID is asleep in bed.     The camera moves out into the hall and into BEAN's\nroom.\n\n\nINT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    BEAN'S ROOM- NIGHT.\n\nBEAN is lying, fully dressed, in the darkness, on his back. Thinking.\nWorried by what he's heard. Then suddenly an idea comes into his eyes.      The\nmusic is like his brain He jumps off the bed.\n\nThere follows a version of the classic tooling up for action sequence. But\nthe 'tools' here are distinctly bizarre. BEAN picks up his suitcase, and in\nquick cuts, rushes through the house and collects....\n\nDAVID'S PLASTIC KEY CARD\nA PAIR OF Y-FRONTS\n\nA TORCH.\nSOME OF KEVIN'S CHEWING GUM. 6 EGGS\nA COOKING BASIN\nA CUP\nA LARGE PAINT BRUSH\nA BOTTLE OF CLEAR NAIL VARNISH DAVID'S LARGE TIN OF LAXATIVE.

GALLERY.   NIGHT.\n\nThe building is floodlit by ground spots.\n\nBEAN arrives silently, with suitcase, on the skateboard. Soon his full plan\nwill be revealed. The Gallery is empty, apart from the one Security Guard,\n\nBUCK, visible through the glass front of the building, drinking coffee,\nwatching his 12 security monitors. BEAN swallows at the sight of BUCK - he is\na massive gorilla of a man.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.    RECEPTION - NIGHT.\n\nBUCK is casually watching his screens, when suddenly, horror of horror, the\nhuge silhouette of a person hanging .themselves from a tree outside appears,\nthe shadow of the limp body thrown across the floodlit gallery wall. BUCK\nfrantically rushes out. And BEAN subtly slips in.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\n\nEXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT.\n\nBUCK is looking for the body amongst the trees. He finds nothing. Because he\nfails to notice the tiny ACTION MAN swinging gently in front of one of the\nground-level floodlights.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT'.\n\nInside, BEAN is casually pouring the entire       contents of DAVID's large laxative\ntin into BUCK's coffee. He also swaps two        keys on the board of keys by the\ndesk. He then takes the opportunity to put        the oven gloves on his feet, one\nshaped like a pig, one like a crocodile, so       he can move silently.\n\nBUCK returns. He sits down, and takes a long gulp of coffee. Pause. BEAN\nwatches. BUCK feels something uncomfortable in his stomach. He takes a key\nfrom his rack of keys, and sets off and rounds a corner- On a monitor screen,\nBEAN watches him break into a canter - as he passes through another monitor\nBUCK is at full sprint. BEAN giggles.\n\nBEAN is satisfied he'll be uninterrupted for a while. He goes to the key-\nrack, borrows two keys, and sets off on his mission. The next 3 minutes of\nfilm are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios:\n\n                                                                                 73\n\n\nFIRST: BUCK - his next 10    minutes    are not happy ones. When he reaches the\ntoilet, the key he chose    does not    unlock it. He has to sprint back, grab all\nthe keys, and charge back    again to    the door. Then he has to try out every\nsingle key. We never see     him find    the right one.\n\nSECOND scenario - all the    activities of the night shown on the security\nmonitors. BUCK sprinting     desperately through shot - BEAN casually going about\nhis business and, on one    occasion, BUCK running right past BEAN, but not\nseeing him - he has other    things on his mind.\n\nTHIRD scenario - we actually see BEAN's Big Plan.\n\nHe unlocks the merchandise shop. So he can see properly and have his hands\nfree, he puts the y-fronts on his head, and wedges the torch into them, like a\nhead-lamp. He then takes a poster of Whistler's Mother and replaces it with\n\nthe rolled-up Tennis Ball Girl. He unrolls the Whistler and places the 4\nencyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down.\n\nHe separates the yokes from the eggs, mixes the whites with clear nail varnish\nand varnishes the-poster with it. Dries it off with the hair drier.\n\n,With the now stiff poster, he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the\nWhistler Room itself, all the time chewing gum frantically. Once there, he\nunlocks the final cupboard with David's plastic key, takes the Whistler down\nand removes the destroyed Mother from its gilded frame, and its wooden support\nframe. He uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame.\n\nHe then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and\nrelocks it with DAVID's key card.\n\nThe job is done.     He scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin,\nand heads off.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\nEXT. STREET.

There stands       GRIERSON, looking straight at Whistler's Mum. In\n all its untorn, unsmudged,      undestroyed glory.\n\n                                                                                75\n\n                                   GRIERSON\n            I think you're wrong, David.

DAVID is not\nfar behind him. STINGO is still trying to kick start it. BEAN takes out a\nsmall screwdriver and twiddles with something on the engine.\n\nThe bike sparks into life and does a wheelie before speeding out of the drive\nand down the road. BEAN stands, hands on hips, looking very-pleased with\nhimself indeed.\n\n                                          DAVID\n                To BEAN )    Right! Right! You get inside and look after Kevin!\n                (not such    a good idea) Uh --- Right! Kevin. You get inside and\n                look after    ... uh... (that would be a worse idea) Right! Get in\n                the car!     Both of you. Jesus!\n\n                                                                             CUT TO:\n\nINT.     THE GRIERSON GALLERY.

DAVID is still rattled.\n\n\n                                          ANNIE\n                Big day today, huh?\n                                                                                  78\n\n                                          DAVID\n                Uh ... yes ...\n\nDAVID looks askance at BEAN.       BERNIE hurries up and takes DAVID to one side.\n\n                                       BERNIE\n                Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and\n                concentrating on the future.\n\n                                       DAVID\n                Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.      I'm sure we\n                haven't been doing as badly as all that.\n\n                                         BERNIE\n\n              You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love\n              you. (he hugs him and laughs). Jesus - what a terrible tie-\n              Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a\n              little surprise for you and the Boss.\n\n DAVID calls to ANNIE.\n\n                                     DAVID\n              Annie ... would you look after Kevin? And Kevin - you look after\n              Bean.\n\nHe heads off with BERNIE.     Back at the counter.   BEAN, KEVIN & ANNIE.\n\n                                     KEVIN\n             My Dad told me all about you.\n\n                                       ANNIE\n             Did he now?\n\n                                     KEVIN\n              He says you've got a babe count of ten out of ten, and a brain\n              cell count of about two and a half.\n\n                                     ANNIE\n              Yeah, I'll go with that. I'm kinda, like, dumb, intellectually.\n              (to Bean) But I'm great in bed.\n\nBEAN is unsettled by this.     He gives a shudder and heads for the gallery.\n\n                                                                                 79\n\n\n                                     KEVIN\n             Catch you later, babe.(goes after Bean) Come on, Beanie - there\n             must be a computer here somewhere. I hate paintings. They don't\n             do anything.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.    DAY.\n\nBERNIE, DAVID and GRIERSON. BERNIE looks very confident at a computer\nmonitor. A painting is in fact 'doing' something, on the computer screen, as\nthe girls in a Toulouse-Lautrec painting actually dance the can-can.\n\n                                      GRIERSON\n             Well, congratulations.

I'11 pipe the guide to\n             every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the\n             Governor.\n\n                                   GRIERSON\n             Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a\n             winning team.\n\nDAVID slightly embarrassed not to be included in the winning team.      He looks\n\nto the poster of Whistler's Mother behind GRIERSON's desk.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY\n\nKEVIN and BEAN have found a computer,    also showing BERNIE's Gallery programme.\nThe monitor shows the interior of the    ground floor of the gallery. KEVIN\nclicks, and up comes the same Toulouse    Lautrec picture. As KEVIN works the\nmouse, BEAN hums the catchy tune from    'GOBLINS 21. It's play time again.\n\n                                     KEVIN\n              This is way cool, Beanie.\n\nHe clicks again, and a tiny talking Toulouse Lautrec starts to explain the\nprovenance of the painting.\n\n                                                                              80\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   THE WHISTLER ROOM. DAY\n\nDAVID is overseeing things. There's a burgundy rope, keeping people a bit\naway from the case in which Whistler's Mother is contained. ELMER brings in\ntwo large flower displays. BERNIE enters.\n\n                                     BERNIE\n             Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only person round here who\n             actually gets things done.\n\nHe exits. BERNIE is growing in confidence - and getting nastier by the\nminute. DAVID pulls a face at ELMER.\n\n                                     DAVID\n             You arrange those flowers yourself?\n\n                                      ELMER\n             Sure did.\n\n                                      DAVID\n             They're pretty.

Gardeners gardening, window cleaners cleaning, polishers polishing etc.\nAnd someone empties a dustbin, in the midst of which we glimpse something\nwhich might be a scrunched up old Whistler painting.\n\n2.    BERNIE watches as someone plugs in a plug - and a huge video screen in\nthe gallery flickers and starts up.\n\n3.    ANNIE at her counter, reading a book called 'The Art of Conversational.\nShe shakes an imaginary hand and rehearses a keen conversation with an\nimaginary V.I.P.\n\n                                                                                81\n\n4.    ELMER, in the men's room mirror, trims his hair around his peaked hat\nwith scissors. He has a row of war medals on his chest. He polishes them\nproudly with his sleeve.\n\n5.    GRIERSON watches through the front glass - a red carpet rolls itself out\nfrom the gallery's main entrance to stop by the rear door of a black car.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\n\nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY\n\nClose on the bottom    of the black cars rear door. It opens and a pair of legs,\nwearing black shoes    and charcoal trousers, step out onto the red carpet. As\nthey walk purposely    up the carpet, the camera pans up their owner's body, to\nreveal that this is    BERNIE. It's a rehearsal. He is met with a hand shake by\nGRIERSON at the main    entrance.\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n             What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.

Let's junk the medals, Elmer. This is not a Veterans'\n             reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home. Not remind him\n             of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.\n\nELMER puts on a defiant face. DAVID shakes his head disapprovingly.        GRIERSON\nmoves BERNIE to meet DAVID. They\n\n'Shake hands.\n\n                                     DAVID\n             David Leary.

THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    BERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nBEAN at the computer. He's actually quite enjoying himself now. In fact,\nhe's rather hogging the thing. This is, after all, an animated catalogue -\nhis area.\n\n                                                                                83\n\n                                     KEVIN\n             I'm just gonna go see if Annie needs me for anything.      Truth is,\n             she smells kinda nice. okay? (grins).\n\nBEAN smiles and gives KEVIN a thumbs-up.       KEVIN returns the gesture and\nexits..\n\nBack to the computer, BEAN clicks on an icon which takes him to the ground\nfloor gallery. He clicks through various paintings and stops at the painting\nof the woman, in the castle, wearing the chastity belt. BEAN clicks and\nenlarges the painting to fill the screen.\n\nHe happily hums the catchy tune from 'GOBLINS 2' and homes in on the tiny\npadlock on the chastity belt. Padlocks interest him. He clicks on the\nkeyhole rapidly (as we have seen him do with the frog in GOBLINS 2).\n\n                                     MR. BEAN\n\n             Click! click! click! click! click!\n\n.Suddenly, to BEAN's surprise, the padlock starts to flash red...then the\nwhole screen starts to flash ... before going dramatically back to black ...\nNow flashing in the .centre of the monitor is an icon of a tiny key. Beneath\nit, a row of six dashes appears (e.g - - - - - - - ). A cursor is flashing\nover the first dash.\n\nBEAN is totally absorbed. He loves these kinds of puzzles. With one finger,\nhe slowly types out letters on the keyboard (he has to search for some of\nthem). As he does so, they appear over each dash in turn:\n\n                                 G-O-B-L-I-N\nA message pops up: \"ACCESS DENIED\" BEAN tries something 0 else.\n                                 G-N-O-M-E-S\nThe message again: `ACCESS DENIED'. The room door suddenly opens! Making\nBEAN jump! It's BERNIE. He cannot see the computer screen from the doorway.\n\n                                       BERNIE\n         How goes it, Bean?    Ready for the Governor?\n\nBEAN smiles and nods nervously.       He knows he's probably up to something he\nshouldn't be.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   84\n\n\n                                    BERNIE\n           We need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more.\n           Period. Oh, And put this on.\n\nBERNIE throws BEAN a name badge with 'Dr. Bean' on it. BEAN nods. BERNIE\nexits. BEAN goes back to the code. He types in the first thing that comes\ninto his head:\n\n                                      B-E-R-N-I-E\n\nThat damned message again: `ACCESS DENIED'.         Then, as though something is\ndawning on him, he punches in:\n\n                                      P-E-R-I-0-D\n\nUp comes a message: \"CODE ACCEPTED\". Close on BEAN's face as light from the\ncomputer plays on it- He reads it carefully and with interest. We cant quite\nread his expression - but what he sees is a surprise and a puzzle. Long\nmeaningful pause as his eyes scan the screen.\n\n                                                                             CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.

Through the glass we see a couple of Police Motorcycle Escorts\npull up outside followed by a beautiful, old, classic Rolls Royce.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\n\nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY\n\nThe red carpet unrolls all the way to the Rolls, rear door. Close on the\nbottom of the driver's door.

Camera pans up to\nshow us that GOVERNOR REYNOLDS is dressed in his Veteran's uniform - chest of\nmedals and forage cap. He is a grand figure. In fact - he's exactly the same\ngrand figure Mr BEAN caused epic problems To on the plane over. He gives his\nprized possession, the car, a little token polish with his sleeve before\nheading on.\n\nBRUTUS and his SIDE-KICK COP fall into step behind him.       They are the Police\npresence today.\n\nGRIERSON and BERNIE greet REYNOLDS at the entrance.\n\nGRIERSON is wearing a striking brand new light blue silk suit.       BERNIE is\nfrowning - not happy about that uniform.\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n             what a pleasure, Governor.

Very striking.\n\n REYNOLDS takes in GRIERSON's suit.\n\n                                      REYNOLDS\n             Interesting suit.\n\n                                       GRIERSON\n                                      (Beaming)\n             Why thank you sir.\n\n                                      REYNOLDS\n              off the peg?\n\n                                   GRIERSON\n                                (crestfallen )\n                Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...\n\nHe gestures to BERNIE but REYNOLDS cuts in and hands BERNIE a set of car keys.\n\n                                    REYNOLDS\n                                  (To Bernie)\n             Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son.\n\nBERNIE's smile melts away. As they enter the gallery, BERNIE hopefully offers\nthe car keys to BRUTUS - who rewards him with a \"don't be stupid\" smile and\nfollows the Governor.\n\n                                                                                 86\n\n\nBEAN (wearing \"Dr Bean\" name badge) comes into the corridor by the front door,\nthus just missing REYNOLDS. BERNIE sees him and jumps on the chance to\ndelegate.\n\n                                     BERNIE\n             Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you.\n\n BEAN assents happily. BRUTUS spies BEAN over his shoulder and frowns - its\n that mad English guy again. BEAN gets to the door and sees the Governor's\n car. Yummy!\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   RECEPTION AREA - DAY\n\nGRIERSON leads REYNOLDS to the reception counter, as BERNIE sneaks up to take\nhis position again. ELMER is in the background trying to look professional,\ndeferring to BRUTUS.\n\nANNIE steps out from behind the counter, curtsies and ,shakes REYNOLDS' hand.\n\n                                     ANNIE\n             Good day, Governor. I'm Annie.      You know, you're a lot taller\n             than you were half an hour ago.\n\n                                    REYNOLDS\n             Well, that's great to hear at my age, Annie.      Thank you very much.\n\n                                      ANNIE\n             Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have to curtsy?      Or does\n             she 0 have a decent job?\n\n                                    REYNOLDS\n             Er ... Mrs. Reynolds is doing just fine.      Just fine.\n\nHe spots KEVIN and winks at him.      KEVIN smiles back.\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   DAY.\n\nBEAN has let himself into the car. It's one of the happiest moments of his\nlife, as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather\nseat.\n\n                                                                                 87\n\n\nHe starts the car up - and heads up into the circular car park. He sweeps\ndangerously round a few turns - but just manages to keep the car in tact.\nFinally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left.\n\nBEAN is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the\none he's used to.\n\nHe takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his Mini, and\nmeasures the space. Yes. Seems large enough. He moves the car in. It isn't\nlarge enough.\n\nWith a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the Rolls Royce squeezes in\nbetween the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process.\nBEAN looks a tadge concerned.\n\n                                                                                CUT TO:\n\nINT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY.\n\nREYNOLDS has moved on to ELMER who salutes crisply.         REYNOLDS returns the\nsalute with pride.\n\n                                     REYNOLDS\n              Nice set of medals there Elmer.      Which beach they drop you on?\n              Utah? Omaha?\n\n                                       ELMER\n              Couldn't tell you sir. I was so drugged up with the killing I\n              didn't know where I was.\n\n                                     REYNOLDS\n              Well, congratulations soldier.\n                                                                                CUT TO:\n\nEXT.    PARKING LOT - DAY.\n\nBEAN sitting in the wedged car. He tries       the door - but it won't open a\ncentimetre. He's totally stuck. He looks        up at a small window in the roof.\nIf only he could get that open. He pushes      various buttons, which set of\nwindscreen wipers, squirters, radios. He       pushes the cigarette lighter.\nFinally, he pulls a lever - and the bonnet      pops up an inch.\n\nAt which moment we see the lighter shoot out, and on to the seat. BEAN is\nstill looking round below the dashboard, when he notices a little fire in the\nseat beside him. Not good news.\n\n                                                                                     88\n\n\n BEAN panics a bit, turns and half      climbs over into    the back   seat, when he\n spies a drinks cabinet. He has a       very good idea -    he finds   a cut crystal\n decanter of brown liquid, opens it      and uses it to    douse the   fire. Not a\n wise move with brandy. Before the       cut, we see the    WHOOOSH!   of a major fire\n in the front seat of the car.\n\n                                                                                CUT TO:\n\n INT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   DAY.\n\nGRIERSON leads REYNOLDS towards the main gallery. He points up to the video\nscreen they are passing, which shows the two of them walking along - as does\nevery screen in the gallery. REYNOLDS is impressed. He glances at DAVID in\npassing.\n\n                                        REYNOLDS\n\n             Nice tie, fella.\n\nDAVID grins to himself.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\nINT.   PARKING LOT - DAY.\n\nThe front of the car isn't    what it was. There has been a big fire. It's out\nnow - three decanters lie    empty. BEAN is not happy. Finally, he decides to\ngo for brute strength. He     turns the car on again, puts it into reverse, and\nputs his foot down on the    accelerator.\n\nWe see the car from above. Full throttle. Totally still. Totally still.\nAnd then WHOOOOSH WHAM!!! It reverses at 100 mph straight backwards, smashing\nviolently into and destroying the back of the car behind _ as it happens,\nBernie's car.\n\n                                                                  CUT TO\n\n\nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    GROUND FLOOR - DAY\n\nREYNOLDS stops to admire a small painting - a twelfth century 'Crucifixion of\nChrist'.\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n             Ah, one of my favourites. It expresses a universal agony that the\n             established Church so rarely acknowledges, don't you think?\n\n                                                                            89\n                                    REYNOLDS\n             Jesus ... no one's got feet like for crying out loud. Have you\n             got feet like that? Dammed if I have. Let's move it, shall we?\n\nBERNIE spots a slightly concerned DAVID.\n\n                                       BERNIE\n             Everything okay, David?\n\n                                        DAVID\n             Yes. Ahm.      I was just wondering where my English house guest had\n             got to.\n\n                                     BERNIE\n             He's just parking the Governor's car.\n\n                                     DAVID\n             Great - keep him out of trouble.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\nINT.   PARKING LOT - DAY.\n\nBEAN is inspecting the car. He's not too happy with it. '.He tries to get\nthe bonnet down, but it insists on staying up. He shrugs his shoulders and\ngets in to drive off again, having to wind down the window and drive by\nleaning his head out. This means that as he heads for the exit, he fails to\nsee the system to stop people leaving without paying, a foot high barrier that\nappears out of the ground. When he hits it, the car stops dead.\n\nBEAN gets out,    leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where normally the\nattendant would    be - but everyone is in the gallery at the moment. Inside he\npushes a couple    of buttons, and, hurrah, gets the one that drops the barrier.\nLess hurrah, he    has forgotten to put on the hand brake.\n\nAs he moves    back towards the car, it glides slowly down the ramp on the\noutside of    the building, then accelerates, and finally, on a particularly\nsharp turn,    smashes through the wall, and flies off the building. We hear a\ncrash - but    do not see where it lands.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.

My eyes are making my feet\n              sore, as my wife would say.\n\n                                          DAVID\n              Sure, Governor.   Please.     This way.\n\nThe party follows DAVID as he walks through the gallery, towards the double\ndoors, to take the lift to the Whistler Room. An excited atmosphere.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT.   WHISTLER ROOM.

Thank you.\n\nIt's part of his plan of caution - he knows there's something wrong - and\nwants as few people as possible to .see the painting close up. The crowd\nmoves back.\n\n                                      DAVID\n              I'd like the Governor to have, as it were, a private audience with\n              his new friend.\n\nREYNOLDS is flattered. Silence. DAVID inserts the plastic card key - opens\nthe doors - and sure enough there in all its glory is Whistler's Mother'.\nRespectful silence.\n\nREYNOLDS is delighted.     He stands back to inspect her.\n\n                                     REYNOLDS\n              Well, hello Ma'am! Yes - she certainly looks a million dollars to\n              me - or should I say ten million dollars!\n\nEveryone applauds.\n\n                                     GRIERSON\n              Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of, though I say it\n\n             myself, rather 'expensive' champagne.

REYNOLDS, GRIERSON, BERNIE and DAVID stay behind.\nDAVID spots BEAN arriving. He hands the car keys back to BERNIE with a\nslightly dazed smile. DAVID eagerly takes his arm and brings him over.\n\n                                     DAVID\n             Governor, I don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from\n             England.\n\nThey turn to each other - recognition from BEAN \"it's the man from the plane\".\nHe does a very quick hand-shake and tries to make a getaway before REYNOLDS\nrecognises him...\n\n                                      BEAN\n             Ah, hello, sorry, I ... Ahm... sorry ...\n\nBEAN turns. In fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops anyone\ngetting too close to the great painting. He spins and falls in the direction\nof the painting.\n\nCUT TO: the looks of horror on all the faces.\n\nCUT TO: BEAN, reaching out to keep himself standing. We think he's going to\ntear the painting. He doesn't. He simply catches hold of the bottom of the\nornate frame. It ,,snaps off.\n\nCUT TO: a look of relief for an instant on all faces.\n\nCUT TO: the truth - as the frame breaks off, there is the little white strip,\nsaying, THE GRIERSON GALLERY, HOME OF WHISTLER'S MOTHER\"-\n\nCUT TO: a look of horror on all faces.\n\nCUT TO: ELMER looking like someone has just murdered his own mother.\n\nCUT TO: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK glowering at BEAN.\n                                                                       CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Not only have you failed to protect\n             your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even\n             know it'd been stolen!

That suit stinks and\n             you obviously dye your hair.\n\nGRIERSON is seriously shocked and offended.\n\n             Now, bring my car round the front please - I've had enough of this\n             crap!.\n\n                                         BERNIE\n             Certainly, sir.\n\nHe rushes off.

BEAN looks\nout of his window to see the BAG LADY, from the mall robbery, sitting in the\nback. She is still wearing her filthy clothes. She raises a glass of\nchampagne to BEAN and smiles.\n\nBEAN waves back uncertainly.     He's sure he's seen her before - a vague memory.\n\nCUT TO: ELMER's CAR is in the traffic queue about ten cars back. BRUTUS and\nSIDE-KICK get out and start running down the line towards DAVID's car.\n\nThe lights are green.

They all look up to BEAN as he\nenters, fully kitted up.\n\n                                   ASSISTANT\n             Good evening Doctor.. What we have here is a bullet wound in the\n             lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's\n             severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.\n\n                                       NURSE 2\n             He's coming round.\n\n                                   ASSISTANT\n             Give him a T 70, straight away.\n\nThe victim starts to move - he looks up - we see his face for the first time.\nIt is the police officer, BRUTUS. He is in great pain. As the sedative shot\ngoes in, BEAN takes off his mask, and smiles, with a little wave. A look of\ntotal panic goes over BRUTU'S eyes, as he loses consciousness.\n\n                                   ASSISTANT\n              Shall I do the cut, sir?\n\nBEAN nods - he's not going to argue with anyone. The assistant cuts. BEAN is\nhorrified, almost faints, then snatches the knife. He can't believe this\nmaniac has just cut through another personas flesh.\n\n                                                                             100\n\n\n                                   ASSISTANT\n             I'm sorry. it's only MY first week.\n\nBEAN hands the knife to the NURSE testily.\n\n                                     NURSE\n             I'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the X-rays, Doctor, or we'll\n             never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort out the support\n             systems.\n\nEVERYONE turns to get on    with their particular jobs. BEAN is left with the\nbody. A pause. He gets      a little bored. Takes a sweet packet out of his\npocket. Only one sweet     left. he takes it out lovingly, and then does what he\nalways does - throws it    up into the air, to catch it in his mouth.\n\nUnfortunately, he forgets that he is wearing a mask.     It hits the middle of\nthe mask and bounces into the cut in the body.\n\nBEAN looks down annoyed. Checks round him - everyone's 'still busy. So he\nputs his hand in the body, really rummages around, finds the sweet, takes it\nout, and then realises he's in fact got the bullet between his fingers.\n..Guiltily, he slips it back into the body, rummages a bit more, finds the\nsweet, wipes it, & pops it in his mouth. At which second the X-ray arrives.\n\n                                   ASSISTANT\n              Here we go, doctor. ( STUDYING THE X-RAY ) the bullet is here -\n              so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here. Think we all\n              better be prepared for a long one here. This is tricky.\n\nBEAN tuts scornfully - 'you're wrong 1, reaches in again, feels around for a\nsecond, and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers.\n\nThey all applaud.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Dr Bean here just saved his life.\n\nSIDE-KICK's eyes water. He's choked. BEAN shakes his hand nervously, and\nheads on fast before he's found out. He turns the corner and suddenly sees\nDAVID and ALISON, still seated. ALISON sees him.\n\n                          ALISON\n            0 my god.\n\n                                    DAVID\n             Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.\n\n                                    ALISON\n            Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?\n\nShe turns her head away: the bond of the moments before is gone.       BEAN looks\nvery contrite. At that moment, another doctor walks by.\n\n                                      DAVID\n            Excuse me.\n\n                                   DOCTOR 2\n            Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute.    We have a lot to\n            deal with here, sir.\n\nALISON looks round, and shakes her head. BEAN kicks DAVID in the shins.\nDAVID looks round, puzzled. There is a poster of the human skeleton. BEAN\npoints to the spine. DAVID looks but cannot fathom a relevant meaning from\nit.\n\nAnother doctor comes along - the same one who they spoke to first.

Spine, ribcage, skull. Looks back\nat Bean gesturing to it. This time the penny drops! Spine spineless!\n\n                                                                                102\n\n                                      DAVID\n            Say that again, son.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n            I beg your pardon?\n\n                                    DAVID\n            I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll\n            make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less\n            healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.\n\n                                       DOCTOR\n               I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.\n\n                                       DAVID\n               We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the\n               Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end\n               of the world.\n\nA hint of a smile arrives on ALISON's lips. She's heard that somewhere before.\n\n                                                DAVID\n               So,    why not haul    your    ... (checks) nice little ass into this room\n               and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going\n               to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence\n               and    attention you    are    going to give her case.\n\n                                               DOCTOR\n               Okay, sir.        Certainly.    Good.\n\nDAVID turns to ALISON - she does a little tilt of her\nHead `WOW'. And he turns to BEAN, who points to\nhimself,    and nods .... n Come on!\n\n                                       DAVID\n               Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will\n               you?\n\n BEAN nods enthusiastically and backs off.\n\n                                               ALISON\n                 Smiling         Well, well.\n\n                                                                                  CUT TO:\n\n                                                                                      103\nINT.     HOSPITAL.    JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nClose on an E.C.G. monitor, green lines on black screen. DAVID and ALISON sit\nby JENNIFER's bed. JENNIFER is unconscious. She has her arm in a cast and a\nsmall Band-Aid on her head. otherwise she seems undamaged.\n\nKEVIN    is sitting on the end of the bed playing the SUPER NINTENDO game (the\nGothic    Vampire thing, with bats and he-men, we saw on JENNIFER'S TV earlier).\nIt is    plugged into a T.V. which sits on a trolley. It's quite a noisy game.\nKEVIN    is immersed in it.\n\n                                               ALISON\n               Let's get a coffee.\n\n                                             DAVID\n               Yes.     Great.     Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.\n\nALISON exits. David follows. BEAN enters.               He sees JENNIFER for the first\ntime. Sympathy shows in his eyes.\n\n                                       KEVIN\n               Help me with this. It's a scientific experiment. We're gonna\n               wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire\n               bats.\n\nBEAN is determined to help. He sits down with KEVIN. The game continues.\nThe he-man jumps up and down, lashing out at bats with his sword. Lots of\nnoise, but JENNIFER sleeps on.\n\n                                                                          CUT TO:\n\nINT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nBy a drinks machine.

Slowly she gets close and puts\nher arms around him. She's a bit tearful.\n\n                                     DAVID\n             Everything's gonna be fine.\n\n                                        ALISON\n                                       (pause)\n             About Charles...\n\n                                                                              104\n\n\n                                        DAVID\n             shhh...\n\n                                     ALISON\n              It was nothing.

JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nJENNIFER is still asleep. BEAN is sitting on the end of her bed. He looks at\nthe SUPER NINTENDO console thinking, \"How can I get this working again? How\ncan I help?\" The only sound in the room is the beeping from the E.C.G.\nmachine, monitoring Jennifer's heart. BEAN has an idea.\n\nHe yanks off the jack plug at the end of the Super Nintendo lead.        Producing\nhis small screwdriver, he starts to unscrew the console casing.\n\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\n                                                                                   105\nINT.

They're going to get through this.\nSuddenly, we hear noise from the vampire game, coming from JENNIFER's room.\nKEVIN registers this and is puzzled. Then ALISON and DAVID notice it.\n\n                                         DAVID\n             I thought you said....\n                                                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT.   HOSPITAL.     JENNIFER'S ROOM - DAY\n\nThe LEARYS appear in the open doorway.       Their expressions turn from curiosity\nto horror.\n\nBEAN has plugged the SUPER NINTENDO games system into the       back of JENNIFER's\nE.C.G. monitor. A couple of bats are flapping about the        screen but the most\nworrying thing here (shown in close-up) is the sight of a       he-man type, jumping\nup and down, lashing out, with his sword, at the passing       pulse light, showing\nJennifer's faint vital signs ...\n\nALISON gasps.      DAVID slowly moves into the room.\n\n                                     DAVID\n             Now, Bean ... just put down that thing ... nice and slow ... you\n             hear me? Come on now...\n\nBut BEAN is determined to keep going - it's his way of reviving Jennifer.\nDAVID approaches the opposite side of the bed and gets ready to pounce ... CUT\nTO: a close-up of the monitor. The he-man chases the pulse light ...\n\nDAVID dives across the bed just as he man swipes the pulse light with his\nsword. DAVID has landed on top of JENNIFER. The pulse light explodes and the\nmonitor screen whites-out. JENNIFER wakes up with a start.\n\n                                                                                   106\n\n                                        JENNIFER\n             Dad!     Get off!?   What's happening here?!   Mom?\n\nALISON covers her mouth, tearful, but she can't hold it back.        She laughs.\n\nDAVID and KEVIN stare at JENNIFER. They can't help but join in the laughter.\nJENNIFER has no idea what's going on. BEAN is happy that everyone is happy.\n\n                                     KEVIN\n             I don't care what anyone says. Mr. Bean brought my sister back\n             from the dead. He did it under laboratory conditions. My eyes do\n             not lie!\n\nALISON grins at him.      Then at BEAN.\n\n                                                        MIX THROUGH TO:\n\nINT.   LEARY HOUSE.     KITCHEN.   NIGHT.\n\nALISON is fixing some coffee.

( but she can't concentrate I don't\n             believe this. I'm being seduced by my own husband.\n\nPause. They are just about to kiss when BEAN enters.\nHe's a bit impatient.\n\n                                      BEAN\n             Ahm - excuse me ...

DAY.\n\nWith heavy hearts everyone is gathered to hear their fate. Pan across the\nfamiliar faces. DAVID. BERNIE. ELMER. ANNIE. BEAN, looking nervous and\nshifty. Dead silence as GRIERSON stands, very solemnly.\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n             Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday\n             teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would\n             have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent\n             philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself\n             for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had\n             realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell\n             her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership\n             flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice-\n             President.\n\n\nCUT TO BERNIE, looking smug next to DAVID, who is pretty shocked by this.\n\n                                                                                108\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n               He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and\n               the 21st century.\n\n                                          BERNIE\n               Thank you, sir.       Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we\n               can ...\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n               Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive\n               interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask,\n               survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?\n               Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we\n               find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a\n               criminal of great genius.\n\nBEAN looks pleased - but then realises it's not a suitable emotion ~ so nods\nsagely.\n\n               Insurance? Not a chance. Those bastards never pay. So,\n               surely we're bankrupt? Surely your jobs are forfeit? Surely\n               you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as\n               waiters and boys? Yes. Yes indeed. Except for one little\n               thing. one little thing done by one little man. Dare I say,\n               one helluva little man. Watch this.\n\nEveryone is totally at a     loss. GRIERSON stands and moves to the framed poster\nof Whistler's Mother on     the wall. He then produces a plastic key card and\ninserts it in a slot on     the side of the frame. A buzz and a click! An\nelectric motor starts to     whirrrr ...\n\nThe glass, along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster, slides\ngently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the\noriginal oil of Whistler's Mother.\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n               Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler's Mother!\n\nThere are gasps from the room.     BEAN is open mouthed.\n\nGRIERSON beams as many applaud and BEAN now joins in hyperactively.      He's\nsaved!\n\n                              GRIERSON\n                The best security in the world is no match for a master\n                criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank\n                you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new\n                Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the\n                computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were\n                so rudely interrupted by events.\n\nThe room is emptying.     DAVID and BEAN stand there, DAVID stunned.   GRIERSON\nheads over.\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n             David, David, David ...\n\n                                       DAVID\n             I'm fired?    Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n               Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct,\n               relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred,\n               through your recent lack of professional judgement.

BEAN has his eyes on DAVID.\nHe is mortified by what's\n\nhappening.   GRIERSON notices but misinterprets his worried expression.\n\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n               Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation\n               for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite\n               bathroom.\n\nDAVID glares at BERNIE.     BEAN is thinking 'No!   I don't want to stay with\nhorrible BERNIE.'\n\n                                    GRIERSON\n             How are you making out there?\n\n                                                                                110\n\n                                      BERNIE\n             All fixed up, sir.   Stick around, Davey boy.   This is going to be\n             quite a show.\n\nHe presses an intercom.    He's enjoying himself.\n\n             Hi everyone - this is your new Vice President, Bernie Shistler.\n             Would you please watch your video screens. You're in for a treat,\n             guys.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   VARIOUS ROOMS.

Every picture\n             in the gallery will have its own story to tell.\n\nA Van Gogh picture comes up on the giant video screens\n\n....and then keeps changing, as BERNIE keeps talking.\n\n             Just click , and here is a portrait of the painter - then his\n             family then other paintings by him - then other pictures relevant\n             to him in the gallery\n\n Everyone is delighted and impressed.\n\n             And the beauty is, any idiot can use it. Dr Bean - would you like\n             a try?\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\nINT.

He begins to click boxes.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\nINT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.

He clicks on the padlock repeatedly - humming the\nfamiliar 'Goblins' tune.

That's it.\n              Period!\n\nOn the computer screens, the screen has gone black, just as it did when Bean\nwas playing earlier, and the 6 dashes have appeared with the flashing cursor\nover the first of them. All watch, intrigued by what they see.\n\n                                                                             CUT TO:\n\nINT.

I deny any knowledge of this. He probably\n              typed in all this stuff himself. Don't you find it all a bit\n              suspicious that it's here at his fingertips.

Everyone in the gallery bursts into\napplause.\n\n                                                                           CUT TO:\n\nEXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY.\n\nHalf an hour later.

The car pulls away.     Then breaks and reverses.\nThe SIDE-KICK gets out.\n\n                                     SIDE~KICK\n            Oh, yeah - I forgot.\n\nSIDE-KICK opens the back of the car.    He takes out a huge bunch of flowers.\n\n             The chief said I was to give you these.\n\nBEAN is delighted. Then sniffs the flowers.      What a nasty stink.    Not his\nsort of thing at all.\n\n                                                                                  114\n\n\nSIDE-KICK drives AWAY.

DAVID\ngets the message, and changes his tune..\n\n            Let me think about that, Thomas.     We'd have to talk quite a salary\n            hike.\n\n                                     GRIERSON\n            Of course.\n\n                                       DAVID\n            And a car.\n\n                                     GRIERSON\n            Mmmmm...\n\n\n                                       DAVID\n            Maybe two cars.\n\n                                     GRIERSON\n            A car sounds sensible.\n\n                                    DAVID\n            And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.\n            Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of\n            time to make up.\n\nDAVID heads off. BEAN wants to follow, but needs to get rid of the stinky\nflowers. He turns to ANNIE and gives them to her to be rid of them. She\nbeams with delight: after all, he DID love her.\n\nBEAN heads off with DAVID to the parking lot.       As they go, DAVID puts an arm\n\nround BEAN.\n\nWho shoos him away instantly.           No sloppiness for him.\n\n                                                                                CUT TO:\n\n\n                                                                                      115\n\nEXT.

It pulls away, as they drive off, BEAN\nsticks his    hand of    the window - and waves a last farewell to ALISON and\nJENNIFER.     At last    a sentimental moment - romantic music swelling - like Liza\nMinelli at    the end    of \"Cabaret\".\n\nUntil the waving hand viciously cracks against the wooden front gate as the\ncar squeezes past.\n\n                                                           MIX THROUGH TO:\n\nINT.

Said\n               good things about you. So expect a great reception back home,\n               huh?\n\nBEAN delighted. Promotion is in his sights. He studies his watch.              He's\nbeing polite but held really like to get going.\n\n                                                                                      116\n\n                                       KEVIN\n               Good-bye Beanie.

Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?      I know\n              it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.\n\nBEAN    nods abruptly, picks up his case, checks his watch and goes. He doesn't\nlook    back. Kevin and David turn and walk away. DAVID does stop to look back\nover    his shoulder at BEAN, heading off in the distance. But BEAN doesn't\nturn,    so DAVID walks on.\n\nThen there is suddenly a tap on his shoulder. It's BEAN, ,as though he's\nmagically jumped there. He gives DAVID a big bear hug, a big grin, and then a\nlittle wave - and heads away. In the distance, he treads on the back of ,some\none's shoe.\n\n                                                       MIX THROUGH TO:\n\nEXT.    THE NATIONAL GALLERY.

Then, from behind a pillar, LORD\nWALTON.\n\n                          LORD WALTON\n               Is he gone?\n\n                          MISS HUTCHINSON\n               Yes, my lord.\n\n                           LORD WALTON\n               Tell the others.\n\n                           MISS HUTCHINSON\n               Very well, my lord.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\n\nINT.   PITCH DARK ROOM.       DAY.\n\nPitch dark. A door opens and the light from the corridor falls on the 150\ngallery employees squashed into this one tiny room. It's the gent's loo.\n\n                                                                              118\n\nMISS HUTCHINSON's head pops in.\n\n                                  MISS HUTCHINSON\n                   He's gone.\n\nMassive cheer, bowlers in the air, massive music.     Roll credits.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\nEXT.   BEAN'S HOUSE        DAY.\n\nBehind the credits, we see close-ups of BEAN hammering away at large planks of\nwood on some wooden structure.\n\nHe walks    away from it - without us seeing what it is\nand goes    to his Mini, where TEDDY sits on a pile of books in the front seat,\nwearing a    seat belt. Bean gets into the car, which is laden with suitcases,\nstarts it    up and drives ....\n\n.... straight into the huge crate he has built.     A rope tied to the back\nbumper pulls the lid closed behind him.\n\n                                                                         CUT TO:\n\nEXT.   MOTORWAY.    DAY.\n\nThe crate sits on the back of a speeding truck.\n                                                                       CUT TO:\n\nEXT.   AIRPORT.   DAY.\n\nThe crate is now on the top of a forklift truck moving up the ramp on an\nAmerican airline cargo plane. Close up on a large sticker on the crate: it\nreads: \"DAVID LEARY, 23 WOODFORD AVENUE, CHESTERFIELD, CALIFORNIA. HANDLE\nWITH CARE.\n\n\nAnd cut to the plane flying through clear skies.   Though, for the Lear's of\ncourse there are no clear skies ahead.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nBean\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Richard Curtist\u00a0\u00a0Robin Briscoll\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:20:33.482417"}
