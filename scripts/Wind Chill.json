UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - DAY                              1\n\n    A GIRL'S FACE\n\n    fills the screen, twenty-one years old, pensive, pretty.\n\n    Camera lingers on her in CLOSE UP, noticing details: hair\n    worn stylishly messy, no makeup, double-pierced ears (though\n    no earrings today), the corner of her bottom lip a little\n    frayed where she's been chewing it ruminatively.\n\n    She's the kind of beauty who can withstand such bad lighting:\n    institutional lighting, florescents HUMMING overhead, joining\n    the chorus of ambient noises: a COUGH, papers RUSTLING, the\n    SCRIBBLE of a pen, someone SHIFTING in their chair, etc. The\n    shot lingers until it becomes uncomfortable, invasive,\n    scrutinizing this unhappy girl in an unguarded moment, then -\n\n    A new sound breaks her reverie, a muted BUZZING o.s., and her\n    eyes cut down to -\n\n    HER CELLPHONE\n\n    skittering sideways across the closed cover of her blue final\n    exam book, like a bug.

Wrap it up!\n\n    There's a collective GROAN and the sound of two hundred\n    panicked asses twisting in their seats.\n\n    Our girl feels her phone buzz, looks down to see a final text\n    message from her friend:\n\n                     y don't u check the ride board?\n    A slow smile lights up her face at the idea, as all around\n    her students rise and begin stampeding out.\n\n                        PROCTOR (O.S.)

NEW ENGLAND UNIVERSITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY               3\n\n    Campus is a ghost town, most students having already left for\n    the holidays: the DORMS abandoned, the LIBRARY STACKS empty,\n    the LABS silent, the DINING HALLS eerie.\n\n    Our GIRL hurries across the deserted college green dotted\n    with little hillocks of snow from an earlier storm. She\n    passes a forlorn pine tree decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS,\n    on her way to...\n\n\n4   EXT. UNIVERSITY - QUAD - DAY                                    4\n\n    She arrives at a large, partially-enclosed KIOSK covered with\n    dozens of student-made notices, printed in a rainbow of eye-\n    catching computer fonts and colors. A sign at the top reads:\n    RIDE BOARD.\n\n    She scans the posted notices. One catches her eye: torn\n    hastily from a spiral notebook, on which is scrawled a\n    handwritten message:\n\n\n                  NE1 Need a Ride 2 Delaware 12/23?\n                           Call 607-154-9835\n    A gust of wind riffles the notice.\n\n\n    TITLE CARD ON BLACK:\n\n                          DECEMBER 23, 3:12 P.M.\n\n\n5   EXT. UNIVERSITY - STUDENT PARKING LOT - DAY                     5\n\n    Our girl wheels her suitcase across a largely-empty parking\n    lot. It's late afternoon, and already dark enough for the\n    sodium vapor streetlights to have come on. A few snowflakes\n    swirl in their sickbed glow.\n\n    We follow her to...\n\n    A beat-to-shit 1988 OLDSMOBILE idling in the middle of the\n    lot. An unbroken dusting of snow indicates it's been the\n    only vehicle here for some time.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n      WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                   4.\n5    CONTINUED:                                                     5\n\n\n    An underclassman GUY, 19, is asleep behind the wheel of the\n    Oldsmobile. He's skinny, dressed in thrift-shop clothes, has\n    the complexion of someone who doesn't get out in the sun\n    much. His car is filled with all of his earthly possessions:\n    books, CD's in plastic milk crates, dirty laundry, etc.\n\n    She knocks on the driver's side window, startling him awake.\n\n    He stirs, blinks uncomprehendingly at the empty parking lot.\n\n                        GIRL\n              Do you think you could have parked\n              any further from the entrance?\n\n    The sight of her quickly snaps him awake.

What are you waiting for? I\n               thought you wanted to stay ahead of\n               the snow?\n\n    He hurries back to the driver's seat.   Starts the engine.\n\n    She hurriedly crams everything back in and slams the trunk.\n    Then runs around to the passenger side and pulls on the door\n    handle.\n\n    Stuck.\n\n\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n           WIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                    6.\n5         CONTINUED: (3)                                                 5\n\n\n         Now it's her turn to look impatient.
