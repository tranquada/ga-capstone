Then another BLUE\n    runs the opposite way, closer in the foreground. BROWNS VS.\n    BLUES?? The SILENCE is crawling, deafening, and then...\n\n<b>    BOOM.\n</b>\n    ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.

KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut\n    and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley. A BUM\n    holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it.\n\n    From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN &amp; BLUE\n    combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS.   In the top right corner\n    of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE, somewhat\n    transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to\n    your own reflection on a TV).\n\n    We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE.\n    KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the\n    third floor window - and then, coming from the REAR SURROUND\n    SPEAKERS, behind us:\n\n    A VOICE - almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be\n    outdoors in this environment... and TOO YOUNG to possibly\n    belong to KABLE.\n\n<b>                           VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>                     (clean, disconnected)\n                 Eat shit please.\n\n    THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cuts\n    back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front.\n    Inside a CLERK \"air\" bags groceries for an empty store.\n\n    A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a\n    bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets seem\n    almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his\n    left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting\n    the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TAT\n    TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some\n    clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the\n    ground, dead.\n\n    Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on\n    him. Uh oh...\n\n    BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the\n    knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing\n    straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobbles\n    over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees.\n    The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and\n    bone TRIPOD.\n\n\n<b>                                                           (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                                      5.\n</b><b>                             WHITE KABLE SCRIPT - 9/19/2007\n</b><b>8    CONTINUED:                                                              8\n</b>\n<b>     VROOOOOOSH!!!
