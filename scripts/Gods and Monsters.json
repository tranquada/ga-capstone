The Monster stares at\n     her.  \"Friend?\" he asks, tenderly, desperately.\n\n     EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT (B & W)\n\n     Lightning splits the black-and-white sky, revealing a single\n     shattered oak in a desolate landscape.  Below, a HUMAN\n     SILHOUETTE stumbles through the darkness, the top of his\n     head flat, his arms long and heavy, his boots weighted with\n     mud.\n\n     Suddenly the storm fades.  Light creeps into the scene, and\n     color, as we DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     THE PACIFIC OCEAN\n\n     melting into a hazy morning sky.  In a box canyon off the\n     coast highway, we see row after neat row of trailer homes, a\n     makeshift village for beach bums.\n\n     INT. TRAILER - DAY\n\n     CLAYTON BOONE opens his eyes.  He is 26, handsome in a\n     rough-hewn, Chet Baker-like way, with broad shoulders and a\n     flattop haircut.  He grabs a crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes,\n     lights a bent cigarette.\n\n     Clay stands and walks bare-assed across the single tin room,\n     his head almost touching the ceiling.\n\n     EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY\n\n     Clay goes a few rounds with a weatherstained speed bag\n     that's set up behind his trailer.\n\n     INT. TRAILER - DAY\n\n     Clay towels off, glances at the morning paper.  He moves\n     aside a pile of paperbacks on a card table until he finds a\n     calendar.  His finger targets today's first appointment.\n     \"10 A.M. - 788 Amalfi Drive.\"\n\n     EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY\n\n     Clay steps out of the trailer, clean-shaven and dressed in\n     dungarees, a T-shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped\n     into one sleeve.  He weight-lifts a secondhand mower onto\n     the bed of his rusty pick-up.\n\n     Clay climbs into the truck, slides the key into the\n     ignition.  It takes a few tries but the engine finally turns\n     over.\n\n     EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY\n\n     Clay's truck sails down the road, \"Hound Dog\" blaring on the\n     radio.  MAIN TITLES END.\n\n     EXT. COLONIAL-STYLE HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Sprinklers twirl on a grassy slope outside a rambling\n     clapboard house.  Below, a swimming pool forms a perfect\n     rectangle of still water.  A title reads: SANTA MONICA\n     CANYON.  1957.\n\n     The pick-up drives past.  Clay parks in the back, hops out.\n\n     ANGLE - HOUSE\n\n     A SHADOWY FIGURE stands at a window, watching Clay unload\n     his red power mower.\n\n     INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n     The shadow is a man with dove white hair, wearing a dress\n     shirt and seersucker jacket.  This is JAMES WHALE, age 67.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                    I'd have more peace of mind if the\n                    live-in nurse were still here.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    She was nothing but bother.

She\n     is a squat, muffin-faced Hungarian woman in her late 50s,\n     dressed in black, her hair cinched in a tight bun.  She\n     speaks with a thick accent.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                    You'll contact me if there's an\n                    emergency?\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    Yes, I call you at this number.\n                         (calls out)\n                    Mr. Jimmy?

Why not?\n\n     He moves into the dining room, sits opposite David.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Isn't Hanna a peach?\n\n     Hanna ignores him, returns to the kitchen.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                    She tells me you haven't been\n                    sleeping well.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    It's the ridiculous pills they\n                    prescribe.  If I take them, I spend\n                    the next day stupid as a stone.\n                    If I don't, my mind seems to go off\n                    in a hundred directions at once --\n\n                                     DAVID\n                    Then take the pills.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    I wanted to be alert for your visit\n                    today.  Especially since I saw so\n                    little of you in the hospital.\n\n     The remark hits its target.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                    I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this\n                    movie and two difficult stars --\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    \"The fault, dear David, is not in\n                    ourselves but in our stars.\"\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         (too anxious to laugh)\n                    You remember how a production eats\n                    up one's life.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in\n                    making you feel guilty.\n                         (stands)\n                    You better go, my boy.  You'll be\n                    late for that aeroplane.\n\n     David extends his hand, but Whale draws him into a hug.  As\n     he starts out, David points to a framed painting.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                    By the way, I like the Renoir.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Thank you.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                         (calls out)\n                    Goodbye, Hanna.\n\n     Hanna runs out of the kitchen to escort David to the door.\n     Whale drifts back to the window, watches as Clay revs up the\n     lawnmower, creating a cloud of white smoke.  We CUT TO:\n\n     EXT. STREETS OF DUDLEY - DAY (1900)\n\n     A bean-pole child with flaming red hair (WHALE at age 12)\n     stares up at the coal smoke pouring from a seemingly endless\n     row of chimneys.  We're in Dudley, a factory town in the\n     English Midlands region known as the Black Country.\n\n                                     SARAH WHALE (O.S.)\n                    Stop lagging behind, Jimmy.  We'll\n                    be late for church.\n\n                                     YOUNG WHALE\n                    Yes, Mum.\n\n     Whale runs to catch up to his six brothers and sisters.  His\n     father, WILLIAM WHALE, frowns at the boy's prissy trot.\n\n                                     WILLIAM WHALE\n                    Straighten up, son.\n\n     Young Whale's movements thicken into a dim imitation of\n     manly reserve.  The Whale family marches up a steeply\n     mounting street to Dixon's Green Methodist Church.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n     Whale's eyes tighten.  He focuses on Clay Boone as he peels\n     off his T-shirt, revealing a tattoo on his upper right\n     forearm.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Hanna?

I\n                    hire him while you were in the\n                    hospital.  He came cheap.\n\n     Whale nods, chooses a walking stick.  He emerges into the\n     sunlight.\n\n     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Whale moves jauntily onto the front lawn, singing to\n     himself:\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    The bells of hell go ting-a-ling\n                    For you but not for me.\n                    Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling?\n                    Grave where thy victory?\n\n     Whale steps up next to Clay.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Good morning.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                         (not looking up)\n                    Mornin'.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    My name is Whale.

Good for you.  You\n                    must have served in Korea.\n\n     Clay shrugs nonchalantly.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Getting to be a warm day.

Keep up\n                    the fine work.\n\n     Whale heads off, smiling to himself.  Pleased to be naughty\n     again.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY\n\n     The room is filled with unframed canvasses, many of them\n     copies of paintings by the Old Masters.\n\n     Whale rolls out the easel, lifts a half-painted canvas into\n     position.  He stares at the blotches of color, trying to\n     remember what he intended to paint.\n\n     Whale pulls out a heavy volume on Rembrandt, opens to a\n     black-and-white plate of \"The Polish Rider.\"  We CUT TO:\n\n     INT. WHALE HOUSE - DUDLEY - NIGHT (1908)\n\n     A rough pencil outline of the same painting.  Whale, age 16,\n     sits on his bed, ignoring the roughhousing of the three\n     younger BROTHERS who share the room.

You could do this\n                    scene in your sleep.\n\n     Clive grits his teeth and nods.  Whale positions them in\n     front of the upended table, Clive and Thesiger holding\n     Elsa's robe out by the hems.  The shadow of the sound boom\n     passes back and forth while they rehearse.\n\n                                     ERNEST THESIGER\n                    I gather we not only did her hair\n                    but dressed her.

Fully engaged,\n     intensely alive.  We CUT TO:\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Whale glances at the clock, sees that it is 3:15.  He is\n     wide awake.  He reaches over, picks up the Luminal.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Luminal.  Illumine all.\n\n     Whale reluctantly places the pill on his tongue and\n     swallows.  He rests his head on the pillow and stares at the\n     ceiling, where the reflection of the window sheers casts an\n     ever-shifting pattern of light and dark.  We move down to\n     reveal:\n\n     INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT (BLACK & WHITE)\n\n     It's a cobblestone cell, a plaster set from \"Bride of\n     Frankenstein.\"  Whale sits in a massive chair, straining\n     against thick iron chains, as a lightning storm rages\n     outside.  In the distance, heavy footsteps, coming closer,\n     until the cell door is filled with the silhouette of the\n     Monster.  Whale hardly dares to breathe as the Monster rips\n     off the door and enters the cell.\n\n     The Monster steps into the light, allowing us to see his\n     face for the first time.  It is Clay Boone, dressed in a\n     Marine parade uniform.  He uses his hedge clippers to cut\n     the chains from around Whale's chest.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Thank you.  Thank you so much.\n\n     Clay leans down and takes Whale in his arms, cradling him\n     like a child.  They move across the sound stage -- Clay\n     carefully sidestepping the lights and cables on the floor --\n     until they reach the next set:\n\n     EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT\n\n     Clay carries Whale past a painted backdrop of a stormy\n     English countryside.\n\n     INT. FRANKENSTEIN'S LAB - NIGHT\n\n     Whale lies on the Bride's table.  Clay pulls on a doctor's\n     smock, picks up a scalpel from a table covered with various\n     medical instruments.  he carves a thin circle around the top\n     of Whale's forehead.  Then, with one deft movement, he pops\n     off Whale's scalp and pulls out the brain.  It is\n     soot-covered, charred, used up.\n\n     Whale watches with detached fascination as Clay tosses it on\n     the floor, then takes a throbbing, luminous mass from a\n     tray.\n\n     Clay inserts the new brain into Whale's skull, sutures the\n     scalp back into place.  he fastens the conducting clamps\n     around Whale's temples, then throws the heavy circuit\n     breaker.  Lights throb with bursts of energy...loose sparks\n     crackle...rotary sparks create snapping circles of fire...as\n     the energy of the raging storm is harnessed into the\n     machinery.\n\n     Clay steps back to take in his handiwork.  A sudden look of\n     panic fills Whale's face.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    It isn't working.  The experiment\n                    is a failure.\n\n     Clay glances down at Whale, whose breathing is slowing.\n     Realizing that the new brain hasn't taken:\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Just go to sleep.\n\n     A serenity suffuses Whale's features as he stares up at the\n     pale flicker of lightning.  His breathing finally stops, his\n     face a tranquil mask of death.  We CUT TO:\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Whale wakes with a start.  He checks the clock, sees that\n     it's past nine.  He presses an intercom button on the\n     bedside table.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    I'm up, Hanna.\n\n     Whale sits up, drinks in the sunlight.  He notices some\n     grass clippings and leaves scattered on the bedspread.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    What in God's name --\n\n     Whale turns and sees Clay lying next to him.

We CUT TO:\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Whale opens his eyes groggily.  He scans the room in panic,\n     clearly unable to get his bearings.\n\n     Whale tries to stand but his legs give way beneath him.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY (LATER)\n\n     Whale and Hanna stare straight out as she reaches down and\n     unbuttons the tiny buttons on his pajama fly.  Whale\n     supports himself with one hand on Hanna's shoulder as he\n     relieves himself with the other.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY (LATER)\n\n     Whale sits up in bed, staring dumbly at the morning paper.\n     Hanna reaches in to take away the breakfast tray.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Does the yardman come today?\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    Of course.

WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Whale and Hanna go through the closet together.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting\n                    friend.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    I'd hardly call our yardman a\n                    friend.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    No.  But someone you can talk to.\n\n     Whale stops, turns to Hanna.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Do you miss having someone to talk\n                    to, Hanna?\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    I have my family.  Also our Lord\n                    Jesus Christ.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Of course.  How is the old boy\n                    these days?\n\n     The naughty remark is met with a solemn stare.  Whale\n     reaches up, chooses a lightweight blue suit.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    It needs a hat.  There was a\n                    wide-brimmed cream fedora...\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    It must be up in your old room.  I\n                    will look.\n\n     The phone rings.  Hanna hurries to answer it.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MAIN HALL - DAY\n\n     Hanna speaks softly in Hungarian.  Whale points upstairs to\n     let her know he will look for the hat himself.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Whale opens the closet door and takes down a stack of\n     hatboxes from the overhead shelf.  He opens the first box,\n     takes out a rubbery wad of heavy fabric with two round\n     windows like eyes.  It's a gas mask.  We CUT TO:\n\n     INT. TRENCHES - NIGHT (1917)\n\n     The night sky explodes with light and smoke.  Whale moves\n     calmly through the chaos, trying to maintain a modicum of\n     order among the troops.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Gas masks on.  Gas masks on.\n\n     At the end of the line, young Barnett is struggling with his\n     straps.  Mustard gas is starting to stream into the trench.\n\n                                     BARNETT\n                    Don't mind me, Lieutenant.  Save\n                    yourself.\n\n     Whale slips the mask over Barnett's face, fastens it.  He\n     slides his own mask into position moments before the trench\n     is obliterated by the yellowish smoke.  We CUT TO:\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Hanna stands in the door with a forlorn frown.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    Oh, Mr. Jimmy.  You make a mess of\n                    it.  Here.\n\n     Hanna lifts the lid of an unopened box to show him the\n     missing fedora.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                         (stacking boxes)\n                    That is my daughter.  She say she\n                    and her husband are coming to town\n                    this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr.\n                    Jimmy.  I will make it short.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    I'll be out this afternoon,\n                    remember?  Your family can visit as\n                    long as they like.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    No.  I do not cook for them.  My\n                    daughter's no-good husband will not\n                    take one bite of our food.\n\n     Hanna holds out the box for the gas mask.  Whale gives it a\n     long, final look, then drops it in the box.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    You can toss this one in the trash.\n\n     Hanna clamps the lid on the box.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY\n\n     Hanna has opened the door.  At the end of the hall,\n     silhouetted against the bright afternoon sky, is Clay.  His\n     shoulders fill the doorway.  The top of his head is\n     perfectly flat.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Good afternoon, Clayton.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Do I look okay?\n\n     Clay steps into the light.  His khaki pants are clean and\n     pressed.  A blue knit shirt fits his muscles snugly.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    You look splendid, my boy.  Quite\n                    splendid.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY\n\n     Whale crosses to the passenger side of the Chrysler.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    I suppose you'd like the top down.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    If that's okay?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Nothing would please me more.\n\n     Clay squeezes behind the wheel, shifts the seat back,\n     explores switches.  The vinyl top pops up and folds\n     backward.\n\n     Whale gets in.  Clay starts the engine and backs out.\n\n     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Hanna stands at the front door, hands tangled in her apron.\n     Whale tugs his hat brim at her as the car swings around the\n     driveway.\n\n     Whale smiles at the wide open sky overhead.  Clay steps on\n     the gas and the Chrysler takes off.\n\n     EXT. CUKOR HOUSE - DAY\n\n     The party is clearly audible from the road, where Clay has\n     squeezed the Chrysler into a long row of shiny cars nuzzling\n     the high brick wall.  Whale puts his dark glasses on.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Stars, you know.  The suns of other\n                    galaxies.\n\n     They walk up the steep road to the gatehouse.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Good old George.  He loves to put\n                    on the dog.  Only his dogs tend to\n                    have a bit of mutt.\n\n     A WOMAN at the gate inspects the invitation, waves them\n     through.\n\n     EXT. CUKOR HOUSE - LAWN - DAY\n\n     A sunny patio with hedges and statues.  Wickets and stakes\n     have been set up for a game of croquet, but only a handful\n     of very tanned children strut around with mallets.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    What did I tell you?  Listen.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    I don't hear anything.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to\n                    hire music.  There's nothing but\n                    chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard\n                    of English chin-wag.\n\n     Whale scans the crowd.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Slim pickings.  Well, it's early\n                    yet.  Perhaps this is a good time\n                    to pay our respects.\n\n     Clay follows Whale toward a trellis alcove covered in ivy.\n     A handful of people grin at the mismatched couple who stand\n     in the shade: a homely older man in glasses and a pretty\n     woman in a white dress with polka dots.  GEORGE CUKOR and\n     PRINCESS MARGARET.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Let's get this over with quickly.\n\n     Whale forgets to remove his hat when he comes forward.\n     Before he can give Cukor their names Princess Margaret's\n     polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth.\n\n                                     PRINCESS MARGARET\n                    I had no idea you'd be here.\n\n     She seizes Whale's hand in her little white gloves.\n\n                                     PRINCESS MARGARET\n                    How are you?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                         (taken aback)\n                    Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal\n                    Highness?\n\n                                     PRINCESS MARGARET\n                    Splendid.  Now that I know you're\n                    around.\n\n     Standing beside him, Clay is clearly impressed that Whale\n     knows a princess.\n\n                                     PRINCESS MARGARET\n                    Can we get together while I'm in\n                    town?  I so badly want to sit for\n                    you again.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Sit?\n\n                                     PRINCESS MARGARET\n                    I've changed my hair, you see.\n                    Since our last session.  Those old\n                    snaps look rather dowdy now.\n\n     Whale realizes she's mistaken him for someone else.  He tugs\n     his sunglasses down his nose so she can see his eyes.\n\n                                     PRINCESS MARGARET\n                    Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James\n                    Whale.\n\n                                     PRINCESS MARGARET\n                         (laughs)\n                    I am such a goose.  I mistook you\n                    for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat.\n                    You're wearing one of Cecil's hats,\n                    you know.\n\n     Whale attempts to chuckle while he fights a feeling of\n     humiliation.  He turns to Cukor for help.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Hello, George.  James Whale.  David\n                    Lewis's friend.  I once made\n                    pictures myself, Ma'am.\n\n                                     GEORGE CUKOR\n                    Yes.  Of course.  One can't throw a\n                    rock in this town without hitting\n                    one of us old movie directors.\n\n     Whale feels the sting.  He turns to Clay.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Ma'am, may I present Mr. Clayton\n                    Boone?\n\n     Clay steps forward to shake hands.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    My gardener, who insisted I bring\n                    him today.  He so wanted to meet\n                    royalty.\n\n     Cukor's face goes blank with indignation.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Pleased to meet you.\n\n                                     PRINCESS MARGARET\n                    Quite.  I adore gardens.\n\n     Whale narrows his eyes at Cukor and sharpens his smile.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    He's never met a princess.  Only\n                    queens.\n\n     Cukor puffs out his chest, quivers a bulbous lower lip at\n     Whale.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    George, Ma'am, this has been an\n                    honor.  An occasion to remember for\n                    the rest of my days.\n\n     He leads Clay away and an American couple promptly crowd in\n     to take their place.  Striding through the garden, Whale is\n     obviously pleased with himself.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    What was that about?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Nothing of importance.  Just two\n                    old men slapping each other with\n                    lilies.  Shall we have a drink?\n\n     Whale leads Clay to a tented bar.  Across the way, David\n     Lewis has come through the gate with a WOMAN on his arm.\n     People look discreetly, not at David but at the woman,\n     lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Who's that?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    David.

Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n     Clay watches in amazement as ELIZABETH TAYLOR waves to\n     someone and pipes out a happy hello.  She hurriedly unties\n     her scarf, thrusts it at David and runs off on tiptoes to\n     embrace a woman.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Is that really her?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    David produced her last picture.\n\n     David glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat\n     pocket.  He sees Whale looking at him.  He puts on a tight\n     smile and strolls across the patio.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                    What are you doing here?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Just what I was about to ask you.\n                    I thought you were in New York.\n\n                                     DAVID\n                    I was, until last night.  Publicity\n                    asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for\n                    today's reception.\n\n     The waiter arrives with their drinks.

Karloff gurgles and\n     coos at the child.\n\n                                     ELSA LANCHESTER\n                    And what do you make of our royal\n                    visitant?\n\n                                     BORIS KARLOFF\n                    Perfectly charming.

A hussy in tennis\n                    shoes?\n\n     Whale looks up and discovers Clay standing a few feet behind\n     Karloff.  He is ogling two bosomy actresses who are\n     listening intently to the monocled British consul.\n\n     Whale's eyes try to focus Karloff and Clay together, his\n     once and future monsters.  Kay shouts to a passing\n     photographer carrying a bulky Speed Graphic.\n\n                                     KAY\n                    Hey, you!  With the camera!

Right.\n\n     Karloff and Elsa drift into position next to Whale.  The\n     flash goes off, a snap and a crunch of light.  Whale cringes\n     in pain.\n\n                                     ELSA LANCHESTER\n                         (through clenched teeth)\n                    Don't you just love being famous?\n\n     Another flash.  From Whale's perspective, the bulb resembles\n     nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical\n     current from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.  Whale\n     concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his\n     brain.  He clutches Elsa Lanchester's hand.\n\n                                     ELSA LANCHESTER\n                    Are you all right, Jimmy?\n\n     A sharp nod from Whale.

Karloff gently cradles the\n     child.  Whale stands on his left, Elsa on his right.  They\n     all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up.  Whale\n     follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks\n     and strains in a furious electrical storm.\n\n     The camera flashes once, then again.\n\n                                     PHOTOGRAPHER\n                    Got it!\n\n     Whale glances up -- the kite is gone.  Thunder rumbles as\n     the group starts to disperse.  Whale nods to the faces\n     exchanging good-byes.\n\n                                     BORIS KARLOFF\n                    So good to see you again, James.\n\n     He strolls off, clucking and cooing at his baby.\n\n                                     KAY\n                    Catch you before you go, Mr. Whale.\n                    I'll make sure everybody gets sent\n                    a print.\n\n     He goes off with the photographer.

On the patio, everyone shoves and squeezes\n     to get through the one open door.\n\n     Whale stares out, hypnotized by the deluge.  From his POV,\n     we see a young man step into the rain.

Especially in\n                    light of the journey I'm about to\n                    make.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    You're planning a trip?\n\n     Whale's gaze remains dreamy and preoccupied as SOUNDS of\n     battle fill the room.  A relentless rat-a-tat of gunfire.\n     The whistling of bombs.  The tortured wailing of dying men.\n     Whale stands, moves over to the window.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Barnett.

From his POV, we see a\n     scarred and barren landscape, illuminated by occasional\n     flashes of lightning.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    He caught his one night coming back\n                    from the reconnoiter.  I wouldn't\n                    take him out, but McGill did.  Just\n                    to give the lad a taste.  They were\n                    nearly home when a Maxim gun opened\n                    fire.\n\n     EXT. TRENCHES - NIGHT (1917)\n\n     We race along the open trench with Whale, the darkened sky\n     intermittently punctured by bursts of gunfire.  He reaches\n     the periscope, pulls an enlisted man off it.  From his POV,\n     we see Barnett and McGill dodging bullets as they attempt to\n     make their way back.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                         (through clenched teeth)\n                    Come on.  Come on.\n\n     McGill leaps over the barbed wire of a forward trench.\n     Barnett follows.  Just as his feet leave the ground his\n     chest is riddled by a fresh round of gunfire.  Whale's eyes\n     snap closed, trying to obliterate what they've just seen.\n\n                                     WHALE (V.O.)\n                    Barnett's body fell in wire as\n                    thick as briers.  It was hanging\n                    there the next morning, a hundred\n                    yards from the line, too far out\n                    for anyone to fetch it.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Whale stares out impassively.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    We saw him at morning stand-to and\n                    evening stand-to.  \"Good morning,\n                    Barnett,\" we'd say each day.\n                    \"How's ole Barnett looking this\n                    morning?\"  \"Seems a little peaky.\n                    Looks a little plumper.\"  His\n                    wounds faced the other way and his\n                    hat shielded his eyes, so one could\n                    imagine he was napping on\n                    bedsprings.  He hung there until we\n                    were relieved.  We introduced him\n                    to the new unit before we marched\n                    out, speaking highly of his\n                    companionship.\n\n     Clay's eyes are filled with pity.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Oh, but we were a witty lot.\n                    Laughing at our dead.  Telling\n                    ourselves it was our death too.\n                    But with each man who died, I\n                    thought, \"Better you than me, poor\n                    sod.\"\n                         (bitterly)\n                    A whole generation was wiped out by\n                    that war.

It can't hurt you\n                    now.  It's no good to dig it up.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Oh no, my friend.  It's digging\n                    itself up.  There is nothing in the\n                    here and now to take my mind off\n                    it.  All my diversions have\n                    abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading.\n                    Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone\n                    to me now.\n\n     Whale remains perfectly still, staring out the window.  Clay\n     deliberates a moment, then puts down his drink next to the \n     decanter of Scotch.  He stands and yanks the neck of the \n     sweater over his face, then tosses it on the sofa.  Whale \n     blinks at the reflection in the glass, not yet \n     understanding.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    You wanted to draw me like a Greek\n                    statue.  All right, then.\n\n     Clay pulls at the knot, lets go of the towel.  He defiantly\n     parks his hands on his hips.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    There.  Not so bad.\n\n     Whale continues to stare at the reflection, his back to\n     Clay, his eyes wide and expressionless.  He turns slowly,\n     fully expecting the vision to evaporate.  When he sees that\n     Clay is truly naked he mutters softly under his breath.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    So it is going to happen after all.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    What'd you say?\n\n     Whale doesn't respond.  Finally he opens his mouth to take a\n     breath.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    No.  It won't do.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    What won't do?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    You are much too human.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    What did you expect?

WHALE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Whale passes quickly through the dining room and out to the\n     kitchen.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT\n\n     Whale reaches for the hatbox, which sits on top of a garbage\n     can.  Suddenly a large hand appears on the box.  Whale gasps\n     when a flash of lightning reveals the face of the Monster.\n\n     The Monster growls out an inarticulate greeting.  He picks\n     up the box and hands it to Whale.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Whale removes the lid, sets the hatbox on the sofa.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    I would like you to wear this?\n\n     Whale steps back.  Clay takes the box and covers his lap\n     with it.  He lifts out the gas mask.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Why?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    For the artistic effect.  The\n                    combination of your human body and\n                    that inhuman mask.

Clay's vision is enclosed in\n     two round windows, so he can't see Whale buckling the second\n     strap.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Now what?\n\n     Mouth muffled by the inhalator, Clay hears his voice from\n     inside his head.  Whale comes around to stand in front of\n     him.  He grins as he steps back to examine Clay.  Clay\n     nervously taps his knees with his hands.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    All right.  Let's take it off now.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    What was that?\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    It's too tight.\n\n     Clay raises his voice to make himself heard.  He reaches\n     back to undo the buckles.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Allow me.\n\n     Whale steps in past the goggles.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    We don't want to tear the straps.\n\n     Clay drops his hands so Whale can undo the buckles.  But\n     nothing happens.  Clay turns left and right.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Oh yes.  I am still here.\n\n     Two hands grip Clay's shoulders.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    What steely muscles, Clayton.\n\n     Whale's hands squeeze.  Clay grabs the frame of his seat, to\n     stop his arms from automatically swinging a fist.  Whale's\n     hand slides over Clay's shoulder to his arm, caressing the\n     tattoo.  Clay jerks his shoulder to shake Whale off.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Just take off the fucking mask!\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you.\n                    I can't hear a word.\n\n     Whale presses his lips to Clay's tattoo.  Clay's muscles\n     tense from head to toe.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    What a solid brute you are.\n\n     Whale's tongue moves down Clay's arm.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    No?  Maybe this, then?\n\n     The hand slides over Clay's stomach toward his lap.  The\n     tattooed arm swings backward, slamming an elbow against\n     Whale's skull.  Clay jumps from the chair, knocking into an\n     end table.  The glass and crystal decanter fall to the\n     floor.  The lamp spills over and the room goes dark.\n\n     Clay's ankle is caught by the sofa leg and he hits the\n     floor, jamming the inhalator against his mouth.  He quickly\n     gets up, on his knees and elbows, pulling at the mask.\n     Flashes of lightning strobe the room as Whale collapses over\n     Clay's back and holds on.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Oh yes.  I have you now.\n\n     A strap breaks.  Clay rips the mask off.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Get the fuck off!\n\n     Whale's hand squeezes between Clay's legs.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    What will you do to get yourself\n                    back?\n\n     Clay jabs with his elbow, flipping Whale on his back.  His\n     body straddles Whale's and pins him, face to face.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    I'm not that way.  Get it through\n                    your fucking head.  I don't want to\n                    mess with you.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.\n\n     His hands clasp Clay's hips.  Clay's fist opens as it comes\n     down; he slaps Whale across the face.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    That didn't even sting.  You're not\n                    such a real man after all.  Are\n                    you?\n\n     Clay whacks Whale's face again.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Wait until I tell my friends I had\n                    you naked in my arms.  Won't they\n                    be surprised?\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    I haven't done a damn thing with\n                    you!\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Oh, but you have.  You undressed\n                    for me.  I kissed you.  I even\n                    touched your prick.  How will you\n                    be able to live with yourself?\n\n     Clay snatches Whale's wrist before it can touch his crotch.\n     With his other hand he picks up the heavy crystal decanter.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    What the hell do you want from me?!\n\n     Whale tilts his face up for another blow.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    I want you to kill me.\n\n     Clay freezes.  He stares down at the old man with white hair\n     and wild eyes lying beneath him.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Break my neck.  Or strangle me.

Please, Clayton.\n                    We've come this far.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    You're crazy.\n\n     Whale's eyes glimmer in the sporadic bursts of lightning.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Exactly, I'm losing my mind.\n                    Every day, another piece goes.\n                    Soon there will be nothing left.\n                    Look at the sketch I made of you.\n\n     Clay turns to the sketch pad, which lies on the floor next\n     to Whale.  The page is filled with nothing but doodles and\n     scrawls.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Look, if you want to die do it\n                    yourself!\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    No, I don't want to die alone.  But\n                    to be killed by you -- that would\n                    make death bearable.  They say you\n                    never see the one with your name on\n                    it.  But I want to see death coming\n                    at me.  I want it to be sharp and\n                    hard, with a human face.  Your\n                    face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my\n                    second Monster.  Almost as famous\n                    as the first.  It would be the\n                    great adventure you've yearned for.\n                    A war story for both of us to\n                    share.\n\n     Clay's breathing comes in quick, panicked bursts.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    You'd be fully exonerated, I've\n                    taken care of that.

WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Whale sits on the edge of the bed, tugs the bowtie from his\n     collar.  Clay taps on the door, opens it.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    You okay?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Oh Clayton.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Did I hurt you?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Nothing I didn't deserve.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Need some help?\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Pray you, undo this button.\n\n     He lifts his chin and points to his collar.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    I can never manage it when I'm\n                    tired.\n\n     Clay leans in to open the button.  His face is only six\n     inches from Whale's.\n\n                                     WHALE\n                    Do you believe people come into our\n                    lives for a reason?\n\n     Clay doesn't answer.

He stands there a\n     moment.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Clay shakes open a bedsheet and wraps himself in it.\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Clay finds a pack of cigarettes on the floor and lights one,\n     then sets the furniture back up.  He picks up the gas mask\n     from beside the sofa, shoves it into its box.\n\n     Clay sits in the wing-back chair, props his feet on the\n     hassock, adjusting the sheet around his shoulders.  We CUT\n     TO:\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Whale bolts up in bed.  An electrical storm flashes and\n     cracks in the window.\n\n     Whale gets out of bed, stares outside.  From his POV, the\n     lawn is a barren slope covered with stumps.\n\n     Whale turns on the desk lamp, sits.  He pulls out a piece\n     of paper.\n\n     EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT\n\n     We're back to the scene that opened the movie, a flat-topped\n     creature stumbling through the mud.  A flash of lightning\n     reveals Clay's face.  He turns, signals for Whale to follow\n     him.  Whale joins Clay on a slight rise of ground, the rim\n     of a crater.  Clay points down into it.\n\n     EXT. CRATER - NIGHT\n\n     The crater is full of bodies gathered around a pool of\n     water.  Whale stumbles down, reaches the bottom and bends\n     over the nearest corpse in khaki.  It is Leonard Barnett.\n     There are no wounds on his body, no rips or gaping holes.\n     His eyes are closed in dreamless sleep.\n\n     Whale looks up and sees that Clay is gone.  The only other\n     living creature is an owl, which blinks wearily at him.\n\n     Whale lies down, finding a spot next to Barnett.  He takes a\n     last breath and closes his eyes.  We CUT TO:\n\n     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n     A roar of bells blasts Clay awake.  The telephone is\n     ringing.  A hard pair of shoes thunder out to answer it.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    Hello?  Oh, Mr. David!\n\n     Clay blinks at the sight of Hanna in black dress and white\n     apron, chattering on the phone by the far wall.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    No, no, he did not tell me.

I only hope you did\n                    not get him excited.  It could give\n                    him a new stroke.\n\n     She stomps into the kitchen.  Clay gets up, slips on his\n     undershorts.  He's zipping up his chinos when she comes out\n     again with a breakfast tray.  She hands him a cup of coffee.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Thanks.\n                         (quickly)\n                    Why do you do it?\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    What do I do?\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Take care of Mr. Whale like he was\n                    your flesh and blood.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    It is my job.  I did it when he was\n                    happy and it was easy.  It is only\n                    fair I do it now when he is ill.\n                         (picks up the tray)\n                    Enough talk.  I must wake up the\n                    master.\n\n     She marches around the corner towards Whale's bedroom.  Clay\n     hears her knocking on a door.\n\n                                     HANNA (O.S.)\n                    Mr. Jimmy?  Morning, Mr. Jimmy.\n\n     Clay pulls on his shirt.  Hanna comes back around the\n     corner.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    What have you done with him?\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    I put him to bed.

He picks it up.  On the front\n     is scrawled the word 'CLAYTON'.  Clay opens the envelope.\n     Inside is Whale's original sketch of the Monster's head.  He\n     turns it over.  There is a message written on the back.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    No.\n\n     Clay drops the sketch, looks out.  He sees something.\n\n     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY\n\n     Clay crosses the patio, hurtles down the slope.\n\n     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - POOL - DAY\n\n     Clay leaps headfirst into the water.  Whale rests lightly on\n     his back, with an upward sway of straight white hair.  Clay\n     hauls the body toward the side.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Almost there.  Almost there.\n\n     He gets an arm around Whale's chest and heaves the body over\n     the curb.  he climbs out, drags the body forward to rest in\n     the grass.  He grabs the wrist.  Nothing.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Son of a bitch.  You crazy son of a\n                    bitch.\n\n     Clay straddles Whale's thighs and applies pressure on his\n     rib cage.  But it's no use.  Clay sits up and takes a deep\n     breath.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    Ohhh!\n\n     Hanna comes down the path, her run slowing to a walk.  She\n     stares at Clay.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    I didn't do it.

He did it himself.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    He says here good-bye.  I find it\n                    in his room.  He is sorry, he says.\n                    He has had a wonderful life.\n\n     She waves a folded piece of paper.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    You poor, foolish man.

It will be better if I\n                    find the body alone.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    But how're you going to explain\n                    this?\n                         (points at the body)\n                    How did you get him out of the\n                    pool?\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    You are right.  Yes.  We must put\n                    him back.\n\n     They both hesitate, looking down at Whale.  Then Clay drags\n     the body parallel with the pool.  Hanna stoops over to\n     adjust the collar of Whale's shirt.\n\n                                     HANNA\n                    Poor Mr. Jimmy.  We do not mean\n                    disrespect.  You will keep better\n                    in water.\n\n     She nods to Clay.  He rolls the body over and it splashes on\n     its belly.  It bounces a moment in the waves of the splash,\n     then begins to sink.  As it drops, the air in the chest\n     slowly flips the body around.\n\n     Looking up at them with open eyes, Whale sinks backward into\n     the thickening light.  His arms trail upward and the hands\n     lightly flutter as if waving good-bye.  The melancholy sound\n     of a solo violin pierces the silence as we CUT TO:\n\n     EXT./INT. BLIND MAN'S HUT - NIGHT\n\n     A black-and-white scene from \"Bride of Frankenstein.\"  The\n     old BLIND MAN plays a mournful lullaby on his violin while\n     the MONSTER listens outside, moved by the music.  He smashes\n     open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the\n     soul-soothing sound.  The blind man stops playing, looks up.\n\n                                     BLIND MAN\n                    Who is it?  You're welcome, my\n                    friend, whoever you are.\n\n     The Monster attempts to communicate, manages only a\n     plaintive moan.  The blind man stands.\n\n                                     BLIND MAN\n                    I cannot see you.  I cannot see\n                    anything.  You must please excuse\n                    me.  But I am blind.\n\n     The Monster holds out his burned hands.\n\n                                     BLIND MAN\n                    Come in, my poor friend.  No one\n                    will hurt you here.  If you're in\n                    trouble, perhaps I can help you.\n\n     The old man touches the Monster, who recoils with a\n     defensive growl.\n\n                                     BLIND MAN\n                    Can you not speak?  It's strange.\n                    Perhaps you're afflicted too.  I\n                    cannot see and you cannot speak.\n\n     INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT (1972)\n\n     MICHAEL BOONE, 10, lies on the living room carpet, staring\n     raptly at the movie playing on the large Zenith console.\n     The house is small but tidy and comfortable.\n\n                                     BLIND MAN (O.S.)\n                    It's been a long time since any\n                    human being came into this hut.  I\n                    shall look after you.  And you will\n                    comfort me.\n\n     On the tv screen, the old man starts to cry, then collapses\n     onto the Monster's chest.  A thick tear rolls down the\n     Monster's cheek.\n\n     Clay Boone sits on the sofa, a baby on his lap.  He's 40\n     now, his hair starting to thin but still closely cropped at\n     the top and sides.\n\n     On the tv, daylight fills the hut.  The blind man and the\n     Monster share a meal.\n\n                                     BLIND MAN\n                    We are friends, you and I.\n                    Friends.\n\n                                     MONSTER\n                    Friends.\n\n                                     BLIND MAN\n                    Before you came, I was all alone.\n                    It is bad to be alone.\n\n                                     MONSTER\n                    Alone, bad.  Friend, good.\n\n     He takes the old man's hand.\n\n                                     MONSTER\n                    Friend, good.\n\n     The blind man nods.  On the sofa, Clay watches his son watch\n     the movie.\n\n     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)\n\n     A color promo for \"Chiller Theater\" fills the screen.  Clay\n     turns off the set.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Time for bed, sport.\n\n     Michael groans, slowly stands.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    What'd you think of the movie?\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                    Pretty cool.  Better than most\n                    monster movies.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    I knew the guy who made it.\n\n     Michael glances skeptically at his father.\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                    Come on, Dad.  Is this another one\n                    of your stories?\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Here.\n\n     Clay unfolds Whale's sketch of the Monster, hands it to his\n     son.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    It's his original sketch of the\n                    Monster.\n\n     Michael turns over the sketch.  On the back, scrawled in\n     block letters: \"TO CLAYTON BOONE -- FRIEND?\"\n\n                                     MICHAEL\n                    This is for real?\n\n     Clay nods.  At the same time, his wife DANA appears in the\n     doorway.  A pretty, cheerful woman in her mid-30s.\n\n                                     DANA\n                    The trash, Clay.  Before it rains.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Okay.\n\n     Clay kisses the top of his son's head.\n\n                                     CLAY\n                    Off to bed.\n\n     EXT. CLAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Clay carries a large metal bin down the tidy lawn.  The sky\n     momentarily brightens with a silent flash of lightning.\n\n     Clay gazes up at the electrical storm.  He glances back at\n     his house, sees Dana cradling the baby in an upstairs\n     window.\n\n     The skies open with a shattering crash of thunder.  Clay\n     tilts up his face, drinks in the cool rain.  Then he extends\n     his arms and staggers along the sidewalk, imitating the\n     Monster's famous lurch.\n\n     We PULL BACK, revealing a sleepy neighborhood of small\n     houses and neat lawns, until Clay is only a small dot in the\n     landscape.\n\n     FADE OUT.\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGods and Monsters\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Bill Condon\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:26:05.406105"}
