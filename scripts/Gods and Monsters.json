The Monster stares at\n     her.  \"Friend?\" he asks, tenderly, desperately.\n\n<b>     EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT (B &amp; W)\n</b>\n     Lightning splits the black-and-white sky, revealing a single\n     shattered oak in a desolate landscape.  Below, a HUMAN\n     SILHOUETTE stumbles through the darkness, the top of his\n     head flat, his arms long and heavy, his boots weighted with\n     mud.\n\n     Suddenly the storm fades.  Light creeps into the scene, and\n     color, as we DISSOLVE TO:\n\n<b>     THE PACIFIC OCEAN\n</b>\n     melting into a hazy morning sky.  In a box canyon off the\n     coast highway, we see row after neat row of trailer homes, a\n     makeshift village for beach bums.\n\n<b>     INT. TRAILER - DAY\n</b>\n     CLAYTON BOONE opens his eyes.  He is 26, handsome in a\n     rough-hewn, Chet Baker-like way, with broad shoulders and a\n     flattop haircut.  He grabs a crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes,\n     lights a bent cigarette.\n\n     Clay stands and walks bare-assed across the single tin room,\n     his head almost touching the ceiling.\n\n<b>     EXT.

TRAILER - DAY\n</b>\n     Clay towels off, glances at the morning paper.  He moves\n     aside a pile of paperbacks on a card table until he finds a\n     calendar.  His finger targets today's first appointment.\n     \"10 A.M. - 788 Amalfi Drive.\"\n\n<b>     EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY\n</b>\n     Clay steps out of the trailer, clean-shaven and dressed in\n     dungarees, a T-shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped\n     into one sleeve.  He weight-lifts a secondhand mower onto\n     the bed of his rusty pick-up.\n\n     Clay climbs into the truck, slides the key into the\n     ignition.  It takes a few tries but the engine finally turns\n     over.\n\n<b>     EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY\n</b>\n     Clay's truck sails down the road, \"Hound Dog\" blaring on the\n     radio.  MAIN TITLES END.\n\n<b>     EXT. COLONIAL-STYLE HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n     Sprinklers twirl on a grassy slope outside a rambling\n     clapboard house.  Below, a swimming pool forms a perfect\n     rectangle of still water.  A title reads: SANTA MONICA\n<b>     CANYON.  1957.\n</b>\n     The pick-up drives past.  Clay parks in the back, hops out.\n\n<b>     ANGLE - HOUSE\n</b>\n     A SHADOWY FIGURE stands at a window, watching Clay unload\n     his red power mower.\n\n<b>     INT.

We CUT TO:\n\n<b>     EXT.

Striding through the garden, Whale is\n     obviously pleased with himself.\n\n<b>                                     CLAY\n</b>                    What was that about?\n\n<b>                                     WHALE\n</b>                    Nothing of importance.  Just two\n                    old men slapping each other with\n                    lilies.  Shall we have a drink?\n\n     Whale leads Clay to a tented bar.  Across the way, David\n     Lewis has come through the gate with a WOMAN on his arm.\n     People look discreetly, not at David but at the woman,\n     lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses.\n\n<b>                                     CLAY\n</b>                    Who's that?\n\n<b>                                     WHALE\n</b>                    David.

Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n     Clay watches in amazement as ELIZABETH TAYLOR waves to\n     someone and pipes out a happy hello.  She hurriedly unties\n     her scarf, thrusts it at David and runs off on tiptoes to\n     embrace a woman.\n\n<b>                                     CLAY\n</b>                    Is that really her?\n\n<b>                                     WHALE\n</b>                    David produced her last picture.\n\n     David glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat\n     pocket.  He sees Whale looking at him.  He puts on a tight\n     smile and strolls across the patio.\n\n<b>                                     DAVID\n</b>                    What are you doing here?\n\n<b>                                     WHALE\n</b>                    Just what I was about to ask you.\n                    I thought you were in New York.\n\n<b>                                     DAVID\n</b>                    I was, until last night.

Only when Clay takes\n     his glass of beer does David see that Whale is not alone.\n\n<b>                                     DAVID\n</b>                    David Lewis.\n\n<b>                                     CLAY\n</b>                    Clay Boone.\n\n<b>                                     WHALE\n</b>                    Our yardman.

A hussy in tennis\n                    shoes?\n\n     Whale looks up and discovers Clay standing a few feet behind\n     Karloff.  He is ogling two bosomy actresses who are\n     listening intently to the monocled British consul.\n\n     Whale's eyes try to focus Karloff and Clay together, his\n     once and future monsters.  Kay shouts to a passing\n     photographer carrying a bulky Speed Graphic.\n\n<b>                                     KAY\n</b>                    Hey, you!  With the camera!

From Whale's perspective, the bulb resembles\n     nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical\n     current from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.  Whale\n     concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his\n     brain.  He clutches Elsa Lanchester's hand.\n\n<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER\n</b>                    Are you all right, Jimmy?\n\n     A sharp nod from Whale.

Karloff gently cradles the\n     child.  Whale stands on his left, Elsa on his right.  They\n     all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up.  Whale\n     follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks\n     and strains in a furious electrical storm.\n\n     The camera flashes once, then again.\n\n<b>                                     PHOTOGRAPHER\n</b>                    Got it!\n\n     Whale glances up -- the kite is gone.  Thunder rumbles as\n     the group starts to disperse.

He picks it up.  On the front\n     is scrawled the word 'CLAYTON'.  Clay opens the envelope.\n     Inside is Whale's original sketch of the Monster's head.  He\n     turns it over.  There is a message written on the back.\n\n<b>                                     CLAY\n</b>                    No.\n\n     Clay drops the sketch, looks out.  He sees something.\n\n<b>     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY\n</b>\n     Clay crosses the patio, hurtles down the slope.\n\n<b>     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - POOL - DAY\n</b>\n     Clay leaps headfirst into the water.  Whale rests lightly on\n     his back, with an upward sway of straight white hair.  Clay\n     hauls the body toward the side.\n\n<b>                                     CLAY\n</b>                    Almost there.  Almost there.\n\n     He gets an arm around Whale's chest and heaves the body over\n     the curb.  he climbs out, drags the body forward to rest in\n     the grass.  He grabs the wrist.  Nothing.\n\n<b>                                     CLAY\n</b>                    Son of a bitch.  You crazy son of a\n                    bitch.\n\n     Clay straddles Whale's thighs and applies pressure on his\n     rib cage.  But it's no use.  Clay sits up and takes a deep\n     breath.\n\n<b>                                     HANNA\n</b>                    Ohhh!\n\n     Hanna comes down the path, her run slowing to a walk.

It will be better if I\n                    find the body alone.\n\n<b>                                     CLAY\n</b>                    But how're you going to explain\n                    this?\n                         (points at the body)\n                    How did you get him out of the\n                    pool?\n\n<b>                                     HANNA\n</b>                    You are right.  Yes.  We must put\n                    him back.\n\n     They both hesitate, looking down at Whale.  Then Clay drags\n     the body parallel with the pool.  Hanna stoops over to\n     adjust the collar of Whale's shirt.\n\n<b>                                     HANNA\n</b>                    Poor Mr. Jimmy.

It bounces a moment in the waves of the splash,\n     then begins to sink.  As it drops, the air in the chest\n     slowly flips the body around.\n\n     Looking up at them with open eyes, Whale sinks backward into\n     the thickening light.  His arms trail upward and the hands\n     lightly flutter as if waving good-bye.  The melancholy sound\n     of a solo violin pierces the silence as we CUT TO:\n\n<b>     EXT./INT.

He smashes\n     open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the\n     soul-soothing sound.

You're welcome, my\n                    friend, whoever you are.\n\n     The Monster attempts to communicate, manages only a\n     plaintive moan.

A thick tear rolls down the\n     Monster's cheek.\n\n     Clay Boone sits on the sofa, a baby on his lap.  He's 40\n     now, his hair starting to thin but still closely cropped at\n     the top and sides.\n\n     On the tv, daylight fills the hut.
