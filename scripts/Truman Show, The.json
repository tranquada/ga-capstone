A WOMB.  DAY.\n\n     A fiber optic camera observes a five-month-old MALE FETUS as he\n     gently floats, weightless, suspended in the amniotic fluid of\n     his mother's womb.  We focus on the unborn's hand, already a\n     tiny, exquisite work of art, moving towards his newly formed\n     lips.  He sucks his thumb.\n\n\n     INT.  HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     A seconds old BABY BOY - umbilical cord still attached,\n     smeared with blood and protective skin grease - is held up\n     by an anonymous pair of latex gloves to the camera.  Shocked by\n     the unaccustomed light and cool of the delivery room, the\n     newborn fights for his first, arduous breath.  Following almost\n     immediately, a cry.\n\n     From another angle we see the crying infant on a television\n     screen, the individual lines of the screen clearly visible.\n\n     MATCH DISSOLVE TO\n\n\n     INT.  CAR - UTOPIA, QUEENS.  MORNING.\n\n     The face of the baby thirty-four years later, still crying.\n     TRUMAN BURBANK, thinning hair, a body going soft around the\n     edges, appearing older than his thirty-four years sits at the\n     wheel of his eight-year-old Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.  He\n     cries without shame, making no attempt to wipe away the tears.\n\n     Pausing at an intersection in a quiet, working-class suburban\n     street, a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and\n     lands with a deafening crash on the roadway, several yards in\n     front of his idling car.\n\n     Truman exits the Oldsmobile to investigate.  Amidst a sea of\n     shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism.\n\n     He looks around him but the street is deserted.  He checks that\n     all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for, even though\n     the fallen fixture is far larger.  He looks up into the sky but\n     there is no plane in sight.  With some effort, Truman picks up\n     what's left of the crumpled light, loads it into the trunk of\n     his car and drives away.\n\n\n     INT.  CAR - TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING.\n\n     TRUMAN sits behind the wheel of his car, unscrews the cap of\n     a miniature bottle of Jack Daniels and empties the contents into\n     his Styrofoam cup of coffee.  Stirring it in with his finger, he\n     burns himself.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Shit!\n\n     As Truman drinks, he becomes aware of the delighted squeals of\n     children coming from the gymnasium of Utopia Elementary School,\n     adjacent to the parking lot.  The sound of the children triggers\n     a memory in his head.\n\n\n     EXT.  LONG, WIDE BEACH.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.\n\n     Unlike a conventional flashback, the scene in his memory appears\n     to be playing on a television screen.\n\n     A sandy-haired, SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, runs towards a bluff on\n     the beach.\n\n     The boy's father, KIRK, late-thirties, beer bottle in hand,\n     flirts with two TEENAGE GIRLS at the shoreline.  Suddenly, the\n     father remembers his son.  He looks anxiously around.  The sight\n     of the boy at the far end of the beach causes him to drop his\n     bottle in the sand and run to him.\n\n     The boy is near the top of the cliff before his agitated father\n     comes within earshot.\n\n                           FATHER\n                      (out of breath, clutching his side)\n              Truman!  Truman!  Stop!\n\n     Truman turns from his perch and waves happily down to his\n     father.  But the smile quickly vanishes when he registers the\n     anger and distress on his father's face.\n\n                           FATHER\n              Come down now!\n\n     His father's unnatural anxiety makes the next bay even more\n     tantalizing.  The boy considers defying his father.  He puts\n     his hand on the rock above him to stretch up and sneak a peek at\n     the other side.  One good stretch would do it.\n\n                           FATHER\n                      (reading Truman's mind, enraged)\n              No!\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (sensing his father is keeping\n                      something from him)\n              Why?  What's there?\n\n                           FATHER\n                      (unconvincing)\n              Nothing's there.  It's the same as this.\n                      (trace of desperation)\n              Come down, please!\n\n     Truman is suddenly aware that the hundreds of other BEACHGOERS\n     have stopped their activities to stare at him.  Reluctantly\n     he starts to retrace his steps down the rocks.  When he finally\n     jumps to the sand, his father grabs him roughly by the arm and\n     drags him away down the beach.\n\n                           FATHER\n              I told you to stay close.  Don't ever leave\n              my sight again.  You gotta know your\n              limitations.  You could've been washed\n              away by the tide.\n\n\n     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.  MORNING.\n\n     TRUMAN emerges from a subway exit in Lower Manhattan and walks\n     briskly down the bustling street.  A snarl of taxis, buses and\n     COMMUTER traffic.  A STREET VENDOR thrusts a pretzel under\n     Truman's nose, a CAREER WOMAN catches his eye.\n\n     Truman stops at a newspaper stand and plucks an issue of\n     Cosmopolitan from the rack, quickly flicking through the glossy\n     pages.  Glancing in the direction of the NEWSPAPER VENDOR and\n     finding him busy with another customer, Truman deftly tears a\n     portion of the open page and pockets the cutting.\n\n     He guiltily replaces the magazine, startled to find the\n     Newspaper Vendor standing close behind him.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (quickly recovering)\n              Gimme a copy of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\".\n\n                           VENDOR\n              We ran out.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (hastily departing)\n              Thanks anyway.\n\n     As Truman hurries away, the Vendor picks up the copy of Cosmo\n     and instantly turns to the torn page.  It is a Lancome\n     advertisement with ISABELLA ROSSELLINI's nose missing.\n     Truman is still in view but the Vendor makes no effort to\n     confront him, almost as if he were expecting it.\n\n     Passing one of the tall, black mirrored buildings that grow\n     out of the pavement, Truman glimpses himself in the reflective\n     glass.  He doesn't like what he sees and attempts to suck in his\n     gut, but quickly concedes defeat.  The image triggers another\n     childhood memory.\n\n\n     INT.  SCHOOLROOM.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.\n\n     Once again, the flashback appears to be playing on a television\n     screen.\n\n     The sandy-haired SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits in the middle row of\n     a Catholic Elementary School classroom surrounded by thirty-or-\n     so other well-scrubbed, uniformed YOUNGSTERS.  DOUGLAS, the boy\n     next to Truman is on his feet under the scrutiny of a sixty-\n     year-old NUN with a face as wrinkled as her habit is starched.\n\n                           DOUGLAS\n              I wanna be a chiropractor like my dad.\n\n                           SISTER\n                      (impressed)\n              Tell the class what a chiropractor does,\n              Douglas.\n\n                           DOUGLAS\n              He helps people by fixing their backs,\n              Sister Olivia.\n\n                           SISTER\n              That's right, Douglas.\n                      (holding her back, hamming it up)\n              Perhaps I'll be your first patient.\n\n     The CLASS titters.  Douglas sits down, pleased with himself,\n     throwing a smirk to Truman.\n\n                           SISTER\n              What about you, Truman?\n\n     Truman rises to his feet.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I want to be an explorer\n                      (with reverence)\n              ...like Magellan.\n\n     The Sister's face falls.\n\n                           SISTER\n              No one's going to pay you to do that,\n              Truman.\n                      (with scarcely disguised glee)\n              Besides, you're too late.  There's\n              nothing left to explore.\n\n     The class roars with laughter and Truman takes his seat.\n\n\n     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN, FINANCIAL DISTRICT.  MORNING.\n\n     From TRUMAN'S POV we see that he is staring up at relief\n     letters that proclaim, \"American Life & Accident Insurance,\n     Inc.\" above an office building's entrance.\n\n     A POLICE OFFICER walking his beat, wanders in Truman's\n     direction.  From another angle, we observe Truman from the\n     Police Officer's POV - shaky, handheld camera - on a television\n     screen.  Truman enters the building.\n\n\n     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY - TWELFTH FLOOR.  DAY.\n\n     In a cramped, cluttered, windowless cubicle, TRUMAN talks on\n     the telephone.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (into receiver)\n              ...okay, okay, let's call it what it is...\n              I'm not gonna lie to you...life insurance\n              is death insurance...you just gotta ask\n              yourself two questions...one, in the event\n              of your death, will anyone experience\n              financial loss?...and two, do you care?\n\n     A CLERK drops a large reference book on Truman's desk.  He\n     checks the spine - \"MORTALITY STATISTICS, 1986 to Present\".\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (into receiver)\n              Hold on will ya?\n                      (to Clerk, putting receiver\n                      to chest, referring to the book)\n              This's no good.  Lumps all drownings\n              together.  I need drownings broken down\n              by category.\n\n     The Clerk shrugs, returns the book to his trolley and continues\n     his rounds.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (returning to his call)\n              ...just think about what I've been\n              saying and lemme...hello?...\n\n     The person on the other end has hung up.  With an apathetic\n     shrug, Truman replaces the receiver.  He looks over his shoulder\n     and places another call.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (lowering his voice)\n              Can you connect me with directory\n              inquiries in Sydney, Australia?\n                      (a long delay makes Truman\n                      even more uncomfortable)\n              ...er, yes.  Do you have a listing\n              for a Lauren Powers...\n                      (pause)\n              ...nothing listed?...what about a Sylvia\n              Powers...nothing?  Thanks...\n\n     Truman replaces the receiver, disappointed.\n\n\n     INT.  LOCAL ITALIAN DELI.  LUNCHTIME.\n\n     TRUMAN stands in line with a crush of other WHITE COLLAR\n     WORKERS.  As he reaches the counter, the store owner, TYRONE,\n     has anticipated his order and ahs already begun preparing a\n     meatball and mozzarella sandwich on Italian roll.  Truman gazes\n     at the sandwich skillfully under construction, pained by his own\n     predictability.\n\n                           TYRONE\n                      (nauseatngly cheerful)\n              How's it goin', Truman?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (deadpan)\n              Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.\n\n                           TYRONE\n                      (not listening to Truman's\n                      reply, as Truman anticipated)\n              Good.  Good.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?\n\n                           TYRONE\n                      (not missing a beat)\n              I'd ask for identification.\n\n     Truman forces a half-smile.\n\n     We focus on another MALE OFFICE WORKER in line at the cash\n     register, watching Truman out of the corner of his eye.  About\n     to depart with his sandwich, the man receives a guarded rebuke\n     from the FEMALE CASHIER.\n\n                           FEMALE CASHIER\n                      (a whisper to prevent Truman overhearing)\n              He's right there.  You're supposed to pay\n              when he's here.\n\n                           MALE CUSTOMER\n                      (nonchalant shrug as he departs)\n              He never notices.\n\n     We re-focus our attention on Truman who is taking the wrapped\n     sandwich from Tyrone.\n\n                           TYRONE\n              Hold on, Truman.  I got somethin' to show ya.\n\n     Tyrone holds up a front page of the New York Post that\n     features a photograph of a scaled-down replica of Columbus'\n     Santa Maria, moored in front of the Manhattan skyline.  Truman's\n     eyes widen at the photograph.\n\n                           TYRONE\n                      (referring to the photo)\n              The flagship of Christoforo...our Genoese\n              navigator, huh?  I know you love this like me.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (averting his eyes with difficulty)\n              Not me.  You got the wrong man.\n\n     Tyrone tries not to let his disappointment show as Truman pays\n     the Cashier and exits.\n\n                           TYRONE\n              See ya tomorrow, Truman.\n\n\n     EXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN eats lunch alone on a concrete bench in a cement park.\n     From his briefcase he pulls out an old hardcovered book, \"To The\n     Ends Of The Earth - The Age Of Exploration\".\n\n     A TRANSIENT in a wheelchair approaches, looking for a handout.\n     Truman gives the homeless man half of his sandwich, reconsiders\n     and gives him it all, his appetite gone.  As the transient\n     wheels himself away, Truman loses himself in his book.\n\n\n     INT.  A DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.\n\n     Close up on an old man's face.  CHRISTOF.  Hair pure white,\n     late-sixties, a vitality in his eyes that belies his years.\n\n     He stands beside a floor-to-ceiling window in a dimly-lit room.\n     Outside the window, a single palm tree swaying against a deep\n     blue Californian sky.  A news anchor-style earpiece disappears\n     down the neck of the unconventionally-cut suit he wears.\n\n     Suspended from the ceiling above his head is a television\n     monitor upon which a surveillance picture of Truman, engrossed\n     in his book, silently plays.\n\n     CHLOE, twenty-something, androgenous-looking, similarly-suited,\n     joins Christof at the window.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (never taking his eyes\n                      from the monitor)\n              You ever pass a car wreck on the side of the\n              road?  They're pulling out a body.  You know\n              you shouldn't look, but you do.\n\n\n     INT.  A CONFERENCE ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.\n\n     A group of a dozen MEN and WOMEN of varying ages sit around\n     a circular conference table in a sterile, windowless meeting\n     room.  All stare at a single telephone placed in the center of\n     the table, anticipating a call.  On cue, the phone rings and one\n     of the men, after waiting for the second ring, picks up.\n\n                           MAN\n              Hello?...I'm sorry, I got more than enough\n              insurance.\n\n     He hangs up.  After a moment the phone rings again.\n\n\n     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN sits at his desk, making a cold call.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (into receiver)\n              ...this isn't about insurance, this is\n              about the great variable - when will\n              death occur?

MERYL, early\n     thirties, a petite woman easy to mistake for frail.  He deposits\n     the photo in his briefcase and departs.\n\n\n     INT.  MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN, briefcase in hand, ashen-faced, stands in line for the\n     Staten Island ferry.\n\n     As the TOURISTS and COMMUTERS impatiently brush past him onto\n     the boat, Truman remains frozen to the spot, mesmerized by the\n     scummy water rising and falling beneath the dock, triggering\n     a flashback in his head.\n\n\n     EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.\n\n     The flashback once again appearing an a television screen, the\n     SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits alongside his father, KIRK, in a\n     small sailing dinghy.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (shouting above the wind)\n              Let's go further, daddy!

MUNICIPAL FERRY TERMINAL.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN turns and begins to fight his way back against the tide\n     of PASSENGERS boarding the ferry, emerging back on the street\n     into the bright sunlight, gasping for air.\n\n     Gathering himself, he makes for the entrance of Whitehall Street\n     subway station.  Two COMMUTERS surrepticiously observe Truman as\n     he departs.\n\n                           COMMUTER 1\n                      (commenting out of Truman's earshot)\n              I can't believe he's taking the long way.\n\n                           COMMUTER 2\n              He'll never make it.\n\n\n     INT.

DAY.\n\n     A taxi crosses the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge towards Staten\n     Island.  TRUMAN keeps his eyes shut tight all the way across.\n     refusing to look down at the entrance to New York harbor.\n\n\n     EXT.  BAY STREET, STATEN ISLAND.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN finally reaches his destination at a well-to-do\n     condominium on Bay Street.  As he approaches the lobby, he\n     realizes he has perspiration showing through the armpits of his\n     suit jacket.\n\n\n     INT.  CONDOMINIUM.  DAY.\n\n     A middle-aged CONCIERGE behind a reception desk, is having his\n     hair brushed by a YOUNGER MAN in his mid-thirties.  Anticipating\n     Truman's arrival, the hairdresser fusses one more time and\n     swiftly departs through a rear door.  TRUMAN enters the lobby\n     and approaches the CONCIERGE, trying to keep his arms tightly at\n     his sides to hide the perspiration.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I'm here to see a Mr Hamilton.\n\n                           CONCIERGE\n              You from the insurance company?

He waited as long as\n              he could.  You was supposed to be here by four.\n\n     A clock on the wall reads 4.l2pm.\n\n\n     INT.  SUBWAY.  AFTERNOON.\n\n     TRUMAN sits by himself in the rattling subway car, defeated.\n     The only other occupants in the train, a TALL WOMAN, mid-\n     thirties, reading a pulp novel and two MALE YOUTHS, late-teens,\n     sitting opposite the woman, slouching, ogling her.\n\n                           YOUTH 1\n                      (to woman)\n              You wanna read to me?\n\n     His companion smirks.\n\n                           YOUTH 1\n                      (more insistent)\n              You wannna read to me?\n\n     The woman looks up, unaware of the boys' presence until now.\n     She quickly avoids eye contact and returns to the book.  The\n     other boy reaches over and snatches the novel from her grasp.\n\n                           YOUTH 2\n                      (menacing)\n              My friend asked you a question.\n\n     The woman picks up her bag from the floor in a reflex and\n     holds it to her.  She looks around the train for assistance,\n     briefly catching Truman's eye.  The youths also look in\n     Truman's direction, staring him down, daring him to interfere.\n     Truman quickly averts his gaze.\n\n                           WOMAN\n                      (reaching for the book)\n              Please...\n\n     The boy returns the book to the woman, but before doing so rips\n     out the last page from the novel and stuffs it in his shirt\n     pocket.\n\n                           YOUTH 2\n              Now you're gonna have to ask me how it ends.\n\n     The train pulls into a deserted station.  Feeling vulnerable,\n     the woman jumps up from her seat and exits.  The youths, sensing\n     a chase, also exit.  Scanning the empty platform, the woman\n     realizes she has made a serious error.  Truman watches through\n     the train's open door as the boys corner the frightened woman\n     but still he remains in his seat.\n\n                           YOUTH 1\n              We're gonna tell you how it ends, baby.\n\n     One of the youths produces a knife from his pocket and waves it\n     in the woman's face.\n\n                           YOUTH 2\n              Don't you wanna know how it ends?\n\n     The boys pin the woman to the station wall with the weight of\n     their bodies.  The woman looks again in Truman's direction.\n     Again she makes eye contact, eyes pleading.\n\n                           WOMAN\n                      (screams)\n              Help!!  Please, help!!\n\n     The woman's second scream is muffled as the train door closes.\n     Truman looks up to the emergency handle beside the door.  There\n     is still time to act.  He stands up and half-reaches for the\n     handle but moves no further.\n\n     The train abruptly pulls away, leaving Truman time to see one of\n     the youths covering the woman's mouth while the other reaches\n     under her skirt before the train enters the tunnel.  Truman bows\n     his head in shame as the train rattles on.\n\n\n     INT.  SUBWAY STATION.  DAY.\n\n     The train safely out of sight, the YOUTHS promptly release the\n     WOMAN.  She calmly hitches down her skirt, no longer afraid.\n     The young men, no longer angry, help fix her hair and retrieve\n     her shoulder bag.\n\n                           WOMAN\n              Thanks.\n\n     The threesome walk along the platform together, as if lifelong\n     friends.\n\n                           WOMAN\n                      (pondering the incident)\n              He did nothing.\n\n                           YOUTH 1\n                      (shrugs, suddenly more couth)\n              Physical violence paralyzes him.  Always\n              has.\n\n\n     EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  DUSK.\n\n     The backyard of a modest but tidy one-story tract home.  Beyond\n     the plank fence at the end of the property flows a busy\n     Expressway.\n\n     TRUMAN wheels a lawnmower towards the garage as his wife, MERYL,\n     pulls up the drive in her four-year-old Toyota Camry.  She has a\n     sensible blue vinyl bag over her shoulder and carries a new\n     knife-set in a wooden block.  She kisses Truman affectionately\n     on the cheek.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (proudly referring to the knife-set)\n              I got it free with the tune-up.\n\n     Looking over Truman's shoulder, she notices a small uncut patch\n     of grass, missed by Truman in one of his passes.\n\n                           MERYL\n              You missed a section.\n\n     Meryl enters the house.  Truman restarts the lawnmower and\n     obediantly pushes it towards the offending patch of lawn.  As\n     the mower brushes up against the unconforming blades of grass,\n     Truman pulls back abruptly.  He checks the kitchen window for\n     Meryl and wheels the mower away, leaving the patch uncut.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  DAY.\n\n     MERYL is applying ointment to her wrists as TRUMAN enters.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (referring to her hands)\n              Do they hurt?\n\n                           MERYL\n              I was afraid I'd seize up during cross.\n              One of the keys kept sticking.\n\n     Truman picks up Meryl's newspaper and skims idly through it.  He\n     notes an article headlined, \"SLAYING TRIAL ENTERS SIXTH WEEK\".\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (referring to the article)\n              Is he gonna take the stand?\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (dispassionate, matter-of-fact)\n              No point.  Two eye witnesses saw him\n              near the dumpster where they found the legs.\n\n     She flexes her arthritic wrists.\n\n                           MERYL\n              You gonna eat before you leave?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I'll get something out.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (sensing something odd\n                      in his demeanor)\n              Did something happen today?\n\n     Truman turns to her too sharply, his guilt showing.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (composing himself)\n              What could happen?\n\n\n     EXT.  UNOPENED FREEWAY.  NIGHT.\n\n     An abandoned freeway project in Queens.  The four hundred yard\n     stretch of deserted freeway is paved but unmarked.  At one end\n     is an off-ramp that abruptly ends in inid-air, reinforcing steel\n     protuding from the concrete.\n\n     TRUMAN stands at the end of the off-ramp with MARLON, thirty-\n     two, the kind of physique some descibe as fat, others big.\n     Marlon drinks beer from a can while Truman addresses a teed-up\n     golf ball with a number three wood.\n\n     Truman winds up and swings, making a healthy contact with the\n     ball.  The ball arches away into the night sky, lit by the\n     adjacent operating roadway.  From a new angle we see the ball\n     take a huge hop on the outside lane of the abandoned freeway and\n     continue down the asphalt.\n\n     Marlon tosses Truman another ball from a bucket of badly scarred\n     golf balls - a ball initialed with the letter, \"T\".  Truman sets\n     the ball up on the makeshift tee area and launches himself into\n     his second shot.  With a slight fade, the second ball carries\n     even further than the first.\n\n     Truman hands Marlon their sole golf club without comment.\n     Marlon is still looking admiringly in the direction of the shot.\n\n                           MARLON\n              Ouch.  Whose nuts were those?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (opening a beer from the six pack)\n              Mine.\n\n     Marlon tees up a ball of his own. initialed with the letter \"M\".\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I gotta get out, Marlon.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (mild interest only)\n              Yeah?

What the hell's wrong\n              with your job?  You gotta great job.\n              You gotta desk job.  I'd kill for a desk\n              job.\n\n     Marlon addresses the ball and swings.  A sweeping hook shot\n     that bounces off the freeway out of bounds.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (annoyed by the errant tee shot)\n              Sonofabitch.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              It doesn't mean anything.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (still looking in the\n                      direction of his ball)\n              Nothing means anything.

My biggest decision\n              of the day is whether the Almond Joys look\n              better next to the Snickers or the Baby Ruths.\n\n     Truman selects another \"M\" ball from the bucket and tosses it to\n     Marlon.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (adamant)\n              I gotta get out.\n\n     Overcompensating with his second shot, Marlon slices the ball in\n     the other direction.  A lucky bounce keeps it on the cement\n     fairway.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (skeptical, picking up his beer)\n              Sure and go where?\n\n     Truman gulps his beer as he prepares his answer.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (unable to disguise his reverence)\n              Australia.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (impressed)\n              No shit.  Where is Australia exactly?\n              Near England?\n\n     Truman picks up a golf ball to demonstrate.

LATER THAT NIGHT.\n\n     TRUMAN and MARLON wander down the empty freeway, retrieving\n     the golf balls.

Just buried under what\n              we settled for.\n\n     They approach Truman's Oldsmobile.  Truman opens the trunk to\n     deposit their humble golfing equipment.  Inside are the remains\n     of the fallen light fixture.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (referring to the light)\n              You really think it could've dropped off an\n              airliner?\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (unimpressed)\n              Sure.

EATON'S NECK POINT.  DUSK, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.\n\n     The lines of a television screen signal another of Truman's\n     flashbacks.  A small group of MOURNERS in black, several openly\n     weeping, stand on the end of a small jetty, including the SEVEN-\n     YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, dry-eyed in an ill-fitting suit, his weeping\n     MOTHER, older sister, RAQUEL, and a PRIEST at the head of the\n     gathering.\n\n     The priest nods to Truman who holds an ornate wreath, heavy and\n     cumbersome in his tiny hands.  He heaves it off the dock.\n\n     MATCH DISSOLVE TO\n\n\n     EXT.  EATON'S NECK POINT, LONG ISLAND.  NIGHT, PRESENT.\n\n     A smaller, more simple wreath lands on the calm, dark water\n     beyond the jetty twenty-seven years later.  TRUMAN stares at the\n     wreath for a long moment, turns and wanders back towards the\n     shoreline.\n\n     In his work suit minus his shoes and socks, he sits on the sand.\n     He has a portable tape recorder slung over his shoulder and\n     points a corded microphone at the surf.  For a long while we\n     watch Truman's impassive face as he makes the recording of the\n     lapping waves, staring up at the handful of stars visible\n     through the gloom.\n\n     We focus on the lantern room of a nearby lighthouse.  From the\n     light's POV, through the green hue of a night vision camera, we\n     observe Truman get to his feet and walk towards the dark water.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (shouting at the surf)\n              I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!\n\n\n     INT.  DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.\n\n     CHRISTOF's dispassionate face is reflected in the screen of a\n     television monitor that displays the distraught TRUMAN at the\n     water's edge.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     At the Formica kitchen table, TRUMAN makes calculations in a\n     school notebook, a bottle of beer close at hand.  MERYL appears\n     in her robe, a glimpse of black negligee beneath, restless.  She\n     throws her arms around Truman's neck.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (suggestive)\n              What are you doing?

God, everytime you and Marlon--\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              --We could bum around the world for a year\n              on that.\n\n                           MERYL\n              And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to\n              where we were five years ago.  You're talking\n              like a teenager.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Maybe I feel like a teenager.\n\n     Getting to his feet.  Truman holds Meryl by the arms, talking\n     excitedly to her the way we imagine he did when they were\n     courting.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Meryl, it'd be an adventure.\n\n                           MERYL\n              We said we'd try for a baby.  Isn't that\n              enough of an adventure?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              That can wait.  I want to get away.  See\n              some of the world.  Explore.\n\n     Meryl gives a derisive laugh.\n\n                           MERYL\n              You want to be an explorer?  You mean like\n              all the other great explorers from Queens?\n              You don't even have a passport, Truman.  I\n              bet you don't even know how to get one.\n\n     The words sting.  Truman turns away.\n\n     Seeing the pain she's caused, she changes tack.\n\n                           MERYL\n              This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this\n              now and then.\n                      (making one more attempt\n                      at seduction)\n              Come to bed.\n\n\n     EXT.  A NIGHTWATCHMAN'S OFFICE SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.\n\n     In a nightwatchman's office, two UNIFORMED GUARDS drink coffee.\n\n                           GUARD 1\n              How can they have a child?\n\n                           GUARD 2\n              It's not gonna be his, you idiot.\n\n                           GUARD 1\n              Why not?\n\n                           GUARD 2\n              You think she'd go through with it?\n                      (reassessing his own opinion)\n              Guess I always thought they'd adopt.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.\n\n     TRUMAN stands in the darkened bedroom in his Hanes underwear\n     looking down at his bed.  MERYL has fallen asleep waiting for\n     him, snoring lightly.  Truman rests his hand tentatively on the\n     bed.  The surface rocks.  A waterbed.  The motion triggers a\n     flashback in his head.\n\n\n     EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DAWN, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.\n\n     As always the flashback appears to play on a television screen.\n     The SEVEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN sits on the upturned hull of a small\n     dinghy in calm, deep water.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (plaintively calling into the mist)\n              Daddy!!...Daddy!!...\n\n     His cries go unanswered.\n\n\n     INT.  A LIVING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Two OLD WOMEN, seventies, sit beside wach other on a sofa\n     against a bare wall, looking directly into camera as they\n     talk.  Nothing else of the room is seen.\n\n                           OLD WOMAN 1\n                      (playing amateur psychiatrist)\n              It left him with more than his obvious fear\n              of the water.  It's as if he felt his father\n              had gone beyond his limitations and he vowed\n              never to repeat the mistake.  He was never\n              the same curious little boy again.\n\n                           OLD WOMAN 2\n              We're all born with a pound of cocaine\n              up our nose.  By the time we're eleven\n              it runs out.\n\n                           OLD WOMAN 1\n              Half the people I knew named their\n              babies after him.\n\n\n     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN.  MORNING.\n\n     TRUMAN emerges from the subway station and as usual stops at the\n     newspaper stand. He picks up a copy of Vogue and flips through\n     the glossy cosmetic ads, surreptitiously tearing CLAUDIA\n     SCHIFFER's nose from one of the pages.  He returns the magazine\n     to the rack and begins his daily pilgrimage to work through the\n     rush hour pedestrian traffic.\n\n     Pausing to check his profile in the mirrored building, he\n     glimpses the reflection of a HOMELESS MAN standing directly\n     behind him.  Truman, spellbound by the man, suddenly wheels\n     around to face him.  The Homeless Han is in his late-sixties.\n     more well-groomed and well-fed than the average vagrant, with a\n     serene smile on his face.\n\n     From a new angle we see a two-shot of Truman and the Man on a\n     television screen.  The Homeless Man places his hand ever so\n     gently on Truman's cheek.  Truman makes no effort to withdraw.\n     He is transfixed by the the man's eyes.  He appears to recognize\n     him.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (almost to himself, mouthing\n                      the word)\n              Daddy...\n\n     Suddenly a distinguished OLD WOMAN walking a small dog and a\n     YOUNG MALE BUSINESS EXECUTIVE carrying a briefcase, walking in\n     opposite directions along the sidewalk, grab the Homeless Man,\n     one taking each arm.\n\n     A bus suddenly screeches to a halt beside the struggling group,\n     doors already open, and before Truman can react, the Old Woman\n     and the Young Executive force the Homeless Man onto the bus.\n     Truman lurches after them, but he is met by the bus doors,\n     closing sharply in his face.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to BUS DRIVER)\n              Hey, stop!  Stop!!\n\n     Truman thumps against the doors, but the BUS DRIVER ignores his\n     cries and the bus roars away from the curb.  He starts to run\n     after the bus, colliding with several PEDESTRIANS who make no\n     attempt to avoid him.\n\n     Stepping blindly into the street, he tries to hail a taxi.\n     A vacant cab suddenly switches off its \"FOR HIRE\" light as he\n     reaches it.  Truman pleads with the TAXI DRIVER through the\n     closed windows and locked doors of the cab but the driver is\n     apparently oblivious to Truman's shouts.\n\n     Frantic, Truman, dashes into a nearby parking structure and\n     grabs a bunch of car keys from the key rack of the unsupervised\n     parking attendant's kiosk.  Running along the rows of parked\n     cars, Truman desperately presses the car security buttons\n     attached to the key rings\n\n     A car alarm chirps and Truman turns in time to see the car's\n     winking sidelights.  He jumps inside a brand new BMW and guns\n     the car.  The PARKING ATTENDANT, alerted by the squealing tires,\n     appears from the Men's Room and attempts to wave Truman down.\n\n                           ATTENDANT\n                      (running after the car)\n              Hey!\n\n     Truman ignores the attendant and accelerates into the street\n     without looking, causing a taxi and a postal van to take\n     evasive action.\n\n     Catching sight of the bus in the distance, Truman leans on the\n     car's horn as he recklessly weaves past other motorists.  He is\n     only a couple of car-lengths from the bus.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (reading aloud, the\n                      ID number of the bus)\n              Two, four, oh, six.\n\n     Suddenly the taxis and cars directly in front of him start to\n     slow for no apparent reason.  Truman looks for a way around\n     but the cars crab across the street, blocking any passage,\n     working together almost as if they are running interference.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (shouting at the cars)\n              Outta the way!  Outta the way!\n\n     The bus is escaping.\n\n     Truman suddenly jumps the sidewalk in the car, scattering\n     PEDESTRIANS.\n\n     The same cars on the street that seemed intent on slowing his\n     progress suddenly accelerate in unison, anticipating his move.\n     By the time Truman reaches the end of the sidewalk, the cars are\n     clustered together on the corner in an impenetrable jam.  Truman\n     spies the bus turn the corner at the far end of the street and\n     disappear from view.\n\n     Fumbling with the gear stick. he finally finds reverse but turns\n     to find a hostile group of PEDESTRIANS herded tightly together\n     behind the car, leaving Truman with nowhere left to go.\n\n     The car door is suddenly jerked open and the out-of-breath\n     PARKING ATTENDANT yanks Truman from the driver's seat.\n\n                           ATTENDANT\n              What the fuck are you trying to pull?!\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (cowering, the fight instantly\n                      gone out of him)\n              I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!  No harm done!\n              No harm done!\n\n                           ATTENDANT\n                      (feverishly inspecting the\n                      fenders for dents, he finds none)\n              I oughta fuck you up!\n\n     The Attendant looks into Truman's terrified eyes.  They get\n     the better of him.\n\n                           ATTENDANT\n              Get the fuck outta here.\n\n     The Attendant shoves Truman's briefcase into his arms and\n     brushes him aside.  As he departs, Truman notices that the\n     traffic jam in the street and the mysterious crowd of\n     pedestrians has dissolved.\n\n\n     EXT.  BUS DEPOT.  DAY.\n\n     Row after row of parked buses.  TRUMAN and MARLON exit an\n     administration office.  Instead of heading for the exit, Truman\n     begins marching down the first row of buses, inspecting the\n     number painted on the rear of each one.\n\n                           MARLON\n              What're you doing?\n                      (gesturing to the office)\n              The man told you there's no such bus.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              He's lying.  Two, four, oh, six was\n              definitely the number.\n\n     Marlon stops walking.  Truman continues his inspection.  Seeing\n     there is no reasoning with him, Marlon hurries to catch him up.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I never believed he was dead.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (trying to be patient)\n              C'mon, Truman, a lotta times they don't find\n              a body.  You know what the currents are like\n              in that water.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (shudders, a memory\n                      flashing in his head)\n              You had to see his face when that wave hit.\n              He wasn't scared Marion.  It was like he\n              was expecting it, waiting for it.  He\n              knew it was coming.\n\n                           MARLON\n              Why would he fake it?\n                      (trying to make light)\n              He's not Elvis Presley.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (ignoring the joke, pondering\n                      the morning's events)\n              You know what was really strange about today?\n              An old woman with a little dog and a\n              businessman, walking in opposite directions\n              on the sidewalk, both react like clockwork.\n              They force him onto a bus against his will,\n              a bus that doesn't normally stop outside\n              my building.  And when I'm giving chase, the\n              bus never makes another stop and I get the\n              feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians\n              are working together to make sure I never\n              catch up with it.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (sarcastic)\n              Oh, so now it's also the pedestrians and\n              the buses and the cars?  What are you\n              saying, the entire population of Lower\n              Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding\n              out that your father staged his death to\n              pursue a life as a street person?  Oh yeah,\n              that makes sense.\n\n     Truman has no answer.  We see an aerial shot of Truman and\n     Marlon on a television screen, continuing to check the rows of\n     buses, Marlon still marveling at Truman's obstinance.  They\n     have come to the last bus in the final row.  Truman hangs his\n     head.  The offending bus is not amongst them.  He makes towards\n     the exit without comment and Marlon follows.\n\n     Unseen by the pair, we focus on the ID number on one of the\n     buses they have previously checked - \"2400\".  A single drip of\n     black paint trickles off the last freshly painted digit.\n\n\n     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN and MARLON, drinking beer, sit in the rear doorway of\n     Marion's delivery van, wholesale-sized boxes of candy stacked\n     behind them.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              You think I imagined it, don't you?\n\n                           MARLON\n              I think you're missing your dad.\n                      (trying to be delicate)\n              The anniversary was yesterday, wasn't it?\n\n     Truman is surprised Marlon remembered.  Marlon nods to the\n     sidewalk.\n\n                           MARLON\n              You got sand in your cuffs.\n\n     Truman looks down at his feet.  A small, tell-tale pile of sand\n     has poured out of his tight trouser cuff.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Maybe you're right.  If only the old\n              woman hadn't left her dog behind.\n\n     We see a flashback in Truman's head of the earlier scene in the\n     Lower Manhattan street.  It confirms that the old woman's DOG\n     was abandoned on the sidewalk.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT, QUEENS.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN stands in the corridor of his mother's cramped, fussy.\n     doilyed apartment with his older sister, RAQUEL, late forties,\n     prematurely grey.  Through a doorway, the figure of his MOTHER\n     is visible asleep in bed, despite the early hour.  Truman and\n     Raquel speak in hushed tones to avoid waking her.\n\n                           RAQUEL\n              Don't you dare go in. Truman.  I just\n              got her off to sleep.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              It was Dad. I swear.\n\n     Raquel fixes Truman with a contemptuous stare.\n\n                           RAQUEL\n              Well, the next time he shows up. bring\n              him over.  Until then, I'm not saying a\n              word about this to Mom and neither are you.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              If it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Can you\n              think of a reason he'd want to hide from us?\n\n                           RACQUEL\n              I know a reason he'd want to hide from you.\n              Look at how you treat us.  You live ten minutes\n              away, we hardly see you from year to year and\n              then you turn up with this story so insane you\n              don't even believe it yourself.  Haven't you\n              hurt her enough, Truman?  She already blames you.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (incredulous)\n              I was seven years old!\n\n                           RAQUEL\n              But you're here and he's not.  Has it really taken you\n              this long to invent a story to ease your conscience?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I'm telling you he's alive!\n\n                           RAQUEL\n                      (snapping back bitterly)\n              And I'm telling you he's fish food!\n\n     Truman meets her unforgiving eyes.  Without another word, he\n     walks out of the apartment.\n\n     Truman safely departed, the figure in the bed, rolls out.\n     CHRISTOF, fully clothed, relishing the danger of being so close\n     to Truman without being detected.  Raquel's demeanor immediately\n     changes, all trace of bitterness gone from her face, she appears\n     younger, posture more upright, almost a different person.\n     Christof hugs Raquel.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              You did well.\n\n\n     INT.  DRESSING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.\n\n     A cavernous dressing room contains a long row of identical\n     mirrored make-up tables.  At the only occupied table, Truman's\n     contrite father, KIRK, is having what's left of his homeless\n     disguise cleaned from his face by a MAKE-UP ARTIST under the\n     watchful eye of two DARK-SUITED BODYGUARDS.\n\n     From a mezzanine floor out of Kirk's vision, CHRISTOF and CHLOE\n     also take in the proceedings.  Behind their heads, a monitor\n     shows a surveillance picture of an agitated TRUMAN sitting in\n     his car, trapped in rush-hour traffic.\n\n                           CHLOE\n              We've tightened security.\n\n     Christof nods indifferently, knowing the damage is already done.\n\n                           CHLOE\n                      (referring to Kirk)\n              Why would he do this to us?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Old age.  Sentiment.  You play someone's\n              father all those years, you are someone's\n              father...He sees the way Truman is.  He\n              feels responsible.\n\n     Christof turns and enters an office adjacent to the balcony,\n     containing a state-of-the-art monitor and VCR.  Chloe follows.\n     Christof plays the cued recording without comment.  We focus on\n     the screen.\n\n\n     EXT.  LONG ISLAND SOUND.  DAY, TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS EARLIER.\n\n     A younger-looking CHRISTOF sits in a motorboat in the calm\n     water of Long Island Sound.  Truman's father, KIRK, twenty-seven\n     years younger and a DARK HAIRED BOY, Truman's age at the time,\n     acting as a stand-in, sit in the stern of a sailing dinghy.\n     Two SCUBA DIVERS in the ocean.\n\n                           YOUNG CHRISTOF\n                      (barking instructions to Kirk)\n              ...as soon as we give the cue, tack to windward...\n\n     Kirk rehearses turning the tiller in the instructed direction.\n\n                           YOUNG CHRISTOF\n              The freak wave will strike from the\n              starboard side.  Remember, you don't\n              go to the diver.  The diver goes to you.\n\n     To simulate the wave, one of the divers puts his full weight on\n     the side of the dinghy to capsize it.  Kirk and the boy are\n     tossed into the water.  While the boy immediately bobs to the\n     surface in his life jacket, Kirk fails to surface.  After a long\n     moment, he reappears with the second diver some distance away.\n     now wearing a spare aqualung.\n\n                           YOUNG CHRISTOF\n              ...Good!  Good!...of course, on the day you\n              only surface once you're safely beyond the\n              cove...Try it one more time...You okay?\n\n     Kirk is staring at Truman's stand-in, clinging to the upturned\n     boat.  Kirk's expression suggests he is not a totally willing\n     participant in the masquerade.\n\n     The present-day Christof freezes the monitor on Kirk's uncertain\n     face.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S GARAGE.  DUSK.\n\n     A cluttered garage, dimly lit by a single work lamp.  TRUMAN\n     looks over his shoulder before turning his attention to a dusty\n     trunk under a canvas sheet.  The trunk is fastened with a\n     combination lock.  He deftly dials the correct combination and\n     opens the lid.\n\n     Inside, mementoes from his youth.  A \"HOW TO SAIL\" book, a\n     stack of \"GREAT EXFLORERS\" magazines, and beneath it all, a\n     garment in a drycleaning bag.  Truman carefully lifts up the\n     plastic to reveal a schoolgirl's lavender cardigan decorated\n     with pearl beading.  He puts the cardigan to his nose and\n     breathes deeply.\n\n     Footsteps.  Truman hastily drops the cardigan in the trunk and\n     shuts the lid.  MERYL, standing close behind.\n\n                           MERYL\n              What're you doing out here?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (turning attention to an upturned\n                      mower on the garage floor)\n              Fixing the mower.\n\n     Meryl doesn't look like she buys it.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (concerned)\n              Your sister called.  She was worried about you.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (matter-of-fact)\n              I saw my father on State Street dressed as\n              a homeless man.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (attempting to comfort)\n              I kept seeing my brother for years after he died.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (irritated at her subtle dismissiveness)\n              What do you want?\n\n                           MERYL\n              I made macaroni.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I gotta go out.  About a replacement...\n                      (hastily adding)\n              ...mower blade.\n\n     Meryl nods, not at all convinced.  After an uncomfortable\n     pause, she turns and heads back to the house.\n\n\n     EXT.  CAR WASH.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly\n     washed Oldsmobile.  In the background is the warning sign he\n     has just ignored, \"CLOSE WINDOWS, LOWER AERIALS\".\n\n     Truman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender\n     cardigan and forces the bent wire into what's left of the\n     severed aerial.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN motors down a busy shopping street, crowded on both sides\n     with PEDESTRIANS.  As he drives, he tests his car radio.\n     Adjusting the tuner knob, he finds a station.\n\n                           FEMALE VOICE (from radio)\n              ...west on Atlantic...he's making a right\n              on Woodhaven...\n\n     Truman glances up at the street signs along his route and finds\n     that they coincide exactly with the streets quoted on the radio.\n     Distracted, he almost bowls over an OLD LADY on a crosswalk.\n\n                           MALE VOICE (from radio)\n              ...God, Truman almost hit Marilyn!...he's\n              on the move again, passing the Burger King...\n\n     Truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out. Suddenly\n     there is a piercing blast of feedback.  He looks up and, as far\n     as the eye can see, every PEDESTRIAN, MOTORIST and SHOPKEEPER\n     along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right\n     ear at exactly the same moment.\n\n                           MALE VOICE\n                      (from radio, in distress himself)\n              ...something's wrong.  Change frequencies...\n\n     Truman tries to pick up the channel once again but without\n     success.\n\n\n     EXT.  DRUG STORE.  DUSK.\n\n     Still shaken by his experience with the radio, TRUMAN exits\n     a Drug Store with a small, brown paper bag.  Out of the corner\n     of his eye he catches a MALE BYSTANDER still checking his right\n     ear with his finger.  He goes to say something to the by-stander\n     but thinks better of it.\n\n\n     EXT.  REDLIGHT DISTRICT, QUEENS.  NIGHT.\n\n     HOOKERS in white heels and spray-on skirts display their wares.\n     TRUMAN cruises slowly past in his Oldsmobile, the expression of\n     the prostitutes turning from seductive to contemptuous as each\n     is by-passed.\n\n     Suddenly Truman pulls sharply into the curb beside a leggy,\n     prostitute, VERONICA, wearing a platinum blonde wig.  She is in\n     deep discussion with a fellow WORKING GIRL.  Veronica recognizes\n     the car and instantly bends down to the open passenger window.\n\n                           VERONICA\n              Hey, Truman!  Where you bin?  You bin\n              cheatin' on me?\n\n     Veronica opens the door and folds herself into the passenger\n     seat.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT.\n\n     VERONICA knows the form.  As TRUMAN pulls away from the curb,\n     she is already removing the lavender cardigan from the\n     drycleaning bag on the back seat.  She drapes the cardigan\n     around her shoulders.\n                           VERONICA\n              Bout time you got this thing cleaned.\n                      (half-joking)\n              Don't tell me you bin makin' your old lady\n              wear it.\n\n     Truman passes her the brown paper bag without reply.  Veronica\n     removes a bottle of perfume and proceeds to liberally apply it.\n\n                           VERONICA\n                      (examining the bottle)\n              God, do they still make this stuff?\n              What's the Sell-By Date?\n\n\n     INT.  FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.  NIGHT.\n\n     From a vantage point in a disused tower high above the park.\n     CHRISTOF and CHLOE watch as Truman's Oldsmobile enters the park\n     grounds and comes to a stop near the large metal framed globe,\n     the Unisphere.  Both Christof and Chloe wear earpieces, a\n     miniature television propped at their feet shows a close-up\n     picture of TRUMAN and VERONICA inside the car.\n\n                           CHLOE\n                      (into a flip-phone,\n                      condescending)\n              ...you see him messing with the antenna...what\n              did you think would happen?...\"lapse of\n              concentration\", is that what you call it?\n              I call it amateur-hour...\n                      (sarcastic)\n              In case you hadn't noticed, we don't get to\n              do it over.\n\n     Christof, totally unfazed, regards his zealous young assistant\n     with affection and even a mild amusement.\n\n                           CHLOE\n                      (as she hangs up, querying the\n                      smile that plays around his lips)\n              You think this is funny?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              The mask has slipped before.  Everything\n              can be explained.\n\n     TRUMAN kills the lights and he and VERONICA exit the car\n     unaware that they are being observed.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (adopting a more serious tone\n                      as he returns his attention to Truman)\n              What's dangerous is that he makes the connection\n              between what happened today and the girl.\n\n     We focus on Truman and Veronica as they take a seat at the edge\n     of the pool surrounding the great steel globe.\n\n                           VERONICA\n              Like I say, I don't normally do this.\n              I gotta charge extra.\n\n     Truman nods his agreement and forks over several bills.\n     Veronica deposits the money in her purse and perches herself as\n     modestly as possible on the edge of the fountain.\n\n     When she is ready, Truman tenderly places his arm around her\n     shoulder.  Veronica responds, hesitantly, becoming immersed in\n     her role.  She reaches out her own hand and rests it on the\n     nape of his neck.  Slowly both heads drift together, but stop\n     just short of their lips meeting, agonizingly close.  So close\n     they can feel each other's breath, barely a sliver of daylight\n     separating them.  Then finally their lips touch in the most\n     gentle of caresses.\n\n     They hold the kiss for another long moment and then\n     simultaneously break.  As they look into each other's eyes,\n     Truman goes to say something but Veronica hushes him by placing\n     a finger to his lips.  Then abruptly she moves out of frame, the\n     cardigan falling from around her shoulders in her haste.\n\n     From Truman's POV we focus on the cardigan on the pavement,\n     triggering a flashback in his head.\n\n\n     INT.  HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.  DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.\n\n     As with Truman's previous flashbacks, this scene appears to be\n     playing on a television screen.  However, on this occasion it is\n     also accompanied by CHRISTOF's comments from his perch in the\n     tower above the park.\n\n                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)\n              He's re-created the event on and off for a\n              number of years.  We've never understood what\n              prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that\n              matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy\n              to approach her in the first place...\n\n     A SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN, carrying a stack of books, spies\n     LAUREN, sixteen going on thirty-five, wearing the lavender,\n     beaded cardigan at her open locker.  She is entertaining two\n     GIRLFRIENDS with what appears to be a lewd tale.\n\n                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)\n              We'd noticed them making eyes at each other\n              for some weeks but never thought he'd say\n              anything.  She was a year older, wrote poetry,\n              way out of his league...\n\n     Truman, obviously terrified, musters the nerve to approach the\n     lockers.  The three girls look up, surprised by the\n     interruption.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to Lauren, tongue-tied, a strangled greeting)\n              Hi.\n\n                           GIRLFRIEND 1\n                      (to Lauren as the two girlfriends\n                      abruptly depart)\n              See you in class.\n\n     Lauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Lauren, right?\n\n     Her name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her\n     text books.\n\n                           LAUREN\n              No.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (ignoring her lack of interest)\n              Look.  I was wonder--\n\n                           LAUREN\n              --I can't go out with you.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I haven't asked you yet.\n\n                           LAUREN\n              Well when you do, that's my answer.\n                      (softening)\n              I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (summoning up courage from somewhere)\n              Why, you married?\n\n     Lauren smiles despite herself.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I'm not asking you to have my children,\n              just a pizza.

We got finals.\n\n                           LAUREN\n              If we don't go now, it won't happen.\n\n     Truman hesitates.\n\n                           LAUREN\n                      (impatient, looking anxiously around)\n              Well, what do you want to do?\n\n     THE PICTURE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN SUDDENLY FAST-FORWARDS AT\n     SUCH SPEED IT BECOMES A BLUR - THEN RETURNS TO NORMAL SPEED.\n\n\n     EXT.  FLUSHING MEADOW PARK.  DUSK.\n\n     The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN and LAUREN enter the park near the\n     Unisphere.  The park is deserted on a hot June afternoon.\n\n                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)\n              We knew we were taking a risk.  She hadn't\n              been properly coached, but we were torn...\n              He'd summoned the courage to make the\n              approach...We wanted to reward that.  Of\n              course she took full advantage...\n\n     Truman and Lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding\n     the steel sculpture.\n\n                           LAUREN\n              I never knew this place existed.\n\n     They both stare down at the inviting water.  Lauren suddenly\n     throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another\n     thought.  She comes splashing to the surface.  Truman stares\n     down, transfixed hy the shimmering water.\n\n                           LAUREN\n              Come on!  Come on!  It's wonderful!\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (nervous)\n              I...I can't.\n\n     Lauren suddenly stops splashing.\n\n                           LAUREN\n              That's right.  Oh, God, I'm sorry.\n\n     She quickly climbs out of the pool, dripping wet.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (confused)\n              Why? You've got nothing to be sorry about.\n              Has someone been talking to you?\n\n     Lauren wrings out her dress.\n\n                           LAUREN\n                      (to the sky, upset)\n              Get me out of here.  I don't want to\n              be here.\n\n     Lauren starts walking away.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (confused, calling after her)\n              What are you talking about?  Lauren!  Lauren!\n\n     Truman runs after Lauren and holds her by the arms, forcing\n     her to face him.\n\n                           LAUREN\n                      (distraught)\n              My name's not Lauren!  It's Sylvia!\n\n     Truman looks into her eyes and believes her.\n\n     THE PICTURE FAST-FORWARDS AGAIN AT HIGH SPEED FOR A MOMENT AND\n     RETURNS TO NORMAL.\n\n     TRUMAN and SYLVIA (as she is now called throughout the remainder\n     of the movie) sit on the ledge of the pool - the same spot as\n     Truman and the hooker, Veronica, seventeen years later.  As we\n     have just seen imitated, Sylvia and Truman kiss with great\n     delicacy.  Truman goes to say something but she covers his lips\n     with her finger.\n\n                           SYLVIA\n              In a minute someone's going to come and\n              stop me talking to you.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (looking around the deserted park)\n              Who?

And your\n              teacher, Sister Olivia said, \"You're too\n              late, Truman.  There's nothing left to\n              explore.\"  And all the other kids laughed.\n              And you sat down.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (incredulous)\n              How do you know about that?\n\n                           SYLVIA\n              It doesn't matter.  You've forgotten about\n              that boy, Truman.  You got scared.  Just\n              because something happens, doesn't mean you\n              can't take another chance in your life.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I don't understand.\n\n                           SYLVIA\n                      (looking over her shoulder nervously)\n              There isn't much time.

Promise me you'll do that?\n\n     Truman nods, unsure of the commitment he is making.\n\n     Suddenly a 1962 Plymouth roars towards the fountain out of\n     nowhere.\n\n                           SYLVIA\n                      (scared)\n              I told you, Truman!\n\n     The car skids to a stop and a large MAN, 40ish, with a shock of\n     dark hair jumps from the car.  The man yanks the frightened\n     Sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (shocked)\n              Hey!\n\n                           MAN\n                      (to Sylvia)\n              Get in the car, Lauren!\n\n     Truman jumps up.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to the Man)\n              Who are you?!\n\n                           MAN\n              I'm her father!\n\n                           SYLVIA\n              No he's not!

We're moving to Australia.\n              New York's done something to her head.\n\n     The Plymouth roars away.  Truman stares after it and then\n     turns back to the cardigan left on the ground.\n\n                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)\n              Why did he say Australia?  Why couldn't he\n              have said New Jersey?\n\n\n     EXT.  FLUSHING MEADOW.  DUSK, PRESENT DAY.\n\n     VERONICA'S head suddenly appears back in frame beside TRUMAN.\n\n                           VERONICA\n              You want me to do it again?  I think I\n              could do it better.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (coming back to reality)\n              No...thank you.\n\n     Truman picks up the cardigan.  They return to the car.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT.\n\n     TRUMAN drives VERONICA back to her turf.  She smokes a\n     cigarette, flicking ash out of the window.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Veronica, what do you know for sure?\n\n                           VERONICA\n              For sure?\n                      (taking a long drag on her cigarette\n                      as she gives the question due\n                      consideration)\n              The nuns at my school, they used to say,\n              \"The whole of life is faith.\"\n\n     Truman regards his companion in a new light.  He comes to a stop\n     at the corner where he picked her up.\n\n                           VERONICA\n                      (giving Truman an affectionate\n                      peck on the cheek)\n              On the house.\n\n\n     INT.  HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.  DAY, SEVENTEEN YEARS EARLIER.\n\n     Another televised flashback.  The SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN\n     stands reflectively beside Sylvia's open and vacated locker.\n\n                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)\n              We removed all physical trace of her\n              but we couldn't erase the memory...\n\n     ANOTHER SHORT BURST OF FAST-FORWARD AND THEN THE PICTURE RETURNS\n     TO NORMAL SPEED.\n\n\n     INT.  HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY.  DAY\n\n     In a secluded corner of the library the SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD\n     TRUMAN sits at a table surrounded by a stack of glossy women's\n     magazines.  By tearing out individual facial features - eyes.\n     nose, mouth, ears, chin, hair - from photographs of YOUNG WOMEN\n     in the magazine's advertisements, Truman has been able to\n     improvise a composite picture of Sylvia.\n\n     The montage is a passable likeness although Truman is not\n     completely satisfied with Sylvia's nose.  He toys with\n     several nose examples before reluctantly settling for one.\n     He stares wistfully at the completed picture.\n\n     ANOTHER BURST OF FAST-FORWARD\n\n\n     INT.  SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD TRUMAN enters the front door.  His older\n     sister, RAQUEL, has been awaiting his arrival.\n\n                           CHRISTOF (V.O.)\n              When he decided to go after Sylvia, we\n              were forced to intervene once again...\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (excited)\n              I've got something to tell you, Sis.\n\n                           RAQUEL\n                      (adopting a low, serious tone)\n              I've got something to tell you too.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (unable to contain his news)\n              I'm going to Australia.\n\n                           RAQUEL\n              Mom's real sick.\n\n     Truman's face falls.  As he enters the bedroom where his ill\n     MOTHER lies gazing at the ceiling, we focus on his EXCHANGE\n     STUDENT APPLICATION that he has inadvertently crushed in his\n     hands.\n\n     THE FLASHBACK SEQUENCE OVER, WE RETURN TO THE PRESENT TIME WITH\n     THE IMAGE NO LONGER APPEARING ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  NIGHT\n\n     TRUMAN turns into his street but stops several houses short of\n     his own driveway and kills the car's engine.  In the light of a\n     streetlamp, Truman opens his briefcase and removes the framed\n     photograph of his wife, MERYL.  But he turns his wife's face\n     away from him and opens the clasps on the back of the frame.\n\n     Removing the backing, he exposes the composite picture of SYLVIA\n     we witnessed in the flashback of his youth, worn and faded by\n     the years.  With the frame on his lap, Truman retrieves a\n     handful of paper fragments from his jacket.  Noses.  He tests\n     the likeness of each one in turn.  Unsatisfied that any of the\n     new noses is an improvement, Truman tosses them out of his car\n     window.  We watch the paper fragments blowing in the breeze as\n     Truman's car proceeds down the street and into his driveway.\n\n\n     EXT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     Close up on a nose.  We pull back to reveal that the nose\n     belongs to SYLVIA, seventeen years older than Truman's composite\n     picture - slimmer in the face, wearing her hair shorter.\n     She is standing at the water's edge on a long, deserted\n     windswept beach, several sailing dinghys pulled up beyond the\n     high-water line.  In the background, a solitary, white\n     beachfront house - an other-worldliness to the idyllic scene.\n\n     Looking up into the sky, Sylvia's attention is drawn to a piece\n     of paper carried on the ocean breeze.  The paper catches on the\n     mast of one of the sailing dinghys.  A page from a newspaper,\n     carrying a photograph of TRUMAN in the street where he\n     encountered his father.  Sylvia retrieves the page.  The\n     article's headline reads, \"TRUMAN'S FATE IN DOUBT\".\n\n     Spying a MAN, late-thirties, kindly face, riding up to the beach\n     house on an old bicycle, Sylvia secrets the page under her\n     sweater.  The man waves cheerfully as he comes to join her on\n     the sand.  Sylvia waves cheerfully back.\n\n\n     INT.  BAR SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.\n\n     In a quiet bar, a WAITRESS patiently explains her viewpoint to\n     the BARMAN.  A PATRON on a barstool, eavesdrops.\n\n                           WAITRESS\n              She was willing to lose him if it meant he\n              could find himself.\n                      (registering the barman's blank look)\n              Never mind.\n\n\n     EXT.  TRAIN STATION PARKING LOT.  MORNING.\n\n     TRUMAN sits in his car, about to lace his coffee.  From inside\n     the adjacent Elementary School gymnasium, he hears the familiar\n     excited squeals and shouts of SCHOOL CHILDREN.  Truman suddenly\n     throws aside his miniature of Jack Daniels and sprints across\n     the parking lot and into the school.\n\n\n     INT.  UTOPIA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  MORNING.\n\n     TRUMAN slams through the front doors into the reception area.\n     It is deserted, no one stationed at the administration desk, the\n     corridors empty.  He runs down a vacant corridor, pushing open\n     classroom doors as he goes.  They are all unoccupied.\n\n     Finally, he stands outside the gymnasium.  The childrens'\n     voices can still be heard.  Truman takes a deep breath and\n     bursts through the double doors.\n\n     The room is empty save for a large reel-to-reel tape recorder\n     in the middle of the basketball court playing a continuous tape\n     of childrens' voices.  The recorder is attached to speakers on\n     tall stands facing the ventilation ducts.  Truman stares at the\n     machine in disbelief.\n\n\n     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING.\n\n     TRUMAN exits the subway, still lost in thought.  He stops at\n     the newstand and picks up a copy of Vanity Fair to resume his\n     ritual search but his heart is not in it.\n\n     He starts his trek to work, pausing to stare at his reflection\n     in the mirrored building, hoping that the Homeless Man will\n     appear at his side once again.  But no one joins him.\n\n     However, as Truman continues to stare, it is the building itself\n     that takes his interest.  An imposing forty-story office\n     building, a black, sheer mirrored box clad in the kind of\n     reflective glass that shields its occupants from the world, a\n     building Truman passes every day.\n\n     As usual, a steady stream of EMPLOYEES and VISITORS enter and\n     exit the building's high-ceilinged lobby past an intimidating\n     security desk manned by two UNIFORMED GUARDS.  Beyond security\n     are banks of elevators, ferrying executives, clerical staff and\n     delivery personnel to and from their floors of business.\n\n\n     Truman abruptly enters the building.  He strides confidently\n     past the security desk trying to look as if he belongs.\n\n                           SECURITY GUARD 1\n                      (to Truman)\n              Can I help?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (sneaking a glance at the\n                      building directory)\n              I have an appointment at, er...Diamond\n              Enterprises.\n\n                           SECURITY GUARD 1\n              They went bust.\n\n     The second Security Guard is rising from his seat to block\n     Truman's path to the elevators but Truman reads his mind\n     and makes a dash for it.\n\n     He slips into an elevator just as the doors are closing,\n     defeating the flailing arm of the pursuing guard.  A WOMAN\n     EXECUTIVE in the elevator looks in horror at Truman.  The cause\n     of her concern becomes all too apparent.  Looking beyond the\n     woman, Truman discovers that there is no back to the elevator\n     car.\n\n     The elevator is simply an opening into the body of the building.\n     Truman pushes past the Woman to be confronted with the fact that\n     the entire office block is nothing but a giant, empty shell with\n     no floors above the ground floor.\n\n     The PEOPLE Truman has just witnessed entering the other\n     elevators are milling around a refreshment table, sitting on\n     folding chairs, changing their clothes behind temporary\n     curtained cubicles or lining up to re-enter the bogus elevator\n     cars.  Gradually, they all turn to gape at Truman, who in turn\n     stares back, appalled.\n\n     The Security Guards suddenly appear at Truman's side and take\n     him by the arm.\n\n                           SECURITY GUARD 1\n              You gotta leave.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (riveted by the equally-stunned\n                      building occupants)\n              What're they doing?\n\n                           SECURITY GUARD 2\n              You gotta leave.\n\n     The Guards frog-march Truman out of the huge facade towards an\n     Emergency Exit.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (not going quietly)\n              Just tell me what the hell's going on?\n\n                           SECURITY GUARD 1\n              We're re-modelling.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Like fuck!  What're they doing?\n\n\n     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN continues to struggle as the GUARDS usher him to the\n     street.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              You don't tell me, I'll get you investigated!\n\n                           SECURITY GUARD 2\n              Investigate what?  You're trespassing!\n\n     Truman sees there is no point in arguing further.  His\n     shouts are attracting the interest of PASSERS-BY.  A thought\n     occurs to him.\n\n     He starts to run along the street, suddenly entering another\n     building at random.  An office block with a bank on the ground\n     floor.  As he skirts the bank, he feels the eyes of the BANK\n     STAFF and CUSTOMERS on him.  Is he so suspicious-looking or\n     were they expecting him?\n\n     Truman rushes to the elevators.  The lights above the doors\n     show all the elevators on upper floors.  Frantic pressing\n     of the elevator button gets no response.  Truman heads for the\n     stairs but is intercepted by a BANK OFFICIAL who bars his way.\n\n                           OFFICIAL\n              You can't--\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (anticipating his response)\n              --I know.\n\n     Truman backs away out of the office and continues to run down\n     the streets of Lower Manhattan's financial district.  Every\n     building he encounters seems to have a SECURITY GUARD\n     anticipating his arrival or a building OFFICIAL hanging a CLOSED\n     FOR BUSINESS sign on the front door.\n\n     He feels the eyes of PEDESTRIANS.  Is he simply drawing\n     attention to himself by his behavior?  Truman wheels around,\n     trying to make eye contact with passers-by.  They shy away.\n     Truman stops still, his head reeling.\n\n\n     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.\n\n     From the office window on the twelfth floor, TRUMAN can observe\n     the glass building down the street.  He ponders the black,\n     mirrored box.

After waiting only a matter of\n     seconds for an elevator, he impatiently enters the stairwell.\n\n     As soon as he disappears from sight, a grim CHRISTOF emerges\n     from a nearby office, shadowed as always by CHLOE.   They\n     approach Lawrence with the familiarity of business associates.\n\n                           LAWRENCE\n              680 West 89th.\n\n     Christof nods.  Chloe opens a flip-phone to make a call.\n\n\n     INT.  INSURANCE CO. - STAIRWELL.  DAY.\n\n     An out-of-breath TRUMAN arrives on the second floor landing of\n     the stairwell to find two burly MOVERS blocking his path\n     with a large office desk they are attempting to transport.\n     Truman considers retracing his steps, then without warning\n     clambers over the mahogany barrier.\n\n                           MOVER 1\n              Hey, would it kill ya to wait?!\n\n\n     INT.  SUBWAY.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN paces impatiently on an empty subway platform with other\n     frustrated passengers.  He loses patience and suddenly\n     turns and runs up the stairs.\n\n     INT.  TAXI CAB.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN sits seething in a traffic jam that exists for no\n     apparent reason.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (impatiently to driver)\n              Is there another way?

A partially\n     burnt building, waterlogged, still faintly smoldering.  Truman\n     checks the address on his file.  A small, serious-looking BOY\n     straddles his bicycle on the sidewalk.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to the boy)\n              When was the fire?\n\n                           BOY\n                      (shrug)\n              Week ago.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              How come it's still smoking?\n\n                           BOY\n              Started up again.\n                      (dismissive)\n              Kids.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (referring to his claims report)\n              Says here it burnt to the ground.\n\n                           BOY\n              Wishful thinking maybe?\n\n     The boy is wise well beyond his years.  Truman fixes him with a\n     glare.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Someone send you to tell me all this?\n\n                           BOY\n                      (unfazed)\n              You the one askin' questions.\n\n     The boy casually rides away.\n\n\n     EXT.  CITY PARK.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN wanders aimlessly through a city park, observing.  We\n     sense, truly observing for the first time.\n\n     A group of YOUTHS play a pick-up game of basketball.  A YOUNG\n     WOMAN walks a pair of AFGHAN HOUNDS.  An OLD MAN answers the\n     incessant questions of his GRANDCHILD.  Nothing appears amiss.\n\n\n     EXT.  TIMES SQUARE.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN stands amidst a throng of TOURISTS and COMMUTERS marooned\n     on Times Square.  Mesmerized by the two fast-moving rivers of\n     vehicles flowing through the intersection.\n\n     Truman stares down at the street, contemplating stepping out\n     into the traffic.  However as his foot is poised, the stream\n     of cars that passed so close by seconds earlier, now appear to\n     be giving him a wider berth.  He steps off the sidewalk and.\n     to an acompaniment of car horns, begins to wander back and forth\n     without fear through the traffic, confident that each vehicle\n     will take evasive action.\n\n     Safely on the other side of the street, he stands in front of\n     the window of an electronics store.  He watches a local TV\n     news show covering the Santa Maria replica moored near Pier 13.\n\n     However Truman is forced to look away when he glimpses his own\n     face on another TV taking a feed from a camcorder aimed out the\n     store window.  He shudders at his video reflection.\n\n\n     INT.  DIMLY-LIT ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN'S face stares out from a televison monitor.  We slowly\n     pull back to reveal that other smaller monitors surround the\n     first until we find ourselves staring at a video wall in a room\n     the size of a football field.\n\n     The curved bank of monitors, suspended by cables from the\n     ceiling, gives the appearance of a giant patch-work mobile.\n     Investigating the screens we discover surveillance pictures from\n     all over New York City, covering every facet of Truman's life.\n     Camera angles from the interior of Truman's house, his backyard,\n     car, subway station, office, the deli he frequents, the seashore\n     to which he is drawn, the park he visits with Veronica, the\n     abandoned freeway where he golfs with Marlon, many of the\n     locations strangely devoid of people.\n\n     Beneath the video wall is a state-of-the-art mixing desk, its\n     illuminated buttons glowing brightly in the gloom.  Facing the\n     desk, several OPERATORS in high-backed, high-tech swivel chairs,\n     wearing the slimmest of headsets.  SIMEON, a meticulous young\n     man with a penetrating gaze, sits directly in front of the\n     largest of the monitors, co-ordinating camera angles.\n\n     CHRISTOF stands over Simeon's shoulder, staring intently at the\n     live picture of Truman now seated at a streetside cafe,\n     continuing to inspect his surroundings.  CHLOE hovers in the\n     background.\n\n     There is an uncomfortable silence in the control room as the\n     production crew feel themselves under scrutiny for the first\n     time.  Christof leans forward and talks soothingly into a\n     microphone on the control panel.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              ...Everybody stay focused...remember who\n              you are...\n\n\n     EXT.  STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN sits alone at the table, still looking for a false move.\n\n     A DELIVERY MAN unloads boxes from the back of his truck and\n     carries them into a Restaurant Supply store.  Further down the\n     street CONSTRUCTION WORKERS take their time tending to an\n     electrical repair in an exposed manhole.  A POSTAL WORKER does\n     his rounds.  An OLD WOMAN struggles with two heavy shopping\n     bags.  Everybody appears natural, places to go.\n\n     Truman turns his attention to a group of ITALIAN-LOOKING MEN\n     at the only other occupied table at the cafe.  We see extreme\n     close-ups as Truman scans the men's faces for any sign of\n     phoniness.  They are talking loudly, making suggestive comments\n     to the WAITRESS and generally showing off like schoolboys.\n     Their behavior passes the test, all seems genuine.\n\n     Truman idly regards his three-stone wedding ring with which he\n     has been fidgeting.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     The on-air monitor shows TRUMAN from the ring's POV, revealing\n     that the small center diamond contains a miniature, hidden\n     camera.  Truman suspects nothing.\n\n     He looks up to find two well-to-do 3OGGERS, out for a lunchtime\n     run, making their way down the street towards the cafe.  Truman\n     happens to glance at the sneakers of one of the joggers.  He\n     springs to his feet and blocks the joggers' path.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (staring at the monitor)\n              Damn!\n\n     Unseen by Christof, his Assistant Director, Simeon takes a\n     moment of pleasure from the older man's distress.\n\n\n     EXT.  STREETSIDE CAFE, LITTLE ITALY.  DAY.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to the jogger with\n                      the familiar sneakers)\n              Small world.\n\n                           JOGGER 1\n                      (attempting to sidestep Truman)\n              Excuse me.\n\n     Truman blocks the man a second time.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              You don't remember?  Two days ago I gave you\n              my meatball sandwich in the park.  You were\n              in a wheelchair.  Same sneakers.\n\n     An almost subliminal flashback appears in Truman's head\n     confirming that the JOGGER and the HOMELESS MAN in the\n     wheelchair two days earlier are one and the same.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (commenting ironically on his\n                      new-found mobility)\n              A miracle!\n\n                           JOGGER 2\n                      (coming to his companion's aid)\n              Get the hell outta here.\n\n     The second jogger pushes Truman back against the cafe table\n     causing him to stumble.\n\n\n     EXT.  WAREHOUSE - MARLON'S WORK.  DAY.\n\n     MARLON is loading boxes of candy into the back of his van.\n     TRUMAN hurries up to him.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Marlon. I've gotta talk to you.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (surprised)\n              Truman!

CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     CHRISTOF is in deep conversation with two executives.  MOSES, a\n     contemporary of Christof but more jaded and debauched-looking\n     and ROMAN, a fresh-faced, younger man.  CHLOE hovers in the\n     background.  A monitor, suspended from the ceiling shows a\n     surveillance shot of TRUMAN and MARLON pulling into a beach\n     parking lot in Marlon's van.\n\n     The glass conference room looks out onto the vast control\n     facility where SIMEON continues to call the shots, all too aware\n     of the closed-door discussion taking place in the background.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (marveling, excitedly referring\n                      to Truman on the monitor)\n              I can't believe how much he's shoved down.

DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN runs down the beach towards the cliff he attempted to\n     scale as a seven-year-old boy.\n\n\n     EXT.  CLIFFTOP.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN sits on the clifftop, staring out at the view his father\n     had been so desperate for him not to see twenty-seven years\n     earlier.  However the deserted bay beyond is exactly as his\n     father described - almost identical to its neighbor.  MARLON,\n     laboring, crests the rise and joins his friend on the clifftop.\n\n                           MARLON\n              What're we doing here, Truman?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              This is where it started.\n\n                           MARLON\n              Where what started?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Things.

You\n              ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your\n              whole life has been building to something?\n\n     Marlon looks skeptically at Truman.  He hasn't had that feeling.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (becoming testy)\n              A coincidence.

She was too beautiful for here.\n\n     Now Marlon is really confused.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Can you lend me some money?  A hundred bucks.\n\n                           MARLON\n              All I got on me is the takings from the machines.\n              Why do you need it?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I'm going away for a while.\n\n\n     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DUSK.\n\n     The comfortably furnished room of a writer.  Walls lined with\n     books.  Desk overlooking the sea, strewn with notes, photos and\n     other reference material.  Sylvia's name on the spine of several\n     published volumes.  Pages of unfinished manuscript, handwritten\n     in blue ink.\n\n     SYLVIA stands at a bookcase, looking for inspiration.  As she\n     pulls out a book, a magazine falls to the floor.  Truman's\n     missing copy of Time Magazine.  His face on the cover with the\n     headline,  \"Truman Burbank and the Lost Generation\".\n\n     Sylvia retrieves the magazine.  In front of a nearby mirror, she\n     holds Truman's photographed face next to her own, for a moment\n     imagining them together.  Then, catching herself, she quickly\n     lowers the magazine, left alone with her own reflection.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     We see TRUMAN's disturbed face reflected in the screen of his\n     television set, montaged over that of ROBIN LEACH, host of\n     \"Lifestyles Of The Rich And Famous\".  MERYL, wearing her robe,\n     head against Truman's chest, sips from a bottle of beer.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (attempting to open him up)\n              What's going on, Truman?

NIGHT.\n\n     CHRISTOF eats a sumptuous meal in an ornate private dining\n     room with an elegant WOMAN, thirty years his junior.  Playing\n     silently on a monitor on an antique side table is a surveillance\n     shot of TRUMAN and MERYL slumped in front of their television.\n\n     CHLOE, enters the room and nods an apology to Christof's dinner\n     companion - a woman her own age.  Christof's companion shrugs\n     resignedly.  Christof registers Chloe's thinly disguised\n     resentment, enjoying the rivalry.\n\n     Chloe inserts a cassette tape into a nearby VCR.  Christof\n     wipes his mouth with his napkin and picks up his wine glass as\n     he gives the television his full attention.  A commercial for\n     \"GLOBAL TRAVEL\" begins to play.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     TRUMAN continues to watch \"Lifestyles\" restlessly.  However, as\n     he goes to get up from the sofa, MERYL starts to slide down his\n     chest towards his lap.\n\n                           MERYL\n              We could do it right here, like we used to.\n\n     The program cuts to a commercial break.  The commercial\n     is for \"Global Travel\".\n\n                           NARRATOR\n                      (from television)\n              Travelling Down Under?

However, on his way to the\n     bathroom he hesitates at the kitchen table.  He surreptitiously\n     lifts the platic-coated plaid tablecloth to reveal numerous\n     bills laid out flat beneath it to keep the stash hidden.\n\n\n     INT.  CHRISTOF'S BEDROOM.  DAWN.\n\n     CHLOE pulls back long, white silk drapes to reveal a spectacular\n     view overlooking the Hollywood Hills.  CHRISTOF rouses from his\n     enormous round bed.  His DINNER COMPANION also stirs, waving\n     coyly to Chloe as she modestly covers herself, only mildly\n     perturbed by the intrusion.  Chloe switches on the television\n     set in the extravagent bedroom.  Playing on the set are TRUMAN\n     and MERYL still fast asleep in their own bed.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              What happened overnight?\n\n                           CHLOE\n              He couldn't do it, even on the sofa.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (smiling to himself)\n              God, that thing of his must be psychic.\n                      (matter-of-fact)\n              He didn't masturbate?\n\n                           CHLOE\n              Not for the last two inonths.\n\n     Chloe exits and Christof climbs out of bed.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  MORNING.\n\n     MERYL emerges from the bathroom, ready for work, surprised to\n     find TRUMAN sitting at the kitchen table.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (rubbing ointment into her wrists)\n              Aren't you gonna be late?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I got a call in the area.\n                      (nodding to her wrists)\n              What's the case?

We see a quick flashback in Truman's head\n     of the two YOUTHS assaulting the WOMAN on his train.\n\n                           MERYL\n              They're guilty as hell but they'll walk.  No\n              witnesses.  Her word against theirs.\n                      (picking up her bag to leave)\n              Maybe we could meet for lunch today.\n\n     Meryl gives him an affectionate kiss and exits the back door.\n     Truman waits for the sound of Meryl's car to disappear down the\n     road and exits himself.\n\n\n     INT.  COURT BUILDING.  MORNING.\n\n     TRUMAN enters the courtroom building.  A crush of DEFENDENTS,\n     FAMILIES, ATTORNEYS and POLICE OFFICERS.  Truman goes to enter\n     a courtroom but a SECURITY GUARD blocks his path.\n\n                           SECURITY GUARD\n              You a witness?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Er, yes...\n                      (suddenly losing heart)\n              No, no I'm not.\n\n                           SECURITY GUARD\n              Closed session.\n\n     Before the guard can move him on. Truman sneaks a look at\n     proceedings through the courtroom door window.\n\n     He recognizes the two YOUTHS sitting at the defendent's table.\n     A PROSECUTOR is on his feet, addressing the JURY.  MERYL is\n     working attentively at her stenotype machine, her fingers\n     rapidly pressing the keys.  However, Truman notices a glaring\n     omission.  There is no paper emerging from Meryl's machine.  The\n     roll of paper tape sits on the floor beside her chair leg.\n         \n\n     INT.  TRAVEL AGENCY.  DAY.\n\n     The EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS inside GLOBAL TRAVEL are all doing\n     a last-minute primp, fixing their hair and checking their\n     clothes.  Suddenly, in unison, they take their positions and\n     begin working.  As TRUMAN enters GLOBAL TRAVEL, one CUSTOMER\n     looks up a fraction too quickly, anticipating his arrival.\n\n     Truman takes a seat at the only unoccupied desk, opposite a\n     female TRAVEL AGENT.  Feeling uneasy about a surveillance camera\n     in the corner of the room, he nervously obscures his face with\n     his hand.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I wanna book a flight to Australia.\n\n                           AGENT\n              Where exactly?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (believing she is being\n                      deliberately obtuse)\n              Australia.\n\n                           AGENT\n                      (a trace of condescension)\n              Where in Australia?

MANAGER\n                      (unable to conceal his pride)\n              Happy?\n\n     Christof gives a grudgingly complimentary nod.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (staring out at the pleasure\n                      craft littering the harbor)\n              Can we contain him long enough?\n\n                           PROD. MANAGER\n              I think so.\n\n     Christof looks skyward at the cottonwool clouds above the\n     harbor.\n\n                           PROD. MANAGER\n                      (anticipating his next question)\n              He flies at night.  Thick cloud cover to\n              disorient him.  Hopefully we'll knock him\n              out with complimentary cocktails, pull the\n              shades down during the movies.  He'll never know.\n\n     Christof gives another grudging nod of approval.  The Production\n     Manager is beckoned by a group of CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who are\n     putting the finishing touches to a corner of the Opera House.\n     CHLOE drifts to Christof's side, a Watchman TV in her hand.\n\n                           CHLOE\n                      (referring to the surrounding scene)\n              Why go to all the trouble?\n\n     Christof glances at the TV screen in her hand, showing TRUMAN\n     sitting in his office gazing at his composite picture of SYLVIA.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              He believes she has the answer.\n\n                           CHLOE\n              Why not just tell him she's dead?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              It's too late for that.  That won't satisfy\n              him.  He's going to have to find out for himself.\n              See it with his own eyes.  Right now he needs\n              something genuine.\n                      (rueful, all too aware\n                      of the contradiction)\n              Even if we have to fake it.\n\n\n     INT.  INSURANCE COMPANY.  DAY.\n\n     Close up on typewriting appearing on a page.\n\n              \"Please accept my resignation from\n              American Life & Accident, Inc. to\n              take effect immediately.\n\n              Yours tru\"\n\n     TRUMAN gets up from the typewriter in mid-word and strolls to a\n     fellow AGENT's desk.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to agent, picking up\n                      a dictionary)\n              \"Yours truly...\"  You spell \"truly\"\n              \"l...y\" or \"e...l...y\"?\n\n                           INSURANCE AGENT\n              I always write \"Yours faithfully...\"\n\n     Truman finds the appropriate page in the dictionary and gazes at\n     the entry for a long moment.  He looks up, staring into the\n     middle distance.  His eyes widen as something clicks in his\n     mind.  Suddenly LAWRENCE snatches the dictionary from his hand.\n\n                           LAWRENCE\n              Where the hell have you been, Burbank?\n              What the hell's going on?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              That's what I'd like to know, Lawrence.\n\n     The AGENTS in the other cubicles turn in their direction.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I was just about to resign.

I'm calling Security\".\n\n     Truman picks up the framed photograph from his desk, containing\n     SYLVIA's hidden likeness.  Suddenly he wheels on Lawrence,\n     pinning him to a cubicle wall.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              You don't believe a single word you're saying!\n                      (to the assembled group)\n              None of you do!\n                      (suddenly talking to a sprinkler\n                      head in the ceiling)\n              You hear me?!\n\n     We see Truman's manic face from the sprinkler head's POV.\n     Truman stomps off down the corridor, other Insurance Agents\n     giving him a wide berth.  He shoves computers, desk lamps and\n     pot holders off desks as he goes.\n\n\n     EXT.  MANHATTAN STREET.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN steps out of the office, suddenly able to breathe\n     again, pleased to be outdoors despite the gloomy sky overhead.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM SOMEWHERE.  DAY.\n\n     CHRISTOF is once again standing at the picture window in the\n     dimly-lit control room where we first encountered him.  Behind\n     him, the fronds of the palm tree sway in a gentle breeze.  The\n     sky, a cloudless, cobalt blue in sharp contrast to the overcast\n     day in New York City.\n\n     SIMEON, co-ordinating camera angles, sits in front of the\n     largest of the monitors that shows a live picture of TRUMAN\n     stuck in his car in gridlock.\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (talking quietly into a\n                      slim headset)\n              ...and back to the close-up...\n\n     CHLOE's attention is focused on a subsidiary monitor displaying\n     a freeze frame of TRUMAN reading the dictionary a few minutes\n     earlier.\n\n                           CHLOE\n                      (to a hard-bitten Operator, staring\n                      at the dictionary)\n              Do you think he sees the entry?\n\n                           OPERATOR\n              Hard to tell.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (sarcastic)\n              Why don't we ask him?\n\n                           CHLOE\n                      (snapping back, referring to the book)\n              I don't know how it got there!\n                      (to Operator)\n              Enhance.\n\n     Christof turns his back on the screen and stares out the window.\n     We focus on an enhanced picture of the dictionary's text.\n\n               genuinely, etc.  2. in fact; really.\n\n              Truman\u00cbsque (\u00cbsk)a. characteristic\n               of the experiences of Truman Burbank\n               (a Trumanesque town, conversation,\n               etc.) [circa. 1972)\n         \n              trump,n. [<triumph], 1. playing-\n\n\n     EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET IN QUEENS.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN drives erratically down a quiet suburban street.\n     On the sidewalk up ahead, he spies a YOUNG MOTHER pushing an\n     INFANT in a baby carriage.\n\n     Truman suddenly swerves sharply and jumps the curb in front\n     of the mother and child, the car straddling the sidewalk.  He\n     has the driver's door open almost before the Oldsmobile has come\n     to a halt.  Truman dashes from the car and plucks the infant\n     from the carriage while the mother stands rooted to the spot.\n\n     The startled infant immediately begins to wail as Truman holds\n     the crying bundle in both hands above his head.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to the Mother, motioning to the sidewalk)\n              Say my name or I'll smash its head open.\n\n     The young mother, frozen with fright, does not reply.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (vehement)\n              Say my name!\n\n                           YOUNG MOTHER\n                      (composing herself,\n                      reaching out for her child)\n              Please, give him to me...\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (screaming above the baby's cries)\n              Say my name!  You know my name!

He drops his hose and hurries\n     towards the fracas.  Halfway across the street, the old man\n     stops in his tracks as he sees the baby, perilously poised in\n     the air.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (hysterical)\n              I mean it!  I'm ready to do it!\n              What's my name?!!\n\n     Truman lifts the screaming baby as far above his head as he can,\n     his arms shaking, fighting the urge to dash the fragile innocent\n     to the concrete.  We see a view of the scene from the POV of a\n     streetlight.  The young mother, recognizing Truman's\n     seriousness, opens her mouth to speak but no sound comes.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (entreating the young\n                      woman, tears in his eyes)\n              This is your last chance!\n\n     The anguish in his voice convinces us that Truman is truly on\n     the brink.  The young woman now has tears rolling down her\n     cheeks.  She is at a loss, powerless.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (his entire body shaking)\n              What...is...my...name?!\n\n     The young woman mumbles but is unable to supply the name.\n     Truman, arms shaking, face red with rage, realizes he can't go\n     through with it.  With everything he has, he gathers himself.\n     After what seems like an age, he ever so slowly lowers the\n     child into the safety of the mother's outstretched arms.\n\n                           YOUNG MOTHER\n                      (clutching the baby to\n                      her breast, without thinking)\n              Thank you, Truman.\n\n     Truman shudders at the sound of his name and backs away from the\n     young woman, as if it is she who now represents the threat.\n\n     He jumps into his car and slams it into gear, driving over the\n     sidewalk and back onto the street.  The young woman and the old\n     man stare after Truman's car as it roars away.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR.  DAY.\n\n     As TRUMAN drives, he stares, paranoid, at seemingly innocuous\n     features in his Oldsmobile - his rearview mirror, steering wheel\n     insignia, speedometer, airconditioning ducts - and peers up at\n     the streetlamps lining the roadway.\n\n\n     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     A dozen-or-so of SYLVIA'S FRIENDS, including the MAN we have\n     seen before, sit around a table on the balcony in the afternoon\n     sun, talking animatedly.  A TEN-YEAR-OLD SON of one of the\n     guests has strayed into the living room and switched on the\n     television set hidden away in an antique bureau.\n\n     SYLVIA. emerging from the kitchen, is taken aback by what she\n     sees playing on the screen.  The MAN on the balcony catches\n     her look as she swiftly switches off the TV.  She gently takes\n     the child's hand and leads him outside.\n\n\n     EXT.  TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN, staring at the freeway from the bottom of the garden.\n     doesn't bother to look up as MERYL approaches.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (referring to a distant\n                      car on the expressway)\n              See that car way down there?  I bet it's a\n              Suburu station wagon.\n\n     Meryl looks idly over the fence at the approaching car.\n     Finally a Suburu station wagon motors by.  Meryl is unimpressed.\n     Truman turns his back on the Expressway to continue his game.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I predict the next four cars will be a\n              white Honda Civic, a blue and white\n              Dodge Dart with the front hubcap missing,\n              a Volkswagon Beetle with a dented fender\n              and a motorcycle.\n\n     Meryl doesn't wish to participate in the game and makes for\n     the house.  Truman holds her arm, forcing her to watch.  He\n     turns to check his prediction.  A convoy of cars approaches.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              There's the Honda...the Dodge...here\n              comes the dented Beetle...\n\n     Meryl's attention wavers.  Truman tightens his grip.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Look, damn you!\n\n     Following the VW is a school bus.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (mocking)\n              Where's the motorcycle?\n\n     Truman is momentarily disappointed.  Meryl seizes her chance\n     and heads for the house.  Truman follows her inside.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (yelling after her)\n              Don't you want to know how I did that?\n              Maybe you already know.

TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN and MERYL are hemmed in by a traffic snarl on the New\n     Jersey Turnpike.  We observe the Oldsmobile on a television\n     lens from the POV of a tail-light on the car ahead.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (a manic edge to his voice)\n              So much traffic, this time of day.  Does\n              that strike you as peculiar?\n\n     On the side of the road, TWO MOTORISTS, are arguing over a\n     minor collision.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (sneering at the sight of\n                      the motorists)\n              Look at them.

But\n     his move is anticipated.  At the end of the offramp a pack of\n     cars suddenly appears.  Other vehicles fill the gap behind.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to Meryl, marveling)\n              Blocked at every turn.

We could be stuck here\n              for hours.  Could be like this all the\n              way to Atlantic City.\n\n     Truman suddenly veers the Oldsmobile onto the sidewalk.\n\n                           MERYL\n              What the hell are you doing?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              You're right.  Let's go back.  I'm\n              sorry.  I don't know what got into me.\n\n     Truman rejoins the New Jersey Turnpike, heading back towards\n     Queens, the roadway now relatively free of traffic.\n\n                           MERYL\n              Would you please slow down, Truman?\n\n     Truman floors the Oldsmobile.  The car flies past the exit for\n     Route 276.  He continues along the Jersey Turnpike.\n\n                           MERYL\n              Truman, that was the turnoff!\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              I've changed my mind again.

CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.\n\n     CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON and the other OPERATORS follow Truman's\n     progress from a helicopter shot - the Oldsmobile optically\n     circled to ease identification.  Christof jabs his finger at the\n     rapidly thinning traffic surrounding Truman's vehicle.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (to Simeon)\n              What the hell is wrong with the \"carousel\"?\n              Keep them together.\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (agitated)\n              They're rusty.

TRUMAN'S CAR.  DUSK.\n\n     As he speeds erratically, TRUMAN glances at the streets either\n     side of the freeway, where he discovers a distinct lack of\n     moving traffic.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to the anxious Meryl at his side)\n              Look down there, Meryl!...No cars!

Executives, MOSES and ROMAN have entered the\n     control room.  They hover nervously in the background.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S CAR, WESTCHESTER.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN is forced to slow once again behind a line of other cars\n     at a police roadblock.  At the head of the line, the cars are\n     being turned around by POLICE OFFICERS, who are also contending\n     with a swarm of NEWS REPORTERS and TELEVISION CREWS.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to Meryl)\n              It's hard to go places, isn't it?\n\n                           MERYL\n              There's been an accident, Truman.  We\n              have to go back.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              No.  There's no accident.  It'S just more stalling.\n\n     Truman slows beside a POLICE OFFICER.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              What's going on?\n\n                           OFFICER\n                      (grim-faced, indicating the nearby\n                      Indian Point nuclear power plant)\n              Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Is there any way around?\n\n                           OFFICER\n              The whole area's being evacuated.  A precaution.\n\n     Truman falls in line behind the cars making a U-turn when, all\n     of a sudden, he guns his car and swerves past the barricade.\n\n\n     EXT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DUSK.\n\n     In the twilight sun, SYLVIA'S GUESTS wander up the gravel path,\n     leading away from the beach house, the younger children carried\n     in their parents' arms.  Hanging back from the rest of the\n     group, Sylvia's admirer, wheeling his bicycle, turns back\n     to the house.  As the MAN is about to lean his bicycle against\n     the side of the beach house, he looks in a window.\n\n     Lit by a blue-glow, SYLVIA sits transfixed by the television\n     playing in her antique bureau, the screen obscured from our\n     view.  She is unaware of the man's face at the window.\n\n     Recognizing what is playing on the screen, the man regards\n     Sylvia with a resigned smile.  He mounts the bicycle and rides\n     back up the path.\n\n\n     EXT.  NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  DUSK.\n\n     Truman's car slides to a stop, blocked by Hazardous Waste\n     vehicles straddling the roadway leading up to the power plant,\n     the pursuing police car blocking his retreat.  TRUMAN flees the\n     car, leaving MERYL in the passenger seat.\n\n                           MERYL\n              Truman!!  Come back!!\n\n     Truman bursts past the alien-looking HAZARDOUS WASTE WORKERS in\n     their protective suits carrying detection instruments.  The\n     workers give chase in their cumbersome suits, trying to cut off\n     his path to the power plant.  As he crests a slight rise beyond\n     the plant, he is finally tackled to the ground.  However,\n     peering through the long grass, Truman is able to make out the\n     lights of a cityscape in the distance.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.\n\n     CHRISTOF, a trace of panic in his eyes, turning to CHLOE.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Did he see it?\n\n                           CHLOE\n              I don't think so.\n\n     The reason for Christof's concern becomes all too apparent as\n     the helicopter passes over the power plant, where the struggling\n     TRUMAN is being escorted away.  We see an aerial shot from the\n     helicopter as it emerges directly above the Sydney skyline.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT.\n\n     MERYL and TRUMAN sit at their kitchen table.  Truman stoic,\n     tears rolling down Meryl's cheeks.  Truman's airline ticket\n     torn to shreds on the table in front of them.\n\n                           MERYL\n              Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're\n              not well.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (ignoring her tears and medical advice)\n              Why do you want to have a child with me?\n              You can't stand me.\n\n                           MERYL\n              That's not true.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (suddenly angry)\n              Don't lie to me!\n\n     Truman's raised voice backs Meryl to her feet.  Truman follows,\n     getting in her face.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Tell me what's happening?!\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (frightened but remaining poised)\n              I thought you knew everything.  What could\n              I tell you?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (backing her up against\n                      the kitchen bench)\n              You're part of this, aren't you?!\n\n     Meryl grabs a kitchen knife from a wooden block to protect\n     herself.\n\n                           MERYL\n              Truman, you're scaring me!\n\n     Truman looks in her eyes and, with surprising swiftness,\n     grabs her wrist and disarms her.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              No, you're scaring me, Meryl!\n\n     Truman grabs Meryl by the hair and turns the knife on her.\n     While pressing the blade to Meryl's throat, Truman starts to\n     march her around the room, talking to the walls, light\n     fixtures, a mirror, doorknob, framed picture, blank television.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Stop this now or I kill your leading lady.\n                      (to a lamp)\n              I know you can hear me.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.\n\n     CHRISTOF and the OTHERS watch the monitors spellbound as TRUMAN\n     looks directly into one camera lens after another.  ROMAN is the\n     first to crack.\n\n                           ROMAN\n                      (entreating Christof)\n              Get somebody in there!\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (quiet but firm)\n              No.\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (siding with the executive,\n                      showing his true colors)\n              She's in trouble!  We've got to help her!\n\n     Christof, never taking his eyes from the monitor, leans into\n     the microphone.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT.\n\n     We see an extreme close up of MERYL's ear.  Unheard by TRUMAN,\n     from her inner car, we hear a familiar voice.\n\n                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)\n              He's bluffing.  Call his bluff.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (in reply to the voice in her\n                      head, half-strangled due to the\n                      pressure of the knife)\n              Do something...\n\n     Upon hearing her remark, Truman's eyes widen.  Sensing that she\n     too is addressing a third person, he jerks her head around to\n     read her face.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (wild-eyed)\n              Who are you talking to?!\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (incredulous)\n              You're the one talking to the walls!\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              No.  You said, \"Do something.\"  Who were you\n              talking to?  I swear I'll kill you, if\n              you don't tell me.\n\n     Meryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to\n     the bedroom but before she can barricade the door, Truman\n     forces his way inside.  They both tumble onto the waterbed\n     causing it to rock back and forth.  Gripping Meryl's hair,\n     Truman throws aside the bed covers.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (distraught, referring to the bed)\n              How could you buy this damn thing when you\n              know he drowned in front of me?!\n\n     Truman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing Meryl\n     begins to slash viciously at the waterbed, opening a large gash.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              You have any idea what it's like to drown?\n\n     Truman drops the knife and forces Meryl's head into the gaping\n     hole in the bed, submerging her head in the tepid water.  She\n     thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself.\n\n     Truman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (gasping for air)\n              Truman, stop it!\n                      (to the ceiling)\n              Don't let him do it!\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to a light fixture, threatening)\n              I'll kill her!\n\n     He dunks her head into the water a second time, holding her\n     head down longer this time.  She continues to struggle.\n\n     Suddenly, the front door chimes.  Startled, Truman lets Meryl up\n     for air.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (sneering at Meryl)\n              Right on time.  Cops must be telepathic.\n\n     Meryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but Truman beats\n     her to it.  Grabbing the knife by the blade, he slices his hand.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (wincing in pain)\n              Damn!\n\n     At knifepoint, Truman marches Meryl down the hallway to the\n     front door.  The doorbell chimes a second and third time, more\n     insistently.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (shouting through the closed door)\n              Stay where you are or I'll kill her!\n\n                           MARLON (O.C.)\n              Truman?  It's me, Marlon.\n\n     Truman flinches.  He was so convinced it would be the police.\n     He takes a step back against the hallway wall.  Before he can\n     decide what to do, Marlon has opened the unlocked front door\n     to be confronted with the sight of Truman holding the knife to\n     Meryl's throat, blood streaming from his own wound.\n\n     Marlon locks eyes on Truman.  Sizing up the situation, he slowly\n     but decisively removes the knife from Truman's hand.  Meryl\n     wrenches herself free from Truman's now limp grasp, and\n     collapses into Marlon's arms, sobbing.\n\n                           MERYL\n                      (distraught, dropping character,\n                      forgetting herself)\n              They were going to let him kill me!\n\n\n     EXT.  ABANDONED FREEWAY.  NIGHT.\n\n     MARLON and TRUMAN, both nursing bottles of beer, sit on the end\n     of their abandoned freeway off-ramp.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              People know who I am, my every move, complete\n              strangers know my name.  Even when there's\n              no one around, I feel the eyes on me.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (reluctant admission)\n              I was in the bank today.  The Federal on\n              Lewis.  A clerk was talking about somebody\n              named Truman messing with her baby.  Is that\n              the stranger you're talking about?\n\n     Truman closes his eyes as he takes in the explanation.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (half to himself, refusing to accept it)\n              No.  No.  I've never seen her before.\n                      (registering Marlon's skepticism)\n              I know you already think I'm going out\n              of my mind but I genuinely believe the\n              world revolves around me somehow.  Everybody\n              seems to be in on it.\n\n                           MARLON\n              It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure\n              that's not wishful thinking, you wishing\n              you'd made something more of yourself?  Christ,\n              Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had\n              an imaginary interview with Barbara Walters?\n              Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              That's just it.  I think I am somebody.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (sympathetizing)\n              I used to dream all my friends and family\n              got together in a hotel room, thinking of\n              ways to fuck me up.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Sometimes I think it's in my head, sometimes\n              I think it's for real.\n\n     Marlon looks around as if drawing inspiration from somewhere\n     in the night.\n\n                           MARLON\n              Tru, we've known each other since before\n              we could get a hard-on.\n\n     Truman half-smiles at the ribald remark.\n\n                           MARLON\n              The only way we ever made it through\n              high school was cheating off each other's\n              test papers.  Jesus, they were identical.\n              I always liked that, because whatever the\n              answer was, we was right together and we\n              was wrong together.\n\n     Truman nods fondly at the memory.\n\n                           MARLON\n              The only night either of us ever spent\n              in jail, we spent together and I wet\n              myself but you never told anyone.\n              I was best man at your wedding and my\n              brother was best man at my wedding and\n              you didn't talk to me for a month over\n              that and I didn't blame you because you've\n              been more of a brother to me than he's\n              ever been.  And I never shoulda let\n              my Goddam father talk me into that.\n\n     Truman is slowly coming around.  Marlon's speech from the heart\n     soothing away his pain.\n\n                           MARLON\n              I know things haven't worked out for\n              either of us like we used to sit up on\n              Freemont Street all night and dream they\n              would.  We all let opportunities pass us\n              by, none of us asks for the dance as\n              often as we should.  I know that feeling\n              when it's like everything's slipping away\n              and you don't want to believe it so you\n              look for answers someplace else.  But,\n              well, the point is, I would gladly step\n              in front of traffic for you.\n\n     Truman grins a melancholy grin, nearly all the way back.  We see\n     a close up of Marlon's ear.  From inside, unheard by Truman,\n     CHRISTOF dictates Marlon's heartfelt speech.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.\n\n     CHRISTOF leans over a microphone at the mixing desk, feeding the\n     lines to Marlon, immersed in the role.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (hushed tones)\n              ...and the last thing I'd ever do is\n              lie to you...\n\n     Recognizing the importance of the moment, his colleagues stand\n     around in awe at Christof's spontaneous performance, arguably\n     superior to Marlon's own delivery.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (staring into Truman's\n                      eyes, repeating the\n                      words in his ear)\n              And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.\n                      (pause)\n              Think about it, Truman, if everybody's\n              in on it, I'd have to be in on it too.\n              I'm not in on it cos there is no it.\n\n     Truman's head slowly drops in surrender, his doubts draining\n     away.  Marlon embraces Truman in a bearhug.\n\n     Truman looks over his shoulder to the sky where a single star\n     shines.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.\n\n     From his chair, CHRISTOF modestly accepts the congratulations of\n     his COLLEAGUES.  The two executives, MOSES and ROMAN are at the\n     head of the line, their earlier disagreement suddenly forgotten.\n\n     CHLOE gives Christof a warm hug.\n\n     MARLON, accepting a towel from a P.A., still in wardrobe,\n     approaches and kneels beside the arm of Christof's chair.\n     grasping his hand.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (leaving his head close to\n                      Christof)\n              I can't thank you enough.  I don't know\n              what happened.  He was so close.  It threw\n              me.  I'm indebted.\n\n     Christof gives Marlon a consoling pat on the shoulder and\n     Marlon withdraws.\n\n     Finally Christof's Assistant Director, SIMEON, approaches and\n     offers his hand.  Christof hesitates before shaking.  Simeon\n     returns to the monitors, now showing TRUMAN alone at the dock or\n     Long Island.  Christof stares out the window to conceal an\n     expression of quiet vindication.\n\n\n     INT.  A LTVING ROOM SOMEWHERE.  NIGHT.\n\n     The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before sit on their sofa\n     gazing straight ahead.  On the teievision in front of them,\n     a live picture of TRUMAN - the first time we have seen him\n     broadcast to a viewer's set.\n\n     He is reading a book at his kitchen table, unaware of the\n     cameras recording him.\n\n     The scene alternates between a wide master shot, a medium tight\n     shot, a close up of Truman's face and two insert shots - one\n     over the shoulder shot of the page he is reading and one from\n     another angle showing the book's title, \"To The Ends Of The\n     Earth - The Age Of Exploration\".\n\n     At one point, a sponsor's border appears on screen, tastefully\n     framing the \"action\" with the message, \"FOLGERS Coffee - Good To\n     The Last Drop.\"  After several seconds, the border disappears.\n\n     Suddenly tbe live picture of Truman shrinks into a window on the\n     screen to accomodate a title sequence that begins to piay around\n     the edge of the image.  Overlapping scenes from Truman's life\n     appear in chronological order, from infancy to adolescence and\n     finally adulthood.  A graphic, \"TRUMAN - Total Record Of A Human\n     Life\", appears on screen accompanied by an introductory\n     narration.\n\n                           NARRATOR (O.C.)\n              You are watching \"Truman - Total Record Of\n              A Human Life\".  Everything that occurs here\n              is real.  There are no re-creations or\n              interruptions.  Due to the live and unedited\n              nature of the program, viewer discretion is\n              advised.\n\n     The title sequence is replaced by an INTERVIEWER, mid-fifties,\n     conservative suit and hair, sitting opposite CHRISTOF in a Larry\n     King-style interview setting.  Projected in the background is\n     the live picture of Truman, immersed in his book.\n\n\n     INT.  STUDIO.  NIGHT.\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n                      (to camera)\n              Welcome to week seventeen hundred and sixty\n              eight of \"Truman\" and there can scarcely have\n              been a more momentous week in the show's\n              history.  I'm your host, Michael Conners, and\n              this is a special edition of \"Tru Talk\", the\n              forum where we discuss and analyze recent\n              events with the show's award-winning creator\n              and producer, Christof.\n                      (referring to the image\n                      of Truman in the background)\n              I remind viewers that as this is a living\n              history, it is our practise to keep the image\n              of Truman on screen at all times.\n                      (turning to Christof)\n              Welcome.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Thank you.\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n              Before we start taking calls, the huge surge in\n              ratings over the last few days, how do you hope\n              to sustain that audience now that Truman appears\n              to have reconciled himself, returned to \"normal\"?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Ratings have never been our primary goal.  I\n              imagine we'll lose those voycurs only interested\n              in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However\n              I'm certain our core audience will remain loyal.\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n              But recent events have been so dramatic, it does\n              raise the perennial question.  What keeps us\n              watching one man twenty-four hours a day -\n              eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in\n              contemplation?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              It has to be the reality.\n\n     During this segment, we cut to a cross-section of VIEWERS -\n     the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the two OLD WOMEN on their sofa, the\n     BARMAN and the WAITRESS - listening to Christof's theories on\n     their viewing habits.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              We've become increasingly frustrated watching\n              actors give us phony emotions, bored with\n              pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the\n              world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's\n              nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts.\n              no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but\n              it's genuine.  That's how he can support an\n              entire channel.\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n              A window onto the human condition?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              I prefer to think of it as a mirror.  Not only\n              does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he\n              gives us a glimpse of ourselves.\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n              But how do you account for the popularity of\n              those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              We find many viewers leave him on all night\n              for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your\n              child or your lover sleep?\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n              Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.\n\n     The Interviewer presses a blinking illuminated button on his\n     desk's high-tech phone terminal.\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n                      (into speaker phone)\n              Charlotte, North Carolina, for Christof.\n\n                           MALE CALLER 1 (O.C.)\n              Hello?\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n              You're on, caller.

The way he looked\n              directly at us, spoke to us for the first time.\n              Do you think he'll ever work it out?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              I don't believe so.  Not now.  He tested his\n              world, as we all do at certain times, and\n              eventually it passed the test.  You have to\n              understand, he is a man made-for-TV, the world\n              he occupies his only frame of reference.\n              No, for him to come even this close to the\n              truth is a remarkable testament to his\n              instincts.\n\n     The Interviewer presses another line on his terminal.\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n              Sacramento, California, you're on \"Tru Talk\".\n\n                           MALE CALLER 2 (O.C.)\n              How much of a strain has the last few days\n              placed on the actors?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Working on \"Truman\" has always been a huge\n              commitment for an actor, not just in terms\n              of separation from friends and family, but\n              since Truman essentially drives the plot,\n              it's a never-ending improvisation.  Recent\n              events have raised the pressure but also the\n              prestige.\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n                      (cutting off the call)\n              Of course Truman has always been very much in on\n              casting.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              As with our own lives, the only people he can't\n              cast are his family.

I think\n              what really distresses you, caller, is that\n              ultimately he prefers the comfort of his \"cell\"--\n\n                           FEMALE CALLER 1\n                      (as if trying to convince herself.\n                      giving herself away)\n              --No, you're wrong!  He'll prove you wrong!\n              He can still do it!\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (a thought occurring, looking\n                      directly into camera)\n              Do I know you, caller?  Your voice sounds familiar.\n\n\n     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     SYLVIA, finger on the button of the phone where she has cut off\n     the call, stares at CHRISTOF on her television screen.\n\n     It is she who is the Female Caller.  Christof seems to stare\n     back at her as the talk show continues.\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n                      (from television)\n              Recording a human life from birth to death,\n              that's still the intention?  You still believe\n              Truman has more to contribute?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (still reflecting on the last call)\n              More than ever.  By unwittingly allowing us to\n              witness his struggles, he's constantly forcing\n              us to evaluate our own lives.  He gives us hope.\n\n                           INTERVIEWER\n              Let's take another call.\n                      (pressing a line)\n              London, England you're on \"Tru Talk\".\n\n                           FEMALE CALLER 2\n              By definition Truman has to be free of censorship,\n              but has the recent violence and profanity\n              caused a problem for the sponsors...?\n\n     Sylvia shuts out the conversation on the television, focusing on\n     the window that displays TRUMAN, still buried in his book.\n\n     She comes close to the screen, catching his melancholy.  She\n     has a camera and a white envelope in her hand.  With a look of\n     resolve, she takes her fountain pen and writes Truman's name\n     on the envelope in her familiar blue ink.\n\n\n     INT.  MASTER TAPE ROOM.  NIGHT.\n\n     Row upon row of digital video cassettes occupy one entire,\n     cavernous room - \"Truman\" and a date on the spine of each\n     cassette.  Suspended from the ceiling, a monitor shows a live\n     picture of TRUMAN sleeping on the sofa.\n\n     Sitting in front of a playback monitor, CHLOE is transfixed by\n     Truman thirty-four years earlier, a FETUS in his mother's womb.\n\n                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)\n              What are you looking for?\n\n     Chloe tries to conceal her startlement at CHRISTOF's unexpected\n     entrance.\n\n                           CHLOE\n                      (not taking her eyes from screen)\n              He was premature, wasn't he?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Only by two weeks.\n\n                           CHLOE\n              Curious even then?  Like he couldn't\n              wait to get started?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (feeling out where the\n                      conversation is headed)\n              His eagerness to leave his mother's womb\n              also meant he was the one selected.\n\n                           CHLOE\n              What was it like, the first show?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              The ultimate live television.  In competition\n              with five other unwanted pregnancies - the\n              casting of a show determined by an air date\n              - he was the one who arrived on cue.\n\n                           CHLOE\n              Is it true what you said...on the show tonight?\n              About letting him go if he wanted it badly\n              enough.  Would you really do that?\n\n     Christof stares at his assistant, weighing her loyalty.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              It won't come to that.\n\n\n     INT.  OFFICE.  DAY.\n\n     The suitably crestfallen TRUMAN stands in front of his boss,\n     ERROL, sitting behind his ostentaciously large desk.  LAWRENCE\n     lounges on the guest sofa, enjoying Truman's dressing-down.\n\n\n     INT.  BANK.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN approaches the bank window.  The teller is the YOUNG\n     WOMAN whose child Truman attacked in the street.  She takes a\n     step back at the sight of Truman, apprehensive, the\n     confrontation fresh in her memory.\n\n     Truman glances at the names on the checks in the young woman's\n     hand, realizing how she was able to identify him in the street.\n     He begins to apologize profusely.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S GARAGE.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN enters the garage, carrying Sylvia's sweater.  He\n     breathes in the scent one last time and reluctantly replaces it\n     in the trunk.  With a sense of finality, he lowers the lid and\n     fastens the lock.\n\n\n     EXT.  TRUMAN'S BACKYARD.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN emerges from the garage, wheeling his lawnmower,\n     deliberately averting his eyes from the back of the house.\n\n     Staring out of the kitchen window, a tall glass of iced tea in\n     her hand, MERYL has been anticipating her husband's appearance.\n     She wears a neckbrace, we sense more as a reminder to Truman\n     than for any benefit she might derive.\n\n     Feeling Meryl's eyes burning into his back, Truman fires up the\n     mower and heads directly towards the symbolically uncut section\n     of grass.  We focus on the errant blades of grass as they are\n     severed by the mower.  The lawn is now uniformly trimmed.\n\n     From a mechanical platform above the Expressway, CHRISTOF and\n     CHLOE watch Truman's final act of defiance laid to rest.\n\n\n     INT.  OFFICE BUILDING, LOWER MANHATTAN.  MORNING.\n\n     In an office building high above Manhattan's financial district,\n     a ROBOTIC MANNEOUIN in a 3-piece suit stands at an upper-story\n     window mechanically lifting a coffee cup to its mouth.\n\n\n     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING.\n\n     In the street below, something is different about the rush-hour\n     traffic.  The PEDESTRIANS are all standing around, no one\n     walking.  Some are chatting with each other, others primping.\n     The cars, vans and taxis are also idling.\n\n     Camera locations are being checked.  A miniature camera\n     inserted into the head of a streetlamp, a CAMERA TECHNICIAN\n     waves his hand in front of an innocent-looking fire hydrant, the\n     eye of a MDDEL on a bus shelter's cosmetic ad is wiped clean,\n     the head of a parking meter is replaced, a buttonhole camera is\n     placed on a BUSINESSMAN's double-breasted jacket by a TECHNICIAN\n     - we see from the button's POV, a CONTACT LENS CAMERA is\n     carefully inserted into the eye of Truman's colleague, LAWRENCE,\n     another TECHNICIAN we observe from the contact's POV.\n\n     Finally a surveillance camera on the outside of a bank building\n     and a TOURIST'S camcorder are positioned.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     CHRISTOF is seated at the control desk, directing the morning\n     session, SIMEON assisting, CHLOE at his shoulder, a buzz of\n     excitement in the room.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              I hope we've got fresh extras.\n\n                           CHLOE\n                      (consulting a clipboard)\n              The rotation was made this morning.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (staring at a monitor, irritated)\n              I don't like the couple with the baby.\n              They'd never be together.\n\n     The COUPLE with the stroller are promptly moved further along\n     the street.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Who's doing wardrobe?  I keep seeing the\n              same wardrobe...\n\n\n     INT.  SUBWAY STATION.  MORNING.\n\n     TRUMAN spills out of the subway car with hundreds of other\n     COMMUTERS.  We hear Christof's off-camera voice, as always\n     unheard by Truman.\n\n                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)\n              ...everybody back to One...\n\n     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN STREET.  MORNING\n\n                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)\n              ...and, action background...\n\n     At the command, the PEDESTRIANS and VEHICLES begin inoving\n     normally, TRUMAN exits the subway, suspecting nothing.  He\n     begins his trek to work, accompanied by the cued rush hour\n     traffic.\n\n                           CHRISTOF (O.C.)\n              ...nice...nice...I like the woman with the dog...\n              let's keep it moving...I want that traffic kept\n              together...everybody look like you've got places\n              to go...\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     CHRISTOF covers his microphone to deliver an aside to SIMEON,\n     from whom he has temporarily assumed the role of director.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              I bet he doesn't stop at the newstand.\n\n     As predicted, Truman walks by, barely glancing at a newspaper's\n     banner headline, \"NUCLEAR POWER PLANT REOPENED\".  Christof scans\n     the shot options available to him on the video wall.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              ...Bodycam Two...\n\n     The large On-Air Monitor cuts to Truman, via the point-of-view\n     of an approaching PEDESTRIAN.  For an instant, the unaware\n     Truman looks directly into the lens of the disguised camera.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              ...streetlight eight...\n\n     The monitor cuts to an overhead shot from a streetlamp.  The\n     camera continues to follow Truman's progress.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              ...ready, Car-Cam One.  Go to One...\n\n     TRUMAN enters his office building as a taxi cruises by.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              ...and cut to interior...\n\n     Truman is immediately picked up by a hidden camera inside\n     the building where he exchanges a half-hearted greeting with an\n     ancient SECURITY GUARD.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              ...looser...\n\n     The camera widens the angle.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              ...and action, Vivien...\n                      (aside, proud of his casting)\n              Looks just like Truman's mother at that age.\n\n     VIVIEN, an insurance adjuster approaches the elevator button at\n     the same time as Truman.  However she reaches for it after\n     Truman has already turned his back.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (incensed)\n              Damn, she missed her mark!\n                      (impatiently to Simeon)\n              Why do we bother with walk-throughs if\n              nobody pays attention?  Give me a two-shot\n              of Truman and Vivien...go to the master\n              ...hold the elevators...\n                      (mustering patience, into microphone)\n              Vivien, press the elevator button again\n              ...and make sure you catch his eye this time...\n\n\n     INT.  INSURANCE OFFICE LOBBY.  DAY.\n\n     A second time, TRUMAN's brief encounter with VIVIEN goes like\n     clockwork.  As instructed, she hammers away at the elevator\n     button and throws a conspiratorial look to Truman.  The elevator\n     car duly arrives and Truman's eyes follow Vivien's rear as she\n     sachets into the lift.  For a moment he appears to glance at a\n     piece of gaffer tape on the marble floor.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Good!  Perfect!  Cut to the interior...\n\n     The monitor cuts to the inside of the elevator, rapidly\n     filling with co-workers.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              ...and Lawrence...\n\n     Just as the doors are about to close, LAWRENCE oozes in.  He\n     gives Truman a smug smile.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              ...nice look, Lawrence...and, Vivien...\n\n     The elevator doors open and Vivien exits with two co-workers.\n\n                           LAWRENCE\n                      (admiring aside to the remaining\n                      fellow-males in the elevator)\n              I wouldn't kick her out of bed.\n\n     Truman doesn't seem to share Lawrence's enthusiasm for the\n     comely young woman.  He is miles away.\n\n\n     INT.  STUDIO - CONFERENCE ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     Assembled around a long oval table for a story confernce are\n     several principal characters in Truman's life - MERYL, MARLON,\n     ERROL, TYRONE, RAQUEL, VERONICA and the new actress, VIVIEN,\n     sitting slightly apart from the rest of the cast.\n\n     CHRISTOF takes his place at the head of the table, a large\n     monitor showing TRUMAN drinking coffee in his cubicle at\n     American Life plays silently behind Christof's head.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (to the meeting, referring to\n                      Meryl by her real name)\n              Regrettably, I have to inform you that\n              Hannah has chosen not to renew her contract.\n\n     All eyes turn to Meryl.  She looks at the floor.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              I'm sure we can all respect her reasons.\n\n     Meryl receives a sympathetic squeeze of the hand from her co-\n     star Marlon, now out of wardrobe, wearing an Armani suit.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Her separation from Truman will be\n              orchestrated over the summer.\n                      (more up-beat)\n              However, I'm pleased to announce that\n              television's first on-air conception will\n              still take place.  You witnessed the initial\n              contact this morning.\n                      (glancing to Vivien, once\n                      again using her real name)\n              You all know Claudia from her work in theatre.\n              Thankfully, Truman doesn't.\n\n     The rest of the cast nod politely in Vivien's direction.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (referring to the bound documents\n                      CHLOE passes to each cast member)\n              This is a copy of Claudia's back story.\n              Her character's name will be Vivien.\n              She's the new adjuster at the office.\n\n     The cast idly flip through the documents, prominently stamped on\n     the cover, \"NOT TO BE TAKEN ON SET\".\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              We intend to entice Truman into the\n              affair as soon as possible.  Claudia will\n              make her advance at the seminar Truman's\n              attending next week.  Details are in your\n              schedules.  I'm sure you'll all make Claudia\n              welcome.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (injecting a note of levity, more\n                      sophisticated than the character he plays)\n              Question is, will Truman make her welcome?\n\n     The cast snickers.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (immediately back to business)\n              I don't have to tell you, how critical\n              the next few weeks will be.  This takes us\n              into the next generation.  When Truman's\n              child is born, the network will be switching\n              to a two-channel format to chronicle both lives.\n\n                           VIVIEN\n              What happens when Truman and the baby are\n              both on camera together?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              There will simply be duplicate coverage.\n\n                           VIVIEN\n                      (mischievous)\n              Let's just hope we don't have twins.\n\n                           CHLOE\n                      (uncharacteristically flippant)\n              When Truman dies do we go back to the\n              single channel?\n\n     The cast turn in her direction.  Christof has a second occasion\n     to question his Assistant's loyalty.\n\n\n     INT.  A BAR SOMEWHERE.  DAY.\n\n     The BARMAN, WAITRESS and PATRON we have seen before, observe\n     TRUMAN on the television above the bar.  The cameras track\n     Truman's progress, walking along Broadway.  As he ducks into a\n     sex shop, the threesome at the bar exchange looks.  Inside the\n     store, Truman appears apprehensive.\n\n                           BARMAN\n              What's he doing in there?\n\n                           PATRON\n              Meryl's at her mom's.  Maybe he's got an urge.\n\n     On screen, Truman looks through some X-Rated video titles.\n\n                           WAITRESS\n                      (referring to Truman's overcoat)\n              What's with the coat?\n\n                           BARMAN\n                      (smirking at the irony)\n              Maybe he doesn't wanna be recognized.\n\n     Truman bumps into a display of sex paraphenalia, knocking an\n     item to the floor.\n\n                           PATRON\n                      (remarking on Truman's clumsiness)\n              Nervous.\n\n     Truman tries to right the display and hurriedly exits the store,\n     the cameras following his journey as always.\n\n                           BARMAN\n                      (exasperated)\n              Oh God, he never bought nothing.\n\n                           WOMAN\n              Give him a break.  It's taken him thirty-\n              four years to get the nerve to go in there.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN.  NIGHT\n\n     We focus on a list left by Meryl on the refrigerator, several\n     pages long.  The kitchen itself is a bombsite.  More than the\n     cliche dishes in the sink - dozens of cardboard boxes stacked\n     haphazardly on the floor.\n\n\n     INT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.\n\n     The usually orderly bedroom is also a mess.  Blankets piled in a\n     heap.  Several large, half-filled cardboard boxes cluttering the\n     room.  A chair in an odd position near the bed.  Clothes strewn\n     everywhere.  Hardly an inch of floor space remains uncovered.\n\n     TRUMAN is asleep in bed, the damaged waterbed replaced with a\n     standard mattress.  Although he is completely covered from head\n     to toe in bedding, the outline of his body is still clearly\n     visible.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.\n\n     Close up on the On-Air monitor in the temple of a control\n     room.  It displays a wide shot of Truman's darkened bedroom\n     filmed through the green hue of the night vision cameras.\n     Assistant Producer, SIMEON, and his VIDEO OPERATORS slouch in\n     their swivel chairs paying scant attention to the screen.\n     Simeon gives his instructions in a lethargic, metronomic manner.\n\n                           SIMEON\n              ...Ready two.  Go to two.\n\n     Operator, eating a doughnut, presses one of the illuminated\n     buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes to a close\n     shot of Truman's covered head.  The camera stays on the\n     blanketed head for a long moment.\n\n                           SIMEON\n              And back to the medium.\n\n     Another button is pressed and the angle changes.  A trace of\n     frustration is evident in the control room.  Recording a\n     sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to\n     contend with Truman's recently aquired camera-shyness.\n\n                           SIMEON\n              ...and wide...\n\n                           OPERATOR\n                      (aside to Simeon)\n              Could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried?\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (shrugs)\n              That loser pays our salary.\n\n                           OPERATOR\n              He's given up on himself again.\n\n                           SIMEON\n              Who cares?  Makes life easier for us.\n              He is what he is.\n\n     At the far end of the great room, one of the large double\n     doors opens and CHRISTOF enters, as always accompanied by CHLOE,\n     carrying a leather-bound folder.  Simeon and the Operators\n     subtely straighten in their chairs.  Christof pretends not to\n     notice.  He is staring intently at the On-Air monitor.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              When did he start sleeping like that?\n\n                           SIMEON\n              About the time Meryl left.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Is that the best shot we can get?\n\n                           SIMEON\n              What's to see?\n\n     Christof watches Truman, a trace of concern in his eyes.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (referring to the debris in Truman's bedroom)\n              What happened to the room?\n\n                           SIMEON\n              He started to reorganize.  I was going to\n              call you.  But half-way through, he gave\n              up and fell asleep.\n\n     Apparently satisfied, Christof turns to an operator.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              I want to check the set-ups for tomorrow's\n              insurance convention.\n\n     Reading off the notes in Chloe's folder, the operator punches\n     up a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors.  They\n     show a generic-looking Marriott Hotel, devoid of actors.  A\n     banner in reception reads, \"WELCOME AMERICAN LIFE & ACCIDENT\".\n     The Operator looks to Christof for approval and realizes his\n     producer's attention has wandered.  Christof is staring at the\n     sleeping figure of Truman on the On-Air monitor.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Give me a shot from his wedding band.\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (pointing out the ring on Truman's\n                      bedside table)\n              He took it off.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (a trace of concern)\n              Why is he so still?  He's too still.\n\n     Christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it to\n     his ear.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Isolate the audio in the cans and amplify.\n\n     An operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel.  Christof and\n     his colleagues listen to Truman's steady breathing in their\n     headphones.  Simeon and the Operators nod, reassured that\n     nothing is amiss.  Christof is not so easily convinced.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Give me a preview.  An ECU on his torso.\n\n     A camera hidden in the room's bedside lamp zooms in to Truman's\n     prone outline...while the breathing remains steady, the body\n     does not rise and fall.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (anxious, barking a command to Chloe)\n              Phone him.\n\n     Chloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials.\n\n                           CHRI STOF\n                      (anticipating Chloe's question)\n              Wrong number.\n\n     The phone on the bedside table, inches from Truman's head,\n     begins to ring.  Truman doesn't flinch.\n\n\n     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     SYLVIA walks up from the seashore where she has been taking a\n     late night swim.  Hearing the telephone ringing; she rushes\n     to pick it up.  However, after lifting the receiver, the phone\n     continues to ring.\n\n     The sound is coming from her television, left on in the bureau.\n     On the screen, TRUMAN sleeps, seemingly undisturbed by the call.\n     Sylvia, drying herself, watches with fascination.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.\n\n     CHRISTOF and the CREW are now highly agitated.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (a trace of panic)\n              He didn't drink tonight?  No pills?\n\n     Every question receives a shake of the Assistant's head in\n     reply.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Hang up!\n\n     Chloe promptly cuts the connection and Truman's phone\n     ceases to ring.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Get Marlon over there.\n\n                           CHLOE\n              Under what pretext?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (letting his anxiety show)\n              Any fucking pretext!\n\n     Christof turns his back on the monitors, his mind racing.\n\n\n     EXT.  TRUMAN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     MARLON's car squeals to a halt outside Truman's house.\n     Hurriedly dressed in jeans and coat over a bare chest, he\n     dashes barefoot to the front door.  He tries the doorhandle,\n     pounds on the door and rings the doorbell simultaneously,\n     shouting Truman's name all the while.\n\n                           MARLON\n              Tru!..Tru!..\n\n     Frustrated, Marlon runs to the bedroom and thumps on the\n     window. He can see the shape of Truman lying on the bed but\n     his shouts fail to rouse him.  Marlon picks up one of Meryl's\n     carefully nurtured flower pots from beneath the bedroom window.\n\n                           MARLON\n                      (shouting a warning)\n              I'm comin' in, Tru!\n\n     Marlon hurls the flower pot through the window sending a shower\n     of glass over Truman's bed.  Still he doesn't move.  Marlon\n     reaches his hand through the shards of glass clinging to the\n     window frame and unlatches the window.\n\n\n     NT. TRUMAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM.  NIGHT.\n\n     MARLON clanbers headfirst through the opened window and lands\n     in an awkward heap on the floor beside TRUMAN's bed.\n\n     He pushes away the clutter in the bedroom and finally\n     stands at his co-star's bedside.  There is a hissing sound.\n     Marlon gingerly lifts the bedcover.  Beneath the bedding is a\n     life-size inflatable female doll.\n\n     The doll has been punctured by the glass and is slowly\n     deflating.  Lying beside the doll's chest is Truman's portable\n     tape recorder.  Marlon picks up the recorder and places it next\n     to his ear.  The cassette plays the sound of Truman breathing.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  NIGHT.\n\n     CHRISTOF, wide-eyed, stares at the image on the On-Air monitor\n     of MARLON and his bizarre companion.  Marlon is frozen, staring\n     into camera.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (quiet but firm)\n              Cut transmission.\n\n     Simeon hesitates, unsure if has heard correctly.  He looks to\n     Christof for confirmation, his finger poised over an\n     \"EMERGENCY\" button.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (enraged)\n              I said, \"Cut\"!\n\n     Christof lunges forward and presses the button himself.\n\n\n     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     SYLVIA watches agog as the scene in Truman's bedroom on\n     her television screen is replaced by the \"TRUMAN\" logo and the\n     message, \"TECHNICAL FAULT.  PLEASE STAND BY.\"\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM NIGHT.\n\n     CHRISTOF has taken his place at the control panel.  On the bank\n     of monitors in front of the mixing desk, the OPERATORS\n     systematically search through the numerous set-ups in Truman's\n     home and neighborhood.  Occasionally MARLON or an EXTRA appear\n     in frame as they fan out and begin a man-hunt.\n\n     While the on-Air monitor continues to play its test-card,\n     Christof and Simeon concentrate on another isolated monitor\n     playing in fast-rewind, time code in the bottom right corner.\n     It is a recording of the night's transmission.  Simeon stops on\n     the last on-camera appearance by TRUMAN.\n\n     They watch Truman, on-screen, switch off his bedroom light and\n     climb into bed fully clothed, immediately pulling the covers\n     over his head.  As the light is switched off, the recording\n     camera automatically switches to night vision.  Simeon continues\n     to play at normal speed, now and then scrolling forward in fast-\n     forward mode.  Christof suddenly points to the screen.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              There.  Freeze...Zoom into the chair...\n\n     Simeon types the appropriate command.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Enhance.\n\n     On the blown-up screen, between a cardboard box and a chair leg,\n     it is barely possible to make out Truman's hand as he crawls\n     commando-style from his bedroom, his inflatable replacement\n     already positioned in the bed.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (referring to the debris)\n              He wasn't making a mess.  He was engineering\n              a blind spot.\n\n                           CHLOE\n              How does he know where the cameras are?\n\n                           CHRI STOF\n              I don't know.\n                      (noting the time-code on the monitor,\n                      staring into the back of Simeon's head)\n              All I know is we've been filming a blow-up\n              doll for the last three hours.\n\n     Simeon feels the hostility.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     The systematic search of the monitors continues.  They now\n     reveal that dawn has broken on the set.\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (hanging up the phone)\n              We've declared a curfew.  Only the extras\n              required for the search are on the set.\n              Everyone else is at first positions.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              All prop cars accounted for?\n\n                           SIMEON\n              He has to be on foot.  He has the world's\n              most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.\n\n     All heads turn to CHLOE as she enters the grand control room\n     with a status report.\n\n                           CHLOE\n              The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug\n              if we don't make a statement within the next\n              hour.  The media is in a feeding frenzy.  The phone\n              lines are jammed.  Every network has a pirated shot\n              of Harlon and the dummy.\n\n\n     EXT.  VACANT LOT.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN rolls in the dirt of a construction site, tearing at his\n     clothes and caking his face and hair with black inud.\n\n     He struggles up a slope onto an adjacent roadway where a\n     shopping cart awaits, loaded with soiled plastic bags.\n     Looking every inch a derelict, Truman begins to wheel his\n     shopping cart through the empty streets of Brooklyn.\n\n\n     EXT.  BROOKLYN BRIDGE.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN wheels his shopping cart over a deserted Brooklyn Bridge.\n     Over his shoulder, in the far distance, we see a lone car\n     approaching.  As it nears, we recognize a police car.\n\n     Truman takes a look under the bridge, as if participating in\n     the search.  The car slowly draws alongside, the POLICE OFFICER\n     looking straight into Truman's blackened face.\n\n                           POLICE OFFICER\n              Any sign of him?\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (deliberately gravelling his voice)\n              Not yet.\n\n     The Police Officer takes a second look at Truman.  After what\n     seems like an eternity, he motions his PARTNER to drive on.\n\n                           POLICE OFFICER\n                      (to Truman, as the car pulls away)\n              Take it easy.\n\n\n     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN.  DAY.\n\n     We pan down one concrete canyon after another.  The usually\n     bustling financial district is totally, eerily deserted.\n\n     Suddenly we see a line of PEOPLE fanned out across a street.\n     Then another and another.\n\n     PEOPLE of every description, shoulder to shoulder, marching\n     down the otherwise empty streets the way a search is conducted\n     at a crime scene.  The lines include PRINCIPALS and EXTRAS\n     linked arm in arm, wardrobed for their usual roles as EXECUTIVES\n     and SECRETARIES, STORE CLERKS, TELEPHONISTS, MAINTENANCE and\n     CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, WAITERS and WAITRESSES, COOKS, SHOPPERS,\n     HEALTH WORKERS, SECURITY GUARDS, POSTAL WORKERS, POLICE\n     OFFICERS, FIRE FIGHTERS AND HOMELESS PEOPLE.  On one occasion we\n     glimpse Truman's colleagues, LAWRENCE, ERROL and VIVIEN, amongst\n     the searchers.\n\n     A building-to-building, floor-to-floor, office-to-office search\n     is also being conducted, each structure secured as they go, the\n     searchers paying special attention to potential blind spots such\n     as closets, dumpsters, man holes, sewers, car trunks, trees and\n     shrubbery.\n\n     We focus on one of the waves of searchers.  TRUMAN has linked\n     arms in the middle of a row, his disguise still holding up.\n\n     A swarm of helicopters fills the sky.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     While his COLLEAGUES monitor the bank of screens, CHRISTOF has\n     been joined by the two ever-anxious studio executives, MOSES and\n     ROMAN.\n\n                           MOSES\n                      (to Christof who is still studying\n                      the faces in a row of SEARCHERS)\n              Rumors are circulating he's dead.\n\n                           ROMAN\n                      (pacing nervously)\n              The sponsors are threatening to rip up their contracts.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (unconcerned, referring to the static\n                      \"STAND BY\" graphic, now accompanied by\n                      soothing classical music)\n              Why?

ELECTRONICS STORE.  DAY.\n\n     A crowd of PASSERS-BY hover around a display of televisions\n     in the window of an electronics store, awaiting developments.\n\n\n     INT.  LIVING ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     The two OLD WOMEN we have seen before stare intently at the\n     graphic on their televisions.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     The fan of EXTRAS reaches the harbor and automatically turns to\n     make another sweep.\n\n                           CHLOE\n                      (referring to the empty streets)\n              When we flush him out how do we explain this?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (deadpan)\n              We tell him the truth.\n\n     Chloe looks askance at Christof.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (joking darkly)\n              We're making a movie.\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (hopeful)\n              We'll get him on this next sweep.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              What have we missed?\n\n                           SIMEON\n              It's just a matter of time.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              No.  We've missed something.\n\n     Christof turns his back on the screens.  Over his shoulder,\n     we see a monitor displaying a view of the harbor.\n\n\n     EXT.  LOWER MANHATTAN - PIER 13.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN has broken away from the line of searchers, on the\n     pretext of taking a leak.  He is standing on the edge of\n     Pier 13, facing the harbor, his back turned to those beginning\n     their next sweep.  Suddenly Truman ducks behind one of the green\n     and white inflatable canopies that enclose the Wall Street\n     Racquet Club.\n\n     We see a close up of Truman's terrified eyes in his blackened\n     face, staring down at the lapping water.  It triggers a montage\n     of flashbacks.  As usual the images all appear to play on a\n     television screen.\n\n     TRUMAN on the CLIFF FACE at seven years old, his second grade\n     teacher SISTER OLIVIA, a close-up of DROWNING STATISTICS at\n     his insurance company, mesmerized by the water in the FERRY\n     TERMINAL, seventeen-year old SYLVIA jumping in the fountain, his\n     WATERBED rocking, and seven-year old Truman sitting on the\n     UPTURNED BOAT in Long Island Sound crying into the darkness.\n\n\n     EXT.  PIER 13.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN comes back to reality.  He steels himself, shuts out the\n     doubts and dives into the water.\n\n\n     EXT.  NEW YORK HARBOR.  DAY.\n\n     Underwater we see TRUMAN panicking at the shock of the cold\n     sea, arms and legs flailing.  Suddenly he stops and sinks for a\n     moment in the weight of his clothes.  Then slowly he rises to\n     the surface and begins to swim.\n\n     Moored in the harbor is the scaled-down replica of Columbus'\n     flagship, The Santa Maria.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     CHRISTOF is spooling through significant scenes in the history\n     of \"TRUMAN\" on a preview monitor.\n\n     He pauses on the scene of SYLVIA and TRUMAN at the fountain\n     in Flushing Meadow Park in the show's seventeenth season.\n     Sylvia has her finger to Truman's lips.  Christof presses\n     \"PLAY\" on the mixing desk.\n\n                           SYLVIA\n                      (from monitor)\n              You remember when you were a little boy...\n\n     Christof fast forwards, then presses PLAY once again.\n\n                           SYLVIA\n              ...Trust that boy...\n\n     Christof jabs the \"PAUSE\" button, freezing the picture.  He\n     recites the words to himself.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Trust that boy...\n                      (to Simeon)\n              We're not watching the sea.\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (confused)\n              Why would we?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Sweep the harbor.\n\n\n     EXT.  NEW YOUR HARBOR.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN is at the wheel of the Santa Maria, wind filling her\n     sails.  Covering the face of the ship's compass is Sylvia's\n     composite picture.\n\n     His is the only craft afloat in New York Harbor.  As the archaic\n     vessel passes under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridget, the bridge\n     appears on fire in the glow of the sunlight.  Truman steers\n     around Norton Point and sets a course for the open sea - the\n     horizon.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     CHRISTOF and his colleagues concentrate on a live aerial shot on\n     a preview monitor, skimming over the calm, featureless sea.\n     Suddenly in the distance there appears a single sail etched\n     against the horizon.\n\n                           SIMEON\n              That's him!\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Resume transmission.\n\n     Simeon punches a button and the image of the sailing ship is\n     instantly transferred to the large On-Air monitor.\n\n\n     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     SYLVIA, dozing on the sofa, suddenly blinks open her eyes as the\n     classical music on the television is abruptly replaced by the\n     sound of a helicopte's rotor blade.\n\n     Sylvia focuses on the screen, her breath taken away by the sight\n     of TRUMAN at the wheel of the Santa Maria.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (staring intently at the On-Air monitor)\n              What do we have on that boat?\n\n     Simeon scans a computer shot list.  He types in a code.  A\n     camera from the main mast of Truman's ship activates.  Truman,\n     unaware of the camera, is concentrating on steering the vessel.\n\n\n     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN is out of sight of land, the sea choppier now, rising\n     and falling beneath his boat.  He nears a large buoy bobbing\n     clumsily in the strong swell.  An official-looking sign is\n     attached - \"DANGER.  NAVAL EXERCISES.  DO NOT ENTER.\"  We see an\n     extreme close up of the nautical signpost where a disguised\n     miniature camera tracks Truman's progress.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     CHRISTOF and the other PRODUCTION STAFF watch TRUMAN from the\n     buoy's POV as he sails by.\n\n\n     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN hears a helicopter overhead.  By now the ocean spray has\n     washed most of the dirt from his face, only a residue remains.\n     The rags he wears, including Sylvia's sweater under his open\n     coat, are soaked.  Her picture clings stubbornly to the compass.\n\n     As he steers, he occasionally refers to a \"HOW TO SAIL\" book\n     from his coat pocket.  He tacks against the wind, as he watches\n     the military chopper circle his boat.\n\n                           CHOPPER PILOT\n                      (over P.A.)\n              Alter course immediately.  You are\n              entering a restricted area.\n\n     Truman screams defiantly back to the chopper.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Fuck you!\n\n\n     EXT.  A STREET SOMEWHERE.  DAY.\n\n     Two YOUNG MEN on a street corner watch, transfixed, the image\n     of TRUMAN steering the Santa Maria on a portable Watchman TV.\n\n                           YOUNG MAN 1\n              I knew he wasn't dead.\n\n\n     INT.  HELICOPTER.  DAY.\n\n\n     The HELICOPTER PILOT continues to circle.\n\n                           PILOT (over P.A.)\n              Alter course or we fire on your vessel.\n\n     TRUMAN screams again at the chopper and gestures wildly at the\n     pilot.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n              Get the hell away!  It's my life!\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (into microphone to pilot, eerily composed)\n              Fire a warning.\n\n\n     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.\n\n     A round of machine gun fire strafes the water across the bows\n     of Truman's boat, several rounds striking the deck.  TRUMAN\n     flinches.  In his eyes we see the ghosts return.  With great\n     effort he shakes the doubts from his head and retrieves a flare\n     gun from the storage cabinet in the boat's wheel house.\n\n                           CHOPPER PILOT (over P.A.)\n              Alter course.  Drop your sails.\n\n     Truman takes aim at the chopper and fires the flare gun.  The\n     distress flare hurtles towards the hovering helicopter, narrowly\n     missing.  Truman ejects the spent cartridge and reloads.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (shocked at the near miss)\n              Jesus!  God!  Is he out of his mind?\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (composed, into microphone to pilot)\n              Pull back.\n\n\n     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.\n\n     Before the chopper can take evasive action TRUMAN takes aim a\n     second time and fires.  The distress flare fishtails into the\n     sky and to Truman's surprise and delight, finds its mark,\n     striking the rear rotor blade.  Truman lets out a whoop.\n\n     The helicopter immediately begins to spiral downwards towards\n     the sea.  The CHOPPER PILOTS bail out of the cockpit, splashing\n     down safely into the coean while the helicopter enters the waves\n     in a spectacular belly flop, sinking out of view in seconds like\n     a stone.  Watching the pilots bobbing around in the ocean in\n     their inflatable life jackets, thoughts of duty invade Truman's\n     head.  He shuts out the thoughts and turns his back, steering\n     away from the drifting pilots.  A look of resolve in his eyes we\n     have never witnessed before.\n\n\n     INT.  SYLVIA'S BEACH HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     SYLVIA kneels on the floor in front of the television.  As\n     Christof's cameras dwell on her likeness - the composite picture\n     still covering the ship's compass - she allows herself a brief\n     moment of satisfaction but she does not dare to hope too much.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     CHRISTOF, CHLOE, SIMEON, and the OTHERS have been joined in the\n     control room by MARLON, MERYL, KIRK and AUDREY.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              How long will another chopper take?\n\n                           SIMEON\n              By the time we pick up the pilots, too long.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              We have to stop him for his own good.\n              Turn him back with the elements.\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (hesitant)\n              There's no rescue boat in the area.  He\n              won't know what to do.\n\n                           MOSES\n                      (trying to appeal to Christof's\n                      sense of reason)\n              For God's sake, Chris.  The whole world\n              is watching.  We can't kill him in front\n              of a live audience.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              He was born in front of a live audience.\n                      (never taking his eyes from\n                      the screen, reassuring)\n              Don't worry, he's not willing to risk his life\n              for the truth.  His doubts will turn him back.\n\n     Simeon reluctantly turns to a panel of controls on the desk\n     marked \"WAVE\", \"WIND\" and \"RAIN\".  After typing in a command, he\n     winds the controls towards their maximum settings.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Kill the lights.\n\n     Chloe searches Christof's face, trying to find the man in whom\n     she has believed for so long.\n\n\n     EXT.  ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.\n\n     Darkness suddenly descends as storm clouds roll towards Truman's\n     boat at an alarming speed.  High winds buffet the boat.  TRUMAN\n     fights the wheel.  Hurricane force winds shake the masts and\n     keel, ripping the sails to shreds.\n\n     The picture of Sylvia is torn from the compass and lost to the\n     sea.  His \"HOW TO SAIL\" book skids off the deck.\n\n     Truman takes a rope from beneath the wheel house and lashes\n     himself to the wheel to secure himself on board.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (shouting above the storm)\n              I'm coming to find you Sylvia!  I'm making\n              myself deaf!\n                      (screaming up to the sky)\n              You're going to have to kill me!  Come on!\n\n     Monstrous waves continually submerge the deck.  Truman continues\n     to head into the teeth of the gale.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     In contrast to his panic-stricken COLLEAGUES, CHRISTOF gives an\n     outward appearance of calm.  However a bead of sweat appearing\n     at his temple betrays him.\n\n                           SIMEON\n                      (agitated)\n              It's not working.

ATLANTIC OCEAN.  DAY.\n\n     TRUMAN appears to be losing his fight against the storm,\n     each successive breaker taking its toll on his body, sapping\n     his strength, his bindings the only thing holding him upright,\n     his head slumps, the wheel goes loose in his grasp, spinning\n     out of control.  His will, draining away.\n\n     As he is about to be overcome by the next wave, he thrusts his\n     arm into the handles of the spinning wheel.  He cries out in\n     pain at the blow to his forearm but succeeds in halting the\n     wheel.  He braces for one last wave.\n\n     But the wave does not come.  A strange phenomenon is occurring\n     in the ocean.  A distinct division has appeared in the ocean\n     swell.  Between the large rolling waves lies a corridor of\n     calmer water, several hundred yards wide, a curious escape lane.\n\n     The wind and the rain are also subsiding, the darkness lifting.\n     Truman steers his vessel down this \"sea-lane\".\n\n     After some time, several large, dark shapes emerge on the\n     horizon.  Land?  Islands?  As Truman steers towards the nearest\n     shape, he discovers what is behind the peculiar wave formations.\n     It is certainly not the moon.\n\n     The dark shape is a huge iron roller, only half of which is\n     exposed above the surface of the sea.  The ocean swell is being\n     caused by the roller slowly turning, mechanically-driven on\n     either end by massive steel arms pumping from the sea bed.\n     In fact there are rollers spaced four hundred yards apart in\n     both directions along the horizon as far as the eye can see,\n     the calm sea-lanes formed by the gaps between the rollers.\n\n     Truman's boat is dwarfed by the gigantic machines.  The exposed\n     half of each roller, the height of a ten story building, its\n     length equivalent to several football fields.  The massive arms\n     perpetually churn.\n\n     Truman's face is thrown into shadow as the boat slips quietly\n     past the giant rotating drum.  The water beyond the rollers is\n     dead calm.  Truman stares ahead desperately trying to focus his\n     eyes.\n\n     But if the sight of the wave machines was difficult to\n     comprehend, it pales in comparison with the next sight that\n     greets him.  His boat is drifting inexorably, on a slow\n     collision course with the sky.  That infinitely receding horizon\n     line recedes no more.\n\n     The sea really does meet the sky.  The join is only too\n     apparent.  Looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of\n     colossal dimensions.  The sky is nothing but a painted backdrop.\n     Truman looks upward, straining his eyes to see the top of the\n     sky, but it curves away at a steep angle beyond his sight.\n\n     The bow of the boat comes to rest against the sky, bumping\n     gently into its latex surface.  Truman unties his bindings\n     and stumbles across the deck to the side rail.  Clinging to the\n     rail with one hand, he tentatively reaches out towards the\n     painted cyclorama.  He touches the sky.\n\n     He feels the surface, puts both terrified hands against it.\n     Hie eyes well up with tears.  He presses his distraught face\n     into it.  He screams at the top of his voice.  No words.  A\n     primal scream.  A pained, animal howl.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.\n\n     CHRISTOF and his PRODUCTION STAFF take in Truman's reaction\n     in silence.\n\n\n     INT/EXT.  BARROOM/ELECTRONICS STORE/HOME.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN's cry echos around bars, offices, shops, homes and\n     streets - wherever a television is to be found.  No VIEWER\n     speaks.  They are stunned to silence, many teary eyed.\n\n\n     EXT.  CYCLORAMA.  DUSK.\n\n     As the boat drifts alongside the seemingly never-ending curve\n     of the cyclorama, TRUMAN's attention is drawn to an outline in\n     the otherwise flawless backdrop.  He clambers to the prow of the\n     boat.\n\n     There, camoflaged in the painted skyscape just above the water\n     line, is a door.  Truman grabs hold of the recessed doorhandle\n     and halts the drifting boat.  He stands in front of the door and\n     closes his eyes in a silent prayer.\n\n     He opens the door in the sky and steps through.\n\n\n     INT/EXT.  VIEWERS.  DUSK.\n\n     Spontaneous cheers and shouts of joy erupt from VIEWERS in their\n     various locations - bars, homes and offices.  Strangers hug each\n     other and dance in celebration.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.\n\n     Even the cynical VIDEO OPERATOR jumps out of his seat - for the\n     first time in the film - and lets out a joyous whoop, forgetting\n     himself for a moment, caught up in the drama.\n\n                           OPERATOR\n              Yeah!\n\n     Self-conscious, he takes his seat again almost immediately.  His\n     COLLEAGUES are transfixed by the live on-air monitor continuing\n     to play its only available shot, the open door in the sky -\n     Truman out of view.\n\n\n     INT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN finds himself on a small metal landing.  A steel ladder\n     rises above him to the height of \"sky\", the soundstage roof, so\n     high as to be barely visible.  The rungs also continue downward,\n     the depth of the \"ocean-bed\", to a studio floor far below.\n\n     Truman turns and looks back through the door he has just\n     entered.  Unsecured, the Santa Maria is beginning to drift away.\n     The sea he has feared since childhood, is nothing but an\n     enormous tank.  The sky, a massive cyclorama.  New York City, an\n     elaborate set.  And it is all housed within an impossibly large\n     soundstage.\n\n     Truman makes no effort to save the boat.  He shuts the door to\n     his world.  A sign on the back of the door reads, \"CLOSED SET.\n     No Unauthorized Access.\"  Gradually he becomes aware of another\n     strange phenomenon taking place in the soundstage.  All around\n     him, thousands of light fixtures mounted in the cyclorama to\n     masquerade as stars, are slowly illuminating - switched on by an\n     automatic timer.  (The light fixtures match the one that almost\n     struck Truman's car at the beginning of the film.)\n\n     By artificial starlight, Truman begins his long descent of the\n     step ladder.  Below, a studio tram makes its way along the\n     soundstage perimeter, on the last tour of the day.\n\n\n     INT.  STUDIO TRAM.  DUSK.\n\n     As he drives, a well-scrubbed, young TOUR GUIDE delivers his\n     tired commentary into a microphone for the thousandth time to\n     the half-full tram of STUDIO VISITORS.\n\n                           GUIDE\n              ...the soundstage roof houses over eight\n              hundred thousand lights of varying intensities\n              to faithfully recreate the constellations...\n\n     However, the passengers are paying less attention than usual.\n     They stare, perplexed, at the television monitor above the\n     Guide's head, continuing to play the show's only available shot\n     of the open door in the sky.\n\n\n     INT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN suddenly steps in front of the tram.  The TOUR GUIDE\n     stands on the brakes, tram lurching to a stop.  The Guide looks\n     from Truman's haunted face to the monitor, hardly able to\n     believe his eyes.\n\n     Truman leaps on board, pressing his flare gun into the side of\n     the guide's head.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to the shocked passengers)\n              Nobody move!\n                      (to the guide)\n              Drive!\n\n     The terrified Guide pulls jerkily away in the tram, resuming the\n     tour.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to the guide, gesturing to the microphone)\n              Keep talking.  Say whatever you say!\n\n     The Guide hesitantly resumes his commentary into his microphone.\n\n                           GUIDE\n               Er,...the ocean tank contains over six hundred\n               and fifty million gallons of man-made salt\n               water, temperature-controlled...\n\n     Truman's attention drifts to the logo on the side of the tram -\n     \"TRUMAN STUDIO TOUR\".  He is suddenly aware of the tourists\n     gawking at him.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (to TOURIST, camcorder around his neck)\n              Act normal!  Keep filming!\n\n     Truman ducks out of sight as a fleet of STUDIO SECURITY CARS\n     speeds towards the tram.  But they streak past, on their way to\n     the site of Truman's escape.  As he tentatively gets back to his\n     feet, Truman finds a CHILD standing in front of him with an\n     autograph book.\n\n                           CHILD\n              Please, Mister Truman.\n\n     On the child's T-shirt, a large photograph of Truman's face.\n\n\n     INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DUSK.\n\n     CHRISTOF talks anxiously on the phone, unaware of a shift in the\n     balance of power taking place behind his back.  The executives,\n     MOSES and ROMAN are huddling with SIMEON, making him an offer he\n     appears to welcome.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (into the phone)\n              What do you mean he's not there?  We can't\n              have lost him again.\n\n     On the far side of the control room, behind a huge curved\n     glass wall on a mezzanine floor, a studio tour tram passes by.\n\n\n     INT.  STUDIO TRAM.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN crouches behind a seat on the tram, flare gun still\n     trained on the guide's head, taking in the gigantic video wall\n     displaying pictures from every facet of his life.\n\n     His heart sinks as he spies the monitor revealing the private\n     spot where he and SYLVIA met.\n\n                           GUIDE\n              ...on your left, the control room where the\n              angles are selected and the actors receive\n              direction.  Of course, the one place we can't\n              show you is the story department.  There is none.\n                      (hesitant)\n              ...Truman writes the script...\n\n     From Truman's POV we watch CHLOE approach CHRISTOF.  She has a\n     pure white envelope in her hands.  As Christof looks up to\n     acknowledge her, he almost makes eye contact with Truman on the\n     tram.\n\n\n     INT.  STUDIO LOT.  DUSK.\n\n     Still inside the studio complex, the tram enters the courtyard\n     of an indoor shopping mall.  Truman gift shops.\n\n     TRUMAN is momentarily frozen by the sight of window displays\n     full of books and board games carrying his likeness with titles\n     such as, \"TrumanTrivia\".  Video cassettes offering \"Truman\n     Highlights\".  His face emblazoned on T-shirts, caps, coffee mugs\n     and posters.  Even Truman Dolls and a model of his decaying\n     Oldsmobile are offered for sale.\n\n     The tram slows to a stop behind other trams at the tour's end.\n     STUDIO POLICE are checking the disembarking PASSENGERS.  Truman,\n     using the TOUR GUIDE as a shield, also exits the tram.\n\n                           GUIDE\n                      (frightened for his life)\n              Here he is!  It's him!\n\n     Truman contemptuously backhands the Guide across the face and\n     makes a run for it.  The guards give chase.  Truman runs into a\n     lookalike mannequin, dressed in a brown suit identical to his\n     own, promoting \"TrumanWear\".  He pulls his \"double\" to the\n     ground to block the guards' path.\n\n     Sprinting along a featureless corridor, he reaches a dead end.\n\n                           GUARD\n                      (into radio)\n              We've got him trapped.\n\n     Truman enters a doorway marked \"NO ENTRY\" to find a stairway\n     leading upwards.  He takes the stairs three at a time.\n\n     The footsteps and shouts of the guards not far behind.  Flight\n     after flight of stairs.  At one point, he loses his grip on the\n     stair's railing and his gun falls from his hand, clattering for\n     an eternity down the stairwell.\n\n     He finally emerges on a landing.  Lungs bursting.  One more\n     door.  He tries the handle.  It opens.\n\n\n     EXT.  SOUNDSTAGE.  DUSK.\n\n     TRUMAN finds himself on the roof of the soundstage.  Outside.\n     Really outside for the first time in his life.\n\n     He looks frantically around him.  Nowhere to hide.  The\n     soundstage stretches for miles in both directions as far as the\n     eye can see, an interminable expanse of roof.\n\n     Facing him, a colossal Burbank.  Several other soundstages\n     almost as gigantic as his own.  The palm trees lining the\n     streets, dwarfed by the mammoth barns.\n\n     The Hollywood Freeway in the distance, carrying its ribbons of\n     traffic, twenty lanes wide.  Gargantuan office buildings\n     eclipse any skyscraper Truman has ever known.\n\n     Directly below him, a dizzying drop to the studio lot and its\n     arched entranceway.\n\n     Above him, a large yellow moon in the twilight sky.  The real\n     moon, not the planetarium projection he has been contemplating\n     for the last thirty-four years.\n\n     Truman wheels around, suddenly realizing he is not alone.  A\n     GROUP has emerged on the rooftop, standing still and silent\n     in a semi-circle, cutting off any escape.\n\n     Along with the STUDIO GUARDS, keeping their distance in the\n     background, are CHLOE, SIMEON, and the two studio executives,\n     MOSES and ROMAN.  In front of them, the co-stars in his life -\n     MARLON, MERYL, sister RAQUEL, mother AUDREY and supposedly dead\n     father KIRK.  No one moves or speaks as Truman scans the\n     familiar faces.  Marlon, in particular, cannot look him in the\n     eye.\n\n     Truman's gaze finally falls on the white-haired old man standing\n     at the head of the group.  CHRISTOF.  He approaches Truman\n     alone, carrying a white envelope, calling his name the way a\n     father calls to a son.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n              Truman...\n\n     Truman seems to sense the significance Christof has had in his\n     life, drawn to and repelled by him at the same time.  As they\n     stand together looking into each other's eyes for the first\n     time, they seem to be the only two figures on the roof.  For a\n     moment Truman averts his gaze to the night sky.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (quietly, half to himself,\n                      half to Christof)\n              Even the stars I wished on...\n\n     As Truman turns his attention back to Christof, he suddenly\n     lunges at him, catching him off-guard, the envelope slipping\n     from Christof's hand.  With a strength he never knew he\n     possessed, Truman forces Christof to the edge of the soundstage\n     roof, threatening to throw them both off his counterfeit world.\n\n     Christof clings desperately to Truman to save himself.  The\n     studio guards dare not move.\n\n                           CHRISTOF\n                      (staring into the chasm,\n                      remaining eerily calm)\n              You won't do it, Truman.  I've watched you\n              your whole life.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (meeting Christof's gaze)\n              You never had a camera in my head.\n\n     Suddenly the doubts flood into Christof's eyes, fearing he\n     has misjudged Truman, fearing for his life.\n\n                           TRUMAN\n                      (incensed)\n              Something was real!\n                      (a terrifying anguish)\n              Something had to be real!\n\n     It takes all of Truman's will not to hurl the old man into the\n     abyss.  Christof, petrified, looks to the pristine, white\n     envelope that lies half over the edge of the roof, glinting in\n     the moonlight.\n\n     Truman follows Christof's gaze.  Contemptuously tossing Christof\n     aside, he retrieves the envelope.  Christof crawls to safety,\n     thankful to still be alive, suddenly appearing very small and\n     insignificant.\n\n     But Christof and the other figures on the rooftop no longer\n     exist in Truman's mind.  Truman gazes at his name for a long\n     moment, handwritten on the envelope in blue ink, then carefully\n     breaks the seal.  Truman allows the sole item in the envelope to\n     be slowly revealed.  A photograph.  A close up of SYLVIA's face\n     including her eyes, mouth and that perfect, ever-elusive nose.\n\n     A serenity comes over Truman.  He lifts up his eyes to the\n     mountains on the far horizon.  As he stands on the very edge of\n     the soundstage roof without fear, clutching the photograph, we\n     commence a long, slow pull-back.\n\n     Truman is unaware that directly beneath his feet on the wall\n     of the enormous soundstage is a billboard acrrying a gigantic\n     picture of his face and proclaiming, \"TRUMAN - Total Record of a\n     Human Life.  34TH GREAT YEAR!\"\n\n     We continue to pull back until Truman is nothing but a speck on\n     top of the soundstage so large it never completely clears frame.\n\n\n     A MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS\n\n     The two OLD WOMEN in the living room, the NIGHTWATCHMEN, the\n     two YOUNG MEN with the Watchman TV, the PATRONS in the bar,\n     PASSERS-BY outside an electronics store are all captivated by\n     their television sets.\n\n     We focus on the screen of a television.  A small FEMALE BABY\n     sucks a toy on a blanket in the backyard of Truman's old\n     suburban home in Queens, the lawn he mowed for ten years of his\n     life.  The infant's doting parents, MARLON and the new actress\n     VIVIEN, enter frame and begin to fuss over the child.  A border\n     around the action on the screen announces, \"ZOE - Total\n     Record Of a Human Life\".\n\n     Suddenly we see a child's hand on top of the television screen.\n     A BABY stands unsteadily, supporting herself against the\n     television set in Sylvia's house.\n\n     TRUMAN bends down and picks up his baby, tossing her into the\n     air, much to the child's delight.  Truman dwells for a moment\n     on the mirror-image scene on the television before very\n     deliberately shutting it off.\n\n     SYLVIA joins Truman and their daughter.  Together, they exit\n     the beach house.  We follow them as they make their way onto the\n     deserted sand and down towards the sea.\n\n     FADE OUT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruman Show, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Andrew Niccol\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:37:41.413210"}
