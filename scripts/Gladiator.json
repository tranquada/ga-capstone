FOREST - DAY\n</b>\nGermania.  The far reaches of the Roman Empire.\n\nWinter 180 A.D.\n\nIncongruously enough, the first sound we hear is a\nbeautiful tenor voice.  Singing.  A boy's voice.\n\nCREDITS as we hear the haunting song float through dense\nforests.  We finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing\nthrough the forest.  On the road a GERMAN PEASANT FATHER\nis herding along three sickly looking cows.  His two SONS\nare with him.  His youngest son sits on one of the cows\nand sings a soft, plaintive song.\n\nThey become aware of another sound behind them on the road\n-- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather.  The\nFather immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the\nroad.  They stand-still, eyes down:  the familiar posture\nof subjugated peoples throughout history.\n\nA wagon train rumbles past them.  Three ornate wagons\nfollowed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed\n<b>PRAETORIAN GUARDS.\n</b>\nThe young boy dares to glance up at the passing Romans.\nHis eyes burn with hatred.\n\n<b>INT.  WAGON - DAY\n</b>\nMist momentarily obscures a man's face.  Frozen breath.\nThe man is in his 20's, imperious and handsome.  He is\nswathed in fur, only his face exposed.  He is COMMODUS.\n\nHe glances up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCOMMODUS\n</b>\t\tDo you think he's really dying?\n\nThe woman across from him returns his gaze evenly.  She is\nslightly older, beautiful and patrician.  A formidable\nwoman.\n\nShe is LUCILLA.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tLUCILLA\n</b>\t\tHe's been dying for ten years.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCOMMODUS\n</b>\t\tI think he's really dying this time.\n\nA beat.

Voices are heard outside.\n\nCommodus leaps out...\n\n<b>EXT.

They've been gone\n\t\tfor eight days.\n\nCommodus tosses off his furs -- beneath them he wears a\nbeautiful set of Lorica Segmentata -- the traditional\nformed armor of Rome.  He moves to a horse as:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCOMMODUS\n</b>\t\t\t(to Soldier #1)\n\t\tMy sister wants a bath, take her to\n\t\tthe camp.\n\t\t\t(to Soldier #2)\n\t\tTake me to my father.\n\nHe leaps onto the horse and canters back to the Praetorian\nGuard unit.\n\nSoldier #2 climbs on his horse and leads them.  Commodus\nrides off with most of the Praetorian Guard unit.\n\nLucilla peeks her head from the wagon.  She glances at the\nremaining soldiers.  Distinctly unpromising.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tLUCILLA\n</b>\t\t\t(dry)\n\t\tCivilization at last.  Gods preserve\n\t\tus.\n\n<b>EXT.  HILL - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nThe mighty catapults dwarf the humans.  Soldiers from the\nelite Felix Regiment -- a legion of the Roman Army -- haul\nthe monstrous machines up a hill.\n\nThe commanding General of the Felix Regiment, MAXIMUS,\nwalks between two of the catapults.  He is a striking and\nintense man in his 30's.  Like all the soldiers who\nsurround him, he is caked with mud and exhausted.\n\nHe trudges up the hill with his two lieutenants, TITUS and\n<b>QUINTUS.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTITUS\n</b>\t\tYou would do as well to read the\n\t\tmind of a rhinoceros.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tQUINTUS\n</b>\t\tThese barbarians would rather drown\n\t\tin blood than yield an inch.  If I\n\t\tdidn't hate them so much I would\n\t\tadmire them.\n\nThey have reached the top of the hill.  Stunning martial\npreparations are underway.  The catapults join ten others.\nArchers are taking up position.  Brutal \"Scorpions\" --\ndevices for firing multiple crossbow bolts -- are being\nloaded.  Soldiers are also loading the catapults with\nenormous \"Greek fire pots\" -- large, round terra cotta\npots.\n\nMaximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop.\nBelow them they can see a German encampment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTITUS\n</b>\t\tThey simply will not surrender.\n\nA beat as Maximus gazes down at the German position.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tA people should know when they are\n\t\tconquered.\n\nA beat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tAt the first signal release the\n\t\tcatapults.

TREES - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nMaximus and Titus are on their horses, the cavalry of two\nhundred Felix Regiment warriors surrounds them.  Steam\nflares from their horses' nostrils.  They wait in a thick\nstand of trees -- the German position can be seen across a\nmuddy plain.\n\nA large wolf -- \"The Wolf of Rome\" -- waits at Maximus'\nside.\n\nMaximus nods to an archer.  The archer lights the tip of\nan arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky.\n\n<b>EXT.  HILLTOP - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nQuintus waits.  The catapults are loaded and waiting.  So\ntoo the Scorpions.  So too the 200 archers of the Felix\nRegiment.\n\nHe sees the flaming arrow flying up from below.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tQUINTUS\n</b>\t\tNow!\n\nThe mighty catapults are released.  The Greek fire pots\narc dramatically through the air.  A moment later soldiers\nrelease the Scorpions and hundreds of bolts streak through\nthe sky.  The archers fire a murderous barrage of flaming\narrows.\n\n<b>EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nThe screaming is almost immediate.\n\nMaximus and his cavalry watch as the fire pots crash down\ninto the German encampment.\n\n<b>EXT.  GERMAN CAMP - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nThe fire pots shatter -- pitch splashes everywhere --\nseconds later the bolts and flaming arrows slice down and\nignite the pitch -- FLAME EXPLODES -- it is a hellish,\nnapalm-like vision -- the conflagration illuminating the\ntwilight.\n\nThe deadly rain of flaming arrows spreads terror through\nthe German camp --\n\n<b>EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nMaximus watches the German camp.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\t\t(to his men)\n\t\tHold steady... steady...\n\nHe can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment\ncontinuing -- fire pots and Scorpion bolts and flaming\narrows -- panic in the German encampment.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tSteady...\n\nHe sees the Germans begin fleeing across the plain.  He\nquickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer, then turns\nto his men:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tBrothers -- I salute you!  For Rome!\n\nHe spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the\nplain...\n\n<b>EXT.  PLAIN - BATTLEGROUND - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nMaximus leads the terrifying and relentless cavalry charge\n-- Titus at his side -- the Felix Regiment screams out\nfearsome war cries as they gallop across the muddy plain\ntoward the Germans --\n\nFire pots and flaming arrows are crashing down everywhere\naround them --\n\nThe cavalry SLAMS into the Germans at full gallop --\n\nIt is carnage.\n\nThe Felix Regiment warriors slash ruthlessly with short\nswords -- slicing a path of sheer destruction through the\nGermans -- but the Germans fight with equal brutality --\nand the Germans also fight with the desperation of a\nhopeless last chance -- they pull and spear Roman soldiers\noff horses whenever they can --\n\nMaximus spins his horse and swings his sword with expert\nefficiency -- a spear stabs through the neck of his horse\nand it immediately collapses forward --\n\nMaximus sails over the horse's head and crashes to the\nmuddy ground -- he jumps up and is in the midst of the\nbattle --\n\nThe flaming arrows and exploding fire pots create a\nferocious inferno everywhere around the battle -- the\nflames silhouetting the fighting --\n\nOn the ground, Maximus proves his absolute worth as a\nwarrior -- he hacks and dodges -- ghastly images of true\nancient warfare -- Maximus' eyes burn with a zealous fire\nas he fights for his life --\n\nHe finds he is momentarily at a terrible disadvantage --\nGermans are surrounding him from all sides -- as he fights\nhe looks for an advantage -- for his soldiers -- for\nanything -- he is doomed --\n\nThen -- an almost mystical image -- Maximus' wolf leaps\nthrough a wall of flame --\n\n\"The Wolf of Rome\" savages several Germans around Maximus\n-- giving him the help he needed.\n\nThe wolf and his master fight, side-by-side.\n\n<b>EXT.  HILLTOP - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nWe see an old man's face, staring down at the battle.  The\nface is weather-beaten, ailing.  The roaring flames from\nthe battlefield below flicker in his sad eyes.\n\nMARCUS AURELIUS, the Emperor of Rome, is on a horse.  A\nmetal brace extends from the back of his saddle.  He is\nstrapped to the brace with thick, leather straps.\n\nHe watches as the Felix Regiment below concludes the\nbattle.  The cheering of the Regiment can be heard as the\nfinal, isolated pockets of Germans are cut down.\n\nBehind Marcus the sun is setting, painting the world blood\nred.\n\n<b>EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - SUNSET\n</b>\nMaximus, bloody and spent, walks through the aftermath of\nthe carnage.  The Wolf of Rome is at his side.  Dead and\ndying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere.  Roman\nsurgeons are attending to the wounded.\n\nMarcus walks to him, embraces him warmly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tCaesar.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\tMaximus, you prove your valor again.\n\t\tLet us hope for the final time here.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tI don't think there's anyone left to\n\t\tfight.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\tThere are always people left to\n\t\tfight...\n\nMarcus takes Maximus' arm and they walk through the masses\nof bodies.  Maximus holds Marcus' arm firmly, quietly\nsupporting him as they walk.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\tBut this night, at least, Germania\n\t\tis at last defeated... What will you\n\t\tdo now, my friend?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tShould Caesar permit, I'll go home.\n\t\tI've been away too long.  I've\n\t\tforgotten my wife's face and I\n\t\tbarely know my son.\n\nSuddenly, a tethered GERMAN PRISONER they are passing\ncalls out to them:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tGERMAN PRISONER\n</b><b>\t\tTHIS BLOOD MEANS NOTHING, CONQUEROR!\n</b>\nMaximus and Marcus stop.  A soldier moves quickly to\nsilence the German Prisoner.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\t\t(to Soldier)\n\t\tStop...\n\t\t\t(to Prisoner)\n\t\t...

You can slit a\n\t\tthousand throats here, and you can\n\t\tput a thousand babies to the sword,\n\t\tbut it will always be our home.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\tNow it is Rome.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tGERMAN PRISONER\n</b>\t\tIt will never be Rome.  Not as long\n\t\tas one German breathes.\n\nThe soldier moves to kill the insolent Prisoner.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\tNo... Release him.  Give him safe\n\t\tpassage.  Let him go to his family.\n\nThe soldier leads the German Prisoner away.\n\nMaximus and Marcus continue walking in silence for a beat.\nThen:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\tTell me again, Maximus, why are we\n\t\there?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tFor the glory of the empire, sire.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tYes.  I remember.\n\nThey continue walking through the mountains of bodies...\n\n<b>EXT.  ROAD - SUNSET\n</b>\nMaximus and Marcus are now walking along a road through\nthe dense forest.  Slaves follow behind them, leading\ntheir horses.\n\nBoth sides of the road are filled with the men of the\nFelix Regiment.  As Maximus and Marcus pass, the battered\nand bloody soldiers drag themselves to their feet, raising\ntheir swords, paying silent homage.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tThey honor you, Caesar.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\tI don't think they're standing for\n\t\tme, Maximus.  They honor you.\n\nJust then Commodus canters into view with his Praetorian\nGuard escort.  He watches the army honor Maximus with rank\nenvy as he nears.\n\nHe rides up to Maximus and Marcus.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCOMMODUS\n</b>\t\tHave I missed it?\n\nHe leaps from his horse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCOMMODUS\n</b>\t\tHave I missed the battle?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\tYou've missed the war.

I should ride now.\n\nMaximus waves for Marcus' horse.  It is brought up.\nSeveral soldiers carefully help the old man into the\nsaddle.  He is then tethered to the brace on his saddle.\nIt is a slow, graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the\nEmperor of Rome.\n\nWhen at last he is strapped in, he looks to Maximus.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\tSo much for the glory of Rome.\n\nWithout a word to his son, Marcus nods and the horse is\nslowly lead away.\n\nCommodus and Maximus watch him go.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCOMMODUS\n</b>\t\t\t(neutral)\n\t\tHe's dying.\n\nA beat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCOMMODUS\n</b>\t\tPoor old man.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\t\t(terse)\n\t\tIf you'll excuse me, Highness.\n\nHe turns and stalks away.\n\n<b>EXT.  TENT CITY - NIGHT\n</b>\nWe see the Roman encampment, a sea of tents.  Hundreds of\ncampfires burn before the tents.\n\n<b>INT.  HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nMaximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of\nthe dead and dying.  Roman surgeons are working feverishly\nto save lives.  Limbs are amputated, the bloody stumps\nquickly cauterized with hot irons.  Leeches and bronze\ncups are employed for blood-letting to balance \"humours.\"\n\nAnesthesia as we know it is nonexistent.  Wine amphoras\nare passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward\nthe patients.  Mostly, though, they just hold down the\nwrithing patients.\n\nMaximus moves through the tent, offering a word of comfort\nhere and there.  All the wounded are delighted to see him.\n\nHe goes to an older soldier, GALLUS, who has one wooden\nhand.  His other hand is bandaged.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tWhat, Gallus, losing your other\n\t\thand?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tGALLUS\n</b>\t\tAye, General, they're going to make\n\t\ta bronze one for it.  Long fingers\n\t\tthis time.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tAnd the women of your village will\n\t\tcrave your touch even more.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tGALLUS\n</b>\t\tAh, then you know the women of my\n\t\tvillage.\n\nMaximus smiles and moves on.\n\nHe stops at a young soldier, VALERIUS, whose head has been\nshaved.  A hole has been bored into his skull to relieve\nthe pressure on his brain.  The young soldier is dying.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tWhat's your name, son?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tVALERIUS\n</b>\t\tValerius, General.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tThe name suits you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tVALERIUS\n</b>\t\tWhy am I dying?\n\nA beat.

He takes Valerius'\nhand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tYou're dying because you love Rome,\n\t\tas I do.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tVALERIUS\n</b>\t\tI've never been to Rome.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tNeither have I.

And he is dead.\n\nMaximus sits for a moment.  He gently closes Valerius'\neyes.  And Maximus finds that he is weeping.\n\nHe is not ashamed of the tears.\n\n<b>INT.  MESS TENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nAn immediate swirl of noise.  The grand mess tent is\ncrowded with soldiers.  They are still filthy with caked-\non mud and blood.  Wounds are bandaged and tankards are\nraised in celebration of the victory.\n\nMarcus sits in a central position and receives visitors.\nCurrently two Senators, FALCO and GAIUS, are bowing before\nhim.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tFALCO\n</b>\t\tHail, Marcus Aurelius.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMARCUS\n</b>\t\tStand up, Senators.

HILLSIDE - NIGHT\n</b>\nMaximus continues to gallop, he is on a different horse.\nHe leads only two horses now.\n\n<b>EXT.  VINEYARD - DAY\n</b>\nMaximus' home in Spain is beautiful beyond measure.\n\nWe see verdant farmlands and vineyards and a spacious\nhouse nestled amid gently rolling hills.\n\nMaximus' eight-year-old SON is in a paddock playing with\nhis pony.  He stops, sees something.  Over a hill, he can\njust glimpse a battle flag, approaching.\n\nHe screams with joy and runs toward the flag as he calls:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS' SON\n</b><b>\t\tMOTHER!  MOTHER!  FATHER'S HOME!\n</b>\nMaximus' WIFE emerges from the house, drying her hands on\na cloth and smiles.\n\nMaximus' Son races toward the flag.  He can just see the\nsoldiers beginning to appear over the hill.  Not a Roman\nLegion at all.  Twenty Praetorians canter over the hill.\n\nMaximus' Son stops, confused.\n\n<b>EXT.  OLIVE GROVE - DAY\n</b>\nMaximus is galloping up a hill, leading only one horse\nnow.  The horse he is on is exhausted, spent, foam coats\nits neck.  It can't make it.\n\nThe horse collapses and Maximus falls.  He immediately\nleaps onto the remaining horse and continues riding up the\nhill.\n\n<b>EXT.  HILLS AROUND VINEYARD - SUNSET\n</b>\nMaximus is racing over the countryside, galloping in a\nfrenzy.  His wound is bleeding profusely, coating the side\nof his horse.\n\nHe rears the horse to a stop for a moment.  Over a hill he\ncan see thick black smoke rising.  He spurs the horse and\ngallops over the hill...\n\n<b>EXT.  VINEYARD - SUNSET\n</b>\nAnd his worst nightmares are realized.\n\nHis home and his vineyards have been destroyed.  The earth\nhas been scorched and his house is still smoldering.  He\nrides up to the house and practically falls off the horse.\n\nHe pulls himself up and walks past the smoldering debris\nof his house, fearing what he knows he will find.\n\nHe sees the bodies of servants scattered about in the\nruins.  He sees a Praetorian battle flag.\n\nHe continues on, his wound bleeding more with every\ntortured step.  He finally stops.  He stares up.\n\nHis wife and his son have been crucified and burnt.  They\nare nothing more than grotesquely twisted, charred shapes.\n\nMaximus instantly collapses to his knees -- he howls out\nhis torment in a heartrending keen of despair as he coats\nhis face in the ashes of his dead world.  He sinks into\nunconsciousness, praying for death.\n\n<b>EXT.  VINEYARD - DAY\n</b>\nAn unusual jingling sound is heard.  Maximus appears to be\ndead, his gaping wound beginning to fester.\n\nThe source of the jingling becomes clear when we see the\nfeet of Bedouin brigands, with delicate anklets, shuffling\naround him.  A hand touches his sandals.  Rich sandals.\nAnother touches his tunic.  Good cloth.\n\nSuddenly Maximus groans.  The hands stop.  He's alive.  A\nbit of quick language in an unknown tongue.\n\nThen the hands grab Maximus and drag him away.\n\n<b>EXT.  SLAVE WAGON TRAIN - DAY\n</b>\nMaximus' eyes slowly open --\n\nInches away from his face -- a lion roars --\n\nMaximus lurches back.\n\nHe looks around to realize he is in a filthy slave wagon.\nThree other wagons slowly move over the desert landscape.\nExotic animals are caged in pens or led alongside the\nwagons:  lions, panthers, zebras, a giraffe.  A dozen\nslaves are chained together alongside sacks of spices and\nother cargo.  Bedouin slave traders jabber in a surreal\nbabel of foreign tongues.\n\nAnd someone is looking at him.  JUBA, a striking African,\nis gazing at him impassively as he chews something.  Juba\nis also chained.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\t\t(weakly)\n\t\tAm I in Hades?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJUBA\n</b>\t\tYes.\n\nJuba spits what he has been chewing into his hands and\nmoves to Maximus.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJUBA\n</b>\t\tFor your wound...\n\nMaximus stares at him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJUBA\n</b>\t\t\t(nods)\n\t\tFor your wound.\n\nMaximus looks down -- the bloody wound at his side.\n\nJuba carefully places his poultice over the wound --\nMaximus hisses in pain -- Juba massages the poultice into\nthe wound gently as:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJUBA\n</b>\t\tIf you die in the wagons they feed\n\t\tyou to the lions...

Juba looks down at him with the\nbarest hint of a smile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJUBA\n</b>\t\tI'm not sure about the giraffe.\n\n<b>EXT.  SLAVE MARKET - DAY\n</b>\nThe heat of Morocco is unlike anything Maximus has ever\nknown.  Shimmering heat waves undulate over the sand.\n\nThe provincial market is bustling like the proverbial\nanthill.  Slave traders and dealers and merchants move\naround, all talking very quickly and very emphatically.\n\nMaximus, Juba and a number of other slaves are on display,\npoked and prodded and fondled.  Their BEDOUIN SLAVE TRADER\nsings out their praises to any passers.\n\nThe crowd parts almost magically for the dramatic arrival\nof PROXIMO.  Proximo is a large man of immense appetites.\nHe has the ferocious appearance of a true pirate.  Two\nslaves follow behind him and impotently swat at flies with\nswitches.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSLAVE TRADER\n</b>\t\tProximo, my old friend, see what I\n\t\thave for you today -- !\n\nProximo SLAMS a fist into the Slave Trader's face.

He's\n\t\ta Spaniard and killed fourteen of my\n\t\tmen before he could be subdued!\n\nProximo looks at Maximus, notes the many battle scars\nagain.  The scars, and something he senses in Maximus'\neyes, is enough for Proximo to consider it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tPROXIMO\n</b>\t\t\t(to trader)\n\t\tAll right, let's see.\n\nThe Slave Trader and his colleagues grab Maximus and\nbustle him across the market, unlocking his chains.\nMaximus has no idea what's going on.\n\nIn the center of the market place, a veritable GIANT of a\nman sits on a small stool, a wooden sword in his hand.  He\nis hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot\nchain shackled to his ankle.  A think metal helmet is\nriveted around his entire head, only long turfs of hair\nemerging.  His dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in\nthe helmet.\n\nThe Slave Trader puts a wooden sword in Maximus' hand and\nshoves him toward the Giant.  The Giant stands.  He towers\nover Maximus.\n\nThe Giant suddenly swings his sword -- he moves with\nremarkable quickness -- Maximus makes no attempt to block\nthe blow -- it sends him flying to the ground.\n\nMaximus pulls himself up.\n\nThe Giant moves in and hits him again -- Maximus recoils\n-- the Giant hits him again -- Maximus falls.\n\nMaximus pulls himself up.\n\nThe Giant moves in again -- he slams him a few more times\n-- Maximus makes no attempt to protect himself -- he\nfalls.\n\nMaximus pulls himself up.\n\nThe Giant is about to attack again --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tPROXIMO\n</b>\t\t\t(to Slave Trader)\n\t\tThat's enough.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSLAVE TRADER\n</b><b>\t\tSTOP!

PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - DAY\n</b>\nMaximus and Juba are crammed into a wagon with about ten\nother slaves, including a very scared and reedy SCRIBE.\nOther wagons are filled with exotic animals, including\nseveral lions.\n\nThe wagons move through a crowded casbah and are taken\nthrough an imposing set of gates to...\n\n<b>EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - DAY\n</b>\nAn open compound in Proximo's school.  On one side of the\ncompound is a series of cages filled with wild animals of\nevery description -- including Proximo's two hapless\ngiraffes.\n\nProximo's house slaves begin unloading the newly purchased\nexotic animals into cages as Maximus and the new slaves\nare unloaded.  Heavily armed guards supervise everything.\n\nBut Proximo's slaves are having a bit of a problem with\none of the new lions -- it growls and resists them.\n\nWithout the slightest hesitation, Proximo thunders to the\nlion and grabs it by the mane -- manhandling it into a\ncage.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tPROXIMO\n</b><b>\t\tCOME ON, YOU FILTHY BEAST!\n</b>\nHe kicks the lion in the rear as he shoves it into the\ncage.\n\nProximo's provincial school resembles nothing so much as a\nseedy prison.  The fading grandeur of the decaying\nbattlements and the sweeping North African architecture\nonly slightly mitigate the brutal feel of the place.\n\nAnd if Maximus had any doubts as to Proximo's profession\n-- all doubts are washed away when he sees the compound.\n\nTwenty GLADIATORS are working out in the compound --\nhacking at practice dummies and sparring.  The many\nheavily armed guards oversee everything.  The gladiators\nstop working out as they see the new slaves enter.  They\neye their potential new opponents warily.\n\nOne huge, glowering gladiator -- VIBIUS -- watches with\nparticular interest.  His eye is quickly drawn to the most\nobvious athlete:  Juba.\n\nThe new slaves are herded to the middle of the compound\nand house slaves immediately begin throwing buckets of\nwater on them, cleaning them.\n\nMeanwhile, Proximo shrugs off his cloak.  A slave brings\nhim wine as he give his \"welcoming speech\" to the new\nslaves:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tPROXIMO\n</b>\t\tSlaves.  I am Proximo, trainer of\n\t\tgladiators.

PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - MAXIMUS' CELL - NIGHT\n</b>\nMaximus and Juba share a small, filthy cell.  The cell\ndoor faces the open compound.  Across the compound they\ncan see the much more comfortable cells of the \"star\"\ngladiators such as Vibius.\n\nThey both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall.\nJuba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon.\nMaximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not\ntouched them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJUBA\n</b>\t\tHave you killed a man before?\n\nMaximus does not respond.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJUBA\n</b>\t\tYou should eat.

Vermilion and crimson dyes\ndrip down and splash across the oxen -- and splash across\nthe gladiators.\n\nMaximus, Juba, the formidable Vibius are chained in the\nback of the wagon.  Also the frightened Scribe.\n\nProximo and a few of his guards drive the wagon.

A pack of children\nrun alongside the wagon, chanting:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCHILDREN\n</b>\t\tDead guts!  Dead guts!

Some of the crowd\ncheers.\n\nThe Andabatae immediately race for the chained teams and\nthe battle is on.\n\nVibius spins into action -- dragging the weeping Scribe\nafter him as he circles opponents and fights -- the Scribe\nis almost instantly killed -- Vibius immediately hacks\nthrough the Scribe's wrist and frees himself, as Proximo\nsurely intended.  Vibius is now free to fight alone,\nswinging the chain as an additional weapon.\n\nJuba's eyes dart everywhere as he tries to move with\nMaximus -- Maximus neither helps nor hinders -- allowing\nJuba to pull him along --\n\nProximo, now that his star Vibius is safe, watched Maximus\nand Juba closely.\n\nJuba fights well, with a strange elegance, his body\nflowing like liquid -- but he is inexperienced.  He\nstrikes a few blows and then tries to move away -- finally\nhe is in trouble -- cornered -- a huge Andabata is slicing\nat him -- it is a desperate battle -- Juba is losing --\nhis sword is slammed away -- the Andabata raises his sword\nfor the kill --\n\nAnd Maximus strikes.\n\nWith a sudden roar he EXPLODES into action -- he swings\npast Juba and blocks the blow meant for Juba -- then he\nslashes the Andabata -- killing him -- he pulls Juba after\nhim as he fights --\n\nIt is a dazzling display of Maximus' skill -- he moves\nthrough the Andabatae at amazing speed -- spinning around\nJuba and protecting him -- slashing ruthlessly -- pulling\nJuba after him and commanding the battle -- Juba recovers\na sword and they fight together.\n\nIn the box:\n\nProximo watches, smiles.

They are\non ropes unrolling huge rolls of muslin; sun tarps that\nprovide shade below...\n\nMerchants open stalls in the curved arcade around outside\nof the Colosseum.  They sell everything from food to magic\nelixirs, from toys to aphrodisiacs.

Racks and racks of\nweaponry and armor.\n\nAnd, most striking, everywhere around them is the heavy\nmachinery of the spectacles above.  Huge \"elevator\"\nplatforms and ramps and pulleys and counterweights are\nmanned by teams of sweating slaves.\n\n<b>INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY\n</b>\nFinally, Proximo's guards lead the gladiators to their\nholding cells.  These cells are right at the edge of the\narena.  Barred windows offer a sand-level view of the\naction.\n\nMaximus immediately goes to a window and looks out.\n\nHe cannot see much of the entire arena, but what he does\nsee transfixes him.\n\nA band of Christians are huddled together.  An eerie\nsilence from the Colosseum but for the prayers of the\nChristians.\n\nMaximus watches them.  One little girl peels past her\nmother's arm.  She sees Maximus.  She smiles.\n\nSuddenly a dozen ferocious lions race up a ramp by Maximus\n-- they roar into the arena --\n\nWe do not see the carnage.  We watch Maximus' face as we\nhear the sounds of the slaughter.\n\nAnd the sound of the roaring crowd.\n\nMaximus finally cannot watch.  He drops his head.\n\n<b>INT.

His full attention\nis focused on one spot alone.  The Imperial Box.\n\nHe can see Commodus and Lucilla sitting in the box.  The\nbox is elevated fifteen feet above the arena floor at the\ntop of a sheer black marble wall.  A cohort of fifty\nimposing Praetorian Guard Archers surround the box.\nCommodus' personal Body Guard of six Centurions actually\nstand in the box itself, eyes constantly watching like\nmodern Secret Service agents.\n\nCommodus is untouchable.\n\nMeanwhile, three teams move from different entrances to\nthe arena.\n\nAs Cassius orates to the crowd:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n</b>\t\tThis day we reach back to hallowed\n\t\tantiquity to bring you...

The good bits are tossed\ninto a wagon to fed to the Colosseum animals.  The waste\nand offal are shoveled into a large sewer opening.  A\nbutcher occasionally lifts a sluice-gate and a gush of\nwater flows into the sewer from above, washing down the\nblood and carcasses.\n\nMaximus crouches and creeps through the nightmare of\nhanging carcasses and flies.\n\nWhen the butchers are looking elsewhere, Maximus creeps to\nthe sewer opening and climbs in -- he immediately slides\ndown for a few yards in the slanting, slippery blood\nsluice -- out of sight --\n\nThen he thuds to a stop.  He can go no further because the\nremains of an animal carcass blocks his way.  He tries to\nslither past the carcass --\n\nFinally, one of the butchers above lifts the sluice-gate\nand a torrent of water flows down.\n\nMaximus is washed down the hideous sewer.\n\n<b>INT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT\n</b>\nProximo and Juba are quickly marching back down the tunnel\ntoward the compound -- they are very close now -- the roar\nof flame is heard -- the creak of falling timber -- and\nthe screams of burning men.

VARIOUS LOCATIONS - ARREST MONTAGE - NIGHT\n</b>\nA quick sequence of brutal arrests as Praetorian Guard\nunits round up many associated with the plot.  And many\nthat are not.\n\nGAIUS' BEDROOM:  Gaius and his wife are yanked awake and\nhauled out.\n\nCHRISTIAN HOME:  A congregation of Christians is chained\ntogether, their secret altar smashed.\n\nCAFE:  Greek Scholars are hauled away from their scrolls.\n\nSTREET THEATER:  Actors are dragged off in the midst of a\nperformance.\n\nGRACCHUS' STEAM ROOM:  Gracchus is enjoying grapes with\nhis handsome catamite.  A unit of Praetorian bursts in.\nGracchus looks at them.  Sighs.\n\n<b>INT.

Her face is\na mask of anguish at what she has been forced to do.\n\nTwo Praetorians enter with a bucket.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tPRAETORIAN\n</b>\t\tCaesar...\n\nCommodus goes to them.

Lucilla\nmoans.  All is lost.\n\n<b>EXT.  TIBER RIVER - NIGHT\n</b>\nMaximus splashes to the surface of the filthy Tiber,\ngasping for air.\n\nAnimal carcasses float up next to him.  He grabs onto one\nand floats down the gently flowing river.\n\n<b>EXT.  ITALIAN FRONT - CAMP - DAWN\n</b>\nThe Wolf of Rome sleeps.  Then its ears rise.  Then its\nhead.  It sniffs the air.  The wolf slowly rises and\nbegins loping through the camp.\n\nIt passes slumbering soldiers and tents, smoke lazily\ndrifting up from campfires.\n\nThe wolf finally stops and looks up.\n\nMaximus is on a horse.  He climbs down.  The wolf goes to\nhim and licks his hand.\n\nMaximus begins marching through the camp, the wolf at his\nside.  Soldiers stir, amazed to see their General is\nalive.\n\nGallus leaps up, stunned, and goes to Maximus.  They\ncontinue to march through the camp, more and more\nastonished soldiers joining them.\n\nThey march toward the large tents at the center of the\nencampment.\n\nTitus emerges from his tent.  Slams to a stop --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTITUS\n</b>\t\tBy all the Gods...\n\nHe goes to Maximus and embraces him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tOld friend...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTITUS\n</b>\t\tYou're returned from Hades!

He\nstares at Maximus, unbelieving.\n\nA long beat as they look at each other.\n\nQuintus knows his destiny.  With quiet dignity he begins\nwhispering a prayer.  Maximus moves to him, embracing him:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tI forgive you.\n\nHe stabs Quintus with a dagger as he embraces him.\nQuintus falls.\n\nA beat.\n\nTitus goes to the dead Quintus and pulls the seal of\noffice from his uniform.  He hands it to Maximus.\n\nAn enormous roar of celebration from the Felix Regiment.\n\n<b>INT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - MORNING\n</b>\nA castrati choir sings a gentle hymn of celebration.\nTheir eerie voices and otherworldly harmonies undulate\naround Commodus' bedroom.\n\nThe Emperor himself is in a chair, wrapped in a robe.  His\nbody slaves work over him closely.\n\nHe is staring into a mirror, lost in another world as the\nslaves carefully apply golden eye makeup to him.\n\nThe castrati hymn continues...\n\n<b>EXT.  OUTSIDE THE COLOSSEUM - DAY\n</b>\nThe hymn is all we hear as we see crowds moving into the\nColosseum...\n\nIt seems that all of Rome is here for this great day.\nHuge throngs of citizens move like a massive wave toward\nthe Colosseum entrances.  Vendors are doing brisk\nbusiness.  Praetorian units in full dress uniform canter\npast.\n\nWe elegantly float up along the outer tiers of the\nColosseum and then glide over the edge to see the arena\nstands...\n\n<b>EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY\n</b>\nThe hymn is all we hear as we see...   \n\nThe stands are filling.  We see the rich and poor alike.\nWe see the orator Cassius.  We see Senator Falco and most\nof the Senate.  We see the cohort of fifty Praetorian\ntaking up position around the Imperial Box.\n\nA golden platform, with stairs down to the arena sand, now\nextends about twenty feet from the Imperial Box to a spot\nover the arena.\n\nWe float down the stairs and then we see the arena\nitself...\n\nIt is stunning in its simplicity.\n\nThe days victims are tied to posts in the center of the\narena.  Suspended above them is an enormous cloud.  A\nthick, tumescent bladder painted to look like a\nthreatening rain cloud.\n\nWe see Proximo and Juba.  We see Senators Gracchus and\nGaius.  We see Gaius' wife and Gracchus catamite and\nChristian families and scholars and actors.\n\nSeven stylized hills surround them.\n\nThe hymn comes to its soaring conclusion as we see the\ndamned.\n\n<b>TIME CUT:\n</b>\nLater.  By now, the Colosseum is packed.  All fifty-five\nthousand seats are taken.  Another ten thousand stand\nwherever they can.  A feral anticipation buzzes through\nthe crowd.\n\nOutside the Colosseum, the streets are crowded with\nthousands more who couldn't get in.\n\nTrumpets blare.\n\nCommodus' six Centurion Body Guards stride into the\nImperial Box.\n\nThen Commodus enters.  He is shrouded in a full lion's\nskin, the head of the lion concealing his own.  His head\nis down, he does not look up.\n\nLucilla and Lucius enter after him and sit.  Lucilla's\nface is drained, her eyes defeated.  Lucius is wearing a\nminiature set of Lorica Segmentata, complete with\nceremonial dagger.\n\n<b>EXT.  ROMAN STREET - DAY\n</b>\nA mangy dog is slowly crossing a dusty street on the\noutskirts of Rome.  The street is deserted.  It seems that\nalmost everyone is at the Colosseum.\n\nThe dog stops.  Looks up.\n\nThen a sound is heard.  The steady cadence of horses'\nhooves.\n\nThe Felix Regiment rounds a corner.  Maximus leads the\ncavalry.  He wears Lorica Segmentata.  His corps of\narchers and soldiers follow.  They troop down the dusty\nstreet.\n\nMaximus and the cavalry canter past the mystified dog.\n\n<b>QUICK CUTS:\n</b>\nThe Felix Regiment moves through the streets.  The few\npedestrians quickly disappear into shops and around\ncorners.  The roar of the Colosseum can be heard far in\nthe distance...\n\nArrows slice into isolated Praetorian sentries.  The Felix\nRegiment continues its stealth invasion...\n\nFinally, Maximus reins his horse and his troops stop.\n\nThe mounted City Guard are waiting.\n\nWithout a word, the City Guard joins Maximus and the two\ncombined forces continue their inexorable march to the\nColosseum.\n\n<b>EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY\n</b>\nCommodus, still swathed in the lion skin, his head down,\nslowly walks out on the platform that now extends from the\nImperial Box.\n\nThe crowd grows hushed.\n\nCommodus reaches the end of the platform and waits for a\nmoment.  Then he dramatically flings off the lion skin.\n\nThe crowd gasps.\n\nHe is almost naked, his entire chiseled body is painted in\ngold.  His eyes are lost in an eerie reverie as he looks\naround at his people.\n\nHe finally speaks:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCOMMODUS\n</b>\t\t\t(serene)\n\t\tRome... This is the day that was\n\t\tforetold.

That I,\n\t\tLucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus,\n\t\tassume my destined place... at the\n\t\tside of the Gods.\n\nThe crowd is stunned.  A few scattered laughs.\n\nLucilla stares at him, disbelieving.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tCOMMODUS\n</b>\t\tAnd as a righteous God, I shall ever\n\t\tprotect you.

ROMAN STREETS - DAY\n</b>\nMaximus continues to lead the combined Felix Regiment and\nCity Guard cavalry through the streets.  The roaring is\ncloser now.  They are nearing the Colosseum, they can just\nglimpse the edge of the top tier over some building.\n\n<b>EXT.

The mounted archers of the Felix\nRegiment have drawn their bows.\n\nMaximus looks down from his horse at a Praetorian Officer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tMAXIMUS\n</b>\t\tThrow down your weapons or we will\n\t\tkill you.\n\nA beat.\n\nThe Praetorian Officer glances at the formidable force\nagainst him.
