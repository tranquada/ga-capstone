APARTMENT - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is\r\n          open.\r\n                         \r\n          The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain-\r\n          clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several\r\n          firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all\r\n          wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses.\r\n          Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their\r\n          way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand,\r\n          the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional\r\n          flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor.\r\n                         \r\n                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE\r\n           (to the superintendent and the\r\n                          NEIGHBOR)\r\n           Wait Outside please.\r\n                         \r\n          He signals to a police officer who herds the curious\r\n          onlookers back out through the door.\r\n                         \r\n                          POLICE OFFICER\r\n           (to the superintendent, pointing to\r\n           a pile of mail)\r\n           What's the date of the last letter?\r\n                         \r\n                          SUPERINTENDENT\r\n                          (VERIFYING)\r\n           The 16th from what I can see...\r\n           Wait...\r\n                         \r\n          The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the\r\n          door on the left. It has been sealed up with adhesive tape.\r\n                         \r\n                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE\r\n           (to the fire officer)\r\n           Can you try?\r\n                         \r\n          While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes\r\n          detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the\r\n          windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via\r\n          the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped\r\n          up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room,\r\n          where he also opens up the windows...\r\n                         \r\n           FIREMAN (O.S.)\r\n           The door is open.\r\n                         \r\n          ...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting\r\n          firemen. Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the\r\n          police officer and the janitor.\r\n           2.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          JANITOR\r\n           ...no as far as I know. During the\r\n           whole time, they had a nurse, but\r\n           it's been a while since I last saw\r\n           her. My wife has been...\r\n                         \r\n          The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now\r\n          accessible. Its windows are open and the draft makes the\r\n          curtains billow into the room.\r\n                         \r\n                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE\r\n           (to the firemen who are now curious\r\n           enough to come and stand by the\r\n                          DOOR)\r\n           Did you open the windows?\r\n                         \r\n          The firemen shake their heads.\r\n                         \r\n          The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed\r\n          placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right-\r\n          hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand\r\n          bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where\r\n          once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The\r\n          corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers\r\n          that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a\r\n          crucifix.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 2 - White letters on a black background: THE CREDITS\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 3 - INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          All we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and\r\n          ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go\r\n          to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once\r\n          everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking\r\n          people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught\r\n          with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the\r\n          lights go out. APPLAUSE.\r\n                         \r\n          Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. THROATS\r\n          ARE CLEARED here and there. Finally, the MUSIC begins.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 4 - INT. ARTISTS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          The music from Scene 3 continues. The soloist is surrounded\r\n          by admirers who congratulate him.\r\n                         \r\n          Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room. (If the\r\n          soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most\r\n          of the others).\r\n           3.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group\r\n          of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly,\r\n          visibly glad to see them.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 5 - INT. BUS - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty\r\n          bus. Anne talks enthusiastically, Georges says something from\r\n          time to time, and smiles now and then. They are both relaxed\r\n          and happy.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 6 - INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the\r\n          outside. THE MUSIC ENDS.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges comes in, turns on the light. He and Anne observe the\r\n          open door. Around the lock, one can see the traces of an\r\n          attempted forced entry.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep\r\n          grooves.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           They used a screwdriver or\r\n           something like that...it doesn't\r\n           look very professional...\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           But who would do something like\r\n           that?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           No idea. Why do people break in?\r\n           Because they want to steal\r\n           something.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           From us?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (laughs briefly out loud)\r\n           Hey, why not? If I thought about\r\n           it, I could come up with at least\r\n           three or four people we know who've\r\n           been burgled.\r\n                         \r\n          After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the\r\n          double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him.\r\n           4.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           What time is it? Can't we call the\r\n           superintendent?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           I'll do that tomorrow morning.\r\n           Anyway, they didn't see anything.\r\n                         \r\n          He unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet\r\n          in the hallway.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Don't let it spoil your good mood\r\n           now.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Or the police?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Come on, give me your coat.\r\n                         \r\n          She goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with\r\n          his in the closet.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Imagine if we were here, in our\r\n           beds, and someone broke in.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Why should I imagine that?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           But it's terrible! I think I'd die\r\n           of fright.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n                          (LAUGHING)\r\n           So would I.\r\n                         \r\n          He undoes his shoes.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Shall we have a drink?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           I'm tired.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           I still fancy a drink.\r\n                         \r\n          He puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his\r\n          slippers. Anne has gone into the bathroom.\r\n           5.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           ANNE (O.S.)\r\n           Go ahead then. Mathilde told me\r\n           that in her building, the attic\r\n           apartment was burgled from the\r\n           loft. They just knocked a hole in\r\n           the wall, cut out all of the\r\n           valuable pictures from their frames\r\n           and disappeared without a trace.\r\n                         \r\n          He goes toward the kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           They must have been professionals.\r\n                         \r\n          As he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears\r\n          to be looking at Anne.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Did I tell you, you looked good\r\n           tonight?\r\n                         \r\n          SHORT PAUSE. THEN:\r\n                         \r\n           ANNE (O.S.)\r\n                          (FLATTERED)\r\n           What's got into you?\r\n                         \r\n          With a gentle LAUGH, Georges disappears into the kitchen,\r\n          where he turns on the lights. We hear him FIDDLING AROUND,\r\n          apparently getting a glass and some wine. After a short\r\n                         PAUSE:\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE (CONT'D)\r\n           Weren't those semiquavers in the\r\n           presto incredible? What staccato!\r\n           Don't you agree?\r\n                         \r\n          Short PAUSE.\r\n                         \r\n           GEORGES (O.S.)\r\n           You're proud of him, huh?\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 7 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Georges wakes up. He looks with amazement beside him, then\r\n          raises his eyes. Anne is sitting upright, her back against\r\n          the headboard.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Something wrong?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           No.\r\n           6.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          After a while, the RINGING of a kitchen egg-timer leads us to\r\n          the next scene.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 8 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The egg timer in the kitchen RINGS.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is\r\n          half set for breakfast. He has mobile phone raised to his ear\r\n          and a phone book opened in front of him. Anne is getting up\r\n          from the table. She goes toward the stove, turns off the gas,\r\n          takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under\r\n          cold water. Like Georges, she is still in her robe.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (on the phone)\r\n           What about next week? No but still,\r\n           it would make sense to get it done\r\n           soon. It might give people silly\r\n           ideas. And anyway, it's too ugly to\r\n           look at... Wednesday? What time?\r\n           OK... Will you bring the paint with\r\n           you too, to paint over it? But at\r\n           least some primer...Yes, OK. Thank\r\n           you.\r\n                         \r\n          He hangs up.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n                          (TO ANNE)\r\n           You can depend on that guy.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           (who comes back to the table with\r\n           the egg) I hope so. The last time,\r\n           he kept us waiting for ages, if you\r\n           remember.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (laughs while acquiescing)\r\n           Yes, that's true. (Reacting when\r\n           she places the egg in his egg cup)\r\n           Thanks. If I call a regular\r\n           professional, we'll still be\r\n           waiting two months time.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           (more to herself)\r\n           Really?\r\n                         \r\n          She has sat down. Looks straight ahead. He cracks open his\r\n          egg, puts salt on it, eats.\r\n           7.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           The Frodons waited three days when\r\n           their toilet was blocked. Not\r\n           exactly pleasant.\r\n                         \r\n          He eats. Wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is\r\n          empty.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           The saltcellar is empty.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal\r\n          with it. As she doesn't react, he realizes the\r\n          inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself,\r\n          heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           I don't know if he's going to bring\r\n           us the CD. Maybe he won't come at\r\n           all. In any case, he didn't mention\r\n           it. I'd like to buy it. It was\r\n           really good and I don't want to\r\n           wait long for it. We could go to\r\n           Virgin this afternoon and buy it.\r\n           What do you say?\r\n                         \r\n          He comes back to the table and sits down again.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Hmmm? Anne? What's the matter?\r\n                         \r\n          She looks at him and doesn't answer.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           What's going on? What's the matter?\r\n                         \r\n          He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Helllloooo!!! Cuckoo!!! I'm here!\r\n                         \r\n          She continues to look at him without reacting.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           (serious now) Anne! What's going\r\n           on?\r\n                         \r\n          He waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly,\r\n          leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her\r\n          turn toward him.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Anne, what's the matter?\r\n           8.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but\r\n          her eyes look through him.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Anne...what's...\r\n                         \r\n          He takes her face in both hands and turns toward him.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Anne...\r\n                         \r\n          She stares into the void. He drops his hands. Then sits\r\n          beside her, for quite awhile.\r\n                         \r\n                         SILENCE\r\n                         \r\n          Finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap,\r\n          wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and\r\n          places it on Anne's face. Waits for a reaction that doesn't\r\n          come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and\r\n          applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her\r\n          imploringly.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           (close to tears)\r\n           Anne...Darling...please!\r\n                         \r\n          Once again they both remain seated. In the background, we\r\n          hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has\r\n          forgotten to turn it off.\r\n                         \r\n          Making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the\r\n          hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress\r\n          agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. Suddenly,\r\n          the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far\r\n          as the bedroom.\r\n                         \r\n          George doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Anne?\r\n                         \r\n          Finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n          Anne is seated in the same place and looks at him.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           What are you doing?\r\n                         \r\n          She turns toward the breakfast.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE (CONT'D)\r\n           You left the water running.\r\n           9.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Georges stares at her.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (both aghast and furious)\r\n           Hey, what's going on?

He\r\n          tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside\r\n          Anne, sits down and looks at his wife. She doesn't know how\r\n          to react.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           What's the matter?

You didn't\r\n           answer me when I asked you what the\r\n           matter was.\r\n                         \r\n          He picks up the wet tea towel from the table.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           I put this tea towel on your face,\r\n           and you didn't react.\r\n                         \r\n          Anne looks at the towel, then at Georges, and shakes her\r\n          head, perturbed that she can't understand. Georges looks at\r\n          her. He sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Look...

Then Georges says:\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (with a nervous smile)\r\n           Where do you want...\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           In the living room.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges pushes her toward the living room door, walks around\r\n          the wheelchair, opens the door, comes back behind the\r\n          wheelchair and pushes Anne into the LIVING ROOM.\r\n                         \r\n          The doorway is narrow. The wheelchair only just passes\r\n          through it. Georges pushes Anne toward the sofa and the\r\n          armchairs and then steps in front of her.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Shall I make some tea?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           (with a faint smile)\r\n           First come sit with me.\r\n                         \r\n          George registers her smile; he knows he's behaving in a\r\n          clumsy way. He sits down in one of the two arm chairs.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE (CONT'D)\r\n           Can you help me into the chair?\r\n                         \r\n          Georges stands back up.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n                          (EAGERLY)\r\n           Of course.\r\n           18.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He extends his hands. She puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts\r\n          the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from\r\n          the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm\r\n          to Georges.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           It's best if you put my arm around\r\n           your neck and your right arm around\r\n           me, that way it'll be easy.\r\n                         \r\n          He does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together\r\n          the short distance to the second arm chair. Cautiously, he\r\n          lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. Because\r\n          they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward\r\n          and clumsy.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE (CONT'D)\r\n           Thanks.\r\n                         \r\n          He smiles because it seems silly to him to answer \"Don't\r\n          mention it\". Then he sits down opposite her.\r\n                         \r\n          LONG PAUSE.\r\n                         \r\n          At first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the\r\n          fact that words do not come easily. After a long while,\r\n          during which we hear the intermittent sound of the TRAFFIC\r\n          below.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (softly almost to himself)\r\n           I'm glad you're back.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           (in a voice just as soft)\r\n           Me too.\r\n                         \r\n          Another PAUSE. Then Anne says:\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE (CONT'D)\r\n           Promise me one thing.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           What?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Please never take me back to the\r\n           hospital.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           What?\r\n                         \r\n          PAUSE.\r\n           19.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          She looks at him. He has understood.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           You promise?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Anne...\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           You promise?\r\n                         \r\n          PAUSE.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Anne, I...\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Don't talk right now. And don't\r\n           give me any lectures. Please.\r\n                         \r\n          Brief PAUSE.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           What can I say, it's...\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n                          (INTERRUPTING HIM)\r\n           Nothing. Just don't say anything.\r\n           OK?!\r\n                         \r\n          PAUSE.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 13 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          He helps her into bed, then throws the blanket over her.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           There.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Thank you.

That would\r\n           be pointless. And a drag. For me\r\n           too.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           I don't feel guilty.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           That's good.\r\n                         \r\n          She smiles.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE (CONT'D)\r\n           Go over there now. I'm not a\r\n           cripple. You can easily leave me\r\n           alone for two minutes. I won't\r\n           collapse.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (with a slight smile)\r\n           OK.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Did you buy the new book on\r\n           Harnoncourt?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           I've already read it.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           And?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Do you want it?

She remains lying\r\n          there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her\r\n          hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the\r\n          blanket that has slipped out of place a little. After a\r\n          while, we hear Georges shouting.\r\n           21.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           GEORGES (O.S.)\r\n           I don't know where I put it.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Don't worry. It isn't that\r\n           important.\r\n                         \r\n           GEORGES (O.S.)\r\n           Yes, it is. Hold on, maybe it's in\r\n           the... Just a moment! Viola! Here\r\n           you are! Nothing like an infallible\r\n           memory!\r\n                         \r\n          She smiles, looks in his direction. He enters with the book\r\n          in his hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           I thought I'd left it over there in\r\n           the other room, but I'd already put\r\n           it away. Tidy people just can't\r\n           help being tidy.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           (taking the book)\r\n           Thanks.\r\n                         \r\n          She puts the book on her stomach. Looks at Georges.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE (CONT'D)\r\n           Right now, take care of yourself.\r\n           And don't wait to see how I hold\r\n           the book in my hand, OK?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           OK.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom.\r\n          She waits till he's outside. Tries to relax. Then she\r\n          remembers the book. She takes it in her left hand and tries\r\n          to open it. It's not easy for her.\r\n                         \r\n          Then she notices that she's forgotten her glasses. She rests\r\n          the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on\r\n          the night stand. In the end, she manages it. Then she opens\r\n          the book again, and tries to read.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 14 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The superintendent's wife puts the filled supermarket bags on\r\n          the counter. Takes the stack of mail that she had put on top\r\n          of one of the bags and puts it down beside them. Then she\r\n          takes out the receipt and the change.\r\n           22.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          SUPERINTENDANT'S WIFE\r\n           Unfortunately the strawberries were\r\n           already moldy.

Bye, Mrs. M\u00e9ry,\r\n           thanks so much.\r\n                         \r\n                          SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE\r\n           Goodbye, sir.\r\n                         \r\n          She heads toward the front door of the apartment, turns\r\n          around again toward Georges.\r\n           23.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D)\r\n           I'll bring you the strawberries\r\n           tomorrow around noon, if that suits\r\n           you.\r\n                         \r\n          He nods, she closes the door as she leaves.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 15 - INT. HALLWAY - TOILET - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          He stands in front of the closed door of the toilet, waiting.\r\n          After a while, we hear the noise of flushing. After a while\r\n          longer, we hear\r\n                         \r\n           ANNE (O.S.)\r\n           There. Can you come in, please?\r\n                         \r\n          He opens the toilet door, goes around Anne, pulls her up, she\r\n          puts her left arm around his neck, keeps herself upright that\r\n          way, he pulls up her pants under her skirt. Then they slowly\r\n          hobble out of the toilet and he sits her back down in the\r\n          wheelchair.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 16 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          They are both lying in their beds. Anne sleeps, BREATHING\r\n          NOISILY. Georges lies with his eyes open, listening\r\n          attentively to her breathing.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 17 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The sun shines in. Georges has cooked something simple. They\r\n          are both in a good mood, eating and drinking.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           ... some banal romance or other\r\n           about a nobleman and a lower middle-\r\n           class girl who couldn't have each\r\n           other and who then, out of sheer\r\n           magnanimity, decide to renounce\r\n           their love - in fact I don't quite\r\n           remember it any more. In any case,\r\n           afterwards I was thoroughly\r\n           distraught, and it took me a bit of\r\n           time to calm down. In the courtyard\r\n           of the house where grandma lived,\r\n           there was a young guy at the window\r\n           who asked me where I'd been. He was\r\n           a couple of years older than me, a\r\n           braggart who of course really\r\n           impressed me. \"To the movies\", I\r\n           said, because I was proud that my\r\n           grandma had given me the money to\r\n           go all alone to the cinema.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n           24.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           \"What did you see?\" I started to\r\n           tell him the story of the movie,\r\n           and as I did, all the emotion came\r\n           back. I didn't want to cry in front\r\n           of the boy, but it was impossible;\r\n           there I was, crying out loud in the\r\n           courtyard, and I told him the whole\r\n           drama to the bitter end.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           So? How did he react?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           No idea. He probably found it\r\n           amusing. I don't remember. I don't\r\n           remember the film either. But I\r\n           remember the feeling. That I was\r\n           ashamed of crying, but that telling\r\n           him the story made all my feelings\r\n           and tears come back, almost more\r\n           powerfully than when I was actually\r\n           watching the film, and that I just\r\n           couldn't stop.\r\n                         \r\n          She looks at him, smiles, then turns back to her food.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           That's cute. Why didn't you ever\r\n           tell me before?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           There are still a few stories you\r\n           don't know.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Aha...? Don't tell me you're going\r\n           to ruin your image in your old age?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n                          (GRINNING)\r\n           You bet I won't. But what is my\r\n           image?\r\n                         \r\n          She takes a mouthful, eats ponderously. Then she looks at\r\n          him.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n                          (TENDERLY)\r\n           Sometimes you're a rotter.

LIVING ROOM - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          She's lying on the sofa. He's seated in the armchair. They're\r\n          both reading the newspaper.

He's back from the funeral, dressed for the occasion.\r\n          He turns on the light. He's wet. Clearly, it's been raining.\r\n          As he closes the door again, his eyes fall on Anne. With her\r\n          back to him, she is sitting on the floor in front of the\r\n          opened window of the light well, half propped against her\r\n          wheelchair.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           What ... ?!\r\n                         \r\n          Shaken, he heads toward her, picks her up and seats her in\r\n          the wheelchair.

Then one of Pierre's\r\n           co-workers made a speech that was\r\n           embarrassingly emotional. His old\r\n           secretary came with a radio-\r\n           cassette player and after the\r\n           speech she put on \"Yesterday\" by\r\n           the Beatles. You can't imagine.\r\n           Everybody turned round to look at\r\n           her. Apparently, it wasn't planned.\r\n           His grandchildren were there. Of\r\n           course they giggled as soon as the\r\n           music began. Then the urn was put\r\n           on a huge stretcher that was\r\n           obviously designed for a coffin,\r\n           and out we went into the rain. They\r\n           placed the urn on a small electric\r\n           cart that crawled along for what\r\n           seemed like an eternity to the tiny\r\n           hole they had dug. A lot of people\r\n           had to stifle their laughter. It\r\n           must have been terrible for Jeanne.\r\n           I have...\r\n           29.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n                          (INTERRUPTING HIM)\r\n           There's just no point in going on\r\n           living.

The soloist looks around him.\r\n                         \r\n          After a few moments we hear the VOICES of Anne and Georges in\r\n          the distance, without understanding what they're saying.

KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - TWILIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Georges has cooked himself a steak and is eating. On the\r\n          radio, we hear the EVENING NEWS. Suddenly, coming from the\r\n          neighboring room, a LOUD CRASH and the SOUND of crockery\r\n          breaking. Stifled CRY from Anne. Georges gets up, irritated,\r\n          crosses the HALLWAY and enters the BEDROOM.\r\n                         \r\n          Anne lies on the floor, beside the overturned night stand, in\r\n          the midst of the crockery and remains of a meal.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (shocked, and hence furious)\r\n           Good God, what are you doing?\r\n                         \r\n          He hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into\r\n          the bed.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Have you lost your senses?!

The\r\n          doorbell rings.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges spits out, wipes his mouth, goes into the hallway and\r\n          over to the front door.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Yes? Who's there?\r\n                         \r\n          No answer. Georges is very irritated. O.S., Anne calls to\r\n                         HIM:\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Georges? What's going on? Who is\r\n           it?\r\n                         \r\n          Georges opens the door. Outside, however, instead of the\r\n          usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without\r\n          a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment. It\r\n          looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment. A couple of\r\n          ladders are propped against the opposite wall. At the other\r\n          end of the room, to the side, is a small door. Georges is\r\n          stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened.\r\n          Hesitating, he crosses the room toward the door.\r\n                         \r\n          O.S., in the distance, Anne's worried voice:\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE (CONT'D)\r\n           Georges? What's going on?\r\n                         \r\n          Georges opens the small door. Behind it is a narrow,\r\n          windowless corridor, as brightly lit as the room. At the end\r\n          of the corridor, a door. Georges heads toward this door and\r\n          opens it too. Behind it is a tiny windowless room, equally\r\n          bright as the others. Everything is very quiet. Georges\r\n          enters, turns round, then goes back along the corridor,\r\n          crosses the room, comes through the apartment door into the\r\n          hallway of the apartment. But it too is now empty and bright,\r\n          with bare unpainted walls, no doors; only the door to the\r\n          bedroom is open. Behind that too, it appears to be empty and\r\n          bright. Georges goes toward it.\r\n                         \r\n          At the same time, we hear GEORGES' VOICE. At first he groans,\r\n          but then begins inarticulately hollering, louder and louder.\r\n          Shortly after, we also hear:\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE'S VOICE:\r\n           Georges, what's going on?\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 29 - INT.

Georges is sitting\r\n          up in his bed, having just awoken, wide-eyed with terror. His\r\n          breathing is labored.\r\n                         \r\n          Anne extends her good hand toward him, caresses his back to\r\n          calm him. He slowly calms down and flops back on his pillow.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           What was it?\r\n                         \r\n          He doesn't answer. Continues breathing heavily.

He comes\r\n          back after a few moments with a stack of albums, pushes away\r\n          the remains of Anne's meal and sets down the first album in\r\n          front of her.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE (CONT'D)\r\n           Thanks.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (a bit irritated)\r\n           You're welcome.\r\n                         \r\n          With her able hand, Anne opens the album, looks at the\r\n          photos, turns the pages, looks.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           That's nice.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (self-consciously, softly)\r\n           What?\r\n           40.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Life...so long...

Georges reads the day's news to\r\n          Anne from the newspaper. When he looks over to her, she has\r\n          fallen asleep. He then puts the newspaper on the night stand\r\n          and turns out the light.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 35 - INT.

He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat\r\n          of the wheelchair.\r\n           41.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           It's no big deal. Come on.\r\n                         \r\n          He lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes\r\n          her through the hallway into the bathroom.\r\n                         \r\n          He lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and\r\n          takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head. She\r\n          starts to SOB inconsolably. He caresses her face.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Come on, darling.

Eva is seated on a chair\r\n          beside the bed.\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA\r\n           ... thinking about whether it\r\n           wouldn't be better to invest the\r\n           money in an apartment block. If\r\n           inflation gets going again,\r\n           property is the only sure thing.\r\n           Right now, savings accounts pay\r\n           1.75% at best. Four years ago,\r\n           Geoff bought some stocks with a\r\n           small sum of money and the whole\r\n           thing collapsed. So now we're\r\n           obviously worried. Unfortunately,\r\n           in the meantime, other people have\r\n           had the same idea, and property\r\n           prices are going through the roof.\r\n           Since we came back from\r\n           Scandinavia, I spend all my spare\r\n           time looking through newspaper ads.\r\n                         \r\n          To put an end to the PAUSE that follows, she adds:\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA (CONT'D)\r\n           It takes time, that's all.

BEDROOM - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          With expert gestures, a nurse shows Georges how to lie Anne\r\n          down and put an incontinence pad on her. She's now almost\r\n          incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an\r\n          object, as tears flow silently down her face.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 40 - INT.

The\r\n          MUSIC suddenly stops. Georges remains silently seated.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 41 - INT.

Sits down on the bed close\r\n          to Anne to feed her her food.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           There, my love, I hope you like it.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           OK...\r\n                         \r\n          He begins to feed her.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           I added a little orange juice.

He wipes it with a tea towel,\r\n          continues to feed her. Finally, after a few mouthfuls, she\r\n          keeps her mouth shut.\r\n           46.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Come on, Anne, you have to eat some\r\n           more. You've only swallowed three\r\n           mouthfuls.\r\n                         \r\n          Anne continues to keep her lips sealed.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Please, darling. A bit more.\r\n                         \r\n          Anne doesn't move. He puts the muesli on the night stand and\r\n          holds the sipping cup to her lips. She drinks slowly, one sip\r\n          after the other. He pulls the cup back between each sip, to\r\n          give her more time. Suddenly she says:\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           ...Mom to the concert...\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Yes?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           ...Mom to the concert... no\r\n           dress...\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Mom has no dress for the concert?\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           ...Mom to concert... no ... uuu...\r\n           no...\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Yes?\r\n                         \r\n          Long PAUSE. Georges waits.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 42 - INT. BATHROOM - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Georges and the nurse install Anne on a metal armchair in the\r\n          shower.\r\n                         \r\n          As she does so, the nurse keeps talking reassuringly to Anne.\r\n          Finally, she turns on the tap.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           (in a monotone)\r\n           Help!

Georges remains standing there, helpless.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 43 - INT.

In front of the nurse, on the table, is a sum of\r\n          money. As they speak, we hear, coming from the room, Anne's\r\n          CALLS FOR HELP.\r\n                         \r\n                          NURSE\r\n           ... we could take turns. She'd come\r\n           from 8 till 12 and I'd do 2 until\r\n           6, or 3 to 7. That would certainly\r\n           relieve the pressure on you.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           I'll think about it.\r\n                         \r\n                          NURSE\r\n           She just has to know in time so she\r\n           can arrange it in her schedule.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Yes, of course, I'll let you know\r\n           in the next few days.\r\n                         \r\n                          NURSE\r\n           Very well. I have to go now...\r\n                         \r\n          She takes the money on the table, pockets it and gets up.\r\n                         \r\n                          NURSE (CONT'D)\r\n           Thanks for the coffee.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           My pleasure. I'll see you out.\r\n                         \r\n          They both leave the kitchen. As the nurse, in the hallway,\r\n          takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on,\r\n          she comments on Anne's continuing CALLS FOR HELP.\r\n                         \r\n                          NURSE\r\n           You mustn't take it too seriously.\r\n           Usually they always say something.\r\n           She might just as well say \"Mom,\r\n           Mom, Mom\". It's just mechanical.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (nodding, softly)\r\n           I know.\r\n                         \r\n          They've reached the door.\r\n                         \r\n                          NURSE\r\n           Goodbye, sir.\r\n           48.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Goodbye.\r\n                         \r\n          He closes the door behind her. Remains motionless a moment,\r\n          then goes into the bedroom, where Anne's CALLS FOR HELP,\r\n          unaltered, continue.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges sits down beside Anne on the bed, takes her hand,\r\n          holds her. After a while, Anne calms down, her CALLS FOR HELP\r\n          become quieter and finally stop altogether.\r\n                         \r\n          After a long PAUSE:\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           (slowly, softly)\r\n           I'd like to hire a second nurse.\r\n           The two could take turns.

We hear the key in the lock. Georges enters\r\n          with a shopping bag, and behind him is the superintendent. He\r\n          carries bigger and heavier bags. Georges holds the door open\r\n          for him.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Would you mind putting them in the\r\n           kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n          The superintendent precedes him into the kitchen with the\r\n          bags.

A pigeon has\r\n          landed on the window ledge.\r\n                         \r\n          It walks to and fro, then finally dares to jump down inside,\r\n          onto the floor. It starts to explore the surroundings.\r\n                         \r\n          We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Georges comes out of the toilet.\r\n          The door opening frightens the pigeon. Alarmed, flapping its\r\n          wings, it flutters about the room.\r\n                         \r\n          After a moment of surprise, Georges tries to shoo it back\r\n          toward the window. But the bird escapes in the opposite\r\n          direction. George follows it.\r\n                         \r\n          He closes the doors of the other rooms. Coming from the\r\n          bedroom, we faintly hear ANNE'S VOICE.\r\n           52.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Georges fetches a towel from the bathroom. He chases the\r\n          bird. He hits out at the bird for so long that it escapes\r\n          back out through the window. Georges, visibly exhausted, has\r\n          to sit down on the chest in the hallway.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 49 - INT.

A few seconds\r\n          later, we hear the front door of the apartment fall shut.\r\n          Georges sits down in his armchair, looks straight ahead. Then\r\n          he lights a cigarette, his hands shake, he smokes.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 50 - INT.

He opens her lips with his fingers and\r\n          tries carefully, but using some force, to separate her teeth.\r\n          Pours a little tea in. The liquid runs out of her mouth.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n                          (ANGRILY)\r\n           Goddammit!\r\n                         \r\n          He puts down the cup, takes a towel and wipes the liquid,\r\n          some of which has run down onto the pillow. He tries to mop\r\n          it up. She watches him the whole time. Finally he puts the\r\n          towel down beside the cup and looks at her.

SILENCE.\r\n          Suddenly, the DOORBELL RINGS.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges, annoyed, puts down his newspaper, gets up, goes into\r\n          the hallway and goes to the front door.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Who's there?\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA'S VOICE\r\n           It's me.\r\n           56.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Eva?\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA'S VOICE\r\n           (a bit irritated) Yes.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges, panicked, thinks for a few seconds.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Just a minute.\r\n                         \r\n          He goes toward the bedroom door, locks it and puts the key in\r\n          his pocket. He goes into the dining room, also closes the\r\n          door leading to the bedroom. He comes back. He is about to go\r\n          toward the front door, but remains motionless an instant,\r\n          opens the door of the toilet that is located just nearby,\r\n          flushes the toilet, closes the toilet door again and opens\r\n          the front door.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Hello.\r\n                         \r\n          A brief kiss hello.\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA\r\n           Hello. What was going on?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           I was in the toilet. Sorry.\r\n                         \r\n          He closes the front door behind Eva, indicates the direction\r\n          of the living room.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Come in.\r\n                         \r\n          Eva points to the bedroom with a questioning look. He shakes\r\n          his head as if to play down the question, and indicates back\r\n          in the direction of the living room, as if to say: \"You\r\n          understand, huh?\". Eva is slightly irritated, but follows him\r\n          into the living room.\r\n                         \r\n          He closes the door.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           Why this unannounced visit?

Why don't\r\n           you answer the phone? After our\r\n           last conversation, I left four\r\n           messages on your answering machine.\r\n           Why don't you call back?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Sorry.

I'm not\r\n           criticizing you. I just don't have\r\n           the time to deal with your worries,\r\n           that's all.\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA\r\n           Dad...\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           No. Let's stop this conversation\r\n           right there. I'm taking care of\r\n           your mother. It's a full-time job.\r\n           And I'm not saying that to\r\n           complain, just to explain why I\r\n           didn't answer your phone calls and\r\n           why I don't want to have any\r\n           pointless discussions on the\r\n           subject. Your mother is just as\r\n           could have been expected: bad the\r\n           whole time.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n           58.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           She is turning more and more into a\r\n           helpless child, and it's sad and\r\n           humiliating, for her and for me.\r\n           And she doesn't want to be seen in\r\n           that state either. Even the last\r\n           time you visited, she didn't want\r\n           you to come. You two have your own\r\n           life. Nothing wrong with that. But\r\n           let us have our life too. Even\r\n           though it's a lousy one. OK?\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA\r\n           Dad, what's the matter?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Nothing's the matter; your visit\r\n           caught me by surprise. And I'm\r\n           annoyed that you show up here to\r\n           check that everything's OK. Who do\r\n           you think you are?\r\n                         \r\n          PAUSE. Eva is speechless.\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA\r\n           I...\r\n                         \r\n          Then she gets up and makes to go to the door.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Stay here, will you!\r\n                         \r\n          She stops short, looks at him.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           (softly, but insistently)\r\n           Please!\r\n                         \r\n          She hesitates a moment, but winds up leaving the living room.\r\n                         \r\n          WE HEAR HER PASS IN THE HALLWAY TO GO INTO THE BEDROOM AND\r\n          HER VAIN ATTEMPT TO OPEN THE DOOR.\r\n                         \r\n           EVA (O.S.)\r\n           Mom? ... Mom??\r\n                         \r\n          Georges remains seated, motionless, until she comes back. She\r\n          seems upset by the situation, as one would expect.\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA (CONT'D)\r\n           Tell me, what's going on? Have you\r\n           gone crazy?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           Please, sit down.\r\n           59.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          EVA\r\n           I don't want to sit down. What's\r\n           going on here?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n                          (QUIETLY)\r\n           Nothing's going on. I want to spare\r\n           us all a pointless drama. I presume\r\n           your mother is asleep. She mostly\r\n           sleeps the whole day. And then she\r\n           wakes up at night. If you really\r\n           want to, we'll go and see her in a\r\n           little while. Now, sit down. OK?\r\n                         \r\n          They look at each other.\r\n                         \r\n          Reluctantly, Eva heads toward her armchair and sits down.\r\n          PAUSE. Then Georges goes on in a quiet voice:\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           We do our speech exercises every\r\n           day, or we sing together. Most of\r\n           the time, I wake up around 5. At\r\n           that time, she's still awake. Then\r\n           we change her incontinence pad. I\r\n           rub cream on her to avoid sores.\r\n           Then, around 7, I try to persuade\r\n           her to eat and drink. Sometimes it\r\n           works, sometimes not. Sometimes she\r\n           tells me things from her childhood,\r\n           then for hours she calls for help,\r\n           and then an instant later she's\r\n           giggling away to herself, or\r\n           crying. Nothing of any of that is\r\n           worth showing to anyone.\r\n                         \r\n          SILENCE. Eva looks down. Finally, she says:\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA\r\n                          (SOFTLY)\r\n           You can't stop me from seeing her.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n                          (ALSO SOFTLY)\r\n           No.\r\n                         \r\n          They remain seated for a moment, finally Eva gets up. Georges\r\n          follows her into the hallway.\r\n                         \r\n          He unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom.\r\n                         \r\n          The bright light from outside filters through the blinds.\r\n           60.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Eva goes over to the bed, looks at Anne. Finally, she\r\n          caresses her face, shyly and clumsily. Anne opens her eyes.\r\n          Looks at her. No movement.\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA\r\n           It's me, Mom.\r\n                         \r\n          Anne emits a FURIOUS SOUND.\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA (CONT'D)\r\n                          (HELPLESS)\r\n           Can I do something for you? Mom...\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom...\r\n                         \r\n          SILENCE.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges has remained by the door. After a while, they both\r\n          leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the\r\n          living room.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges closes the door. For an instant he puts a consoling\r\n          hand on Eva's shoulder. Then he sits down.\r\n                         \r\n          Eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and\r\n          looks outside. Suddenly she starts sobbing.\r\n                         \r\n          After a while, Georges gets up and goes out of the room. Eva,\r\n          vexed, blows her nose.\r\n                         \r\n          Shortly after, Georges comes back. He has another teacup in\r\n          his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           The tea isn't very hot any more.\r\n                         \r\n          Eva turns toward him.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           But it does make you feel better.\r\n                         \r\n          After a short PAUSE, Eva comes toward the table. Sits down.\r\n          He fills her cup.\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA\r\n           Thanks.\r\n                         \r\n          She takes the cup, drinks. Replaces it. Still can't bring\r\n          herself to look at him.\r\n           61.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           It was silly of me to lock the\r\n           door. I'm sorry. You took me by\r\n           surprise, that's all. I'm sorry.\r\n                         \r\n          She nods her head, indicating she understands. Finally she\r\n          looks at him:\r\n                         \r\n                          EVA\r\n           What's going to happen now?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES\r\n           (with a little ironic laugh)\r\n           What's going to happen now? The\r\n           nurse comes twice a week, and every\r\n           two weeks Dr. Bertier and the\r\n           hairdresser come. That's what you\r\n           want to know, right?\r\n           Things will go on as they have done\r\n           up until now. They'll go from bad\r\n           to worse.

So what's hurting you?\r\n                         \r\n          He sits down beside her on the bed. Takes her hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           It's all right... it's all right ...\r\n           I'm here... everything's fine...\r\n           we'll... Hold on, I'll tell you a\r\n           story... but you must be quiet, I\r\n           can't talk too loud, it wears me\r\n           out... Here we go: when I was\r\n           little... well, I wasn't as little\r\n           as all that... it was toward the\r\n           end of primary school, so I was\r\n           about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a\r\n           holiday camp. They thought it would\r\n           do me good to spend the summer with\r\n           kids my own age... We were lodged\r\n           in an old castle in the midst of a\r\n           magnificent wooded landscape... I\r\n           think it was in the Auvergne... I\r\n           don't know... in any case it was\r\n           the opposite of what I'd\r\n           expected... We had to get up at 6\r\n           and go for a morning swim. Not far\r\n           from the castle, there was a pond\r\n           fed by an icy mountain stream. We\r\n           entered it running, in a double\r\n           file. You know, I was never very\r\n           sporty. They had a program to keep\r\n           us on the go all day, probably to\r\n           nip any potential pubescent\r\n           impulses in the bud ... But the\r\n           worst thing was the food. The third\r\n           day after our arrival, there was\r\n           rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice\r\n           pudding. We sat at long tables in a\r\n           huge hall. I didn't want to eat the\r\n           stuff and the housemaster said to\r\n           me: You won't get up until you've\r\n           cleared your plate. So after the\r\n           meal everybody left the room, and I\r\n           remained seated, in tears. I had\r\n           made a secret pact with Mom. I was\r\n           to send her a postcard every week.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n           64.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGES (CONT'D)\r\n           If I was pleased with the place I\r\n           was to draw some flowers on it, or\r\n           if not, some stars. She kept the\r\n           card; it was covered all over in\r\n           stars. After three hours, I was\r\n           allowed to leave the table. I went\r\n           up to my room, got into bed and had\r\n           a fever of 42 degrees. It was\r\n           diphtheria. They took me to the\r\n           nearest hospital where I was put in\r\n           an isolation ward, which meant that\r\n           Mom, when she came to visit me,\r\n           could only wave at me through a\r\n           window. At some point I lost that\r\n           postcard. It's a pity.\r\n                         \r\n          Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story. He still\r\n          holds her hand.\r\n                         \r\n          LONG SILENCE.\r\n                         \r\n          Then Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his\r\n          pillow and presses it over her face. STIFLED SOUNDS from\r\n          Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to\r\n          move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it\r\n          with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's\r\n          movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without\r\n          removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.\r\n                         \r\n          SILENCE.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 55 - INT.

Georges, in city\r\n          clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut\r\n          flowers. He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it\r\n          in the closet.\r\n                         \r\n          The TELEPHONE RINGS. Georges takes the bags and carries them\r\n          in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water.\r\n          He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water.\r\n          We watch him doing so for a while. Meanwhile, the TELEPHONE\r\n          HAS STOPPED RINGING.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 56 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall\r\n          closet. He is looking for a specific dress. He takes some\r\n          out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its\r\n          hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up\r\n          again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He\r\n          takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again.\r\n           65.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Looks at the dress. Then he lowers his arm a little and is\r\n          about to leave the bedroom. He catches his feet in the dress.\r\n                         \r\n          He just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the\r\n          wheelchair that is parked there. Exhausted, he flops down\r\n          into it.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 57 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          With wide adhesive tape, Georges seals up the door frame of\r\n          the bedroom.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 58 - INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING BEDROOM - HALLWAY - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast\r\n          with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for\r\n          reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible.\r\n          Suddenly, Georges starts.\r\n                         \r\n          At the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between\r\n          the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it.\r\n          For a long time.\r\n                         \r\n          Then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the\r\n          kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room.\r\n                         \r\n          On the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. He takes the\r\n          wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen,\r\n          carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm.\r\n          Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it\r\n          over the pigeon. But it manages to escape into the hallway.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times.\r\n          The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up,\r\n          flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light-\r\n          well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an\r\n          exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He\r\n          cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans\r\n          against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 59 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          From the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen\r\n          table, writing. Finally we see what he is writing:\r\n                         \r\n          ... you won't believe it. A pigeon came in, for the second\r\n          time already, through the light well. This time I caught it.\r\n          In fact it wasn't difficult at all. But I set it free again.\r\n          I'm going to ...\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 60 - INT.

O.S., we faintly hear the SOUND of running\r\n          water, and from time to time the CLATTERING OF DISHES.\r\n                         \r\n          After a while, Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n          He remains in the doorway and watches Anne who, doing the\r\n          dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices\r\n          his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually:\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           I'm almost done.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges continues to look at her unwaveringly.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE'S VOICE\r\n           You can put your shoes on if you\r\n           want.\r\n                         \r\n          Georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her,\r\n          goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet\r\n          and puts on his shoes. O.S. we hear Anne finishing her work.\r\n          She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears\r\n          for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has\r\n          got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is\r\n          tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. When she comes out\r\n          again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it\r\n          on.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Thanks.\r\n                         \r\n          They head for the front door.\r\n                         \r\n                          ANNE (CONT'D)\r\n           Aren't you taking a coat?\r\n                         \r\n          Georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from\r\n          the hook and they leave the apartment.\r\n                         \r\n          SCENE 61 - INT.

Eva comes\r\n          into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door.\r\n          Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes\r\n          into the bedroom.\r\n           67.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Anne's twin bed isn't there any more. On Georges' bed lies\r\n          only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes\r\n          through the partition door into the dining room.\r\n                         \r\n          There, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living\r\n          room.\r\n                         \r\n          There too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano\r\n          stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she\r\n          heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the\r\n          table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table,\r\n          turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear\r\n          STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the\r\n          armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room.\r\n                         \r\n          END CREDITS (white on a black background)\r\n                          \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nAmour\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Michael Haneke\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:21.908454"}
