In walks JUDY OAKS-KELLEN (18), a\n          blond haired, mousy girl, wearing only a T-shirt and panties.\n          As she heads to the mirror we hear...\n          \n          Sound of skin smacking against skin and heavy breathing.\n          Whoever operates the camera is definitely CHOAKIN' THE\n          GOPHER.\n          \n          Judy combs her hair in the mirror, oblivious.\n          \n          The camera operator is in a whack off frenzy as he...\n          \n                                CAMERA OPERATOR (O.C.)\n                    Oh, mmph.\n          \n          He's climaxed.\n          \n          The sounds have stopped, but the tape keeps rolling.

HIGH SCHOOL - THE TRACK - DAY\n          \n          Camera shoots from inside a car hidden camera style as Judy\n          runs laps during her gym class. Judy, again, has no idea\n          that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight.\n          \n          She's tired, sweating profusely, and looks completely\n          miserable. She stops running, exhausted, as the other kids\n          pass her.\n          \n          Suddenly, a very Butch looking female GYM TEACHER (40) walks\n          over and begins BERATING Judy. The Gym Teacher's face turns\n          red as she spews insults inches away from Judy's face.\n          \n          We can't hear what she's saying, but whatever it is, it's\n          cruel, harsh, and very intense.

JIMMY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD/KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DUSK\n          \n          Late summer evening. Camera Operator wipes dirt from the\n          lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as\n          he looks at camera. This is the first time we get even a\n          glimpse of JIMMY WRIGHT (21). His looks are striking, even a\n          bit awkward, but not at all unappealing.\n          \n          He throws a mischievously evil look at the lens, then settles\n          his face back to normal. He spins the camera away, pointing\n          it at the back of his house.\n          \n          Through the kitchen window, Jimmy zooms in on his mother\n          (JIMMY'S MOM) (40's) idyllic version of a mom in new\n          millennium suburban housewife clothes. She's on the phone,\n          preparing dinner.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Hey Mom, heard you and Dad doing\n                    the nasty last night. Thanks for\n                    that one. By the way, who the fuck\n                    is Nancy?\n          \n          Camera whips over to JIMMY'S DAD in the LIVING ROOM, well\n          dressed, rich looking and fat in his late 40's, watching\n          baseball on TV, tired after a long day's work. He drinks\n          from a tumbler of expensive scotch neat with an ice cube,\n          munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Hey Dad, Mom's on the phone telling\n                    her friends that you're hung like a\n                    light switch.\n          \n          Dad reaches into his pants to give his balls a good scratch.\n          Jimmy gives the play by play like a baseball announcer.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Oh Daddy, there he goes. He makes\n                    the reach and... yes! Both balls\n                    at the same time! One heck of a\n                    double play!\n          \n          Eyes on the TV, Dad takes his hands out of his pants and\n          sniffs them.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    And the sniff to finish it off.\n          \n          Satisfied, Dad reaches in and grabs a handful of nuts as he\n          continues to watch TV. We zoom out to see both Mom and Dad,\n          each through different windows.\n          \n                                                                     3.\n          \n          \n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Fucking freak show.\n          \n                                                           CAMERA ON:\n          \n          INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Dark and in silhouette, Jimmy flips on the camera by remote.\n          It's too dark to see faces or bodies with any detail, but\n          Jimmy's clearly having sex with a PROSTITUTE in his bed. She\n          is young, black, and looks very much like a prostitute.\n          \n          As he pounds into her...\n          \n                              JIMMY\n                    Do you like that nigger?

With\n          the lights on,   we can see that she's clearly unattractive.\n          Jimmy asks his   questions with a gentle confidence.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Okay, so.

HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT/JIMMY'S CAR - DAY\n          \n          Jimmy hides hidden camera style inside his car in the high\n          school parking lot, bleachers in the distance. School is\n          letting out as he zooms in on Judy.\n          \n          She's looking at the ground as she's taunted by a group of\n          Other Harassing Teenagers, a tear streaming down the side of\n          her cheek.\n          \n          Suddenly, Judy is bashed in the face with a school bag. She\n          falls to the ground, then picks up her broken glasses as\n          camera zooms out to catch the Girl who hit her (Mean Girl).\n          \n                                                                   7.\n          \n          \n          \n          Nearby, a big, Dumb Looking Bully Type (18) taunts her as she\n          cries. His taunts are biting and as excessive as the Mean\n          Girl's, then he dumps a cup of soda on Judy's head as she's\n          crying.\n          \n          Judy screams at the top of her lungs. The group runs off\n          laughing. Jimmy whip pans to the Mean Girl as she laughs\n          with her friends, then whips pans back to Judy, now on her\n          feet, blood running from her nose and onto her white shirt.\n          \n          Camera shuts down.\n          \n                                                         CAMERA ON:\n          \n          I/E. JUDY'S HOUSE - JUDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          A scene we've seen before. Jimmy is off camera videotaping\n          Judy through her bedroom window. We hear him FLOGGIN' THE\n          DOLPHIN off screen while Judy combs her hair in the mirror.\n          She stops when she hears...\n          \n          A Grown Man, (45), walks into the doorway of her bedroom.\n          This is JUDY'S DAD. He comes in and doesn't say a thing to\n          her. Judy doesn't acknowledge him at all and continues\n          combing her hair as though he's not even there.\n          \n          He comes up behind her, then wraps his arms around her,\n          giving her a warm hug from behind. Something's not right.\n          The masturbation sounds STOP.\n          \n          Judy's noticeably uncomfortable but doesn't resist as her\n          Father begins kissing her neck. His hand slowly creeps down\n          to her pelvic area, his other hand turning out the bedroom\n          light. The room goes dark.\n          \n          Camera flips down, then OFF...\n          \n          Then COMES BACK ON AGAIN\n          \n          Once again we're looking through the camera pointing at the\n          window, but now it's the distorted, grainy, black and white\n          of \"Nite Shot\" mode. Though we see the Judy's mirror and her\n          dresser, she and her Father are nowhere to be found.\n          \n          Whatever's going on between them, it's going on out of frame,\n          away from the view of the window.

Judy is bored,\n          completely uninterested in their conversation.\n          \n                              JIMMY'S MOM (O.C.)\n                    So Melissa talked Gary into the SL\n                    instead of the seven series.

Jimmy holds the camera\n          steady.\n          \n          Still she doesn't turn around.\n          \n          She fidgets in her seat but still doesn't turn around.\n          \n          She now sits still on the edge of the bed like she is in a\n          trance, but still doesn't turn around to face the camera.\n          \n                                                                   13.\n          \n          \n          \n          No movement.\n          \n          No movement.\n          \n          No movement.\n          \n          She begins to breath heavily.\n          \n          Then no movement.\n          \n          She leans her head down towards the floor.\n          \n          Then no movement.\n          \n          Still no movement or any reaction for that matter.   It's like\n          she is in a trance and can't wake up.\n          \n          Jimmy (O.C.) continues to roll without budging.\n          \n          Still no movement.\n          \n          It looks like she's about to turn around. She moves her head\n          in the direction of the camera, then assumes her original\n          position facing the TV.\n          \n          Then... no movement.\n          \n          Still no movement.\n          \n          Then Judy collapses onto the bed. Jimmy, still rolling, gets\n          off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor\n          crying hysterically.\n          \n          Judy cries and cries and cries and cries. She then lets out\n          a cry from the depths of her soul. The cry is long, hard,\n          and loud.\n          \n          Jimmy gets up, then stands above her with the camera.\n          \n          She rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into\n          the camera. She tries to collect herself.\n          \n                              JUDY\n                    Why did you do that?\n          \n                                 JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    I had to.\n          \n                                 JUDY\n                    Why?\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    I did it for you.\n          \n                                                                    14.\n          \n          \n          \n                                JUDY\n                      I don't understand.\n          \n          Judy tries hard to stop, but just sobs harder and louder than\n          before.\n          \n                                JUDY\n                      Please tell me.\n          \n                                JIMMY (O.C.)\n                      I felt like if I didn't save you\n                      then no one else would.\n          \n                                JUDY\n                          (screams)\n                      Please turn off the FUCKING CAMERA!\n          \n          A muffled voice comes through the door from downstairs.\n          \n                                JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)\n                      Jimmy!

JIMMY'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY/ENTRYWAY/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Jimmy's behind the camera. He stands at the head of the\n          stairs shooting down. Sounds of a dinner party just getting\n          started come from downstairs. He walks down the steps into\n          the party.\n          \n          A generic \"Happy Twentieth Anniversary\" sign hangs above the\n          front door. Camera pans awkwardly to a lame K-Mart style\n          studio portrait on the wall. It's Jimmy's parents wearing\n          saccharine sweet smiles, Dad's hair slicked back, Mom in an\n          overdone hair-do and in way too colorful clothing.\n          \n          Gifts sit on the entry-way table. Party Guests are dressed\n          nicely and are mingling in the house, drinks in hand. Dinner\n          is yet to start.

Frame moves across a\n          huge mirror on the wall over a cocktail bar.

Walters seems to\n          have a very gentle and nonthreatening aura that suggests he's\n          the type of person you would feel comfortable talking to. He\n          sits by the window in his relatively uninteresting office.\n          Jimmy has turned on the camera in the middle of their first\n          session together.\n          \n                              DR.

Jimmy is\n          catching her seconds after she's has finally composed\n          herself.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Say what you said to me before.\n          \n                              JUDY\n                    I don't know how I said it.\n          \n                                                        19.\n          \n          \n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Paraphrase it then.\n          \n                                 JUDY\n                    Do what?\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Say it like you did before but it\n                    doesn't have to be exactly the\n                    same.\n          \n                              JUDY\n                    You mean paraphrase it.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    That's what I said.\n          \n                              JUDY\n                    I didn't hear you.\n          \n          Judy stares off camera.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Are you ready?\n          \n                              JUDY\n                    I'm waiting for you.\n          \n                                 JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    OK.\n          \n                              JUDY\n                    Tell me when.\n          \n                                 JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Now.\n          \n                              JUDY\n                    You want me to paraphrase it?\n          \n                                 JIMMY (O.C.)\n                           (impatient)\n                    Yes!\n          \n          Judy thinks for a beat.\n          \n                              JUDY\n                    I can't remember what I said.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Then just ad-lib.\n          \n                                                                  20.\n          \n          \n          \n                                JUDY\n                    Ad-lib?\n          \n                                JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Yes.\n          \n          Judy thinks for a beat.\n          \n                              JUDY\n                    I don't know what that means.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                        (getting frustrated)\n                    It means make it up.\n          \n                              JUDY\n                        (confused)\n                    Do you want me to make something up\n                    or paraphrase what I did the first\n                    time?\n          \n          This isn't working.

As camera zooms in further, Judy catches sight of\n          Jimmy's finger on the remote and BLOWS HER FUCKING TOP,\n          leaping from her chair.\n          \n                                 JUDY\n                       God, I hate it when you film me\n                       crying!\n          \n          Judy goes for the camera, struggling to get it off the\n          tripod, she finally frees it and points it at Jimmy.\n          \n                                                                      22.\n          \n          \n          \n                              JUDY (O.C.)\n                    How do you like it, huh?

I'm\n                    used to it.\n          \n          Judy moves the camera directly in his face. The lens is\n          millimeters away from his nose.

When a person is\n                    crying, I mean truly crying, or\n                    truly laughing or smiling or\n                    frowning or gasping. For a few\n                    seconds or minutes I get a chance\n                    to see that person's soul. And\n                    really, now that you've forced me\n                    to think about it. I think it's a\n                    very rare and beautiful thing to be\n                    afforded that opportunity.\n          \n          Judy is shaken and speechless.\n          \n                              JIMMY\n                    Anything else?\n          \n          Judy's moved and forgets herself.

Camera moves and shakes as she\n          hands it over.\n          \n          Jimmy frames her up nicely.

She starts rolling her tongue over the top of the\n          barrel slowly and seductively, then stops. It looks as if\n          she's about to perform full mock oral sex on the barrel of\n          the gun.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    That is SO hot.\n          \n          As she is about to start to move her mouth and lips over the\n          gun, then suddenly we hear a garage door open.\n          \n          Jimmy throws the camera sideways down on the bed.\n          \n                               JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Fuck!

JIMMY'S HOUSE - PARENTS' BEDROOM - DAY\n          \n          Jimmy is hiding in the closet of his parents' bedroom. He\n          has the door of the closet cracked and puts the lens of the\n          camera through the crack.\n          \n          Jimmy's Dad enters the room. He has no idea that he is being\n          filmed and that Jimmy is in the closet.\n          \n          Jimmy's Dad walks over to the dresser, opens up the top\n          drawer and pulls something out. It's too dark in the room to\n          tell exactly what he's pulled out, but it appears to resemble\n          some sort of undergarment.\n          \n          Jimmy's Dad begins undressing, then steps out of frame.\n          \n          After a beat, he reappears. Now he's wearing nothing but a\n          sequined teddy. He's totally fat, hairy, and nasty looking.\n          He sits on the side of the bed, his back to us. Now we see\n          that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of\n          fishnet stockings. He begins putting them on.\n          \n          When he is finished putting on his panty hose, he gets up off\n          the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror. He begins\n          to gently stroke the sides of his legs, relishing the feel of\n          the hose over his hands and fingertips.\n          \n          He seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to\n          get all worked up. He shakes his hips and dances around the\n          room for a few seconds.\n          \n          Now Jimmy's Dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long\n          brunette wig from the back of his top drawer. Putting it on,\n          with the fishnet stockings, sequined teddy and long wig, he\n          has transformed himself into the world's fattest, ugliest,\n          hairiest, Cher look-a-like.\n          \n          Someone else enters the room.\n          \n                                 JIMMY'S DAD\n                    Hi sweety.\n          \n          Holy shit. It's Jimmy's Mom, and she's wearing a leather\n          dominatrix outfit!\n          \n                              JIMMY'S MOM\n                    Are you ready for me, you fucking\n                    slut?\n          \n                                 JIMMY'S DAD\n                    Not quite.\n          \n                                                                  37.\n          \n          \n          \n                              JIMMY'S MOM\n                    I don't feel like waiting. Hurry\n                    up bitch. What do you have left to\n                    do?\n          \n                              JIMMY'S DAD\n                    I just need to put on my makeup.\n          \n          As Jimmy's Mom exits frame, we see Jimmy's Dad go to the\n          mirror. He opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a\n          little makeup bag.\n          \n          Jimmy's Mom re-enters, now wearing a mini leather biker's\n          hat, carrying a riding switch.\n          \n                              JIMMY'S MOM\n                    Come on slut.\n          \n          Jimmy's Dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to\n          the bed. By the way Jimmy's parents are behaving, it's as if\n          they've gone through this routine a thousand times.\n          \n          Jimmy's Mom drifts off screen as Jimmy's Dad gets up on all\n          fours. Suddenly, we hear a SMACK as Jimmy's Mom hits Jimmy's\n          Dad on his ass with the switch.\n          \n          He lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues SMACKING\n          him with the whip harder and harder. He yelps, squeals, and\n          gyrates his hips back and forth, then starts dry humping the\n          air until she stops.\n          \n          Jimmy's Mom comes back through and out of frame. Jimmy's Dad\n          pushes his belly into the bed, groaning from the pain while\n          he waits for her return.\n          \n          She comes back, moving quickly across the screen wearing an\n          enormous strap on dildo.\n          \n          Disappearing out of frame again, Jimmy's Dad gets himself\n          ready for her one more time, ass up, on all fours on the bed.\n          \n          From behind, we can see her hand as she hikes her husband's\n          dress up his back, then we see his face and hear him grunt as\n          she rips his fishnets off screen.\n          \n          There's a pause. Nothing seems to be happening, but Jimmy's\n          Dad is bracing himself for something. His face tightens up.\n          Off screen, Jimmy's Mom has started mounting him from behind.\n          \n          Jimmy can't take it any longer. As he slowly emerges from\n          the closet, his Mom notices Jimmy almost immediately. She\n          jumps off her husband, screaming bloody murder.\n          \n                                                                  38.\n          \n          \n          \n          Camera's shaky but it's easy to guess what's been happening.\n          Mom's just started doing Dad from behind with the strap on.\n          \n                                 JIMMY\n                    Hi mom.     Hi dad.   What are you guys\n                    up to?\n          \n          Jimmy's Dad leaps from the bed and begins shouting. He looks\n          completely absurd screaming at Jimmy wearing his sequined\n          dress and wig.\n          \n                              JIMMY'S DAD\n                    What the fuck are you doing here?\n          \n          Jimmy's Mom goes hysterical and begins screaming at Jimmy's\n          Dad.\n          \n                              JIMMY'S MOM\n                        (to his dad)\n                    I told you he would find out you\n                    fucking freak! No wonder he's a\n                    fucking psycho. Look a his father.\n          \n          Jimmy's Dad is beside himself with fury and throws off his\n          wig.\n          \n                              JIMMY'S DAD\n                    Turn off the that fucking camera!\n                    Turn off that fucking camera right\n                    fucking now god damn it!\n          \n          Jimmy is loving it.\n          \n                              JIMMY\n                    Gee dad, what do you say the two of\n                    us go out to the front yard and\n                    throw some ball together? We'll\n                    have a nice friendly game of catch.\n          \n          Jimmy's Dad attacks Jimmy. He swings at the lens. He's one\n          angry drag queen daddy. He begins strangling Jimmy.\n          \n                              JIMMY'S DAD\n                    You little mother fucker.     Turn off\n                    that fucking camera!\n          \n          Jimmy's Mom rips off her strap on dildo and begins beating\n          Jimmy's Dad with it.\n          \n          Judging from the punishment she's inflicting upon her drag\n          queen husband, the dildo apparently is made from the finest\n          and heaviest of materials.\n          \n                                                                     39.\n          \n          \n          \n                                 JIMMY'S MOM\n                    Stop it!     You're going to kill him.\n          \n          Jimmy's Dad lets go.    The dildo's doing the trick.\n          \n                                 JIMMY'S DAD\n                    Bitch!\n          \n          Jimmy's Mom keeps swinging the dildo at Jimmy's Dad even\n          though he's let go.\n          \n                              JIMMY'S MOM\n                    Fuck you!

She screams\n          at him as she swings her gigantic strap on towards the\n          camera.\n          \n                              JIMMY'S MOM\n                    You little beast! You want to film\n                    something? Film this!\n          \n          She continues to swing the strap on as she walks closer and\n          closer to the lens.\n          \n          The camera goes crazy. Loud sounds are heard throughout the\n          room. Evidently Jimmy has been tackled. We hear wrestling\n          and grunting. It seems that Jimmy's Dad has tackled Jimmy,\n          or maybe his Mom, or both, but the camera is too shaky to\n          tell just what has happened.\n          \n          Jimmy's Dad is still fighting. He seems to have them all\n          pinned against the floor. He's crushing his mother.\n          \n                              JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)\n                    Nancy, Nancy, Nancy, Nancy!

We see a\n          hand go over the lens. Jimmy and his mother and father are\n          all in a wrestling match on the floor.\n          \n          Jimmy with great enthusiasm begins to sing as the camera\n          shakes.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Take me out to the ball game, take\n                    me out to the crowd, buy me some\n                    peanuts and crackerjacks...\n          \n          The wrestling match continues as we see more hands come\n          towards the lens. Jimmy's Mom suddenly stops screaming, as\n          if she's been knocked out.\n          \n                              JIMMY'S DAD (O.C.)\n                    Give me that fucking tape!\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    I don't think so Nancy.   Nancy,\n                    Nancy, Nancy...\n          \n          After some very intense fighting, someone is finally able to\n          shut the camera off.\n          \n                                                         CAMERA ON:\n          \n          EXT. FOREST/MEADOW - RUNNING NAKED - DAY\n          \n          Jimmy has the camera and is chasing a naked (just from\n          behind) Judy through the woods. The camera shakes and\n          rattles, but we can definitely tell this is all in good fun.\n          \n          Judy screams as she is being chased through the woods.   She\n          couldn't feel more free.\n          \n          She begins to tire and slows down. She can no longer run and\n          turns towards the camera. As she turns around, camera shows\n          her from the waist up. She has a beer can in her hand and\n          she is a little drunk.\n          \n          For the first time, she's completely at ease with her own\n          body and looks perfectly natural being naked in the\n          wilderness. She walks towards the camera smoothly and\n          seductively. Her long hair blond hair blows gently in the\n          wind.\n          \n                              JUDY\n                    I'm so glad you're out.

We can hear her breathing heavily as she tries\n          not to cry softly off camera.\n          \n          Jimmy has gone to the rear of the car. We hear the trunk\n          open while Judy films through the windshield at the car full\n          of laughing teens. Jimmy enters the frame carrying a\n          baseball bat.\n          \n          We see him talking calmly to the driver of the car, the Kid\n          who spat in Judy's face. Then...\n          \n          WHAM!\n          \n          Jimmy reels back and clocks the kid right in the face with\n          the bat.

He's bashing in\n          the windshield with all of his might.\n          \n          The teenagers all go running from the car.   A crowd starts to\n          form in the parking lot.\n          \n                              JUDY (O.C.)\n                        (to herself)\n                    Oh, God Jimmy...\n          \n          Jimmy has now completely bashed in the windshield and moves\n          to the front of the car. He now begins smashing the other\n          windows.\n          \n          Now a sizeable crowd is formed. Jimmy is seemingly oblivious\n          to them and continues bashing the car.\n          \n                                                                  53.\n          \n          \n          \n                              JUDY (O.C.)\n                        (to herself)\n                    I love you Jimmy.\n          \n          Now it's to the point of overkill. But Jimmy won't stop.\n          It's as if the rage he's been carrying inside of him his\n          entire life is now coming to the surface.\n          \n          We hear sirens in the distance as Jimmy continues to bash the\n          car. The car is in near shambles as we hear police sirens in\n          the distance.\n          \n          Judy begins screaming.\n          \n                              JUDY (O.C.)\n                    Jimmy stop, please stop.

He pounds the car harder as a police cruiser\n          pulls up. Two policemen get out of the car. They are\n          temporarily paralyzed with indecision.\n          \n          We see one of the officers trying to speak with Jimmy. He\n          just ignores them. The policemen are oblivious to the fact\n          they are being filmed.\n          \n          One of the officers gets out a can of mace and sprays it in\n          Jimmy's face.\n          \n          Now Jimmy is completely freaking out. We hear him scream,\n          but he continues to bash the car with his eyes closed. One\n          of the cops draws his gun as Jimmy swings aimlessly towards\n          them. He gets sprayed again with the mace and is now\n          completely blinded. A huge crowd has now amassed outside of\n          the grocery store.\n          \n                              JUDY (O.C.)\n                    Oh, God Jimmy, oh God...\n          \n          Now the entire parking lot is filled with cop cars. Lights\n          are flashing all around Jimmy. He is surrounded but sill\n          continues to swing the bat.\n          \n                               JUDY (O.C.)\n                    Jimmy...\n          \n          Three cops tackle Jimmy from behind.

The camera is face down on the\n          seat.\n          \n                                                                   54.\n          \n          \n          \n          We hear Judy get out of the car, leaving the door open so we\n          can hear the entire scene with much more intensity. The\n          sounds of police sirens and radios is overwhelming.\n          \n          We hear a woman screaming and more sirens and cars are\n          pulling up. More screaming and sounds on the radio is heard.\n          We hear police chatter:\n          \n                              POLICE CHATTER (O.C.)\n                        (over the police radios)\n                    We're going to need an ambulance\n                    stat at the parking lot of the\n                    grocery store on Route 18...\n          \n          More screaming and chatter is heard until someone enters the\n          car.

GHETTO - COP CAR CAM (FOR VEGAS MOTEL) - NIGHT\n          \n          (From Sc. 37, p. 64) On screen we see something completely\n          new. It's a black and white security cam style video image.\n          Just as the announcer described, this is the kind of image\n          that comes from a video camera that's mounted on the inside\n          of a Cop Car. It's static and covered with date/time text,\n          etc.\n          \n          On TV, we finally get a chance to see what transpired when\n          Jimmy and Judy were pulled over. Judy is standing outside\n          the cop car. The moment she sees it approach, we see her\n          freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and\n          suspiciously. The cop gets up, gets out of the car and goes\n          over to the driver side to talk to Jimmy. After a few\n          moments, he summons Jimmy out of the car while Judy waits.\n          \n          The Cop asks Jimmy to open the trunk. He doesn't have his\n          gun drawn, but he is being cautious, one hand on his gun\n          holster, the other shining on Jimmy's face with a flashlight.\n          \n                              COP\n                        (on TV)\n                    Go ahead and open it.\n          \n          Jimmy stands by the trunk of the car, but he's not really\n          obeying the Cop's commands. He's stalling. The Cop is\n          getting suspicious. We can barely hear what they're saying\n          to each other over the noise of traffic that whizzes by.\n          \n          There's an unintelligible exchange, then... the cop steps\n          forward, raising his voice.\n          \n                              COP\n                        (on TV)\n                    Put your hands on the vehicle.\n          \n          Jimmy's reluctant.\n          \n                              COP\n                        (on TV)\n                    On the vehicle, now!\n          \n                                                                     85.\n          \n          \n          \n          The Cop and Jimmy are sort of at a standoff.    Jimmy finally\n          leans over and puts his hands on the trunk.\n          \n          The Cop comes in close to Jimmy, pulling his hand from his\n          gun holster and shifting it to pull his cuffs off his belt.\n          \n          At that exact moment, Jimmy makes his move, LEAPING for the\n          Cop.\n          \n          He takes the Cop to the ground and off screen.\n          \n          All we see is a barely decipherable image of Judy freaking\n          out in the passenger seat because she can't see what's going\n          on and neither can we.\n          \n          About 5 seconds go by.\n          \n          BOOM!\n          \n          A gunshot is fired.\n          \n          It feels like an eternity, then...\n          \n          Jimmy pops up off the ground. He's got the Cop's gun! He\n          hesitates, not knowing what to do. He pauses, hesitant, then\n          shoots down towards the ground, where the cop is lying out of\n          frame.\n          \n          He runs around the front of the car and into the driver seat.\n          \n          There's a moment of hesitation as Jimmy and Judy seem to be\n          screaming at each other in the car, then...\n          \n          Jimmy slams on the gas and the car takes off into the\n          distance.\n          \n          The image on the TV cuts away and back to the Anchorman.\n          \n          INT.

We    see Jimmy behind the wheel as they drive\n          out of the parking   lot. He's in freak-out mode, afraid as\n          hell they're going   to be caught by the cops.\n          \n                              JUDY (O.C.)\n                    They don't see us.\n          \n                                JIMMY\n                    I know.

Judy, very childlike, opens her\n          arms for Jimmy to hug her.\n          \n          Jimmy leans over, camera in hand, and gives her a hug. The\n          camera shakes and goes out of focus as he's hugging her.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Good morning Mrs. Wright.

Keep looking.\n          \n          Judy drives some more.

Is that it?\n          \n          Jimmy doesn't say anything. He just keeps the camera trained\n          on Judy.

Some live in trailers, some\n          in tents. They watch as Jimmy and Judy drive in. Clearly\n          new faces are of interest to them.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Go over here.\n          \n          Out the window, they approach another trailer.      Clearly this\n          trailer is more important than the others.\n          \n          Outside, a dorky looking douche bag type, BUDDY (20's) talks\n          to some of the Younger People in intense language. They all\n          look over to see Jimmy and Judy approaching.\n          \n                                 JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Stop here.\n          \n          You can hear the excitement in Jimmy's voice as Judy stops\n          the car.\n          \n                                 JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Take it.\n          \n          Jimmy hands off the camera to Judy, who retrains it on the\n          Buddy and the Wunderland Teenagers he talks to.\n          \n          Jimmy gets out of Dinko's car and heads up to him while Judy\n          films. We don't hear the conversation between Jimmy and\n          Buddy man, but clearly he's happy to see Jimmy.\n          \n          Buddy gives Jimmy a big hug like he was a missed relative or\n          an old friend. It's all smiles between the two of them.\n          \n          Jimmy comes running back over to the car.\n          \n                              JUDY (O.C.)\n                    Is that Uncle Rodney?\n          \n                              JIMMY\n                    No, that's Buddy.

Scars and tatoos\n          litter his arms and neck. His eyes are bit maniacal like\n          Charles Manson, but he's able to maintain a stoic, but\n          nonetheless dangerous demeanor as Jimmy begins setting up the\n          camera.\n          \n          Like a prison inmate or rabid dog, you get the feeling that\n          Uncle Rodney could EXPLODE on you at any second.\n          \n          Jimmy moves the camera around the room so we briefly see the\n          interior of the trailer. It's an ELABORATE triple\n          combination of a middle eastern harem, sixties psychedelic\n          motif, and white trash/junk-yard memorabilia.\n          \n          JUST OUT OF FRAME we hear a female voice crying softly,\n          whimpering. The voice is close, in the room with us, but we\n          can't see who's making the sounds. Uncle Rodney ignores it\n          completely.\n          \n          Camera shakes, indicating that Jimmy is exceptionally\n          nervous.\n          \n                                                                 105.\n          \n          \n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Just one second.\n          \n                              UNCLE RODNEY\n                    Take your time man.

RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT - NIGHT\n          \n          Someone (Buddy) is filming a raging party consisting of a lot\n          of strung out young white trash junkies just like the ones\n          Jimmy was interviewing before. It's certainly a weird bunch.\n          They all look alike, dress similar, and have the same type of\n          crystal methamphetamine induced facial expressions.\n          \n          Most of them are smoking weed and drinking forty ounce beers\n          while dancing around a campfire and playing the bongo drums.\n          They all seem to be having more fun than anyone should be\n          allowed.\n          \n          Camera pans to Jimmy, so we realize that he's not filming.\n          Our best guess would be that it's Buddy who's filming. Jimmy\n          screams at the camera over the noise of the Bongo drums.\n          \n                               JIMMY\n                     Where's Judy?\n          \n          Buddy's hand comes into frame as he points by the fire pit.\n          We now see Jimmy see Judy.\n          \n          She dances fervently drinking a forty surrounded by tons of\n          other drunk, happily intoxicated teenagers. Say what you\n          might about the attendees to the event, this party is a\n          FUCKING RAGER and Judy is happy to be the center of\n          everyone's attention.\n          \n          Everyone dances faster and faster as the rhythm of drums beat\n          faster and become more intense. It's an all out jam session.\n          \n          Jimmy heads to the center of the circle of people dancing\n          around Judy. Camera follows him with a zoom as he does.\n          \n          JUMP CUT\n          \n                                                                    110.\n          \n          \n          \n          Who knows how much later. Minutes or hours, the party rages\n          forward. The camera spins around. The party has reached a\n          new level of drunken absurdity. Most of those who are\n          dancing are drunk, stoned or both.\n          \n          In the background, while it's too dark and hectic see\n          anything explicit, some of the teenagers are engaged in a\n          variety of sexual activity. Some have threesomes. Some are\n          probably having oral sex. Still others dance around them in\n          the foreground.\n          \n          Camera zooms in on Uncle Rodney.\n          \n          Standing just behind him, we see of flash of someone\n          recognizable. It's a skinny woman, she looks vaguely\n          familiar, but it's hard to get a fix with all the craziness\n          going on.\n          \n          She turns her head to look over at Rodney.\n          \n          Now we can clearly see that this person is...\n          \n          HAZEL - with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of\n          rolling on crank.\n          \n          AND she's saying something to Uncle Rodney that's definitely\n          pissing him off.\n          \n          Bodies wipe the frame.\n          \n          JUMP CUT\n          \n          Moments later. Camera catches Judy who hasn't missed a step\n          along the way to being a high, drunken mess. The rhythm of\n          the drum beats is ever present.\n          \n          Uncle Rodney comes up behind her and wraps his arms around\n          her shoulder, saying something to her, but we can't hear it\n          over the noise. Jimmy approaches and they start talking.\n          \n          Jimmy doesn't notice, but there are about four or five of the\n          kids, especially a couple of Rodney's Bigger Guys standing\n          not too far behind Uncle Rodney watching the conversation\n          intensely.\n          \n          It's really difficult to put your finger on it exactly, but\n          something doesn't seem right here.\n          \n          Uncle Rodney lets go of Judy and puts his arm around Jimmy.\n          With the noise of the drums and the fact that we're zoomed in\n          from a distance, we can't hear anything they're saying.\n          \n                                                                 111.\n          \n          \n          \n          Now Uncle Rodney and Jimmy are having a conversation as they\n          move towards the camera. Though Jimmy can't see it, we can\n          see that Rodney's Bigger Guys, the ones that were standing\n          behind Uncle Rodney are now pushing Judy along behind Jimmy\n          and Rodney. Though Uncle Rodney seems to be having a very\n          light and friendly conversation with Jimmy, we continue to\n          get the feeling that something ominous is afoot.\n          \n          Finally, they approach camera and we can hear them.\n          \n                               UNCLE RODNEY\n                     I'm so glad you guys came down\n                     here.

Judy loves it\n                     here.\n          \n          Uncle Rodney's got Jimmy in an incredibly friendly one armed\n          side hug.\n          \n                               UNCLE RODNEY\n                     I knew she would.

Before he can react at\n          all, and before he realizes that anything is happening, Jimmy\n          is suddenly thrown into a headlock by Uncle Rodney.\n          \n          Off camera, something similar is happening to Judy.\n          \n                               JUDY (O.C.)\n                         (screaming)\n                     What the fuck are you doing?!\n                     Jimmy, Jimmy!\n          \n          Judy screams his name over and over.\n          \n                                JUDY\n                     Jimmy!

RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - DARK WOODS - NIGHT\n          \n          We hear intense struggling and laughter. By the sounds we\n          hear, we gather that Jimmy and Judy are being dragged off\n          into the woods against their will by Buddy and Rodney's\n          Bigger Guys, but it's too dark to tell if that is what in\n          fact is happening.\n          \n          Someone unidentified is running the show and operates the\n          camera.

It lands right in front of\n          Jimmy. We can still barely see what's going on, but we're\n          close enough and there's enough flashes of light from\n          flashlights to see that Jimmy is face down and bloody.\n          \n                              JIMMY\n                        (defiant)\n                    Fuck you!\n          \n                                                                  113.\n          \n          \n          \n          Jimmy gets kicked again just once.

He's either unconscious or dead.\n          \n          With one last kick, the camera is knocked aside and we don't\n          see Jimmy's face anymore.\n          \n                              RODNEY'S BIG GUY #1 (O.C.)\n                    Is he fucking dead?\n          \n                               JUDY (O.C.)\n                    Jimmy!

Jimmy say something.\n          \n                              RODNEY'S BIG GUY #2 (O.C.)\n                    Get her clothes off.\n          \n                              JUDY (O.C.)\n                        (screaming)\n                    Noooooo! Noooooo!\n          \n          Judy screams at the top of her lungs over and over again as\n          we hear them tearing at her clothes. Then they pick her up\n          and start pulling her away from camera.\n          \n          Her screams get quieter and quieter... fainter and fainter.\n          \n                              JUDY (O.C.)\n                        (extremely faint)\n                    Jimmy!\n          \n          Finally there's silence. The camera isn't moving.    It's on\n          the ground and in the dark. Camera shuts down.\n          \n                                                           CAMERA ON:\n          \n          EXT. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - PARKING AREA - DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT\n          \n          It's completely pitch black dark. We can see nothing.    We\n          can only hear the sound of Jimmy fumbling around and\n          breathing heavily and nervously.\n          \n                                                                   114.\n          \n          \n          \n          BEGIN NITE SHOT\n          \n          Suddenly, we see everything, albeit in a weird black and\n          white grainy fashion. Jimmy's flipped the camera into Nite\n          Shot, using the fuzzy black and white mode as a tool to see\n          in the complete darkness. He's strapped the camera to his\n          wrist.\n          \n          The image is Jimmy's POV as he searches through his trunk for\n          something. Pulling aside a duffle bag, we see the 9mm pistol\n          that Jimmy stole from the Cop. He grabs it as camera shuts\n          down.\n          \n                                                         CAMERA ON:\n          \n          I/E. RODNEY'S WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT/OUTSIDE RODNEY'S\n          TRAIER/INSIDE RODNEYS TRAILER/PARKING AREA/DINKO'S CAR -\n          NIGHT\n          \n          By the fire pit, the site where the teenage drunken of orgy\n          took place, the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens\n          of drunken/passed out teenagers lying on the ground in\n          sleeping bags and in tents.\n          \n          Jimmy begins looking for Judy with his night vision camera.\n          \n          He sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag   with her\n          back turned to the camera. Her hair is identical to    Judy's,\n          but we can't see her face. Jimmy quietly steps over    passed\n          out teenagers, being extremely careful not to awaken   anyone.\n          \n          Jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes\n          a loud clanking sound of glass on glass.\n          \n          Jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking\n          up. No one does.\n          \n          Jimmy continues to walk towards the GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE JUDY.\n          \n          Kneeling directly in front of her, Jimmy puts his hands on\n          her shoulder and pulls the girl's front region towards the\n          camera. The girl flips over.\n          \n          It's not Judy. And luckily, the girl is so severely\n          intoxicated that she doesn't wake up.\n          \n          Jimmy now makes his way over to a tent. He quietly unzips\n          the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the\n          inside. Turns out, the person in the tent is just another\n          passed out flunky loser. Jimmy quickly takes his arm out of\n          the tent.\n          \n                                                                    115.\n          \n          \n          \n          Jimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for Judy\n          among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground.\n          \n          No luck.\n          \n          Jimmy's not too far from Uncle Rodney's trailer.   He decides\n          to make his way up.\n          \n          He walks, using his Nite Shot to see, through the sea of\n          bodies until he gets up to the entrance...\n          \n          OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER\n          \n          There's a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile\n          by the entrance. Jimmy steps around it, turning the lens at\n          the glass. He briefly catches his reflection. He looks like\n          hell warmed over, freshly bruised and cut from the recent\n          beating.\n          \n          Moving forward, Jimmy makes it to the front door of Uncle\n          Rodney's trailer. We hear music coming from inside. Very\n          slowly and very carefully, Jimmy cracks the front door.\n          \n          INSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER\n          \n          It's even darker inside of the trailer, but Jimmy presses\n          forward in spite of that fact, still using his Nite Shot to\n          see. A boom box sits by the bed, still on, playing music.\n          \n          Jimmy is scared shitless.\n          \n          In the corner of the room, in a make shift bunk, is Uncle\n          Rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a\n          spooning position. There's no doubt this time.\n          \n          It's definitely JUDY!\n          \n          They are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying\n          together. Jimmy slowly walks over towards them. Each step\n          is slower and slower, being extra careful not to wake them.\n          \n          Once Jimmy is within arm's length of the two of them he\n          stops. He hesitates for a moment. He hasn't prepared\n          himself for this particular situation and doesn't know\n          exactly what to do.\n          \n          He continues filming them until he finally musters the\n          courage to extend his non-filming arm out to tap Judy on the\n          face. Judy remains unconscious/sleeping as Jimmy gently taps\n          the side of her cheek. Jimmy slowly begins tapping harder\n          and harder until the tap evolves into a poke. Still nothing.\n          \n                                                                    116.\n          \n          \n          \n          THWACK! An arm comes out of nowhere and grabs Jimmy's poking\n          hand. Jimmy has woken up Uncle Rodney!\n          \n          The camera shakes out of control.   Uncle Rodney screams at\n          the top of his lungs:\n          \n                              UNCLE RODNEY\n                    Who the fuck...!\n          \n          Intense and furious wrestling ensues as Uncle Rodney flies\n          out of frame then, in a split second:\n          \n          BAM!\n          \n          A gunshot goes off. We hear a Uncle Rodney collapse,\n          followed by more gun shots. The camera has fallen from\n          Jimmy's hand and dangles by the wrist strap. Camera comes to\n          rest on...\n          \n          UNCLE RODNEY'S BLOODY FACE\n          \n          Jimmy's shot and killed him.\n          \n          Outside, footsteps hit the deck.    Buddy opens the door of the\n          trailer.\n          \n                              BUDDY\n                    Hey!\n          \n          BAM, BAM, BAM!\n          \n          Three more rounds are fired, hitting Buddy square in the\n          chest, knocking him down. Jimmy points the camera at a dead\n          Buddy on his back then whip pans it back to Judy in the bed.\n          Finally we hear Jimmy speak.\n          \n                              JIMMY (O.C.)\n                    Judy, Judy, wake up. Fucking wake\n                    up!\n          \n          Outside we hear voices of some of Rodney's Other Teens.\n          \n          Jimmy acts fast. Judy has been drugged and is mostly\n          unconscious and groggy, but Jimmy picks her up and gets her\n          on her feet, shouldering her out the door. Shot continues\n          to...\n          \n          OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER\n          \n          We hear faint voices...\n          \n                                                                   117.\n          \n          \n          \n                               RODNEY'S BIG GUY #3\n                         (faint)\n                     Hey! Hey!\n          \n          A DISTANT GUNSHOT FIRES, but we can't see what is going on.\n          It's too dark and the camera is too shaky as they go to...\n          \n          PARKING AREA\n          \n          Another DISTANT SHOT, then Jimmy gasps in pain. He's been\n          shot, but decides to run, trying to carry a groggy Judy\n          anyway. Their car is in sight as we hear guns going off and\n          bullets whizzing by them. One hits Dinko's car.\n          \n          Jimmy opens the door, then places the passed out Judy and the\n          camera in the passenger seat, climbs over her, throwing the\n          camera into Judy's lap.\n          \n          We see him scramble to get the key in the ignition as we hear\n          a BULLET HIT the driver's door. The car starts, and Jimmy\n          throws it into gear, flooring the gas as he speeds away.\n          \n                                JIMMY\n                     Judy?   Judy?\n          \n          Nothing.\n          \n                               JIMMY\n                     Judy wake up.\n          \n          Jimmy's voice begins to crack as he talks to/tries to wake up\n          Judy.\n          \n                               JIMMY (O.C.)\n                     Are you all right baby?   Please\n                     wake up Judy. Judy?\n          \n          We don't know if Judy is dead or alive.\n          \n          Jimmy swerves to avoid something in the road sending the\n          camera to the floor as camera shuts down.\n          \n                                                            CAMERA ON:\n          \n          INT. ROAD TO BORDER MOTEL - CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY\n          \n          Close on Judy. The afternoon light strikes a shadow across\n          her face. Her hair's a mess. No makeup.\n          \n                               JIMMY (O.C.)\n                     Judy, sweetie. Come on honey.

HIGHWAY TO BORDER/DINKO'S CAR - NIGHT\n          \n          Judy's got the camera trained on herself.

This is the first time\n          we've seen him at all since he was beaten up by Uncle\n          Rodney's group. He's a wreck. His face is puffy. His lip\n          is cut up. His eye is swollen. He looks like a flyweight\n          boxer who just went fifteen rounds with a heavyweight.\n          \n          He drives with one arm because the other one is in a bandage.\n          \n                                 JUDY (O.C.)\n                    Hey baby.\n          \n          Jimmy looks like a beaten man, both physically and\n          emotionally. His bad ass attitude and rebellious charisma\n          are seemingly non-existent.\n          \n                                                                 119.\n          \n          \n          \n          For the first time, we are seeing Jimmy without his armor.\n          He looks like any other 21 year old kid who is down,\n          vulnerable, and confused. Not to mention the fact that he\n          has a fucking bullet lodged in his shoulder.\n          \n                                 JUDY (O.C.)\n                    Baby?\n          \n                                 JIMMY\n                    Come on.
