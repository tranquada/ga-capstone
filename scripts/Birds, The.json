The CAMERA LOCATES:\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS\n\n\tin the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.  \n\tShe is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, \n\texquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick \n\tsureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, \n\ta mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the \n\tfront door of a pet shop and enters.\n\n\tINT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT\n\n\tMelanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back \n\ttoward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.  \n\tMacGRUDER, comes toward her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tHello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever \n\t\tseen so many gulls?\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\tHello, Miss Daniels.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWhat do you suppose it is?\n\n\tMED. SHOT\n\n\tMrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is \n\tBARKING, o.s.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\t\t(shaking her head)\n\t\tThere must be a storm at sea. That \n\t\tcan drive them inland, you know.\n\n\tThey are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird \n\tdepartment now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor \n\tof innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie \n\tand Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There \n\tis a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls \n\tare lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so \n\tthat the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained \n\tbirds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic \n\tbirds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, \n\tlarger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets \n\tin the bigger cages. As they walk:\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\tI was hoping you'd be a little late, \n\t\tMiss Daniels.\n\t\t\t(apologetically)\n\t\tYou see, he hasn't arrived yet.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tYou said three o'clock.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\tI know. Oh, I know.\n\t\t\t(she is more distressed \n\t\t\tnow)\n\t\tI've been calling all morning. Oh, \n\t\tyou have no idea. Miss Daniels, \n\t\tthey're so difficult to get, really \n\t\tthey are. We get them from India, \n\t\tyou know, when they're just little \n\t\tchicks, and then we have to...\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWell, this one won't be a chick, \n\t\twill he?\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\tCertainly not. Oh, no. Certainly \n\t\tnot. This will be a full grown myna \n\t\tbird. Full grown.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tAnd he'll talk?\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\tWell, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. \n\t\tYou'll have to teach him to talk.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\tYes.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tOh my, I suppose I should call them \n\t\tagain. They said three o'clock.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tMaybe it's the traffic. I'll call.  \n\t\tWould you mind waiting?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(judiciously)\n\t\tI think maybe you'd better deliver \n\t\thim. Let me give you my address.\n\t\t\t(she begins taking \n\t\t\toff her gloves)\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\t\t(producing pencil and \n\t\t\tpad)\n\t\tOh. Oh, well, all right.\n\n\tAs Melanie starts writing:\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\tI'm sure they're on the way, though.  \n\t\tCould I just call?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(with a resigned sigh)\n\t\tWell, all right, but...\n\n\tShe scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie \n\tfinishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the \n\tcounter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)\n\t\tHello, this is Betty MacGruder at \n\t\tDavidson's.\n\t\t\t(pause; accusingly)\n\t\tIt's past three, you know.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tWell, how long do you think...? All \n\t\tright, would you check it please?  \n\t\tYes, I'll wait.\n\n\tMelanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, \n\tshe begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips \n\twith the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding \n\ther. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the \n\tbars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins \n\tBARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER\n\n\tas he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the \n\tsteps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about \n\ttwenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt \n\that.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tseeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of \n\tstrawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.  \n\tThe birds are startled into scarlet flight.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\tas they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little \n\tnod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes \n\ther, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and \n\tthen vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tlooking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of \n\tthe cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI wonder if you could help me.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(deliberately, and \n\t\t\twith a touch of \n\t\t\thauteur)\n\t\tI said I wonder if you could help \n\t\tme.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\ta trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to \n\tinform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But \n\tthen something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea \n\tcomes to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(solicitously)\n\t\tYes, what was it you were looking \n\t\tfor, sir?\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(deadpan)\n\t\tLovebirds.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tLovebirds, sir?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tYes. I understand there are different \n\t\tvarieties, it that true?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWell... yes, sir, there are.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tThese are for my sister... her \n\t\tbirthday you see. As she'll be eleven \n\t\tand... well, frankly, I wouldn't \n\t\twant a pair of birds that were too \n\t\tdemonstrative.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI understand completely, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tAs the same time, I wouldn't want \n\t\tbirds that were aloof, either.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(leading him around \n\t\t\tshop)\n\t\tNo, of course not.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tDo you have a pair that are just \n\t\tfriendly?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI think so, sir.\n\t\t\t(she looks around)\n\t\tNow then, let me see.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(at the finches)\n\t\tAren't these lovebirds?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tNo, sir, those are... redbirds.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tThe sign says strawberry finches.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(airily)\n\t\tYes, we call them that too.\n\t\t\t(she moves away)\n\t\tAhhh, here we are, Lovebirds...\n\t\t\t(and stops before a \n\t\t\tcage of canaries)\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tThose are canaries, Miss.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tDoesn't this make you feel awful?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(baffled)\n\t\tDoesn't what make me...?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tAll these innocent little creatures \n\t\tcaged up like this?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWell, we can't just let them fly \n\t\taround the shop, you know.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI suppose not. Is there an \n\t\tornithological reason for keeping \n\t\tthem in separate cages?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tOh, certainly. It's to protect the \n\t\tspecies.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI imagine that's very important.  \n\t\tEspecially during the moulting season.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tYes, that's a particularly dangerous \n\t\ttime.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tAre they moulting now?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tSome of them are.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tHow can you tell?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWell... they get a sort of hangdog \n\t\texpression.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.\n\n\tThe bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tYes, I see.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tAbout those lovebirds, Miss...\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tAre you sure you wouldn't like to \n\t\tsee a canary instead? We have some \n\t\tvery nice canaries this week.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tAll right.\n\t\t\t(he smiles)\n\t\tShe smiles back.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(he waits)\n\t\tAll right, may I see one, please?\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tas she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries \n\tout of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter \n\twhere she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, \n\tand then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary \n\tcage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(feebly)\n\t\tHere, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.\n\n\tOne of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and \n\tinto the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tOh!  Ohhhhh!\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT\n\n\tas the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and \n\tMitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, \n\tfinally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all \n\tday.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\tWhat is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the \n\t\tbirds is loose!\n\n\tShe joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up \n\tto the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches \n\tthem suspiciously.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tShhh! Shhhh!\n\n\tHe tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers \n\tthe bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tthe canary in his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tThere we are!\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n\t\tOh, good! Oh, wonderful.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT\n\n\tas Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the \n\tdoor.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(putting the canary \n\t\t\tin)\n\t\tBack into your gilded cage, Melanie \n\t\tDaniels.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tstartled.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWhat did you say?\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(savoring this)\n\t\tI was merely drawing a parallel, \n\t\tMiss Daniels.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tBut how... how do you know my name?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(secretly)\n\t\tA little birdie told me.\n\t\t\t(he smiles politely)\n\t\tGood day, Miss Daniels.\n\t\t\t(he bows to Mrs.  \n\t\t\tMacGruder)\n\t\tMadam.\n\t\t\t(he starts out)\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tHey, wait a minute!\n\n\tShe goes after him.

Then:\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI don't know you.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tAhhh, but I know you.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tHow?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWe met in court.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWe never met in court or anyplace \n\t\telse.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tThat's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw \n\t\tyou in court.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWhen?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tDo you remember one of your practical \n\t\tjokes that resulted in the smashing \n\t\tof a plate glass window?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI didn't break that window!\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tNo, but your little prank did. The \n\t\tjudge should have put you behind \n\t\tbars!\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWhat are you? A policeman?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI simply believe in the law, Miss \n\t\tDaniels, and I'm not too keen on \n\t\tpractical jokers.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWhat do you call your lovebird story \n\t\tif not a practical...\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tAhhh, but I really do want those \n\t\tbirds.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tYou knew I didn't work here. You \n\t\tdeliberately...\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tRight. I recognized you when I came \n\t\tin. I thought you might like to know \n\t\twhat it felt like to be on the other \n\t\tend of a gag. What do you think of \n\t\tthat, Miss Daniels?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI think you're a louse.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI am.\n\t\t\t(he tips his hat)\n\t\tGood day.\n\t\t\t(to Mrs. MacGruder)\n\t\tMadam.\n\t\t\t(and he goes down the \n\t\t\tsteps)\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tAnd I'm glad you didn't get your \n\t\tlovebirds!\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(breezily, as he goes \n\t\t\tout)\n\t\tI'll find something else.\n\t\t\t(he gives a slight \n\t\t\tbow)\n\t\tSee you in court some day.\n\n\tThe door closes.

Things \n\t\tmay be different now.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tDifferent?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tWith Lydia.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tDid she seem a trifle distant?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tA trifle.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tThen maybe it isn't different at \n\t\tall. You know, her attitude nearly \n\t\tdrove me crazy. I simply couldn't \n\t\tunderstand it.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tWhen I got back to San Francisco I \n\t\tspent days trying to figure out just \n\t\twhat I'd done to displease her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tAnd what had you done?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tNothing! I simply existed. So what \n\t\twas the answer? A jealous woman, \n\t\tright? A clinging possessive mother.\n\t\t\t(she shakes her head)\n\t\tWrong. With all due respect to \n\t\tOedipus, I don't think that was the \n\t\tcase at all.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tThen what was it?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tLydia liked me, you see. That was \n\t\tthe strange part of it. In fact, now \n\t\tthat I'm no longer a threat, we're \n\t\tvery good friends.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tThen why did she object to you?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tBecause she was afraid.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tAfraid you'd take Mitch?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tAfraid I'd give Mitch.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI don't understand.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tAfraid of any woman who'd give Mitch \n\t\tthe only thing Lydia can give him --\n\t\tlove.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tAnnie, that adds up to a jealous, \n\t\tpossessive woman.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tNo, I don't think so. She's not afraid \n\t\tof losing her son, you see.  She's \n\t\tonly afraid of being abandoned.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tSomeone ought to tell her she'd be \n\t\tgaining a daughter.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tShe already has a daughter.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWhat about Mitch? Didn't he have \n\t\tanything to say about this?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\t\t(apologetically)\n\t\tI can understand his position. He \n\t\twent through a lot with Lydia after \n\t\this father died. He didn't want to \n\t\trisk going through it all over again.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI see.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tSo it ended. Not immediately, of \n\t\tcourse. I went back to San Francisco, \n\t\tand I still saw Mitch every now and \n\t\tthen... but we both knew it was \n\t\tfinished.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tThen what are you doing here in Bodega \n\t\tBay?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tYou get straight to the point, don't \n\t\tyou?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI'm sorry. Forgive me.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tNo, that's all right, I don't mind.  \n\t\tI came up here for two reasons. To \n\t\tbegin with, I was bored with my job \n\t\tin San Francisco. I was teaching at \n\t\ta private school there... well, you \n\t\tknow, you probably went to one \n\t\tyourself.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI did.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tThen you know. Little girls in brown \n\t\tbeanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. \n\t\tI'll go into that classroom on Monday \n\t\tmorning, and I'll look out at twenty-\n\t\tfive upturned little faces, and each \n\t\tof them will be saying, 'Yes, please \n\t\tgive me what you have.'\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tAnd I'll give them what I have. I \n\t\thaven't got very much, but I'll give \n\t\tthem every ounce of it. To me, that's \n\t\tvery important. It makes me want to \n\t\tstay alive for a long long time.\n\t\t\t(she sighs)\n\t\tThat's the first reason.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tAnd the second?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\t\t(simply)\n\t\tI wanted to be near Mitch.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tIt was over, and I knew it, but I \n\t\twanted to be near him, anyway.\n\t\t\t(she smiles)\n\t\tYou see, I still like him a hell of \n\t\ta lot. That's rare, I think. I don't \n\t\twant to lose his friendship... ever.\n\n\tThere is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE \n\tshrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer \n\tit.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - ANNIE\n\n\tat the phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tHello?  Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't \n\t\tasleep. What is it?\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tYes, just a little while ago. Sure, \n\t\thold on.\n\t\t\t(she turns to Melanie)\n\t\tIt's Mitch. For you.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE\n\n\tas they stare at each other across the room, Melanie \n\thesitating.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tHe's waiting.\n\n\tMelanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie \n\tto the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her \n\tthroughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie \n\ttalks to Mitch in the background.\n\n\tAnnie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a \n\twistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally \n\tand irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(at phone; coolly)\n\t\tHello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, \n\t\tthank you. No, no trouble at all.  I \n\t\tsimply followed the road. It's a \n\t\tvery bright night.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tWhat?  Oh. Well, there's no need to \n\t\tapologize. I can understand...\n\t\t\t(pause; she listens)\n\t\tWell...\n\t\t\t(she listens again)\n\t\tThat's very kind of you. No, I'm not \n\t\tangry.\n\t\t\t(she listens)\n\t\tI couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get \n\t\tback to San Francisco.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tNo, I wouldn't want to disappoint \n\t\tCathy, but...\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI see.\n\t\t\t(she is warming)\n\t\tI see. Well, if you really...\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tAll right. Yes, I'll be there.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tGood night, Mitch.\n\n\tShe hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tHe wants me to go to Cathy's party \n\t\ttomorrow afternoon.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI said I would.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tI'll be going, too, to help out. It \n\t\tshould be fun, Melanie.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tIt seems so pointless.\n\t\t\t(she sighs)\n\t\tI think I'll go to sleep. This has \n\t\tbeen a busy day.\n\t\t\t(picking up her paper \n\t\t\tbag)\n\t\tMy luggage.\n\n\tShe smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tPretty. Did you get that at \n\t\tBrinkmeyer's?\n\n\tMelanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent \n\tfor a moment, pensive. Then:\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tDo you think I should go?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tThat's up to you.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tIt's really up to Lydia, isn't it?\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tNever mind Lydia. Do you want to go?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(firmly)\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tThen go.\n\n\tThe room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tThank you, Annie.\n\n\tSuddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, \n\tstartling them both.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\t\t(rising)\n\t\tWho can that be at this hour?\n\t\t\t(she walks to door)\n\t\tWho is it?\n\t\t\t(no answer)\n\t\tIs someone there?\n\n\tMelanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks \n\tthe door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.  \n\tThere is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\t\t(to the emptiness \n\t\t\toutside)\n\t\tIs anyone there?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(pointing to the ground)\n\t\tLook.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - ANNIE\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\t\t(sympathetically)\n\t\tOhhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably \n\t\tlost his way in the dark.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\twho stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up.  \n\tAnd then, slowly:\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tBut... it isn't dark, Annie.  There's \n\t\ta full moon.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE\n\n\tas Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and \n\tconsternation:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  FADE OUT\n\n\tFADE IN\n\n\tHIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with \n\tballoons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. \n\tThe children, in party clothes, with their parents, are \n\tclustered around a long folding table upon which are \n\tsandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either \n\thelping the children to more or telling them they are having \n\ttoo much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and \n\tLAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, \n\tare Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and \n\taway from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin \n\tbend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the \n\tentrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. \n\tThe CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, \n\tthe party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the \n\tCAMERA out to the left.\n\n\tCLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES\n\n\tMelanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and \n\tstand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one \n\tof his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one \n\tof the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI really shouldn't have any more.  \n\t\tI'm a little tipsy already.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI'm trying to get you to stay for \n\t\tdinner. We're going to have a lot of \n\t\troast left over.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI couldn't possibly. I have to get \n\t\tback.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(with a shrug)\n\t\tCheers.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tCheers.\n\n\tThey drink.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWhat's in this? Nitro-glycerin?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWhy do you have to rush off? What's \n\t\tso important in San Francisco?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWell... I have to get to work tomorrow \n\t\tmorning, for one thing.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(surprised)\n\t\tYou have a job?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(sipping at the martini)\n\t\tI have several jobs.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWhat do you do?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI do different things on different \n\t\tdays.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tLike what?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(hesitating)\n\t\tOn Mondays and Wednesdays, I work \n\t\tfor the Travelers' Aid. At the \n\t\tairport.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tHelping travelers.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tYes.\n\n\tShe hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really \n\tconsidered before what she does with her time, and now that \n\tshe is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and \n\tunimportant.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tAnd on Tuesdays, I take a course in \n\t\tGeneral Semantics at Berkeley.  That's \n\t\tnot a job, of course. I just take it \n\t\tbecause...\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWhat about Thursdays and Fridays?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tOn Thursdays I have my meeting and \n\t\tlunch.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI'm chairman of a group that's sending \n\t\ta little Korean boy through school.  \n\t\tWe plan how to raise funds and... \n\t\tthings like that.\n\t\t\t(she shrugs)\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tAnd Fridays? What do you do then?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tNothing.\n\t\t\t(she smiles)\n\t\tI go to bird shops on Fridays.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI'm glad you do.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tDo you know what I was doing in that \n\t\tshop?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. \n\t\tShe's seventy years old, and veddy \n\t\tprim and strait-laced.\n\t\t\t(she does an imitation)\n\t\tShe's coming back from Europe at the \n\t\tend of the month, and I'm going to \n\t\tgive her a myna bird that'll talk to \n\t\ther.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWhat'll it say?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(facetiously)\n\t\tYou'll think me very bold, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tNo, tell me.\n\n\tShe leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out \n\tLAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into \n\tMelanie's face.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tserious, introspective.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tThat's silly, isn't it?  Teaching a \n\t\tbird to shock my aunt. That's just \n\t\tsilly and childish.\n\t\t\t(slight pause)\n\t\tMaybe I ought to go join the other \n\t\tchildren.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\tas she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where \n\tthe children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch \n\tstares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse \n\tof character, and then follows her down the dune. The children \n\tare all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold \n\tfrom Michele to Cathy.\n\n\tCAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\tThe CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We \n\tsee Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by \n\tway of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they \n\treach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of \n\tthe dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS \n\tOFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the \n\tchildren. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from \n\tMichele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back.  During \n\tthis, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes \n\tof Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is \n\twatching Mitch and Melanie.\n\n\tMITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - ANNIE\n\n\tCAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this \n\tmoment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday \n\tcake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also \n\tcatches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat \n\tas she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple. \n\tDuring this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy \n\toff.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\tAll right then, here we go.\n\t\t\t(she spins her)\n\t\tOnce!\n\t\t\t(she spins her again)\n\t\tTwice!\n\t\t\t(she spins her again)\n\t\tThree! Go get 'em, Cathy!\n\n\tShe says all this while still looking toward the couple. She \n\tturns her head away from the couple with a new expression on \n\ther face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as \n\tthough she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees.  \n\tSuddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:\n\n\t\t\t\tLITTLE BOY (O.S.)\n\t\tLook! Look!\n\n\tAnnie swings round and the CAMERA RUSHES INTO her face as \n\tshe looks up.\n\n\tLONG SHOT - ANNIE'S P.O.V.\n\n\tA gull is swooping down.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - CATHY\n\n\tas she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously \n\treaches out in front of her at the air. The gull suddenly \n\tswoops at her, hitting her shoulder. She whirls.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY\n\t\tNo touching allowed!\n\n\tShe almost falls.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE GULL\n\n\tseen from Cathy's position. He flies off, cycles and then \n\treturns.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - ANNIE\n\n\treacting to gull. She turns her head back to Cathy.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\treacting to the gull hitting Cathy. They start towards Cathy.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - ANNIE\n\n\twith Cathy and the children around. The CAMERA PANS DOWN as \n\tshe ducks with two gulls swooping by.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA\n\n\thurriedly putting the cake onto the table. She rushes round \n\tto the front of it.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - ANNIE - LYDIA'S P.O.V.\n\n\tAnnie rising from the ground. Cathy and the other children \n\tare running in the background.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA\n\n\treacting to two more gulls diving.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - TWO GULLS - LYDIA'S P.O.V.\n\n\tdiving toward the children.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA\n\n\tShe starts to run out CAMERA RIGHT.\n\n\tMED.

A puzzled look crosses his face. He turns to \n\tMelanie.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tAre you all right?\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNIE\n\t\t\t(coming over)\n\t\tThat's the darnest thing thing I've \n\t\tever seen in my life.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tAre they gone?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tThey're gone, Mother.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE LAWN\n\n\tas the children begin drifting back toward the table and the \n\tcake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck \n\tvery close by without having injured anyone. All that \n\tadrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tWell... well, is everyone all right?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(with a small boy)\n\t\tI think he got a little scratch, \n\t\tMother.\n\n\t\t\t\tGIRL #3\n\t\tDid you see them?

The engine starts, she \n\tbacks the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway,\n\n\tCAMERA FOLLOWING.  CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA\n\n\tat the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE TRUCK\n\n\tat breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the \n\thighway.

I was just taking her in some \n\t\ttea.\n\n\tHe goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses \n\ther hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to \n\thim fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tBe careful. Please.\n\n\tShe walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss -- a long, \n\tfull kiss.\n\n\tFULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN\n\n\tas Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and \n\tthen picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his \n\tcar starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen, \n\tthrough the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on \n\tthe other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA (O.S.)\n\t\tMitch?\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM\n\n\tThis is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a \n\tlife no longer valid.  There are photographs of her dead \n\thusband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of \n\tMitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct \n\tfemininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing \n\tthe tray.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tNo, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought \n\t\tyou might like some tea.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tOh, thank you.\n\n\tThere is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed, \n\tarranges the pillows behind Lydia.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tWhere's Mitch?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tAl Malone wanted him out at the \n\t\tFawcett farm.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tWhy?

At the school.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tat the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression \n\tclearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all \n\tright. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting \n\tsmile on her face, and her voice is soothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tYes, I'm sure she's fine.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND LYDIA\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tDo I sound foolish to you?\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tI keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.\n\t\t\t(she shudders)\n\t\tThey have such big windows at the \n\t\tschool.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tAll the windows were broken.

TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT\n\n\tA very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the \n\ttown rushing around the car park and the streets across the \n\thighway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see \n\tautomobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil \n\tsmoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the \n\tparked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and \n\thave trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the \n\tforeground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill \n\twith wheeling gulls.

Through the streaming window \n\tshe sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the \n\tleft we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its \n\tpalomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and \n\tleaping and kicking its van to pieces.\n\n\tAt this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of \n\ta man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows.  \n\tHis face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are \n\tcovered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight.  \n\tMelanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides \n\tTown. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter, \n\tthe owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and \n\twaving the birds away from them with flailing arms.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\topens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of \n\trecognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls \n\tcrash around the booth causing her to go back.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - MELANIE IN PROFILE\n\n\tlooking out again toward Mitch.\n\n\tEXT. TIDES TOWN\n\n\tThrough window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction \n\twhile Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning \n\tbuilding adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station. \n\tMitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the \n\tsmoking building.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - MELANIE\n\n\tlooking across in horror.\n\n\tLONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING\n\n\tFor a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly \n\tMitch appears with the small child at the window. He calls \n\tdown. One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office, \n\tanother from the Tides Restaurant. They both wait below the \n\twindow as Mitch drops the child.\n\n\tFLASH - MELANIE\n\n\twatching this breathlessly.\n\n\tCLOSER SHOT\n\n\tThe moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up.  \n\tHe slams the window as two or three birds crash into the \n\twindows. They disappear into the building.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - MELANIE\n\n\tholding her breath.\n\n\tLONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING\n\n\tNo sign of Mitch.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - MELANIE\n\n\tgetting more desperate.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - BUILDING\n\n\tNo sign of Mitch. Suddenly a chair flies through the window \n\tand Mitch climbs OUT and drops to the ground.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\topening the door of the booth, yells out to him.\n\n\tLONG SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tsees her and starts running toward the booth.\n\n\tHIGH SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tbeating his way through the birds. He reaches the booth.\n\n\tLOW SHOT\n\n\tclose to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag \n\tMelanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the \n\tCAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.\n\n\tINT. THE TIDES\n\n\tThere must be at least twenty people all looking toward the \n\twindows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The \n\tCAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very \n\thurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside.  \n\tThere is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can \n\thear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a \n\twoman's voice SCREAMS out:\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tWhy are they doing it?! Why are they \n\t\tdoing it...?!\n\n\tSome of the heads of the group turn.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT\n\n\tIt is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs.  \n\tBundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and \n\thelpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some \n\twords.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BUNDY\n\t\t\t([Mrs. Bundy offers a \n\t\t\tweak explanation of \n\t\t\twhy the birds could \n\t\t\thave gone berserk \n\t\t\tlike this. This \n\t\t\tinformation should \n\t\t\tbe obtained from Dr. \n\t\t\tStager.])\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\tlooking across at this slight scene. They turn back and over \n\ttheir shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(looking up)\n\t\tI think they're going.\n\n\tMelanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud \n\tCRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT\n\n\tAnd past the heads of the other people who have also turned, \n\twe see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has \n\tgone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who \n\tare on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the \n\twindow, beating them out. They succeed in doing this.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\tThey turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the \n\tstreet.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI think it's safe to get out now.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tDon't let's take any chances.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWe've got to get Cathy.\n\n\tThey open the door and make their way out into the street, \n\trunning and looking about them desperately.\n\n\tEXT. BODIGA STREET\n\n\tThere are one or two gulls flying around. Others are perched \n\ton roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the \n\tsidewalk.\n\n\tEXT. BODIGA STREET\n\n\tThere are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as \n\tthey move along past the last street and come into the more \n\tcountrified part of the town.\n\n\tLONG SHOT - THE SCHOOL YARD\n\n\tWe see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which \n\twe see in the distance. There are some birds perched on the \n\tschool roof.\n\n\tSIDE-ON DOLLY SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\tgoing up the school road. He stops for a moment and looks \n\tup, Melanie following his look.\n\n\tSKY SHOT - FULL\n\n\tof wheeling gulls.\n\n\tSIDE-ON CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO\n\n\tThey move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the \n\tschool. Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt.\n\n\tLONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE - FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT\n\n\tThere are a few blackbirds on it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE'S VOICE\n\t\tLook... the crows again.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - THE TWO\n\n\tMitch starts off. Melanie restrains him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tCareful, Mitch. The crows may be \n\t\tback in the play yard.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - THE TWO\n\n\tThey advance cautiously. When they are level with the play \n\tyard, we see what they see.\n\n\tMED. SHOT\n\n\tTHE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of \n\tcrows.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT\n\n\tThey walk stealthily past.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT\n\n\tCAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT\n\n\tShooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they \n\tapproach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over \n\ther shoulder toward the crows.\n\n\tEXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE\n\n\tMelanie and Mitch arrive. They come to a sudden stop.\n\n\tLONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE\n\n\tA woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the \n\tdoor.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tHe reaches the body. He rolls it over.\n\n\tQUICK CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE\n\n\tdead.\n\n\tQUICK CLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tThe shock registering on his face.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\trealizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment \n\twhat Mitch's reaction will be.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.\n\n\tHe kneels silently by the body. Gently, he touches Annie's \n\tface, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket \n\tand covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to \n\tkeep her warm. He turns away then.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - THE WINDOW\n\n\twith its ROOM TO LET sign. Cathy is standing near the sign, \n\twith her eyes peering at something outside.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tturning to follow Cathy's gaze.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MIXED BIRDS\n\n\tMalevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE ROAD\n\n\tAs in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at \n\tthe birds. Melanie dashes forward.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(as the birds flutter \n\t\t\tinto the air)\n\t\tMitch! Don't!\n\n\tShe runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he \n\tmaniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are \n\tnow hovering flight.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tPlease! Get Cathy!  Let's get out of \n\t\there!\n\n\tHer words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the \n\thouse and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a \n\tstate of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds \n\tCathy to her.\n\n\tCLOSER THREE SHOT\n\n\tas Melanie looks anxiously toward the house.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tMitch, you can't leave her out there.\n\n\tHe GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder \n\tis the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and \n\tthen a door is CLOSED.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.\n\n\tWe see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer \n\tin the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA.\n\n\tMED. SHOT\n\n\tHe joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the \n\tthree of them as they silently make their way past the crows \n\tonce more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out \n\tcautiously to the right.\n\n\tMED. SHOT\n\n\tCAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again.\n\n\tBACK TO THE DOLLY SHOT OF THE THREE\n\n\tThey move forward stealthily, CAMERA AHEAD of them.\n\n\tMED.

The car turns into the \n\tCAMERA and goes down the school road.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR\n\n\tMitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the CAMERA, tensely. Melanie \n\tlooks over her shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(holding her breath)\n\t\tI don't think they're coming.\n\n\tCathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes \n\twide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then \n\tsuddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as \n\tthe CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY\n\t\tOn our way back from taking Michele \n\t\thome... we... we heard the explosion \n\t\tand went outside to... see what... \n\t\twhat it was.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tAll at once the... the birds were \n\t\teverywhere.

The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings \n\tto brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues \n\tlow over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting \n\tthere patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, \n\tnot a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the \n\tBrenner house in the distance.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE\n\n\tBehind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed \n\tacross the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two \n\tattic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.\n\n\tLONG SHOT - THE BAY\n\n\tcovered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is \n\tstill smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tpicking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where \n\tthe ladder leans against the side of the house.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE HOUSE\n\n\tas Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner, \n\tcarrying a load of driftwood and old lumber.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\tas she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She \n\tis looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is \n\tnot the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her \n\thair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked \n\twith soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there \n\tis a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she \n\tstands looking toward the distant smoldering town.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tThe town looks clear.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tThe bay doesn't.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tHow long have they been gathering \n\t\tthere?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tThe past fifteen minutes.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tIt seems to be a pattern, doesn't \n\t\tit? They strike and disappear, and \n\t\tthen they start massing again.\n\n\tMelanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI keep thinking of Annie.\n\t\t\t(she squeezes her \n\t\t\teyes shut)\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(after a long pause)\n\t\tIt... it doesn't look very different, \n\t\tdoes it?

This is our \n\t\tguide for the present and our vision \n\t\tfor the future -- a free community \n\t\tof nations, independent but \n\t\tinterdependent, uniting north and \n\t\tsouth, east and west, in one great \n\t\tfamily of man, outgrowing and \n\t\ttranscending the hates and fears \n\t\tthat rend our age.  We will not reach \n\t\tthat goal today or tomorrow.  We may \n\t\tnot reach it in our lifetime.  But \n\t\tthe quest is the great adventure of \n\t\tour century.  We sometimes chafe at \n\t\tthe burdens of our obligations, the \n\t\tcomplexity of our decisions, the \n\t\tagony of our choices, but there is \n\t\tno comfort or security for us in \n\t\tevasion, no solution in abdication, \n\t\tno relief in irresponsibility.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tIn assuming the tasks of the \n\t\tPresidency, I said that few \n\t\tgenerations, in all history, had \n\t\tbeen granted the role of being the \n\t\tgreat defender of freedom in its \n\t\thour of maximum danger.

THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. \n\tInterspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, \n\tis the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section \n\tentering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the \n\troof.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA\n\n\tlooking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She \n\tsqueezes her eyes shut.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE\n\n\tas the child cuddles up into her arms. Over the other sounds, \n\tthere comes a NEW SOUND, the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat\n\n\tof a woodpecker. It stops. It begins again. Rat-tat-tat tattat-\n\ttat. Tat-\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY\n\t\t\t(in terror)\n\t\tI'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I \n\t\twant to throw...\n\n\tHer face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI'll go with you.\n\n\tThey leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR \n\tCathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling \n\tof wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of \n\tbirds striking the house.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE ROOM\n\n\tMitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the \n\tbirds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his \n\twatch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back \n\tdoor. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the \n\tdining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS\n\n\twatching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?  \n\tHe cannot tell.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tlooking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a \n\tNEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing \n\tsound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tcoming into the entry hall.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR\n\n\tThe wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside \n\tassail the door.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tturning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining \n\troom. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it \n\ttoward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and \n\tpiles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, \n\tCAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags \n\tit to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table \n\twhen Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with \n\talarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is \n\tand then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of \n\tdesperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The \n\tCLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din \n\tnow, insidious and increasingly more frightening.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWhen will they stop?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI thought they'd have stopped by \n\t\tnow.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tWhat time is it?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tAlmost two a.m.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tYou must be exhausted.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tHow about you?\n\n\tShe shakes her head. They both move into the dining room, \n\tthe CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their \n\tcage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready \n\tto carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the \n\tchair, goes to the cage.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tlooking at the birds, wondering.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS\n\n\tlooking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their \n\texpressions. Malice or benevolence?\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tHe raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS\n\n\twatching, unmoving.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER\n\n\tas he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.  \n\tOne of them tweets.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI wonder if Cathy fed them.\n\n\tHe turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, \n\ttakes out a small box of bird feed.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE\n\n\tas his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.  \n\tHis hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the \n\tsmall catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.  \n\tCautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.  \n\tThe birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the \n\tsmall feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it \n\tin the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, \n\ttweeting, they begin to eat.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM\n\n\tas Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped \n\tagainst the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.  \n\tWearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling, \n\tpecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(holding her)\n\t\tYou should have left when you wanted \n\t\tto.\n\n\tShe shakes her head.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tYou'd have been safe in San Francisco.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI don't want to be safe. I want to \n\t\tbe with you.\n\n\tThere is something pathetically comic about her voice, like \n\ta small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, \n\tMitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand \n\tin each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of \n\tnight sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(in the darkness)\n\t\tThe power.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tMitch...\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWait here. Don't move.\n\n\tThe screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the \n\tblackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the \n\tSOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes \n\ton.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n\n\tas he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as \n\the directs the beam upwards.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWe'd better light some of those lamps.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tNo... wait.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tHold me.\n\n\tIn the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is \n\talmost black in the room except for the strange effect of \n\tthe flashlight as he holds it behind her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI think they're easing off.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM\n\n\tA kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the \n\tfire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep \n\ton the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs.  \n\tMitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly \n\tand steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer \n\tthe sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another \n\tSOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a \n\tsteady dribbling, difficult to place.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tlistening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(whispering)\n\t\tMitch?\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tas she turns toward him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(still whispering)\n\t\tMitch?\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tasleep.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tseeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming \n\tfrom somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, \n\tpicks up a very long flashlight.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tas she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the \n\tentry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled \n\tagainst the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into \n\tthe kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam \n\ton the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor \n\toutside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, \n\tgoes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's \n\tall right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second \n\tbedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tclimbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first \n\tdoor upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light \n\ton the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, \n\tgoes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to \n\tthe windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back \n\ttoward the door when she stops.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tlooking.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR\n\n\ta pile of chipped and broken plaster.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tturning the flashlight up toward the ceiling.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING\n\n\tA huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tturning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face, \n\tand suddenly, her eyes open wide.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - AN OWL\n\n\tsitting in the darkness, staring at her.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\treacting.\n\n\tQUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL\n\n\twings spread in the beam of light.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tbacking to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering \n\tback, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE CEILING\n\n\ta swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward \n\ther.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tin the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds \n\tattack her.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tin the room, as the owl hits her full in the face.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tswinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH (O.S.)\n\t\tMelanie!\n\n\tFULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS\n\n\tgrotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is \n\ta crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering \n\twings.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH (O.S.)\n\t\tMelanie, open the door!\n\n\tHe hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie \n\tstruggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed \n\tby the birds.\n\n\tShe falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the \n\tspreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering \n\tof wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault \n\ton the door by Mitch outside.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tMitch, get her out of there!\n\n\tMED. SHOT - THE ROOM\n\n\tMelanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in \n\tview. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see \n\ton the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH (O.S.)\n\t\tMelanie!\n\n\tThe door begins to open.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tas the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room.  He \n\tbegins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for \n\tMelanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins \n\tdragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been \n\tshredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.  \n\tWe catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch \n\tpulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut \n\tbehind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at \n\tthe few birds that have escaped into the corridor.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tMother, get a rope!\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tOh, my God, look at her!\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(shouting)\n\t\tGet a rope!\n\n\tShe rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds.  \n\tThere is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He \n\twill not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his \n\thand, knocking the club from it.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tas the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his \n\thands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob.  \n\tAnother bird flutters into the corridor.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tin anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his \n\thands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and \n\tis immediately attacked by the other bird.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(yelling)\n\t\tMother! Hurry!\n\n\tTWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH\n\n\tas she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a \n\theavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily \n\tto the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and \n\tcompassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the \n\tdoorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to \n\tthe bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to \n\tMelanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia \n\tfollowing. As they go downstairs:\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tCathy! Get a blanket and some \n\t\tbandages!\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY\n\t\t\t(at the foot of the \n\t\t\tstars, on the verge \n\t\t\tof tears)\n\t\tIs she all right?\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tcradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tI'm... I'm....\n\n\tFULL SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tas he carries her into the living room, but her down on the \n\tcouch.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tJust lie there and keep still.\n\n\tCathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket.  \n\tBy the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over \n\tMelanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands \n\tare trembling, and he drops it.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tLet me do that, Mitch.\n\n\tShe picks up the bandage.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI can handle it.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tI know you can.\n\t\t\t(her eyes meet his)\n\t\tBut I'd like to.\n\n\tHe nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(weakly)\n\t\tPlease don't mess me up with bandages, \n\t\tMrs. Brenner.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tShhhh. Shhhh.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tPlease.\n\n\tBut she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the \n\tcuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\t\t(as she works)\n\t\tI'm not very good at this, Mitch.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tYou're doing fine.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\t\t(Apologizing)\n\t\tI mean. I want to...\n\n\tPause.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY\n\t\tListen!\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA\n\n\traising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to \n\thear.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tThey're gone. God have mercy, they're \n\t\tgone.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tas he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the \n\ttable and chair. He opens the door a crack.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE YARD\n\n\tthrough the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no \n\tbirds visible.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE DOOR\n\n\tfrom outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred \n\tand splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds \n\tspill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is \n\tdirectly behind him.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE HOUSE\n\n\ta shambles, all the windows broken.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tThey're gone. The same pattern.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tBut they'll be back.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWe won't be here.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tWhere can we go, Mitch? There's no \n\t\tplace to go.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI want to try for San Francisco.  \n\t\tThere are buildings there. Steel and \n\t\tconcrete!\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\t\t(shaking her head)\n\t\tWe'd never make it. They're probably \n\t\tall over the road.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWe have to try it.\n\t\t\t(a long silence)\n\t\tWe can't stay here.\n\t\t\t(silence)\n\t\tMelanie needs help.\n\t\t\t(silence)\n\t\tMother, the house won't take another \n\t\tattack.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tIf...\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tIf... when we get to San Francisco...\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tIf they're already there?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tThey won't be.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tIf they are?\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWe'll worry about that when we get \n\t\tthere.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tI'm frightened, terribly frightened.  \n\t\tI... I don't know what's out there, \n\t\tMitch.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWhat do we have to know, Mother?  \n\t\tWe're all together, we all love each \n\t\tother, we all need each other. What \n\t\telse is there? Mother, I want us to \n\t\tstay alive!\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\t\t(nodding; then after \n\t\t\ta pause)\n\t\tI started to say... inside...\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tYou don't have to.\n\n\tHe holds out his hand to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI think we'd better get started.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD\n\n\tIt is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before \n\tdawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following \n\tuntil the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is \n\tdeafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's \n\tconvertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house \n\ttogether and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the \n\tback seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background \n\tis the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia \n\tcomes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking \n\tdown at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the \n\thouse.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - CATHY\n\n\tShe is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just \n\toutside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tlooking back at her.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA\n\n\tAcross the expanse of the desolated yard.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY\n\t\tMay I take them, Mitch?\n\n\tHe does not answer. She continues looking at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY\n\t\tThey haven't harmed anyone.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tTake them.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\t\t(with a slow nod)\n\t\tWe'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.\n\n\tHe takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car.  \n\tThe CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front \n\tseat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, \n\tand looks toward the trees.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - THE TREES\n\n\tcovered with waiting birds.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tgetting into car.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tBe careful with that door.\n\n\tCathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch \n\tdoes the same with his door.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\t\t(weakly)\n\t\tMitch, if they hear the car \n\t\tstarting... if they see movement...\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tWe'll take it slow until we get to \n\t\tthe main road.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tAre you ready?\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND\n\n\tturning the key. The motor springs to life.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR\n\n\tanticipation on all the faces.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tAll right.\n\t\t\t(he takes a deep breath)\n\t\tHere we go.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE CAR\n\n\tfrom the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is \n\tstill, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it \n\tpasses the gate and starts down the road.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\n\n\tas they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small \n\tfire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact.  \n\tThe car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the \n\troad.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW\n\n\tShe gasps quickly.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE\n\n\tstanding, waiting silently.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR\n\n\tas the tension begins to starts.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tShhh.  Shhhh.\n\n\tMED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\n\n\tas they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with \n\twaiting seagulls.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA\n\n\tseeing them. Her lip begins to tremble.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tturning toward the side of the road ahead.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V.\n\n\tcovered with waiting birds.\n\n\t\t\t\tCATHY\n\t\t\t(whispering)\n\t\tMitch, let's turn back.\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tShhh.

The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded \n\twindow, we see a woman and child peering from a gap.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - CATHY\n\n\treacting.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V.\n\n\tas it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding \n\troad to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still-\n\tstanding wires, watching, waiting.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as \n\tthe car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of \n\tbirds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every \n\tpole, on every fence.\n\n\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n\t\tMitch!\n\n\tMED. SHOT - MITCH\n\n\tas he stops the car and looks ahead.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - THE CAR\n\n\tin the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n\n\tfrightened, try not to reveal her fear.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tCan we turn back?\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n\n\t\t\t\tMITCH\n\t\tI... I don't think so. If we get \n\t\tthrough town, I think we'll be all \n\t\tright.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR\n\n\tThere is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest \n\treason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, \n\twho makes the decision.\n\n\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n\t\tThen go ahead, Mitch.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR\n\n\tas it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow \n\trate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA\n\n\tas she turns to look out the window on her side.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS\n\n\tas the car moves past them slowly.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA\n\n\tclosing her eyes.\n\n\tFULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE\n\n\tthrough the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with \n\tbirds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all \n\tover the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the \n\topen door and across the road, dead people are lying in the \n\tgutter.
