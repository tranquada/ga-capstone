The CAMERA LOCATES:\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS\n</b>\n\tin the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.  \n\tShe is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, \n\texquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick \n\tsureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, \n\ta mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the \n\tfront door of a pet shop and enters.\n\n<b>\tINT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT\n</b>\n\tMelanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back \n\ttoward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.  \n\tMacGRUDER, comes toward her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tHello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever \n\t\tseen so many gulls?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMRS.

A puppy is \n\tBARKING, o.s.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER\n</b>\t\t\t(shaking her head)\n\t\tThere must be a storm at sea. That \n\t\tcan drive them inland, you know.\n\n\tThey are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird \n\tdepartment now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor \n\tof innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie \n\tand Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There \n\tis a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls \n\tare lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so \n\tthat the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained \n\tbirds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic \n\tbirds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, \n\tlarger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets \n\tin the bigger cages. As they walk:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMRS.

Melanie \n\tfinishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the \n\tcounter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tHello, this is Betty MacGruder at \n\t\tDavidson's.\n\t\t\t(pause; accusingly)\n\t\tIt's past three, you know.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tWell, how long do you think...? All \n\t\tright, would you check it please?  \n\t\tYes, I'll wait.\n\n\tMelanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, \n\tshe begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips \n\twith the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding \n\ther. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the \n\tbars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins \n\tBARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER\n</b>\n\tas he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the \n\tsteps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about \n\ttwenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt \n\that.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n</b>\n\tseeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of \n\tstrawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.  \n\tThe birds are startled into scarlet flight.\n\n<b>\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n</b>\n\tas they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little \n\tnod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes \n\ther, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and \n\tthen vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - MELANIE\n</b>\n\tlooking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of \n\tthe cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tI wonder if you could help me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\t\t(deliberately, and \n\t\t\twith a touch of \n\t\t\thauteur)\n\t\tI said I wonder if you could help \n\t\tme.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n</b>\n\ta trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to \n\tinform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But \n\tthen something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea \n\tcomes to her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\t\t(solicitously)\n\t\tYes, what was it you were looking \n\t\tfor, sir?\n\n<b>\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\t\t(deadpan)\n\t\tLovebirds.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tLovebirds, sir?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tYes.

Is there an \n\t\tornithological reason for keeping \n\t\tthem in separate cages?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tOh, certainly. It's to protect the \n\t\tspecies.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tI imagine that's very important.  \n\t\tEspecially during the moulting season.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tYes, that's a particularly dangerous \n\t\ttime.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tAre they moulting now?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tSome of them are.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tHow can you tell?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tWell... they get a sort of hangdog \n\t\texpression.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.\n</b>\n\tThe bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tYes, I see.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tAbout those lovebirds, Miss...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tAre you sure you wouldn't like to \n\t\tsee a canary instead?

She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter \n\twhere she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, \n\tand then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary \n\tcage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\t\t(feebly)\n\t\tHere, birdie.

I simply existed. So what \n\t\twas the answer? A jealous woman, \n\t\tright? A clinging possessive mother.\n\t\t\t(she shakes her head)\n\t\tWrong. With all due respect to \n\t\tOedipus, I don't think that was the \n\t\tcase at all.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tThen what was it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tLydia liked me, you see. That was \n\t\tthe strange part of it. In fact, now \n\t\tthat I'm no longer a threat, we're \n\t\tvery good friends.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tThen why did she object to you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tBecause she was afraid.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tAfraid you'd take Mitch?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tAfraid I'd give Mitch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tI don't understand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tAfraid of any woman who'd give Mitch \n\t\tthe only thing Lydia can give him --\n\t\tlove.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tAnnie, that adds up to a jealous, \n\t\tpossessive woman.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tNo, I don't think so. She's not afraid \n\t\tof losing her son, you see.  She's \n\t\tonly afraid of being abandoned.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tSomeone ought to tell her she'd be \n\t\tgaining a daughter.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tShe already has a daughter.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tWhat about Mitch? Didn't he have \n\t\tanything to say about this?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\t\t(apologetically)\n\t\tI can understand his position. He \n\t\twent through a lot with Lydia after \n\t\this father died.

I went back to San Francisco, \n\t\tand I still saw Mitch every now and \n\t\tthen... but we both knew it was \n\t\tfinished.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tThen what are you doing here in Bodega \n\t\tBay?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tYou get straight to the point, don't \n\t\tyou?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tI'm sorry. Forgive me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tNo, that's all right, I don't mind.  \n\t\tI came up here for two reasons. To \n\t\tbegin with, I was bored with my job \n\t\tin San Francisco. I was teaching at \n\t\ta private school there... well, you \n\t\tknow, you probably went to one \n\t\tyourself.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tI did.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tThen you know. Little girls in brown \n\t\tbeanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. \n\t\tI'll go into that classroom on Monday \n\t\tmorning, and I'll look out at twenty-\n\t\tfive upturned little faces, and each \n\t\tof them will be saying, 'Yes, please \n\t\tgive me what you have.'\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tAnd I'll give them what I have. I \n\t\thaven't got very much, but I'll give \n\t\tthem every ounce of it. To me, that's \n\t\tvery important. It makes me want to \n\t\tstay alive for a long long time.\n\t\t\t(she sighs)\n\t\tThat's the first reason.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tAnd the second?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\t\t(simply)\n\t\tI wanted to be near Mitch.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tIt was over, and I knew it, but I \n\t\twanted to be near him, anyway.\n\t\t\t(she smiles)\n\t\tYou see, I still like him a hell of \n\t\ta lot. That's rare, I think. I don't \n\t\twant to lose his friendship... ever.\n\n\tThere is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE \n\tshrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer \n\tit.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - ANNIE\n</b>\n\tat the phone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tHello?  Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't \n\t\tasleep.

For you.\n\n<b>\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE\n</b>\n\tas they stare at each other across the room, Melanie \n\thesitating.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tHe's waiting.\n\n\tMelanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie \n\tto the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her \n\tthroughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie \n\ttalks to Mitch in the background.\n\n\tAnnie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a \n\twistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally \n\tand irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\t\t(at phone; coolly)\n\t\tHello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, \n\t\tthank you. No, no trouble at all.  I \n\t\tsimply followed the road. It's a \n\t\tvery bright night.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tWhat?  Oh. Well, there's no need to \n\t\tapologize. I can understand...\n\t\t\t(pause; she listens)\n\t\tWell...\n\t\t\t(she listens again)\n\t\tThat's very kind of you. No, I'm not \n\t\tangry.\n\t\t\t(she listens)\n\t\tI couldn't.

This has \n\t\tbeen a busy day.\n\t\t\t(picking up her paper \n\t\t\tbag)\n\t\tMy luggage.\n\n\tShe smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tPretty. Did you get that at \n\t\tBrinkmeyer's?\n\n\tMelanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent \n\tfor a moment, pensive. Then:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tDo you think I should go?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tThat's up to you.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tIt's really up to Lydia, isn't it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\tNever mind Lydia.

Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tThank you, Annie.\n\n\tSuddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, \n\tstartling them both.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\t\t(rising)\n\t\tWho can that be at this hour?\n\t\t\t(she walks to door)\n\t\tWho is it?\n\t\t\t(no answer)\n\t\tIs someone there?\n\n\tMelanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks \n\tthe door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.  \n\tThere is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\t\t(to the emptiness \n\t\t\toutside)\n\t\tIs anyone there?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\t\t(pointing to the ground)\n\t\tLook.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL\n</b>\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - ANNIE\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNIE\n</b>\t\t\t(sympathetically)\n\t\tOhhh.

There's \n\t\ta full moon.\n\n<b>\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE\n</b>\n\tas Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and \n\tconsternation:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  FADE OUT\n</b>\n<b>\tFADE IN\n</b>\n\tHIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with \n\tballoons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. \n\tThe children, in party clothes, with their parents, are \n\tclustered around a long folding table upon which are \n\tsandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either \n\thelping the children to more or telling them they are having \n\ttoo much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and \n\tLAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, \n\tare Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and \n\taway from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin \n\tbend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the \n\tentrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. \n\tThe CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, \n\tthe party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the \n\tCAMERA out to the left.\n\n<b>\tCLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES\n</b>\n\tMelanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and \n\tstand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one \n\tof his pockets, and two glasses from the other.

Annie is busy changing the blindfold \n\tfrom Michele to Cathy.\n\n<b>\tCAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH\n</b>\n\tThe CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We \n\tsee Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by \n\tway of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they \n\treach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of \n\tthe dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS \n\tOFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the \n\tchildren. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from \n\tMichele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back.  During \n\tthis, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes \n\tof Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is \n\twatching Mitch and Melanie.\n\n<b>\tMITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.\n</b>\n<b>\tMED.

Shhh.\n\n\tSilence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, \n\tthe THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence.  More panes \n\tof glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards \n\tand the outside of the house begins building, almost like \n\tmuffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. \n\tInterspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, \n\tis the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section \n\tentering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the \n\troof.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA\n</b>\n\tlooking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She \n\tsqueezes her eyes shut.\n\n<b>\tTWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE\n</b>\n\tas the child cuddles up into her arms.

We HEAR \n\tCathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling \n\tof wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of \n\tbirds striking the house.\n\n<b>\tFULL SHOT - THE ROOM\n</b>\n\tMitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the \n\tbirds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his \n\twatch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back \n\tdoor. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the \n\tdining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS\n</b>\n\twatching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?  \n\tHe cannot tell.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n</b>\n\tlooking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a \n\tNEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing \n\tsound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - MITCH\n</b>\n\tcoming into the entry hall.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR\n</b>\n\tThe wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside \n\tassail the door.\n\n<b>\tFULL SHOT - MITCH\n</b>\n\tturning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining \n\troom. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it \n\ttoward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and \n\tpiles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, \n\tCAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags \n\tit to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table \n\twhen Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with \n\talarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is \n\tand then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of \n\tdesperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The \n\tCLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din \n\tnow, insidious and increasingly more frightening.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tWhen will they stop?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tI thought they'd have stopped by \n\t\tnow.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tWhat time is it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tAlmost two a.m.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tYou must be exhausted.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tHow about you?\n\n\tShe shakes her head. They both move into the dining room, \n\tthe CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their \n\tcage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready \n\tto carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the \n\tchair, goes to the cage.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH\n</b>\n\tlooking at the birds, wondering.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS\n</b>\n\tlooking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their \n\texpressions. Malice or benevolence?\n\n<b>\tMED. SHOT - MITCH\n</b>\n\tHe raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS\n</b>\n\twatching, unmoving.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER\n</b>\n\tas he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.  \n\tOne of them tweets.\n\n<b>\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tI wonder if Cathy fed them.\n\n\tHe turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, \n\ttakes out a small box of bird feed.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE\n</b>\n\tas his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.  \n\tHis hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the \n\tsmall catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.  \n\tCautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.  \n\tThe birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the \n\tsmall feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it \n\tin the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, \n\ttweeting, they begin to eat.\n\n<b>\tFULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM\n</b>\n\tas Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped \n\tagainst the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.  \n\tWearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling, \n\tpecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\t\t(holding her)\n\t\tYou should have left when you wanted \n\t\tto.\n\n\tShe shakes her head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tYou'd have been safe in San Francisco.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tI don't want to be safe. I want to \n\t\tbe with you.\n\n\tThere is something pathetically comic about her voice, like \n\ta small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, \n\tMitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand \n\tin each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of \n\tnight sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\t\t(in the darkness)\n\t\tThe power.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tMitch...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tWait here. Don't move.\n\n\tThe screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the \n\tblackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the \n\tSOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes \n\ton.\n\n<b>\tTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH\n</b>\n\tas he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as \n\the directs the beam upwards.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tWe'd better light some of those lamps.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\tNo... wait.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tHold me.\n\n\tIn the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss.

The fire is burning brightly \n\tand steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer \n\tthe sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another \n\tSOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a \n\tsteady dribbling, difficult to place.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n</b>\n\tlistening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMELANIE\n</b>\t\t\t(whispering)\n\t\tMitch?\n\n<b>\tMED.

The SOUND is still coming \n\tfrom somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, \n\tpicks up a very long flashlight.\n\n<b>\tFULL SHOT - MELANIE\n</b>\n\tas she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the \n\tentry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled \n\tagainst the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into \n\tthe kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam \n\ton the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor \n\toutside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, \n\tgoes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's \n\tall right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second \n\tbedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.\n\n<b>\tFULL SHOT - MELANIE\n</b>\n\tclimbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first \n\tdoor upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light \n\ton the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, \n\tgoes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to \n\tthe windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back \n\ttoward the door when she stops.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE\n</b>\n\tlooking.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR\n</b>\n\ta pile of chipped and broken plaster.\n\n<b>\tMED.

In the \n\tspreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering \n\tof wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault \n\ton the door by Mitch outside.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLYDIA (O.S.)\n</b>\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tMitch, get her out of there!\n\n<b>\tMED.

Her clothes have almost been \n\tshredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.  \n\tWe catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch \n\tpulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut \n\tbehind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at \n\tthe few birds that have escaped into the corridor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tMother, get a rope!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n</b>\t\tOh, my God, look at her!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\t\t(shouting)\n\t\tGet a rope!\n\n\tShe rushes off.

He takes the rope from her, loops it over the \n\tdoorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to \n\tthe bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to \n\tMelanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia \n\tfollowing. As they go downstairs:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tCathy!

But his hands \n\tare trembling, and he drops it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n</b>\t\tLet me do that, Mitch.\n\n\tShe picks up the bandage.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMITCH\n</b>\t\tI can handle it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLYDIA\n</b>\t\tI know you can.\n\t\t\t(her eyes meet his)\n\t\tBut I'd like to.\n\n\tHe nods.

There are no \n\tbirds visible.\n\n<b>\tFULL SHOT - THE DOOR\n</b>\n\tfrom outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred \n\tand splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds \n\tspill into the room. He steps out into the yard.

The silence is \n\tdeafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's \n\tconvertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house \n\ttogether and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the \n\tback seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background \n\tis the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia \n\tcomes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking \n\tdown at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the \n\thouse.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - CATHY\n</b>\n\tShe is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just \n\toutside the doorway.
