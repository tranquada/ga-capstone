FOREST - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON - DAY\n</b><b>          \n</b>               As Cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not\n               alien to him. He crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze\n               of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen\n               cones. Sweat pours down his face. His breath rasps in his throat.\n               He breaks into a clearing and FREEZES...suddenly face to face with a\n               MAN who crouches, blocking his path. It is one of the telephone\n               linemen we saw earlier.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          16   WIDER ANGLE\n</b><b>          \n</b>               The lineman, kneeling at his tool chest, is surprised by Cameron.\n               The other lineman is halfway up the power pole. They both stare at\n               Cameron's handcuffs. Cameron edges back, his escape route blocked.\n               The man on the ground grabs a WRENCH and moves forward with the same\n               gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                           LINEMAN\n</b>                                Stand right there like a good old\n                                boy and do what I say.

Then, enraged like a startled bull,\n               he lunges forward with the wrench. Cameron uses the man's weight\n               against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. A hard knee to\n               his stomach doubles up the lineman. The handcuffed arms slam down\n               like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground.\n               A kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. The other\n               lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one\n               step back up. Cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed\n               grasp and dashes off into the forest.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          17   MOVING SHOT - ON CAMERON\n</b><b>          \n</b>               He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the\n               bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds\n               his head and drinks.

He lifts his knee from the\n               cutter handle. His arms are now free. He wedges a chisel against\n               one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it.

Cameron's apprehension\n               suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as\n               he had feared, but something else. Moving in the shimmering heat\n               wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG\n               SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him.\n<b>          24   ANGLE ON CAMERON\n</b><b>          \n</b>               He scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride.

Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge\n               where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. There is\n               nothing below but the rushing black water. Here and there bubbles\n               swirl to the surface. They could be from a sinking car or could be\n               caused by the current.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          30   ANGLE ON CAMERON\n</b><b>          \n</b>               His thoughts racing.

FOUR MEN Can be\n               seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. The man\n               beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS. He grabs the radio microphone and\n               begins speaking into it. Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a\n               field. The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water,\n               hovers.

He\n                unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his\n                wrist. Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet\n                against it. It won't open. Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the\n                sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward\n                the town.\n<b>          35    EXT.

Now there is a\n                rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode,\n                crushing down toward him. Under the immense pressure, the rear\n                window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent. The\n                memory of Chuck's voice...\"the windows.\" He lowers the front window\n                slowly. The water now pours in faster. The level has risen to his\n                chin. He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head.\n                Still the red light burns. He reaches beneath the seat for the\n                oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. It won't move. The\n                impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. His\n                groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. A hope. Though every\n                second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are\n                as in slow motion. Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager\n                breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. The rubber tube has\n                broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must\n                have with Burt. Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the\n                water reaches the roof.
