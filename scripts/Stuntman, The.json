ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING\n          \n               A strip of two-lane highway runs through a tall pine forest. There\n               is a truck-stop coffee shop beside the roadway. A few 14-WHEELERS\n               are scattered across the big dusty parking lot. Morning sunlight\n               glints off their chrome stacks. It bakes the asphalt and warms the\n               mangy hides of stray DOGS asleep in the dirt. A HELICOPTER hovers\n               about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird. It's the beginning of a\n               perfect day.\n          \n               A highway PATROL CAR slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and\n               parks beside the slat and shingled building.\n          \n               TWO TELEPHONE LINEMEN are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge.\n          \n          2    POWER POLE - ANGLE ON TELEPHONE LINEMEN\n          \n               High on the pole, the linemen lean back against their safety straps\n               to work, their bodies forming a \"Y.\" One of them suddenly turns,\n               pointing at a nearby treetop.\n          \n                                              FIRST LINEMAN\n                                   Lookee there!\n          \n               He grabs a PORCELAIN INSULATOR from his belt, cocks his arm and\n               hurls it across the open stretch. It lands smack in the middle of\n               the tree. SQUAWK! A rattle of leaves, a rustle of feathers and a\n               HUGE BUZZARD comes flapping out. The lineman cackles over his\n               marksmanship.\n          \n          3    CLOSE ANGLE ON BUZZARD - MOVING SHOT\n          \n               The big, frightened beady-eyed bird is lumbering through the sky,\n               flapping for its life and suddenly...SPLAT!

FOREST - TREETOPS\n          \n              The apple drops into the trees, bounces down from branch to branch\n              and falls on the slanted roof of the ROADSIDE DINER beneath. It\n              rolls down the eaves, off the edge and lands on top of the parked\n              Highway Patrol car.\n          \n          6   INT.

DINER - ON POLICEMEN\n          \n              They huddle, then move toward the diner entrance.     As they pass an\n              open WINDOW the CAMERA HOLDS.\n          \n              INT.   DINER\n          8\n          \n              A FRY COOK serves behind the long counter where MEN on stools eat\n              watching the overhead TV. There is a PINBALL MACHINE in action.\n              The policemen are seen ENTERING b.g. A TRUCK DRIVER ambles up and\n              straddles a stool.\n          \n                                             TRUCK DRIVER\n                                  Gettin' hot early.

He's about 25, even-featured, bone-\n               weary. His appealing face needs a shave. The cook fills his water\n               glass. The ice cubes rattle as Cameron's hand trembles. His eyes\n               are riveted on the policemen.\n          \n          10   CAMERON'S POV\n          \n               Two policemen take seats at a booth across from the counter; one\n               policeman moves to a WALL TELEPHONE, another stands near the CASH\n               REGISTER looking at a magazine. They seem nonchalant, but are\n               placed to block all avenues of escape.\n          \n          11   ANGLE ON CAMERON\n          \n               Suddenly startled as someone slaps him on the arm.

The man pulls up his own sleeve\n               to show a small tatoo of an anchor.\n          \n                                             MAN (CONT'D)\n                                  My wife still yells about this...but\n                                  yours -- that's some eagle...like a\n                                  billboard.\n          \n                                             CAMERON\n                                      (eyes on police)\n                                  Yeah, that's the grand old bird.\n                                     (a half-smile)\n                                  Right now I just wish the son-of-a-\n                                  bitch could fly.\n          \n               Cameron rises and moves across the diner to the pinball machine.\n          \n          12   ANGLE ON PINBALL\n          \n               The PLAYER wiggles and contorts, using body English to influence the\n               balls.\n          \n                                               -4-\n          \n          \n          \n                                           HECKLER\n                                Hey Morton, you think your ass is\n                                connected to the machine?

On\n                it, the commercial shows a beautiful girl (who we'll later know as\n                NINA FRANKLIN) bending over a bowl of dog food. Her ass, too,\n          12B   wiggles engagingly. The pinball player leaves the machine.\n                Cameron, stalling for time, works the plunger while a cop stalks\n                closer; like the cat to the mouse hole.\n          \n                                           POLICEMAN\n                                Hey, you're lucky.

He tears through it, but gets\n               stuck halfway.\n          \n                                           CAMERON\n                                   (panicked)\n                                No!...God, don't shoot!\n          \n               Swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh, he\n               breaks free and runs.\n          \n          14   EXT.   REAR OF DINER\n          \n               As Cameron flies down the back steps, a COP stationed at the rear\n               door, caught off-guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his\n               back. Cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences,\n               between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the\n               other side. Behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot.\n          \n          15   INT.   FOREST - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON - DAY\n          \n               As Cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not\n               alien to him. He crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze\n               of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen\n               cones. Sweat pours down his face. His breath rasps in his throat.\n               He breaks into a clearing and FREEZES...suddenly face to face with a\n               MAN who crouches, blocking his path.

They both stare at\n               Cameron's handcuffs. Cameron edges back, his escape route blocked.\n               The man on the ground grabs a WRENCH and moves forward with the same\n               gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.\n          \n                                           LINEMAN\n                                Stand right there like a good old\n                                boy and do what I say.

No shit, so was my old\n                                  man...\n                                     (he suddenly stamps his\n                                      foot and shrieks)\n                                  Aaaaaaaargh!\n          \n               The lineman jumps in surprise. Then, enraged like a startled bull,\n               he lunges forward with the wrench. Cameron uses the man's weight\n               against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. A hard knee to\n               his stomach doubles up the lineman. The handcuffed arms slam down\n               like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground.\n               A kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. The other\n               lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one\n               step back up. Cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed\n               grasp and dashes off into the forest.\n          \n          17   MOVING SHOT - ON CAMERON\n          \n               He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the\n               bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds\n               his head and drinks. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the terrain. There are no\n               pursuers, the forest is silent.\n          \n          18   CLOSE UP - HANDCUFFS\n          \n               The jaws of a wire-cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting\n               the cuffs around Cameron's wrists. He lifts his knee from the\n               cutter handle. His arms are now free. He wedges a chisel against\n               one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it. We hear his\n               sharp outcry.\n          \n          19   ANGLE ON CAMERON\n          \n               Doubled up, holding his wrist in pain. The bracelet is still\n               intact. He buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs\n               the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above.\n          20   EXT.   OLD ABANDONED ROAD - DAY\n          \n               Cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the\n               mountainous pass. He crosses a bridge. Through the arches of its\n               low stone railing, he sees a BLACK RIVER twenty feet below rushing\n               toward the sea. Then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert.\n          \n                                                 -7-\n          \n          21   CAMERON'S POV\n          \n               In the far distance, almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from\n               the road, is a tiny speck moving toward him.\n          \n          22   ANGLE ON CAMERON\n          \n               He clambers down the embankment behind the railing, peering out from\n               this hidden vantage.\n          \n          23   ANGLE ON ROAD\n          \n               The speck grows larger. The SOUND of the engine is faintly audible\n               now. Sunlight flashes from metal and glass. Cameron's apprehension\n               suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as\n               he had feared, but something else. Moving in the shimmering heat\n               wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG\n               SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him.\n          24   ANGLE ON CAMERON\n          \n               He scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride. The Duesenberg\n               roars past him, filling his eyes and mouth with dust. Suddenly\n               there is a screech of brakes.\n          \n          25   ANGLE ON CAR\n          \n               The Duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop.\n               Running, Cameron reaches the car, pulls the front door open and\n               climbs in beside the DRIVER.\n          26   INT.

CAR\n          \n               Cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the\n               Duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the\n               momentum.\n          \n               Stunned, the wind knocked out of him, Cameron rises to his elbows.\n               Before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes\n               screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred-\n               eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron.\n          28\n               INT.   CAR - ANGLE ON BURT\n          \n               Driving with one hand on the door handle, his head halfway out the\n               window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond.\n          \n                                             -9-\n          \n          29   ANGLE ON ROAD - CAR AND CAMERON\n          \n               Cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight\n               of the Duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. His hand closes\n               over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier\n               flings a Coke bottle at a tank, Cameron hurls the rock in the\n               direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. The big\n               spinning tires brush him as they pass. We catch a momentary glimpse\n               of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield.\n          \n               As he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed,\n               expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. He opens\n               his eyes, climbs to his feet. The road is empty. The Duesenberg is\n               gone. Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge\n               where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. There is\n               nothing below but the rushing black water. Here and there bubbles\n               swirl to the surface. They could be from a sinking car or could be\n               caused by the current.\n          \n          30   ANGLE ON CAMERON\n          \n               His thoughts racing. Was it the sun, has he imagined the whole\n               thing? Suddenly a HELICOPTER appears, hovering, almost at eye\n               level. Sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe.\n          \n          31   WIDER ANGLE\n          \n               It is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence. It has\n               swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing,\n               catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide. FOUR MEN Can be\n               seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. The man\n               beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS. He grabs the radio microphone and\n               begins speaking into it. Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a\n               field. The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water,\n               hovers. Protected from sight, Cameron runs between the tall stalks,\n               away from the road.\n          \n          32   CAMERON - MOVING SHOT\n          \n               Glancing back through the stalks as he runs, Cameron sees a STAKE\n               TRUCK barreling toward the sight of the accident. In the back,\n               THREE MEN are frantically putting on black wet-suits. They look,\n               from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each\n               other. Cameron runs on.\n          \n                                              - 10 -\n          \n          33    EXT.   BLUFF - OVERLOOKING SEASHORE TOWN\n          \n                A few hotels, like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread, surround\n                a sandy cove beyond which is the sea. There is a fishing pier,\n                boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with\n                sunbathing TOURISTS. The town's bucolic, turn-of-the-century charm\n                might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow CONSTRUCTION\n                CRANE, which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the\n                sandy cove. Cameron appears on the bluff.\n          \n          34    ANGLE ON CAMERON\n          \n                Surveying the town -- expressionless, a jungle beast going to\n                survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours. He reaches\n                down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into\n                cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear. He pulls off his worn\n                boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the\n                town below. There are crowds to get lost in down there. He\n                unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his\n                wrist. Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet\n                against it. It won't open. Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the\n                sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward\n                the town.\n          35    EXT.   BOARDWALK\n          \n                The SCREEN is yellow and on it are the words: 'HAVE A NICE DAY.'\n                THE ANGLE WIDENS and we realize the words are on the back of a\n                YELLOW HAT that jiggles as its wearer walks. It is Cameron. Beyond\n                him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with\n                the sun. Teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis.\n                The boardwalk cops in white shirts, looking like ice cream vendors,\n                whom Cameron deftly avoids. Then, he looks up at the sky,\n                perplexed: the helicopter from the bridge is overhead, circling.\n                Cameron watches it warily as he walks.\n          \n          35A   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK\n          \n                A BIG CROWD has formed at the railing of the pier. Many of the\n                people with CAMERAS CLICKING at the sand below. Cameron notices the\n                helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open\n                cockpit BIPLANE.

It's a film company\n               shooting on location -- this somehow must explain the Duesenberg.\n               His eyes go to the scene below.\n          36   ANGLE ON COVE\n          \n               A CAMERA RIG suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane\n               is PHOTOGRAPHING the surf where EXTRAS in German WWI uniforms\n               unload ashore. The bright little plane has started a lazy dive\n               toward the soldiers, its engine whining.

Twisting, hurtling across the\n               gap between the buildings, falling, crashing to the slate roof,\n               crawling and scrambling for a hand hold.

An object drops from the cockpit\n                 (the boot). Then there is a burst of flame in the engine. Trailing\n                 smoke, the plane wobbles, crash-lands (sliding alarmingly close to\n                 CAMERA). It ground-loops, goes up on one wing and, as it crashes\n                 down, we see that the pilot who we assumed was Raymond, is really a\n                 dummy that is flapping absurdly and falling to pieces before our\n                 eyes during the crash.

THE OLD ABANDONED ROAD - EARLY MORNING\n          \n                In the stillness, as the morning sun crests the trees, their shadows\n                move like a parting curtain, leaving sunlight to warm the old stones\n                of the abandoned road.

Long, short,\n                tall, fat vehicles; the stretch-out car, the cab towing portable\n                toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the Cortez Camper\n                dressing rooms, the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like\n                radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage German\n                army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the\n                huge, bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads,\n                its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning\n                hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians\n                straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee.

DUESENBERG - WIDE ANGLE PAST CAMERON THROUGH WINDSHIELD\n          \n                The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening,\n                shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and\n                soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera\n                and Cameron's desperate cries. Tearing his seatbelt off he flings\n                himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to\n                reach Nina. Incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is\n                buoyed to the surface. There, again, is the living world - the\n                road, the trees. In that brief instant, through the rear window,\n                Cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina,\n                standing by the rail looking down, Eli beside her. The car noses\n                downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window. The last image\n                on Cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little-girl excitement on\n                Nina's face. Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water\n                as the car plunges toward the bottom.\n          \n                Cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is\n                total. Everyone, even Nina, has conspired to bring him to this --\n                red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his\n                death.\n          \n                                             - 150 -\n          \n          \n                Outrage galvanizes him to action. He reaches for the door handles,\n                to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands. Now there is a\n                rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode,\n                crushing down toward him. Under the immense pressure, the rear\n                window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent. The\n                memory of Chuck's voice...\"the windows.\" He lowers the front window\n                slowly. The water now pours in faster. The level has risen to his\n                chin. He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head.\n                Still the red light burns. He reaches beneath the seat for the\n                oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. It won't move. The\n                impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. His\n                groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. A hope. Though every\n                second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are\n                as in slow motion. Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager\n                breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. The rubber tube has\n                broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must\n                have with Burt. Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the\n                water reaches the roof. For a moment there is a strange stillness\n                which Cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and\n                toward the surface.\n          199   ANGLE ON CAMERON\n          \n                Moving upward through river slime, in a world that grows lighter, in\n                a desperate race to reach air.\n          \n                Daylight! Gasping, half unconscious, barely able to move his arms\n                to stay afloat. Adrift in the current, he touches land, clawing at\n                the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore. His muscles, still\n                moving by motor reflex, driven by survival instinct, take him\n                crawling from the river bank through the tall grass -- still the\n                fugitive, the \"man on the run.\" Then, he lifts his head and stops\n                at what he sees before him:\n          \n          200   POV\n          \n                Fanned out across the field is a row of men, guns held ready.\n                Policemen from the truck in their German uniforms moving forward\n                slowly -- carefully searching the terrain in an arch which, as it\n                closes, must irrevocably reach Cameron.\n          201   ANOTHER ANGLE\n          \n                It's over. Without strength or will, he lies waiting for them as\n                though his eyes were made of glass. They see him now, but their\n                pace doesn't change. As they take the last few steps toward him, he\n                sees their shoulders, waists, knees and then only a circle of feet\n                around him.\n          \n                Their hands roughly grab him, pulling him to his feet, shoving him\n                brutally about.

They seem too\n                gentle. Why is that cop smiling? Some of them are walking away.\n                Where are the handcuffs? Why is he shaking my hand instead?
