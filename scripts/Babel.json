Kenji is\n                embarrassed by his tactlessness and tries to be more\n                considerate.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                        KENJI (CONT'D)\n</b>                            I'm sorry.

Kenji takes off\n                his shoes and leaves them at the door. Chieko leads him to\n                the living room and with a gesture asks if he wants anything\n                to drink.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                        KENJI (CONT'D)\n</b>                            Do you have tea?\n<b>          \n</b>                Chieko nods and goes into the kitchen. Kenji glances over\n                the apartment. Chieko comes back from the kitchen holding a\n                strange gadget which she puts on the living room table. A\n                small bulb lights. Kenji just watches her.\n<b>          \n</b>                Chieko gestures for him to sit down.     Kenji and Chieko sit\n                across from each other.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                                                          95.\n</b><b>          \n</b>                Chieko takes out her notebook and pen, writes something down\n                and hands it over to Kenji.

Kenji looks over; the distance is\n                dizzying. Chieko writes in her notebook and shows him the\n                piece of paper.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                      KENJI\n</b>                          You saw her jump?\n<b>          \n</b>                She nods and writes again.

She scrawls in\n                her notebook \"Then why do you want to talk to my father?\"\n                Kenji reads and then turns to her.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                      KENJI (CONT'D)\n</b>                          It's about a hunting rifle in his\n                          name.\n<b>          \n</b>                The red bulb on the gadget starts to blink.

The sounds of\n          Tokyo come in through the living room: its car horns, its\n          voices.\n<b>          \n</b>          Suddenly a rush of wind comes in. Chieko sees the balcony\n          doors are open and goes to close them. She then comes back\n          to the living room and sits down, dejected.\n<b>          \n</b>          Kenji sits down beside her and leaves the tea on the table.\n          He doesn't know what to do and looks uncomfortable.\n<b>          \n</b>          She picks up the notebook and writes.

Chieko\n          comes back completely naked. Her skin bristles.\n<b>          \n</b>          She walks toward him, breathing through her mouth. Kenji is\n          disconcerted when he sees the quiet teenager approach. She\n          walks all the way up to Kenji and when she is about to take\n          another step, he holds her back with both hands.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                KENJI (CONT'D)\n</b>                    What are you doing?\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                                                               97.\n</b><b>          \n</b>                She doesn't pay attention, breaks free and stands a few inches\n                away from him.

He stands there, immobile,\n                without taking his eyes off Chieko's.\n<b>          \n</b>                She takes his hand and puts it on one of her breasts. Kenji\n                strokes her breast and then pulls his hand away.

You're just a girl.\n<b>          \n</b>                She walks up to his face and licks it.    He is confused.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                      KENJI (CONT'D)\n</b>                          Enough, please.\n<b>          \n</b>                He grabs her by her arms and moves her away. She grabs the\n                sleeve of his jacket and pulls him back. She hugs him and\n                suddenly Chieko starts crying, disconsolate.\n<b>          \n</b>                Kenji, bewildered, first does nothing, but upon seeing\n                Chieko's despair, holds her. She buries her face in his\n                shoulder. Her nakedness becomes increasingly fragile.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          165   EXT.
