Yasira (38) is roasting\n              some goat meat assisted by Yamil (16) and Zora (17), her\n              daughters.\n          \n              Abdullah and his sons, Yussef (13) and Ahmed (14), are sitting\n              on the floor around the small table, looking at a well-\n              conserved .270 caliber Winchester 60 rifle.\n          \n                                    HASSAN\n                            (To Abdullah)\n                        It's almost new.\n          \n              He takes out several boxes of cartridges from his satchel.\n          \n                                    HASSAN (CONT'D)\n                        Three hundred cartridges...\n          \n              He opens a box and shows them one of the golden bullets.\n          \n                                    HASSAN (CONT'D)\n                        The hunter who gave it to me said\n                        you can hit up to three kilometers\n                        away.\n          \n                                    ABDULLAH\n                        How much do you want for everything?\n          \n                                    HASSAN\n                        One thousand dirhams.\n          \n                                                                           2.\n          \n                                    ABDULLAH\n                        One thousand dirhams?

YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY\n          \n              Hassan and Abdullah's family are behind the house. Hassan\n              stands with the rifle in front of a rock some twenty yards\n              away and he turns toward Abdullah.\n          \n                                    HASSAN\n                        With this rifle, your sons will be\n                        able to kill plenty of jackals.\n          \n              He aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding\n              the rifle properly. It is clear that he doesn't know how to\n              fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. The rifle kicks\n              and hits him roughly in the shoulder. The bullet flies far\n              wide of the rock. The women laugh nervously.\n          \n              Rubbing his shoulder, Hassan turns to Abdullah.\n          \n                                    HASSAN (CONT'D)\n                        Let one of your sons shoot.\n          \n              Abdullah looks at his boys and points at the younger one.\n          \n                                    ABDULLAH\n                        Let Yussef shoot.\n          \n              When Hassan is about to hand Yussef the rifle, Ahmed cuts\n              him off, upset.\n          \n                                    AHMED\n                        I want to shoot first.\n          \n              Father and son exchange an angry glance. Hassan, without\n              realizing it, turns and gives the rifle to Ahmed. The boy\n              grabs the gun: it is heavier than he thought.\n          \n                                    HASSAN\n                        Look, load it like this.\n          \n              Hassan opens the chamber, inserts the bullet and then closes\n              it. Once it is loaded, he points at the safety.\n          \n                                    HASSAN (CONT'D)\n                        This is the safety. Push it in when\n                        you're ready.\n          \n              Ahmed nods. Unsure of himself, he raises the rifle and,\n              almost without aiming, fires. The shot kicks up dust far\n              from the rock. His sisters laugh.\n          \n                                                                            3.\n          \n                                    HASSAN (CONT'D)\n                        If he doesn't hit the jackals, at\n                        least he'll scare the shit out of\n                        them.\n          \n              Ahmed lowers the rifle. His father grabs it and gives it to\n              Yussef enthusiastically.\n          \n                                      ABDULLAH\n                        Your turn.\n          \n              Yussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently. He lifts\n              the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming. He seems\n              innately skilled at the maneuver. He shoots and the bullet\n              hits just below the rock.\n          \n              Abdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to Hassan.\n          \n                                    ABDULLAH (CONT'D)\n                        Now this kid shoots a hell of a lot\n                        better than you.\n          \n          5   EXT. GOAT CORRAL -- LATER\n          \n              Yussef takes one of the goats out, ties and ropes it and\n              gives it to Hassan. Abdullah supervises. Yasira approaches\n              and gives Abdullah a bag.\n          \n                                      YASIRA\n                        Your lunch.\n          \n              Abdullah takes it and turns to his sons.\n          \n                                    ABDULLAH\n                        You better kill at least three\n                        jackals.\n          \n                                    HASSAN\n                        And make sure no one sees you with\n                        the rifle, hide it if you see someone\n                        approach you.\n          \n              Ahmed nods.   Abdullah and Hassan go on their way.\n          \n          6   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- LATER\n          \n              Yasira and Yamil are far from the house, cleaning some\n              goatskins stretched out on some branches.\n          \n              Ahmed, with the rifle in his hands, opens the corral gate\n              and enters to herd them out. He calls his brother.\n          \n                                    AHMED\n                        Yussef, Yussef...\n          \n                                                                             4.\n          \n          7    EXT. SIDE WALL, YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n               Yussef is squatting on the other side of the house, spying\n               through a crack, breathing excitedly.\n          \n          8    INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS\n          \n               Zora is inside, undressing. She has a long body and her\n               cinnamon skin is soft and clean. Every now and then she\n               aims a complicit glance at the crack through which Yussef is\n               spying.\n          \n                                        AHMED (O.S.)\n                         Yussef...\n          \n               Zora turns around toward where the voice is coming from.\n          \n          9    EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY\n          \n               Yussef is still spying.    Ahmed approaches.\n          \n                                     AHMED\n                         What are you doing?\n          \n               Yussef turns around and signals for him to lower his voice.\n          \n                                     AHMED (CONT'D)\n                         I told you not to spy on her again.\n          \n               Yussef pays no attention and keeps spying. Ahmed pulls him\n               by the shoulder and makes him lose his balance. Yussef falls\n               on his ass.\n          \n                                     AHMED (CONT'D)\n                         I said don't spy on her.\n          \n               Yussef gets up and dusts himself off.\n          \n                                     YUSSEF\n                         What the hell do you care?\n          \n                                     AHMED\n                         Come on, let's go.\n          \n               He turns around and leaves.\n          \n          10   EXT. DESERT -- DAY\n          \n               The goats graze. Yussef and Ahmed watch them sitting on the\n               side of a hill. They look hot and bored. They both throw\n               stones at a small rusty can. Yussef throws one and misses.\n               Ahmed throws his and does. He draws a line in the ground.\n          \n                                        AHMED\n                         Five to two.\n          \n               A jackal is stalking the goats.

Yussef points at\n               it, but Ahmed still cannot locate it. Yussef despairs.\n          \n                                       YUSSEF (CONT'D)\n                         Over there.\n          \n               Ahmed finally spots it. He loads the rifle, but when he is\n               about to aim, the rifle fires. The shot hits amidst the\n               goats, lifting up a small cloud of dust.\n          \n                                     YUSSEF (CONT'D)\n                         What are you doing, you idiot?\n          \n               The jackal flees, terrified, while the goats scamper in\n               different directions.\n          \n          11   EXT.

They come to Susan, who\n               becomes instantly uncomfortable. She gestures with her hand\n               to say they have no money, but the kids insist.\n          \n                                     BOYS (CONT'D)\n                         Stilo...stilo...\n          \n                                     SUSAN\n                         I don't have any money...

Susan stares at the boy with\n               the binoculars for a moment and then gets in.\n          \n          26   INT. BUS -- LATER\n          \n               Susan sits next to the window, in the middle of the bus.\n               She looks hurt and sad. Richard walks over and sits next to\n               her.\n          \n               The bus starts. Through the window, Richard can still see\n               the boy with the binoculars. He smiles until he sees an older\n               boy snatch the binoculars away and push the little boy.\n          \n               The bus drives away, but Richard can't take his eyes off the\n               scene. The older boy walks away with the binoculars.\n          \n          27   EXT. DESERT -- DAY\n          \n               The bus drives down a straight road that divides the desert.\n          \n          28   INT. BUS -- MOMENTS LATER\n          \n               The bus drives on. Some of the old men sleep. Susan leans\n               her head against the window and watches the landscape scroll\n               past. Richard sits beside her silently.\n          \n               Susan holds out her hand and takes Richard's, as a sign of\n               reconciliation. He holds hers and caresses it.\n          \n               Susan gets comfortable to try to sleep. She closes her eyes\n               when suddenly something smashes the window and Susan collapses\n               forward.\n          \n               Richard turns to look at the punctured glass and then Susan.\n          \n                                     RICHARD\n                         Susan, what's wrong?\n          \n                                                                           19.\n          \n               Susan doesn't answer, limp on her seat.\n          \n                                     RICHARD (CONT'D)\n                         What happened?\n          \n               Richard lifts her up and when he does he sees a thread of\n               blood run down her neck. Richard yells at the driver.\n          \n                                     RICHARD (CONT'D)\n                         Stop the bus, stop, my wife's been\n                         hurt.\n          \n          29   INT. VOLLEYBALL COURT -- DAY\n          \n               In an indoor volleyball court with bleachers, several Japanese\n               girls play volleyball. They all compete intensely for the\n               point. There is excitement, but everything occurs quietly.\n          \n               A player jumps and spikes the ball. Chieko (16), tall,\n               beautiful, with strands of hair painted purple, volleys the\n               ball back up. It reaches one of her teammates who sets up\n               another to spike it.\n          \n               Chieko's team wins the point. The referee, instead of\n               whistling, lifts up a red flag.\n          \n               The players congratulate each other silently, in sign\n               language. The only sound we can here is the parents' clapping\n               as they watch the game from the stands.\n          \n               Chieko's team serves. Again, the game is heated. A rival\n               player spikes the ball, and it is barely out of bounds.\n               However, the referee, with his red flag, calls the point.\n          \n               Chieko is upset and goes to argue with him.\n          \n                                     CHIEKO\n                             (In sign language)\n                         The ball was out.\n          \n                                     REFEREE\n                             (In sign language)\n                         No, it was good.\n          \n               Chieko gestures violently.   One of her teammates goes to\n               calm her down.\n          \n                                      TEAMMATE\n                         Let it go.\n          \n               Chieko breaks loose and approaches the referee.\n          \n                                     CHIEKO\n                         That was out.\n          \n                                     REFEREE\n                         It was on the line.\n          \n                                                                            20.\n          \n                                     CHIEKO\n                         You're not just deaf, you're blind.\n          \n                                        REFEREE\n                         You're out.\n          \n               Chieko is furious.   She starts to make obscene gestures.\n          \n                                     CHIEKO\n                         You're an asshole.\n          \n               The coach walks onto the court. He holds her to calm her\n               down and then takes her away. Despite Chieko's violent\n               reaction, everything is still silent. From the bleachers,\n               Yasujiro (47), Chieko's father, dressed in a nice suit with\n               the tie undone, with a sad pride about him, disapproves of\n               his daughter's actions.\n          \n          30   INT. LOCKER ROOM, VOLLEYBALL COURT -- DAY\n          \n               Chieko sits on a bench in her underwear. She looks aggravated\n               and absorbed in her own thoughts. Her other teammates get\n               dressed. Two of them walk past wrapped in towels, freshly\n               showered, and stand in front of her.

EVE'S -- DAY\n          \n               Eve's is a restaurant full of t.v.'s, noise, video games.\n               There is smoke, and people talking everywhere. Chieko moves\n               through the crowd. A hostess intercepts her.\n          \n                                     HOSTESS\n                         Do you have a table?\n          \n               Chieko doesn't manage to read her lips. The hostess, smiling,\n               awaits an answer. Chieko waits, expectant, for the hostess\n               to repeat herself.\n          \n                                     HOSTESS (CONT'D)\n                         Do you have a table?\n          \n               Chieko nods and points at her group of girlfriends, who are\n               sitting on the barstools next to the bar.\n          \n               The hostess smiles another stupid smile and lets Chieko by.\n               Further off, her friends spot her and make silly faces.\n          \n               Chieko laughs, walks over to them. They are all dressed the\n               same: short skirts, tight t-shirts. Some of them have\n               piercings in their nose, lips and ears. They all exude\n               hormones in their silence.\n          \n               Chieko goes to talk to them in sign language.\n          \n                                     CHIEKO\n                         Why all the way in the corner?\n          \n               Mitsu, with a good body, not very tall and with violet\n               highlights in her hair, points at a pair of tables where a\n               group of young men are drinking beer.\n          \n                                     MITSU\n                         Because of the view.\n          \n               Chieko turns around and stares at one of them wearing a Milan\n               jersey. Their eyes meet. Chieko keeps her eyes on him, and\n               the boy finally turns away.\n          \n                                     MITSU (CONT'D)\n                         Do you like him?\n          \n               Chieko nods without taking her eyes off him.\n          \n                                                                            23.\n          \n          34   INT. EVE'S -- DAY\n          \n               Chieko, Mitsu and another of their friends are playing a\n               pinball game that makes noises whenever the ball hits a wall.\n               The young man in the Milan jersey approaches Chieko.\n          \n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Hello.\n          \n               Neither Chieko, nor her friends answer. The guy turns to\n               look at one of his friends, who signals for him to insist.\n          \n                                     YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)\n                         Can I play with you?\n          \n               Chieko, obviously, cannot hear him. She keeps playing.\n               Suddenly, Mitsu notices the young man's presence and taps\n               Chieko on the shoulder. Chieko turns around and is surprised.\n          \n               The young man turns to look toward his friends as he speaks.\n          \n                                     YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)\n                         Do you want to come have a drink?\n          \n               Chieko gets frustrated; she cannot read his lips. He stops\n               looking at his friends and awaits an answer, but all he sees\n               is three silent girls staring at him stupefied.\n          \n               Chieko talks to Mitsu in sign language.\n          \n                                     CHIEKO\n                         Tell him I couldn't read his lips.\n          \n               The young man, upon seeing them communicate, is caught off\n               guard. He turns around and walks toward his friends without\n               saying a word.\n          \n          35   INT. BATHROOM, EVE'S -- DAY\n          \n               Chieko leans on the sink while Mitsu pees in one of the\n               stalls. Chieko is noticeably upset.\n          \n               Mitsu walks out of the stall, fixing her skirt.   She sees\n               Chieko is distressed.\n          \n                                     MITSU\n                             (In sign language)\n                         What's the matter?\n          \n                                     CHIEKO\n                             (In sign language)\n                         They look at us like we're monsters.\n          \n                                     MITSU\n                         Oh, come off it.\n          \n                                                                              24.\n          \n               Chieko is at a loss for words. Mitsu stares at her: it looks\n               like another one of many tantrums.\n          \n               Chieko hikes up her skirt and starts to pull down her panties.\n          \n                                     MITSU (CONT'D)\n                         What are you doing?\n          \n                                     CHIEKO\n                         Now they're going to meet the real\n                         hairy monster.\n          \n               She makes the gesture of sticking her finger up a hole, then\n               goes to the toilet, throws her panties in and flushes. She\n               turns to look at Mitsu defiantly, who cannot help but laugh.\n          \n          36   INT. EVE'S -- DAY\n          \n               Chieko sits on one of the restaurant's benches. Before her\n               is a new group of young men. Mitsu and Chieko exchange a\n               look. Provocatively, Chieko crosses her legs slowly revealing\n               her pussy.\n          \n               One of the young men seems to notice, and is stunned. Chieko\n               smiles and does it again. He watches Chieko again and\n               discretely turns to one of his friends to tell him.\n          \n               Chieko turns her back to him and faces the bar.    She looks\n               over at Mitsu, who shakes her head, amused.\n          \n               A beeper rings on Chieko's skirt. She picks it up and reads:\n               \"Don't forget your appointment with the dentist. Papa.\"\n          \n               She puts the beeper away and turns toward Mitsu.\n          \n                                     CHIEKO\n                         I'll see you later at my place.\n          \n               She mischievously turns toward the table where the young man\n               was, and as she gets off the bench she spreads her legs wide\n               open, flashing him shamelessly.\n          \n               She struts out.\n          \n          37   EXT.

Some of them get left behind and Yussef hurries back to\n               them. As they climb a hill, he slips and falls, rolls\n               downhill and drops the rifle, which slides a few meters away.\n          \n               Ahmed runs to help him.

Chieko observes her\n               grotesque mouth. She then looks at the old man's bored face,\n               the old woman's feigned interest, the mother's annoyed\n               expression, and the boy, who rocks his head to the music.\n          \n               A man walks out and the receptionist gestures at Chieko and\n               points toward the door.\n          \n          81   INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE -- DAY\n          \n               The dentist (47) - tall and, unlike the receptionist, with\n               impeccable skin covering his hardened, attractive face -\n               examines Chieko's mouth. His face comes very close to hers\n               as he looks at her, making her nervous. The fat receptionist\n               walks in without knocking.\n          \n                                     RECEPTIONIST\n                         Here are the sterilized drill bits.\n          \n               The dentist looks up at her. She leaves the drill bits on a\n               table and leaves. The dentist turns back to Chieko and speaks\n               face to face with her so she can read his lips.\n          \n                                      DENTIST\n                         I-think-you-have-two-cavities-in-\n                         your-molars.\n          \n               She smiles. The dentist moves closer to Chieko's mouth again;\n               she cannot stop looking at him.\n          \n               Suddenly, Chieko licks his cheek. He is surprised, but\n               continues his checkup. She licks him again, this time on the\n               lips. He pulls away, flustered.\n          \n                                     DENTIST (CONT'D)\n                         What are you doing?\n          \n               She grabs his hand, puts it on her inner thigh and rubs it\n               against her pubis.\n          \n               He, confused, tries to pull his hand away, but she prevents\n               him from doing so. The scene starts to turn slightly\n               grotesque. After a slight struggle, he pulls his hand back.\n          \n                                     DENTIST (CONT'D)\n                         What's the matter with you?\n          \n               She grabs his hand again and, again, pulls it toward her\n               pubis. He gets angry and moves back. The fat woman enters\n               again without knocking, sees they are agitated and, without\n               a word, walks out and closes the door.\n          \n                                                                             49.\n          \n               The dentist turns toward Chieko.\n          \n                                       DENTIST (CONT'D)\n                           Get out.\n          \n               She shakes her head. She is excited, anxious, scared,\n               fragile. He pulls her by her wrist out of the chair.\n          \n                                       DENTIST (CONT'D)\n                           Get out right now.\n          \n               He walks to the door and opens it. Just before she walks\n               out, Chieko draws out a slight smile, which is almost a grin.\n          \n          82   EXT. TOKYO STREETS -- DAY\n          \n               Chieko walks down crowded Tokyo streets.   She walks with a\n               lost gaze, unsettled.\n          \n          83   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, TOKYO -- DAY\n          \n               Chieko arrives at an upper class apartment complex. The\n               architecture is cutting edge, but impersonal and cold.\n          \n          84   INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY\n          \n               Chieko enters the lobby. Beside the doorman are two men\n               dressed in suits: Kenji (31) and Hamano (50). The janitor\n               gestures at Chieko with his chin. The men walk over toward\n               her and cut her off.\n          \n                                       HAMANO\n                           Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?\n          \n               Chieko doesn't manage to read his lips. She is silent. The\n               doorman notices the situation, walks out from behind his\n               small desk and shouts at the men.\n          \n                                       DOORMAN\n                           She's deaf mute.

Hamano stands squarely\n               in front of her and speaks slowly, emphasizing every word.\n          \n                                       HAMANO\n                           Are-you-Yasujiro-Wataya's-daughter?\n          \n               She nods.\n          \n                                       HAMANO (CONT'D)\n                           We-are-sargeants-Kenji-Mamiya-and-\n                           Hamano-Kanoo-of-the-Tokyo-police.\n                           We-need-to-find-your-father.\n          \n               She pulls out a pen and a piece of paper from her bag.

Upon\n               receiving it, Chieko turns to look at him. Their eyes meet\n               and she looks down. She then looks up again, blushing.\n          \n                                     KENJI\n                         Tell him to call us.

The two cops leave.    As\n               soon as they do, Chieko heads toward the elevator.\n          \n          85   INT. CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- DAY\n          \n               Chieko walks into the apartment. It is a large apartment,\n               elegantly furnished. Although decoration is scant, some\n               hunting trophies stand out: a scimitar-horned Oryx, sheep,\n               and others. There are also photographs of Yasujiro hunting.\n          \n               A wall is dedicated to family photos.

She puts\n               the policeman's card down and picks up a note from her father\n               that says: \"I waited until five and you didn't make it.\n               I've got a meeting and I'll be back late.

CHIEKO'S ROOM -- DAY\n          \n               Chieko sits in front of a mute T.V., channel surfing.   She\n               stops at a fashion show, then some cartoons.\n          \n               Suddenly, on a news program, we see the photographs of Ahmed\n               and Yussef. Chieko looks at them for a moment and then\n               changes the channel. She is watching T.V. when a red bulb,\n               set between a yellow bulb and a blue one, starts to light up\n               insistently as the doorbell rings.\n          \n               Chieko notices and shuts off the T.V.\n          \n          87   INT.

Mitsu sees the policeman's card\n               on the entrance table and looks at it. Chieko comes back\n               and Mitsu asks her about it in sign language.\n          \n                                     MITSU\n                         The cops came again?\n          \n                                    CHIEKO\n                         Yeah.

STREET, TOKYO -- DAY\n          \n                Chieko walks down the street with Mitsu. They are good-\n                looking and attract attention. They know this and look back\n                out of the corners of their eyes.\n          \n          123   EXT. PARK, TOKYO -- DAY\n          \n                They arrive at a park with a playground: swings, see-saws,\n                slides. Several of their deaf-mute volleyball friends are\n                there.\n          \n                With them are two young men with hair dyed blond. One of\n                them, Takeshi (18), has an earring, and the other, Haruki\n                (19), has several tattoos.\n          \n                Mitsu and Chieko greet them in sign language.    Chieko asks\n                the slightly chubby Kumiko who they are.\n          \n                                      KUMIKO\n                          They're my cousins.\n          \n                Chieko turns to look at them, curious. Haruki, the guy with\n                tattoos, exchanges a look with her. Chieko suddenly feels\n                intimidated and looks down.\n          \n                                      CHIEKO\n                          Is he deaf-mute like us?\n          \n                                      KUMIKO\n                          No, but he understands some.\n          \n                Haruki seems to understand what they're saying and leans in\n                to whisper something to Takeshi, his brother. They both\n                laugh.\n          \n                Haruki approaches Chieko and talks to her face to face so\n                she can read his lips.\n          \n                                                                                 72.\n          \n                                      HARUKI\n                          What's your name?\n          \n                Chieko and her friend smile.    Chieko takes out her notebook\n                and pen and writes her name.    Haruki reads it out loud.\n          \n                                         HARUKI (CONT'D)\n                          Chieko?\n          \n                Chieko nods.\n          \n                                      HARUKI (CONT'D)\n                          My name's Haruki.\n          \n                Chieko nods, trying to show she's understood. Haruki takes\n                out a flask and holds it out to her. Chieko opens it and\n                smells it. Haruki stands in front of her.\n          \n                                         HARUKI (CONT'D)\n                          It's whisky.\n          \n                Chieko smiles and gives a long swig.       Mitsu asks for some\n                and also gives it a long drink.\n          \n                                      HARUKI (CONT'D)\n                          Do the cops come around here?\n          \n                                      MITSU\n                              (Gutturally)\n                          Sometimes.\n          \n                Haruki takes out some ecstasy and gives it to them. Mitsu\n                and Chieko look at each other and down the pills with a gulp\n                of whisky.\n          \n          124   EXT. PARK, TOKYO -- LATER\n          \n                Half-drunk and rushing from the pills, Chieko, her friends,\n                and Haruki and Takeshi, play on the swings and see-saw.\n                They laugh at almost anything. Haruki and Chieko are on the\n                see-saw and every time Chieko rises, Haruki looks at her\n                bush. Chieko knows this sometimes opens her legs even more\n                so he can look to his heart's content. Hormones float in\n                the air.\n          \n                Mitsu also takes advantage of the occasion. She flirts with\n                Haruki whenever she can. Haruki looks happy to be the object\n                of their attention.\n          \n                Takeshi, who has started to make out with one of Chieko's\n                friends, turns to the group and speaks slowly.\n          \n                                      TAKESHI\n                          Why- don't- we- go- to- Montana?\n          \n                                                                             73.\n          \n          125   INT. TAXI, TOKYO -- EVENING\n          \n                Night begins to fall. Haruki sits between Mitsu and Chieko.\n                He strokes Chieko's knee with his hand; she seems turned on.\n          \n          126   EXT. NIGHTCLUB STRIP, TOKYO -- NIGHT\n          \n                The taxi parks outside the Montana. Chieko, Mitsu and Haruki\n                get out of the car and meet with the others at the door.\n          \n          127   INT. HALLWAY, NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT\n          \n                They enter. The music, the light, the crowd, it is almost\n                hallucinatory. For Chieko, it is a silent concert of movement\n                and chaos.\n          \n                She and her friends push their way through the place. Haruki\n                grabs Chieko by the hand, pulls her toward the floor and\n                starts dancing. Chieko looks at the other dancers' rhythm\n                and follows. She slowly manages to follow.\n          \n                The other deaf-mutes also dance. Some do better than others,\n                lost in the sea of lights and people.\n          \n                For Chieko, the dance turns into something hypnotic. She\n                dances with her eyes closed, concentrated on her own rhythm.\n          \n                When she opens her eyes, she sees that Mitsu, a little drunk,\n                is grinding against Haruki, feeling him up.\n          \n                Chieko seems annoyed by this and goes to defend her territory.\n                She starts dancing next to Haruki, but she is constantly\n                interrupted by the surrounding crowd.\n          \n                The struggle between Chieko and Mitsu is a little bit\n                ridiculous. It is finally resolved when Mitsu takes Haruki\n                by the face and starts to kiss him. Chieko doesn't know what\n                to do. Mitsu and Haruki start to make out intensely.\n          \n                Suddenly Chieko is left standing in the middle of the club,\n                motionless, while her friends dance awkwardly and Mitsu and\n                Haruki are having the time of their lives. Chieko, defeated\n                by her friend, decides to leave. Mitsu spots her out of the\n                corner of her eye and waves goodbye. Chieko smiles back and\n                walks away from her friends as they dance.\n          \n          128   INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT\n          \n                Chieko enters her building and goes straight to the doorman.\n          \n                                      DOORMAN\n                          Good evening, how may I help you?\n          \n                Chieko takes out a piece of paper and a pen from her purse\n                and writes a note. She gives it to the doorman together\n                with Kenji's card. He reads it carefully, and when he's\n                done he turns to her.\n          \n                                                                            74.\n          \n                                      DOORMAN (CONT'D)\n                          Very well miss, I'll call him now.\n          \n                The doorman picks up a cordless phone and dials.\n          \n                                      DOORMAN (CONT'D)\n                          Lieutenant Kenji Mamiya, please?\n          \n                There is a pause. The doorman gestures to Chieko that the\n                lieutenant will answer in a moment.\n          \n                                      DOORMAN (CONT'D)\n                          Lieutenant? Yes, look, I'm with the\n                          deaf-mute girl you saw in the\n                          afternoon, and she asked me to call\n                          you... Yes, her... She says she needs\n                          to talk to you, alone... about her\n                          father... If it's possible, in her\n                          apartment, tonight.\n          \n                Chieko watches attentively.\n          \n          129   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY\n          \n                Yussef and Ahmed are sitting against the wall of the house.\n                Yussef's lip is split. Ahmed's nose is bleeding.\n          \n                Abdullah paces desperately, while his wife and daughters\n                watch the scene, silent. Abdullah stops to look at Yussef.\n          \n                                      ABDULLAH\n                          Why did you do this?\n          \n                They don't answer.   Abdullah leans over and slaps Ahmed.\n          \n                                      ABDULLAH (CONT'D)\n                          Answer me, god damn it!\n          \n                Ahmed won't answer and he turns to Yussef again.\n          \n                                      YUSSEF\n                          We were testing the rifle.\n          \n                Abdullah turns and gives Yussef a powerful slap, which he\n                endures with silent dignity.\n          \n                                      ABDULLAH\n                          Are you idiots?

Abdullah walks two steps forward and slaps\n                Zora.

Is there something you\n                            wanted to tell me?\n          \n                Chieko nods and asks him in with her hand. Kenji takes off\n                his shoes and leaves them at the door. Chieko leads him to\n                the living room and with a gesture asks if he wants anything\n                to drink.\n          \n                                        KENJI (CONT'D)\n                            Do you have tea?\n          \n                Chieko nods and goes into the kitchen. Kenji glances over\n                the apartment. Chieko comes back from the kitchen holding a\n                strange gadget which she puts on the living room table. A\n                small bulb lights. Kenji just watches her.\n          \n                Chieko gestures for him to sit down.     Kenji and Chieko sit\n                across from each other.\n          \n                                                                          95.\n          \n                Chieko takes out her notebook and pen, writes something down\n                and hands it over to Kenji. Kenji reads, seems surprised\n                and reads again slowly.\n          \n                                      KENJI (CONT'D)\n                          \"My father had nothing to do with my\n                          mother's death,\" what's this?\n          \n                Chieko is disconcerted at the question. She takes her\n                notebook and starts writing. Kenji reads and turns to her.\n          \n                                      KENJI (CONT'D)\n                          Your father was asleep when she jumped\n                          off the balcony?\n          \n                She nods. She gets up, asks Kenji to go with her and walks\n                toward the balcony.\n          \n          163   EXT. BALCONY, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n          \n                She opens the door to the balcony and points at the void:\n                it's over twelve floors. Kenji looks over; the distance is\n                dizzying. Chieko writes in her notebook and shows him the\n                piece of paper.\n          \n                                      KENJI\n                          You saw her jump?\n          \n                She nods and writes again.    She looks perturbed.\n          \n                                      KENJI (CONT'D)\n                          You've already told the other\n                          officers?\n          \n                She nods again.   Kenji holds her by her arms.\n          \n                                      KENJI (CONT'D)\n                          I don't know what you're talking\n                          about.\n          \n                Chieko remains motionless for a few seconds. She scrawls in\n                her notebook \"Then why do you want to talk to my father?\"\n                Kenji reads and then turns to her.\n          \n                                      KENJI (CONT'D)\n                          It's about a hunting rifle in his\n                          name.\n          \n                The red bulb on the gadget starts to blink. Chieko spots it\n                from the balcony and signals to Kenji that she has to go to\n                the kitchen. She runs off.\n          \n          164   INT. LIVING ROOM, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n          \n                Kenji stands and looks at the photographs of Yasujiro hunting\n                all over the world: with a kudu in Africa, a black bear in\n                Kamchatka, Hassan and the Oryx in Morocco.\n          \n                                                                       96.\n          \n          Chieko comes back with a cup of steaming tea.\n          \n                                KENJI\n                    Does your father still hunt?\n          \n          She shakes her head.   She writes something and hands it over.\n          \n                                KENJI (CONT'D)\n                    There was an incident with a rifle\n                    in your father's name. That's why\n                    we want to talk to him.\n          \n          The news weighs on Chieko; she looks away. The sounds of\n          Tokyo come in through the living room: its car horns, its\n          voices.\n          \n          Suddenly a rush of wind comes in. Chieko sees the balcony\n          doors are open and goes to close them. She then comes back\n          to the living room and sits down, dejected.\n          \n          Kenji sits down beside her and leaves the tea on the table.\n          He doesn't know what to do and looks uncomfortable.\n          \n          She picks up the notebook and writes.    Kenji reads.\n          \n                                KENJI (CONT'D)\n                    No, your father isn't going to jail.\n                    We just need to talk to him.\n          \n          There is a long silence. Chieko seems immersed in a remote,\n          inaccessible world. Kenji turns his face to hers so that\n          she can read his lips.\n          \n                                KENJI (CONT'D)\n                    I have to go now. Thank you.\n          \n          Chieko grabs his arm and shakes her head, urging him to stay.\n          They exchange a look for an instant and Kenji insists.\n          \n                                KENJI (CONT'D)\n                    I have to go.\n          \n          He gets up to leave. Chieko signals for him to wait for a\n          moment and goes to her room.\n          \n          Kenji stands in the middle of the room, waiting.    Chieko\n          comes back completely naked. Her skin bristles.\n          \n          She walks toward him, breathing through her mouth. Kenji is\n          disconcerted when he sees the quiet teenager approach. She\n          walks all the way up to Kenji and when she is about to take\n          another step, he holds her back with both hands.\n          \n                                KENJI (CONT'D)\n                    What are you doing?\n          \n                                                                               97.\n          \n                She doesn't pay attention, breaks free and stands a few inches\n                away from him. She is almost panting. She holds out her\n                hand and caresses Kenji's ear. He stands there, immobile,\n                without taking his eyes off Chieko's.\n          \n                She takes his hand and puts it on one of her breasts. Kenji\n                strokes her breast and then pulls his hand away. She grabs\n                it again and puts it back on.\n          \n                                      KENJI (CONT'D)\n                          No, no, no... this is wrong.\n          \n                Kenji looks turned on and confused: Chieko is beautiful, but\n                he knows he cannot go on and takes his hand away.\n          \n                                         KENJI (CONT'D)\n                          No, I can't.     You're just a girl.\n          \n                She walks up to his face and licks it.    He is confused.\n          \n                                      KENJI (CONT'D)\n                          Enough, please.\n          \n                He grabs her by her arms and moves her away. She grabs the\n                sleeve of his jacket and pulls him back. She hugs him and\n                suddenly Chieko starts crying, disconsolate.\n          \n                Kenji, bewildered, first does nothing, but upon seeing\n                Chieko's despair, holds her. She buries her face in his\n                shoulder. Her nakedness becomes increasingly fragile.\n          \n          165   EXT. DESERT -- DAY\n          \n                Abdullah, afraid, watches his son shoot. The police have\n                stopped firing and run for cover. Yussef loads the rifle\n                again and aims carefully. He shoots and, in the distance,\n                we can see one of the headlights on a police truck shatter.\n          \n                Abdullah shouts at Yussef desperately.\n          \n                                      ABDULLAH\n                          Yussef, stop shooting!\n          \n                Furious, Yussef loads the rifle again and starts shooting at\n                the cops. Ahmed won't stop screaming from the pain. Confused,\n                Abdullah doesn't know if he should console his wounded son\n                or stop the enraged Yussef.\n          \n                In the distance, the cops reorganize.    We hear the faraway\n                shots of Alarid giving orders.\n          \n                                      ALARID\n                          Move that truck... god damn it...\n          \n                One of the cops gets onto a truck and uses it as a parapet.\n                Yussef aims again, but this time the policemen are well\n                covered. Abdullah drags himself all the way to Yussef.\n          \n                                                                     98.\n          \n                                ABDULLAH\n                    Give me that rifle...\n          \n          Yussef turns to his father.\n          \n                                YUSSEF\n                    They're going to kill us.\n          \n                                ABDULLAH\n                    Give me that rifle.\n          \n          He tries to wrest it away, but Yussef resists. The struggle\n          and Abdullah finally pulls it away. When Yussef tries to\n          snatch it back, the police fire a round of shots and the two\n          barely have time to hide.\n          \n          The air is thick with gunshots. Yussef and Abdullah,\n          terrified, stick to the stones. The bullets strike very\n          close to them, and they can't even raise their heads.\n          \n          Ahmed won't stop complaining.    Abdullah shouts at him.\n          \n                                ABDULLAH (CONT'D)\n                    Ahmed, don't move.\n          \n          The gunshots rain down for over a minute. When they stop,\n          Abdullah turns to look at Ahmed, who is lying motionless on\n          the rocks with bullet in his back.\n          \n                                 ABDULLAH (CONT'D)\n                    Ahmed!   Ahmed!\n          \n          Oblivious of the police, he gets up and runs toward him.\n          Motionless, Ahmed just moans. With every breath, his shirt\n          grows bloodier.\n          \n                                 ABDULLAH (CONT'D)\n                    Ahmed!   Ahmed!\n          \n          He rolls Ahmed over and lays his head on his lap. Abdullah\n          cannot stop crying. Yussef, ducking, runs toward his brother.\n          Abdullah laments nervously.\n          \n                                ABDULLAH (CONT'D)\n                    Don't die, don't die.\n          \n          Yussef is shocked upon seeing his dead brother. He stands\n          up and, without caring whether anyone fires at him or not,\n          he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that\n          he is not aiming, and starts to break it against the rocks.\n          \n          When he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks\n          toward the police. One of them policemen looks at him through\n          a pair of binoculars. Alarid interrogates him.\n          \n                                ALARID\n                    What's happening?\n          \n                                                                       99.\n          \n                                POLICE OFFICER\n                    A boy is walking this way.\n          \n                                   ALARID\n                    Is he armed?\n          \n          The officer takes a careful look.\n          \n                                POLICE OFFICER\n                    It doesn't look like it.\n          \n                                ALARID\n                    What are the others doing?\n          \n          The officer watches Abdullah carrying his wounded son.\n          \n                                POLICE OFFICER\n                    A man is holding somebody injured.\n          \n                                ALARID\n                    Is the other one still walking this\n                    way?\n          \n                                   POLICE OFFICER\n                    Yes.\n          \n          Alarid turns to the other officers.\n          \n                                   ALARID\n                    Aim.\n          \n          The police aim and hold Yussef in their sights.

BORDER CROSSING, MEXICO -- EVENING\n          \n                The illegal immigrants cross into Mexico, where they disband\n                into small groups. Amelia walks alone. Before she walks\n                away she turns to one of the other deported Mexicans.\n          \n                                      AMELIA\n                              (In Spanish)\n                          Do you have a cigarette?\n          \n                He acquiesces. He rummages through his pant pockets and\n                pulls out a pack of cigarettes. He offers one to Amelia, who\n                takes it. He also pulls out some matches and lights one.\n          \n                                                                          115.\n          \n                                         AMELIA (CONT'D)\n                          Thank you.\n          \n          187   EXT. STREET, TIJUANA -- EVENING\n          \n                Amelia smokes, drifting. After a while she sits on a sidewalk\n                and leans on a post. She looks into the street at the people\n                passing by and starts crying softly.\n          \n                A dusty and battered pick up truck arrives. Inside are her\n                son and her comadre. Her son steps down and hugs her in\n                silence as she cries. Her comadre observes them from a\n                distance.\n          \n          188   EXT. HAMLET -- EVENING\n          \n                The truck is parked in front of Anwar's house. Richard and\n                Susan wait in the back while the boy, Anwar and the vet lean\n                on the hood.\n          \n                Suddenly a helicopter with American insignia flies over them\n                and goes to land in an empty lot.\n          \n                Anwar looks up and watches the helicopter descend. The\n                helicopter kicks up a cloud of dust before the stunned gaze\n                of dozens of children. Some camels are frightened. Some\n                starving dogs bark at it.\n          \n          189   EXT. TOWN -- EVENING\n          \n                They carry Susan to the helicopter in a stretcher. They\n                load her in carefully. Richard follows her through the wind\n                generated by the helicopter. Anwar catches up to them to say\n                goodbye.\n          \n                                      ANWAR\n                          Good luck, mister...\n          \n                                      RICHARD\n                          Thank you for everything.\n          \n                Richard gives Anwar a hug which he responds to affectionately.\n                Richard takes out his wallet and holds out three hundred-\n                dollar bills, which Anwar rejects.\n          \n                                      ANWAR\n                          No sir, no... Allah be with you.\n          \n                They look each other in the eye and then Richard gets into\n                the chopper. It takes off.\n          \n          190   EXT. DESERT -- EVENING\n          \n                The helicopter silently flies over the Moroccan desert.\n          \n                                                                           116.\n          \n          191   EXT.

A group of doctors and nurses\n                with a stretcher wait in the parking lot. Several journalists\n                and cameras observe.\n          \n                Ken and his entourage await the helicopter's landing. The\n                helicopter approaches. The cameramen hurry to position\n                themselves for a better shot.\n          \n                A reporter speaks to the camera.\n          \n                                      REPORTER\n                          In this helicopter is Susan Jones,\n                          an American mother of two who was\n                          seriously injured in a terrorist\n                          attack. It appears fundamentalist\n                          organizations planned the attack...\n          \n                The helicopter settles softly in the parking lot. It is\n                immediately surrounded by several Moroccan soldiers. The\n                doctors on the ground prepare the stretcher.\n          \n                Ken walks hurriedly toward the chopper, guarding himself\n                from the wind.\n          \n                Susan is immediately placed on the stretcher and quickly\n                taken to the emergency room.

CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n          \n                Chieko, naked, sits in an armchair, again submerged in the\n                remote world of her silence. Before her, Kenji observes her\n                nakedness, her sadness, her pained beauty.\n          \n                For a while they remain motionless. She seems to return\n                from the long journey to herself and turns to look at him.\n                Their eyes meet. There are still tears in Chieko's eyes.\n                They hold each other's gaze until Chieko gets up, gets her\n                notebook, scribbles down some words and gives them to him.\n          \n                Kenji reads them and looks at her.\n          \n                                      KENJI\n                          You don't have to apologize for\n                          anything.\n          \n                She sits down beside him. They look at each other again for\n                a few, long seconds. Chieko takes his hand, strokes it for a\n                moment, kisses it, sucks one of his fingers and then puts it\n                back in its place.\n          \n                She grabs her notebook and starts writing a long note. It\n                takes her almost a minute to do so. Kenji, nervous because\n                of her proximity, watches her write feverishly.\n          \n                Chieko finishes writing, folds the note and hands it to Kenji.\n                Kenji starts unfolding it, but Chieko stops him. She takes\n                it away from him, folds it again and puts it in his breast\n                pocket. She signals for him to read it later.\n          \n                Kenji gets up to go. She stands next to him. Her nakedness\n                contrasts with Kenji's toughness. He bows his head to say\n                goodbye and she moves aside for him to pass. Kenji walks\n                past her as she watches.\n          \n                Kenji reaches the door. He opens it and turns to look at\n                Chieko again, who has been left in the middle of the hall.\n                He bows his head again and leaves.\n          \n                Chieko watches him leave and closes her eyes painfully.\n          \n          196   INT. ELEVATOR, CHIEKO'S BUILDING -- NIGHT\n          \n                Kenji rides the elevator down, touched, barely able to contain\n                his emotion. The elevator doors open and he walks out.\n          \n          197   INT.

There are still traces of Chieko's tears in her eyes.\n          \n                Yasujiro is affected when he sees his daughter like this,\n                but says nothing. He slowly walks toward her. Chieko looks\n                hurt, but whole.\n          \n                Yasujiro stands beside her. They look at each other. Chieko\n                holds out her hand and takes his. Chieko squeezes. She looks\n                at the city and then looks at her father's eyes.\n          \n                He strokes her hair and they both stand on the balcony, with\n                the massive city sprawling under them.\n          \n \n\n\n\n\n\nBabel\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Guillermo Arriaga\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:59.299873"}
