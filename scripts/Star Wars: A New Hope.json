Rebel spaceships, \n                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first \n                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.\n\n                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal \n                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the \n                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough \n                    power to destroy an entire planet.\n\n                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess \n                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of \n                    the stolen plans that can save her people and \n                    restore freedom to the galaxy...\n\n               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total \n               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny \n               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers \n               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed \n               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly \n               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing \n               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.\n\n<b>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY\n</b>\n               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-\n               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way \n               through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are \n               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His \n               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. \n               Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of \n               human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic \n               surface of an Art Deco design.\n\n               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\n\n<b>                                     THREEPIO\n</b>                         Did you hear that?

This is madness!\n\n               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in \n               the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.\n\n<b>                                     THREEPIO\n</b>                         We're doomed!\n\n               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that \n               only another robot could understand.\n\n<b>                                     THREEPIO\n</b>                         There'll be no escape for the Princess \n                         this time.\n\n               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as \n               loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment \n               are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.\n\n<b>                                     THREEPIO\n</b>                         What's that?\n\n<b>               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE\n</b>\n               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade \n               Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the \n               underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.\n\n<b>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n</b>\n               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a \n               tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and \n               a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make \n               their way into the smoke-filled corridor.\n\n               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with \n               laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns \n               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck \n               behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers \n               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered \n               arms and faces.\n\n               An explosion hits near the robots.\n\n<b>                                     THREEPIO\n</b>                         I should have known better than to \n                         trust the logic of a half-sized \n                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...\n\n               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages \n               around the two hapless robots.\n\n<b>               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY\n</b>\n               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. \n               The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone \n               figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations \n               who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy \n               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable \n               lad with a prize-winning smile.\n\n               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a \n               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the \n               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided \n               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot \n               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  \n               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and \n               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his \n               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying \n               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired \n               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet \n               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the \n               tiny robot to follow him.\n\n<b>                                     LUKE\n</b>                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you \n                         waiting for?! Get in gear!\n\n               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and \n               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his \n               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps \n               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum \n               madly.\n\n<b>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY\n</b>\n               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his \n               way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is \n               Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured \n               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which \n               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the \n               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away \n               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through \n               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run \n               in a frenzied panic.\n\n<b>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n</b>\n               A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  \n               Artoo makes beeping sounds.\n\n<b>               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n</b>\n               Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is \n               nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel \n               soldiers can be heard in the distance.\n\n<b>                                     THREEPIO\n</b>                         Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?\n\n               A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and \n               he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-\n               filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years \n               old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, \n               dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting \n               something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little \n               robot joins his companion.\n\n<b>                                     THREEPIO\n</b>                         At last!

The murky, moldy \n               den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic \n               alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At \n               first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, \n               furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over \n               drinks.

Old Ben moves in behind \n               Luke.\n\n<b>                                     BEN\n</b>                         This little one isn't worth the \n                         effort.

The entire fight has lasted only a matter \n               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is \n               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing \n               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben \n               points the the Wookiee.\n\n<b>                                     BEN\n</b>                         This is Chewbacca.

Han unfastens one of \n               Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.\n\n               Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one \n               of his ear-piercing howls.

Their barrage of \n               laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser \n               gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the \n               last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is \n               about to push the alarm system.

Luke aims his laser pistol \n               at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across \n               the abyss from them. They exchange fire.

Another trooper appears \n               and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  \n               Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet \n               of more troops.\n\n<b>                                     LEIA\n</b>                         Here they come!\n\n               Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and \n               he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the \n               gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He \n               tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the \n               princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him \n               quickly on the lips.

DEATH STAR TRENCH\n</b>\n               Vader's wingman panics at the sight of the oncoming pirate \n               starship and veers radically to one side, colliding with \n               Vader's TIE fighter in the process. Vader's wingman crashes \n               into the side wall of the trench and explodes. Vader's damaged \n               ship spins out of the trench with a damaged wing.\n\n<b>               EXT.

SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR\n</b>\n               Luke's torpedoes shoot toward the port and seems to simply \n               disappear into the surface and not explode. But the shots do \n               find their mark and have gone into the exhaust port and are \n               heading for the main reactor.\n\n<b>               INT.

Several small \n               flashes appear on the surface. The Death Star bursts into a \n               supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display.\n\n<b>               INT.

MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM\n</b>\n               Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main \n               temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners \n               are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the \n               beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly \n               march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From \n               one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired \n               Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to \n               an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the \n               whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other \n               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is \n               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  \n               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He \n               winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who \n               is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled \n               troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo \n               beeps with happiness.\n\n<b>                                                                  FADE OUT:\n</b>\n<b>               END CREDITS OVER STARS\n</b>\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Star-Wars-A-New-Hope.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Star Wars: A New Hope</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=George Lucas\" title=\"Scripts by George Lucas\">George Lucas</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Star Wars: A New Hope Script.html#comments\" title=\"Star Wars: A New Hope comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:17:10.801564"}
