Rebel spaceships, \n                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first \n                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.\n\n                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal \n                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the \n                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough \n                    power to destroy an entire planet.\n\n                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess \n                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of \n                    the stolen plans that can save her people and \n                    restore freedom to the galaxy...\n\n               The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total \n               eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny \n               silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers \n               from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed \n               by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly \n               laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing \n               the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY\n\n               An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-\n               D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way \n               through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are \n               old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His \n               face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. \n               Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of \n               human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic \n               surface of an Art Deco design.\n\n               Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Did you hear that? They've shut down \n                         the main reactor. We'll be destroyed \n                         for sure. This is madness!\n\n               Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in \n               the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         We're doomed!\n\n               The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that \n               only another robot could understand.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         There'll be no escape for the Princess \n                         this time.\n\n               Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as \n               loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment \n               are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         What's that?\n\n               EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE\n\n               The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade \n               Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the \n               underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\n               The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a \n               tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and \n               a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make \n               their way into the smoke-filled corridor.\n\n               In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with \n               laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns \n               creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck \n               behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers \n               who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered \n               arms and faces.\n\n               An explosion hits near the robots.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         I should have known better than to \n                         trust the logic of a half-sized \n                         thermocapsulary dehousing assister...\n\n               Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages \n               around the two hapless robots.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY\n\n               A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. \n               The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone \n               figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations \n               who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy \n               hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable \n               lad with a prize-winning smile.\n\n               A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a \n               large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the \n               desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided \n               by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot \n               appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  \n               A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and \n               he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his \n               utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying \n               the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired \n               Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet \n               above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the \n               tiny robot to follow him.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Hurry up! Come with me! What are you \n                         waiting for?! Get in gear!\n\n               The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and \n               smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his \n               arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps \n               into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum \n               madly.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY\n\n               The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his \n               way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is \n               Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured \n               by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which \n               stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the \n               Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away \n               from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through \n               the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run \n               in a frenzied panic.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\n               A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  \n               Artoo makes beeping sounds.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER\n\n               Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is \n               nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel \n               soldiers can be heard in the distance.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?\n\n               A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and \n               he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-\n               filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years \n               old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, \n               dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting \n               something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little \n               robot joins his companion.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         At last! Where have you been?\n\n               Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         They're heading in this direction. \n                         What are we going to do? We'll be \n                         sent to the spice mine of Kessel or \n                         smashed into who knows what!\n\n               Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the \n               subhallway. Threepio chases after him.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Wait a minute, where are you going?\n\n               Artoo responds with electronic beeps.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR\n\n               The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies \n               of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as \n               an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.\n\n                                     IMPERIAL OFFICER\n                         The Death Star plans are not in the \n                         main computer.\n\n               Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles \n               in vain.\n\n                                     VADER\n                         Where are those transmissions you \n                         intercepted?\n\n               Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.\n\n                                     VADER\n                         What have you done with those plans?\n\n                                     REBEL OFFICER\n                         We intercepted no transmissions. \n                         Aaah...

I want her alive!\n\n               The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.\n\n               INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY\n\n               The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the \n               stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia \n               Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her \n               eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds \n               of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the \n               troopers spots her.\n\n                                     TROOPER\n                         There she is! Set for stun!\n\n               Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with \n               her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a \n               paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.\n\n                                     TROOPER\n                         She'll be all right.

REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY\n\n               Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. \n               He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light \n               begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into \n               the cramped four-man pod.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Hey, you're not permitted in there. \n                         It's restricted.

Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty \n               empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to \n               get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist \n               at Luke as he flies past.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         I've told you kids to slow down!\n\n               INT. POWER STATION - DAY\n\n               Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged \n               mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been \n               asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the \n               office, yelling wildly.\n\n                                     FIXER\n                         Did I hear a young noise blast through \n                         here?\n\n                                     CAMIE\n                         It was just wormie on another rampage.\n\n               Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak \n               and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are \n               playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, \n               handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy \n               city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics \n               of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the \n               background.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Shape it up you guys!...

REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY\n\n               Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad \n               of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is \n               brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly \n               marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader \n               emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard \n               at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         Lord Vader, I should have known. \n                         Only you could be so bold.

Several \n                         transmissions were beamed to this \n                         ship by Rebel spies.

I was so close I thought \n                         I was going to fry my instruments. \n                         As it was I busted up the Skyhopper \n                         pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty \n                         upset. He grounded me for the rest \n                         of the season. You should have been \n                         there... it was fantastic.\n\n                                     BIGGS\n                         You ought to take it easy Luke. You \n                         may be the hottest bushpilot this \n                         side of Mos Eisley, but those little \n                         Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it \n                         up, and one day, whammo, you're going \n                         to be nothing more than a dark spot \n                         on the down side of a canyon wall.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Look who's talking.

It's been \n                         so... quiet.\n\n               Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.\n\n                                     BIGGS\n                         Luke, I didn't come back just to say \n                         good-bye...

It's what we always \n                         talked about. Luke, I'm not going to \n                         wait for the Empire to draft me into \n                         service.

I had to cancel my \n                         application. There has been a lot of \n                         unrest among the Sandpeople since \n                         you left... they've even raided the \n                         outskirts of Anchorhead.\n\n                                     BIGGS\n                         Your uncle could hold off a whole \n                         colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         I know, but he's got enough vaporators \n                         going to make the place pay off. He \n                         needs me for just one more season. I \n                         can't leave him now.\n\n                                     BIGGS\n                         I feel for you, Luke, you're going \n                         to have to learn what seems to be \n                         important or what really is important. \n                         What good is all your uncle's work \n                         if it's taken over by the Empire?... \n                         You know they're starting to \n                         nationalize commerce in the central \n                         systems... it won't be long before \n                         your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving \n                         for the greater glory of the Empire.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         It couldn't happen here. You said it \n                         yourself. The Empire won't bother \n                         with this rock.\n\n                                     BIGGS\n                         Things always change.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         I wish I was going...

TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET\n\n               The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange \n               foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures \n               fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock \n               canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he \n               goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for \n               a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.\n\n               In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall \n               and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little \n               further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a \n               pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the \n               narrow path.\n\n               The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until \n               suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out \n               of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages \n               one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his \n               back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then \n               off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller \n               than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they \n               cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and \n               their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be \n               seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave \n               the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down \n               the trail.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\n\n               The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-\n               like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a \n               small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a \n               large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot \n               is sucked into the giant machine.\n\n               The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders \n               and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.\n\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA\n\n               It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo \n               switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles \n               around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty \n               metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and \n               maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper \n               and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end \n               of the chamber.\n\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA\n\n               Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the \n               middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various \n               shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, \n               while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls \n               out from the gloom.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!\n\n               A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET\n\n               The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent \n               twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain \n               ridge.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY\n\n               Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-\n               buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. \n               A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.\n\n                                     FIRST TROOPER\n                         Someone was in the pod. The tracks \n                         go off in this direction.\n\n               A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand \n               and gives it to the first trooper.\n\n                                     SECOND TROOPER\n                         Look, sir -- droids.\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES\n\n               The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.\n\n               INT. SANDCRAWLER\n\n               Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped \n               prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Wake up! Wake up!\n\n               Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, \n               creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  \n               Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights \n               pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long \n               chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding \n               white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the \n               odd assortment of robots.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         We're doomed.\n\n               A Jawa starts moving toward them.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Do you think they'll melt us down?\n\n               Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this \n                         never end?\n\n               EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON\n\n               The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their \n               battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of \n               the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small \n               homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground \n               surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small \n               adobe block house.\n\n               The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening \n               them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. \n               The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting \n               small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils \n               should be.\n\n               Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, \n               a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are \n               sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully \n               inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- \n               shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little \n               Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales \n               pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.\n\n               A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the \n               homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru \n               standing in the main courtyard.\n\n                                     BERU\n                         Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a \n                         translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         It looks like we don't have much of \n                         a choice but I'll remind him.\n\n               Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment \n               for sale with the Jawa leader.\n\n                                     OWEN\n                         I have no need for a protocol droid.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                              (quickly)\n                         Sir -- not in an environment such as \n                         this -- that's why I've also been \n                         programmed for over thirty secondary \n                         functions that...\n\n                                     OWEN\n                         What I really need is a droid that \n                         understands the binary language of \n                         moisture vaporators.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Vaporators!

He is restrained \n               by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.\n\n               Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two \n               robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the \n               head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Uncle Owen...\n\n                                     OWEN\n                         Yeah?\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         This R2 unit has a bad motivator. \n                         Look!\n\n                                     OWEN\n                              (to the head Jawa)\n                         Hey, what're you trying to push on \n                         us?\n\n               The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked \n               out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract \n               attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps \n               Luke on the shoulder.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                              (pointing to Artoo)\n                         Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is \n                         in prime condition.

LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful \n               atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers \n               himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the \n               battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery \n               with a cord to his face.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Thank the maker!

Luke seems to be lost in thought \n               as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man \n               Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. \n               Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he \n               slams a wrench across the workbench.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         It just isn't fair.

A bit of his anger drains \n               and a tiny smile creeps across his face.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Well, not unless you can alter time, \n                         speed up the harvest, or teleport me \n                         off this rock!\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         I don't think so, sir.

Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to \n               scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome \n               pick.

He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-\n               dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being \n               projected from the face of little Artoo.

Suddenly something huge moves in front of \n               his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, \n               gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled \n               and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be \n               heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles \n               down the side of the mountain.\n\n               The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed \n               gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in \n               the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block \n               the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. \n               The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced \n               to the edge of a deep crevice.

The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts \n               and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then \n               everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan \n               is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the \n               Sandpeople fleeing in terror.\n\n               Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight \n               swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even \n               closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and \n               leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and \n               weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating \n               eyes and a scraggly white beard.

TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY\n\n               Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins \n               to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and \n               Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half \n               buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.\n\n               Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then \n               flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally \n               the mechanical man's systems turn on.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Where am I?

Ben glances around \n               suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the \n               air.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         Quickly, son... they're on the move.\n\n               INT.

Which reminds me...\n\n               Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  \n               As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the \n               restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  \n               Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the \n               table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle \n               with several electronic gadgets attached to it.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         I have something here for you.

He feared you \n                         might follow old Obi-Wan on some \n                         damned-fool idealistic crusade like \n                         your father did.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Sir, if you'll not be needing me, \n                         I'll close down for awhile.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Sure, go ahead.\n\n               Ben hands Luke the saber.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         What is it?\n\n                                     BEN\n                         Your fathers lightsaber.

His large blue eyes dominate a fur-\n               covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  \n               Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, \n               and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a \n               sight to behold.\n\n               Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times \n               during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets \n               out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit \n               disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between \n               Ben and the giant Wookiee.\n\n               Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips \n               his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear \n               or whatever.\n\n               A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.\n\n                                     CREATURE\n                         Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?\n\n               The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore \n               the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby \n               Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the \n               belligerent monstrosity.\n\n                                     HUMAN\n                         He doesn't like you.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         I'm sorry.\n\n                                     HUMAN\n                         I don't like you either.\n\n               The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some \n               unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young \n               adventurer.\n\n                                     HUMAN\n                         Don't insult us.

Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His \n               three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind \n               Luke.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         This little one isn't worth the \n                         effort.

No blaster!\n\n               With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life \n               and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut \n               in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, \n               cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns \n               off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. \n               Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, \n               attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter \n               of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is \n               given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing \n               his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben \n               points the the Wookiee.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         This is Chewbacca.

The gantry officer, in a momentary \n               state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling \n               howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. \n               The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted \n               by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the \n               robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed \n               as a stormtrooper.

DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE\n\n               Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits \n               as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, \n               bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio \n               completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious \n               glance.\n\n               Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         I can't see a thing in this helmet.\n\n               A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away \n               by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and \n               the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.\n\n               INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY\n\n               Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main \n               passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot \n               similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end \n               of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then \n               disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting \n               that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. \n               No one in the hallway seems to notice him.\n\n               INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY \n               AREA\n\n               Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door \n               slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards \n               enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates \n               are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.\n\n                                     HAN\n                         This is not going to work.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Why didn't you say so before?\n\n                                     HAN\n                         I did say so before!\n\n               INT. DETENTION AREA\n\n               Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches \n               the trio.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         Where are you taking this... thing?\n\n               Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut \n               up.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-\n                         three-eight.\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear \n                         it.\n\n               The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in \n               the information. There are only three other troopers in the \n               area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the \n               alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of \n               Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.\n\n               Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one \n               of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.\n\n                                     HAN\n                         Look out!

Luke and \n               Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are \n               blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of \n               laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser \n               gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the \n               last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is \n               about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink \n               system, which is screeching questions about what is going \n               on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.\n\n                                     HAN\n                         We've got to find out which cell \n                         this princess of yours is in.

He is \n               yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a \n               dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few \n               feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops \n               begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are \n               moving into an attack position in front of the lone \n               starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops \n               begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.\n\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\n               Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt \n               to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of \n               laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate \n               extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of \n               furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running \n               the other way also.\n\n               INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY\n\n               Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down \n               a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They \n               quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an \n               open hatchway.\n\n               INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT\n\n               Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge \n               that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. \n               The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, \n               and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance \n               off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of \n               his arm and pulls him back.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                              (gasping)\n                         I think we took a wrong turn.\n\n               Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby \n               reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at \n               the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch \n               that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving \n               them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  \n               Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         There's no lock!\n\n               Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         That oughta hold it for a while.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         Quick, we've got to get across.

Luke aims his laser pistol \n               at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across \n               the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops \n               appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, \n               and grabs at his chest.\n\n               Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by \n               Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move \n               back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Here, hold this.\n\n               Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. \n               It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge \n               overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the \n               rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears \n               and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  \n               Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet \n               of more troops.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         Here they come!\n\n               Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and \n               he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the \n               gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He \n               tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the \n               princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him \n               quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         For luck!\n\n               Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss \n               to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as \n               Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the \n               stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at \n               the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into \n               the tiny subhallway.\n\n               INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY\n\n               Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several \n               stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks \n               to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the \n               opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of \n               the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.\n\n               INT.

The young starpilot and his furry companion \n               race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage \n               to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops \n               before the doors slam shut.\n\n                                     TROOPER\n                         Open the blast doors!

DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY\n\n               Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar \n               where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar, \n               Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not \n               ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his \n               and steps slowly forward.\n\n                                     VADER\n                         I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. \n                         We meet again, at last.

Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain, \n               as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He \n               shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.\n\n               Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked \n               by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke \n               by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's \n               blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark \n               Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. \n               The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments \n               with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing \n               sound.\n\n                                     VADER\n                         Your powers are weak, old man.\n\n                                     BEN\n                         You can't win, Darth.

Vader \n               takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings \n               his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to \n               deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.\n\n               The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts \n               his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene \n               look on his face.\n\n               Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's \n               cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.  \n               Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the \n               empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers \n               and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two \n               and starts for him.

Three troopers charge \n               forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close \n               behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the \n               docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his \n               onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops, \n               as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship.

An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han \n               swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser \n               cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts \n               in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his \n               face.\n\n               EXT.

MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT\n\n               Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc \n               of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the \n               pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon \n               hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower \n               of burning fragments.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                              (laughing)\n                         That's it!

All right?\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.\n\n                                     BIGGS\n                              (going off)\n                         You did, all right. It's going to be \n                         like old times, Luke. We're a couple \n                         of shooting stars that'll never be \n                         stopped!\n\n               Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for \n               his ship.\n\n               As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly \n               spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points \n               to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the \n               back of the fighter.\n\n                                     CHIEF\n                         This R2 unit of your seems a bit \n                         beat up. Do you want a new one?\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Not on your life! That little droid \n                         and I have been through a lot \n                         together.\n                              (to Artoo)\n                         You okay, Artoo?\n\n               The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of \n               the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps \n               that he is fine.\n\n               Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an \n               his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive \n               hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner \n               into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo \n               beeps good-bye.\n\n                                     CHIEF\n                         Okay, easy she goes!\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to \n                         come back.\n\n               Artoo beeps in agreement.\n\n                                     THREEPIO\n                         You wouldn't want my life to get \n                         boring, would you?\n\n               Artoo whistles his reply.\n\n               All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.  \n               The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the \n               pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The \n               hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted \n               voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses \n               are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit \n               shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman, \n               holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace \n               of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.\n\n                                     BEN'S VOICE\n                         Luke, the Force will be with you.\n\n               Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.\n\n               EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE\n\n               All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing \n               on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The \n               muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this \n               eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion \n               rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage \n               in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud \n               cover.\n\n               INT.

The red dot that represents the Death Star moves \n               ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear \n               around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills \n               the war room.\n\n                                     MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE\n                         Stand-by alert.

MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR\n\n               Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a \n               throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the ladder \n               as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting. \n               Princess Leia rushes toward him.\n\n                                     LEIA\n                         Luke! Luke! Luke!\n\n               She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance \n               around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace \n               one another, slapping each other on the back.\n\n                                     HAN\n                              (laughing)\n                         Hey!

MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM\n\n               Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main \n               temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners \n               are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the \n               beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly \n               march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From \n               one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired \n               Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to \n               an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the \n               whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other \n               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is \n               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  \n               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He \n               winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who \n               is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled \n               troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo \n               beeps with happiness.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               END CREDITS OVER STARS\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nStar Wars: A New Hope\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0George Lucas\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:20.467273"}
