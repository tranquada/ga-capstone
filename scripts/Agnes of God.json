And all my doubts about\n\n                       myself and God were gone, in that one moment.\n                       I recognized the voice.

Perhaps it was a song\n                       of seduction. And the father was a\n                       fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply\n                       a lullaby that she remembered from many\n                       years ago. And the father was hope and...\n                       and love and desire.
