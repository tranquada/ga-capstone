A\n                          few years ago I looked at myself and saw\n                          nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing.\n                          Not even of Heaven. Not even of God. And\n                          then one evening I saw Agnes standing by\n\n                          her window, singing. And all my doubts about\n<b>\n</b>                       myself and God were gone, in that one moment.\n                       I recognized the voice. Please don't take it\n                       away from me again Doctor Livingston.

And one night\n                        I heard the most beautiful voice\n                        imaginable. And when I looked I saw\n                        the moon shining down on him. For six\n                        nights he sang to me, songs I'd never\n                        heard. And on the seventh night he\n                        opened his wings and lay on top of me.\n                        All the while he sang -\n                                (sings)\n                        Charlie Sweet...

Perhaps it was a song\n                       of seduction. And the father was a\n                       fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply\n                       a lullaby that she remembered from many\n                       years ago. And the father was hope and...\n                       and love and desire. And a belief in\n                        miracles.\n\n        The nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to\nthe\nconvent over    which Agnes' singing can be heard.\n\n<b>                                      MARTHA (V.O.)\n</b>                       I want to believe that she was blessed.\n                       And I do miss her, and I hope that she's\n                       left something, some little part of\n                       herself with me.
