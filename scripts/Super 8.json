JOE'S HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER\r\n                         \r\n          A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in\r\n          LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house,\r\n          notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.\r\n          Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit,\r\n          now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.\r\n                         \r\n          He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt\r\n          trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around\r\n          his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has\r\n          arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR\r\n          with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as\r\n          the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone\r\n          Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in\r\n          his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly\r\n          sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been\r\n          drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.\r\n                         \r\n          Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the\r\n          porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for\r\n          a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and\r\n          stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he\r\n          stares, TEARS come to his eyes.\r\n                         \r\n          A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns\r\n          toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something\r\n          BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts\r\n          open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never\r\n          forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED\r\n          Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad\r\n          car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of\r\n          freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable\r\n                         THAN COMFORTING:\r\n                         \r\n                          JACK\r\n           I'll be home soon.\r\n                         \r\n          And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them\r\n          drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket\r\n          again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear\r\n          an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.\r\n                         \r\n          Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: \"I want you...\r\n          to want me!\" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:\r\n           5.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

It's an old WAREHOUSE,\r\n          dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY,\r\n          CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK.

He watches. Waits. We\r\n          see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK\r\n          DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar.\r\n                         \r\n          Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for\r\n          it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a\r\n          terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the\r\n          Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --\r\n          and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie\r\n          DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize\r\n          that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance.

CHARLES' HOUSE - DUSK\r\n                         \r\n          An anomalous moment in this small steel town: the sun sets\r\n          through the distant trees and it's beautiful, despite the\r\n          distant belching SMOKESTACKS. Joe leaves Charles' house and\r\n          CROSSES THE STREET to his own. SQUAD CAR in the driveway.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. JOE'S HOUSE - DUSK\r\n                         \r\n          Joe comes into the kitchen through the BACK DOOR. Lucy the\r\n          dog greets him. A TV is head somewhere. NIGHTLY NEWS reports\r\n          on the ONGOING CLEAN-UP OF THREE MILE ISLAND. A half-empty\r\n          BEER BOTTLE on the table. Joe peeks into the living room --\r\n          but no one's there.\r\n                         \r\n          Joe looks around for his father. Heads down the hallway.\r\n          Stops when he sees something off camera. We HOLD on Joe's\r\n          face, sort of quietly stunned.\r\n           12.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          And we se his POV: Jack, Joe's father, in uniform pants and T-\r\n          shirt, sits on the edge of the bathtub, head in his hands,\r\n          quietly CRYING.\r\n                         \r\n          Joe is stunned, staring at his dad. But he can't look away.\r\n          And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up. Joe's\r\n          mind scrambles for something to say, but Jack sniffles, gets\r\n          it together, quick. Puts on a strong face.\r\n                         \r\n                          JACK\r\n           Hey -- I'll be out in a minute--\r\n                         \r\n          Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door.\r\n          HOLD ON JOE. Stunned and heartsick.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. CAROL'S DINER - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Commodores quietly sing \"EASY\" on the PA. Joe and his father,\r\n          in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack eats a\r\n          beef stew and reviews office paperwork, not looking at his\r\n          son. Joe eats a grilled cheese, deeply lonely and not even\r\n          knowing it.\r\n                         \r\n          Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table:\r\n                         \r\n                          JACK\r\n           It's a six-week program, hands-on\r\n           training with college coaches.\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           You'll like it. I know I did.\r\n                         \r\n          Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP. Images of\r\n          happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS. Not his thing.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n           I thought I was going to have the\r\n           summer for myself--\r\n                         \r\n                          JACK\r\n           Things have obviously changed for\r\n           us.

You'll\r\n           like it there.\r\n                          (FINALLY)\r\n           It's what we both need.\r\n                         \r\n          Joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up\r\n          from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS\r\n          MOTHER'S LOCKET. Jack wants to cry again. He wants to throw\r\n          that locket away, out of sight. But he just turns away.\r\n                         \r\n          Joe stares at the pamphlet. PUSH IN on the photo of beaming\r\n          15-year-old KIDS. Then CUT TO THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real.\r\n                         \r\n           MRS.

But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes\r\n          galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set:\r\n                         \r\n           MRS.

I... I love you too...\r\n                         \r\n          And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure:\r\n                         \r\n                          ALICE\r\n           Was that okay? Or... not really?\r\n                         \r\n          Charles is stunned -- almost crying -- can't talk -- and as\r\n          he searches, behind him, a LIGHT --\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLES\r\n           -- uh, that was...

He turns to them all:\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLES (CONT'D)\r\n           PRODUCTION VALUE!!!

Joe plugs in the mike, Charles grabs the camera:\r\n                         \r\n                          CHARLES\r\n           Everyone ready...?!

This is my job.\r\n                         \r\n          Charles watches, beaming with excitement. Joe holds the boom,\r\n          looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he\r\n          notices something in the distance. HEADLIGHTS. A quarter mile\r\n          away, a vehicle drives along the horizon. A beat. But the\r\n          train is APPROACHING -- GETTING LOUDER -- which makes Joe\r\n          turn back toward the train -- the thing almost upon them --\r\n          LOUDER AND LOUDER, so the actors begin to YELL over the\r\n                         GROWING DIN:\r\n                         \r\n           MRS.

PUSH IN ON\r\n          JOE, unsettled -- as the train CROSSES THEM NOW -- Joe looks\r\n          back toward Alice -- a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD!\r\n                         \r\n           MRS.

Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH-\r\n          SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of\r\n          STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.\r\n                         \r\n          In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly\r\n          shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD\r\n          METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted\r\n          STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around\r\n          him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But\r\n          what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe\r\n          BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN --\r\n          MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?!

And file a report,\r\n          come home this morning -- before anything can be done\r\n          Jack, my lights keep going on about it. And then we can\r\n          and off. Counting on you, take care of these things. If\r\n          Jack. you do that for me, I promise\r\n           you, I'll handle it myself.\r\n                         \r\n          He seems to have appeased them -- but as he turns, we see how\r\n          stressed he is. He stops, noticing FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS\r\n          DRIVING PAST, SLOWLY, ANTENNAS atop the trucks, and the men\r\n          inside seemingly scanning the area. Jack is disturbed by\r\n          this.\r\n           54.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

It's a MISSING DOG SIGN FOR LUCY. We're\r\n          on Joe's face as he finishes pinning it up -- when something\r\n          he sees makes him stop. He slowly takes a step back. Then\r\n          another... his eyes glued to the board.\r\n                         \r\n          Then we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING\r\n          THAT THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BRAND NEW \"DOG MISSING\"\r\n          SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD. It's COVERED in them.

He\r\n          begins LIFTING; a WIDE SHOT shows him rising to the bare\r\n          utility pole STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER. When Rooney finally gets\r\n          to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer.\r\n          After a moment, though, he stops. HEARS something else, past\r\n          the sound of electricity. He looks over toward the SALVAGE\r\n          YARD. Except it's mostly hidden by the trees. From here,\r\n          Rooney can only see the tops of the JUNK PILES. A small\r\n          METALLIC CRASH. Then ANOTHER.\r\n           58.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Rooney cranes his neck to get a view. Another METALLIC CRASH,\r\n          this time GLASS BREAKING, too. Then, in the distance, at the\r\n          middle of the salvage yard, SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE AIR,\r\n          FALLING AND LANDING WITH A CLANG-THUNK.\r\n                         \r\n          Rooney strains his eyes to see -- what the hell was that? A\r\n          tin can? A piece of a fender? Hard to tell from here.\r\n                         \r\n          Then, thrown into the air: A CAR TIRE. It lands with a THUD.\r\n          Rooney then uses the bucket controls -- MOVES BACKWARD AND UP\r\n          -- a touch higher toward the transformer -- not exactly\r\n          watching how close he is getting. He stops. Watches.\r\n                         \r\n          An ENTIRE JUNKED MOTORCYCLE flies into the air, discarded,\r\n          twirling, and CRASH LANDS, out of sight.\r\n                         \r\n          Rooney is stunned. As the METALLIC RUMMAGING SOUNDS CONTINUE,\r\n          Rooney moves the bucket EVEN HIGHER -- when suddenly his\r\n          bucket BEEP-BEEPS LOUDLY -- a warning he's too high -- and he\r\n          suddenly stops it and the BEEPING STOPS --\r\n                         \r\n          But so do the rummaging sounds. SILENCE, save for the eerie\r\n          HUM OF POWER. He waits. Nothing. Wants a better view, so he\r\n          begins to LOWER THE BUCKET.\r\n                         \r\n          We're in a WIDE SHOT, seeing his DESCEND, PAINFULLY SLOWLY.\r\n                         \r\n          Then we're in a LONG LENS CLOSE UP of Rooney as he SLOWLY\r\n          DROPS -- TIGHT ON HIM as he's looking over toward the salvage\r\n          yard -- and it takes us a minute to realize there's fucking\r\n          SOMETHING BEHIND HIM -- SO BIG WE DIDN'T SEE IT -- COMING OUT\r\n          OF THE SHADOWS -- IT'S GOT MUSCLE AND FLESH AND IT MAKES AN\r\n          UNGODLY SOUND AND IT INSTANTLY GRABS HIM -- THE TRUCK ROCKS\r\n          AS WE CUT INSIDE THE CAB OF THE TRUCK, LOOKING OUT THE\r\n          WINDSHIELD -- KEEEEEEESH!!! IT SPIDERS AS ROONEY'S LEGS\r\n          IMPACT THE GLASS AND SUDDENLY WE'RE IN A WIDE SHOT OF THE\r\n          CHERRY PICKER, ROCKING BACK AND FORTH IN INCREASINGLY SMALLER\r\n          MOVEMENTS, UNTIL THE TRUCK IS MOTIONLESS. Empty. Alone.\r\n                         \r\n          Then: NOISE -- and an AMPLIFIED VOICE:\r\n                         \r\n           MRS.

Then you\r\n           take a dry brush and you just dip\r\n           it in, then you brush on the paper,\r\n           so the paint's barely on the brush.\r\n           Then you make small brush strokes\r\n           on the model. Little ones, like\r\n           where the wear and tear would be.\r\n           Around the wheels. Or where the\r\n           doors would slide. Then you do it\r\n           again, like with Camouflage Gray--\r\n           or here, I used Insignia Red to\r\n           make it look like there was another\r\n           coat of paint on there before. Like\r\n           they painted over it, but you could\r\n           see it scratched off.\r\n                         \r\n          Lost in thought, he looks at her.

I don't mean yes. I\r\n           mean no. I've known Louis Dainard\r\n           for alotta years-- he's been\r\n           nothing but trouble. Your mother\r\n           used to say he's not a bad guy, he\r\n           just needs a chance, he's just sad -\r\n           - well I tried to be good to him,\r\n           but I can't. Not anymore. I will\r\n           not allow him or his daughter in\r\n           this house. I will not allow you\r\n           spending time with her, doing\r\n           projects or whatever it is that\r\n           you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope\r\n           we're clear.\r\n                         \r\n          Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says:\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n           We're not clear.\r\n                         \r\n          Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds --\r\n                         \r\n                          JACK\r\n           What'd you say?\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n           We're not clear.

Her\r\n           father is a selfish, irresponsible\r\n           son-of-a-bitch!\r\n                         \r\n          Jack moves CLOSE to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back --\r\n          Jack is fucking intense:\r\n                         \r\n                          JACK (CONT'D)\r\n           You listen to me, I've got twelve\r\n           thousand people in this town that\r\n           are scared out of their minds--\r\n           they've got one person they can\r\n           rely on -- it used to be someone\r\n           else, but now it's just me.\r\n                         \r\n          Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying. And\r\n          to whom he's saying it. But somehow, in this moment, he can't\r\n          be a better father than law officer. Not yet. More upset at\r\n          himself than Joe, he heads out.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. LILLIAN STREET - DUSK\r\n                         \r\n          Joe rides UP A HILL -- BOOM UP -- REVEAL THE TOWN CEMETERY.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave. Holds her OPEN\r\n          LOCKET, staring at it. He's just come here for comfort. But\r\n          then -- a SOUND -- and Joe turns. Deep and low, in the\r\n          distance. Joe is motionless. HEARS IT AGAIN. He stands, pulls\r\n          out his flashlight -- aims the beam down ROWS OF GRAVES,\r\n          toward the big CARETAKER'S SHED in the distance. Another\r\n          INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON\r\n          WOOD and Joe backs up, nervous. Another odd sound -- then\r\n          ANOTHER -- which TRANSITIONS US TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT ENTRANCE - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Jack's squad car arrives at the abandoned airfield.\r\n           71.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. MUNICIPAL AIRPORT BUILDING - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Jack's car pulls up. He gets out of the car. Suddenly the\r\n          three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed\r\n          at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see --\r\n                         \r\n                          JACK\r\n           Hello--?\r\n                         \r\n          And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming\r\n          WEAPONS. Then, a VOICE over a TRUCK PA:\r\n                         \r\n           VOICE (V.O.)\r\n           Drop your weapons.

MILITARY MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          TIGHT ON NELEC. Past an IV and medical machinery. He's\r\n          looking at someone we don't yet see. In the background,\r\n          Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet, simple:\r\n                         \r\n                          NELEC\r\n           I don't want any more trouble. Do\r\n           you?\r\n                         \r\n          Now we see who he's talking to. IT'S DR. WOODWARD. Battered\r\n          and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.\r\n                         \r\n                          NELEC (CONT'D)\r\n           We've been going through your\r\n           belongings, looking for evidence.\r\n           Of what you knew, how you knew\r\n           it... and who else might know.\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           I remember you. In the lab. And I\r\n           recall we didn't see eye to eye,\r\n           but that's no excuse for doing what\r\n           you did here.\r\n           72.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Dr. Woodward swallows. Feels that his time on Earth is coming\r\n          to an end no matter what he does here. By the door, Overmyer\r\n          is quietly putting on his BLACK GLOVES.\r\n                         \r\n                          NELEC (CONT'D)\r\n           So in the spirit of moving forward\r\n           and avoiding more trouble, tell us\r\n           where you put your research. I know\r\n           you had someone document the crash\r\n           that night. Tell me who that was\r\n           and I'll help you, I swear to God.\r\n           On my mother's life -- if you help\r\n           us now, we will take care of you.\r\n                         \r\n           DR. WOODWARD\r\n           I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,\r\n           when you take care of people.\r\n                         \r\n                          NELEC\r\n           --I'm going to bait him. I'm going\r\n           to catch him.\r\n                         \r\n           DR. WOODWARD\r\n           He's in me, you know. As I am in\r\n           him. So when you see him next, as\r\n           I'm sure you will... I'll be\r\n           watching you, too.\r\n                         \r\n          Nelec offers a vague, searching smile. But Woodward will not -\r\n          - not ever -- relent. So. Nelec moves to the door, he remains\r\n          FACING CAMERA, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the\r\n          bed. PUSH IN ON NELEC'S FACE, UNDERSTANDING HIS TRUE NATURE\r\n          AS WE CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Joe sleeps, power still out. Then, a KNOCK. He wakes up.\r\n          Another KNOCK. His window. He moves to it. Opens it. It's\r\n          Alice. Joe is half asleep, but also stunned. Very quietly:\r\n                         \r\n                          ALIE\r\n           -- are you-- were you sleeping?\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n           Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?\r\n                         \r\n                          ALICE\r\n           Yeah.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           Oh, you wanna come in?\r\n           73.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          And Alice climbs in. Joe sits on the floor. Alice does too.\r\n          It's odd and silent for a moment.\r\n                         \r\n                          ALICE\r\n           Power's still out.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n           Room's still messy.\r\n                         \r\n                          ALICE\r\n           I was in bed, couldn't sleep.\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           Thinking.

I mean, who always gets what\r\n           they want? -- I know I don't know\r\n           you at all. Even though... it sort\r\n           of feels like I do.\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           Do you not... feel like that?\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n           -- no, I totally do, I'm just...\r\n           sort of in shock at this whole\r\n                          CONVERSATION--\r\n                         \r\n          And the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him\r\n          -- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT\r\n          HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector\r\n          to stop it -- but:\r\n                         \r\n                          ALICE\r\n           -- no, keep it-- please --\r\n                         \r\n          Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She\r\n          watches the film. Can't take her eyes away.\r\n                         \r\n                          ALICE (CONT'D)\r\n           ... is that her?\r\n           74.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n           ... yeah...\r\n                         \r\n          And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to\r\n          fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER:\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE (CONT'D)\r\n           ... it's so weird watching her like\r\n           this, like she's still here...\r\n           (beat, lost in it)\r\n           ... she used to look at me, this\r\n           way... like really look. And I\r\n           just... knew I was there. That I\r\n           existed.\r\n                         \r\n          A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that.\r\n          Finally, quietly:\r\n                         \r\n                          ALICE\r\n           He drank that morning. My dad.\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           He missed his shift.\r\n           (beat, hard)\r\n           Your mom took it for him. The day\r\n           of the accident.\r\n                         \r\n          Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes\r\n          wet, Alice turns to Joe.\r\n                         \r\n                          ALICE (CONT'D)\r\n           ...

Finally:\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n           Don't say that.\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           He's your dad.\r\n                         \r\n          Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.\r\n          Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of\r\n          SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound\r\n          remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE\r\n          CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk.\r\n                         \r\n          Joe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube\r\n          VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly.\r\n                         \r\n                          ALICE JOE\r\n          -- has this--? -- no.\r\n           75.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube\r\n          -- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN.\r\n                         \r\n          They are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the\r\n          SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to\r\n          touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY -\r\n          - ACROSS THE ROOM -- AND BLASTS THROUGH THE WALL, LEAVING A\r\n          FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to\r\n          the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He\r\n          moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance,\r\n          trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. ALICE'S HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Alice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully\r\n          toward her room, when --\r\n                         \r\n           LOUIS (O.S.)\r\n           Morning.\r\n                         \r\n          His voice makes her JUMP. She turns: sitting in the dark, in\r\n          an armchair, is her father. He's awake. And drunk.\r\n                         \r\n                          LOUIS (CONT'D)\r\n           You wanna tell me where you were?\r\n           Or you want me to tell you.\r\n                         \r\n          A tense beat, her mind races.

And as the creature\r\n          descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge --\r\n          Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified:\r\n                         \r\n                          NELEC\r\n           -- it was my turn once... to find\r\n           you.

Then... silence. They see the creature burst out\r\n          of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from\r\n          them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter.

Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand\r\n          on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt.\r\n                         \r\n                          CARY\r\n           It's Sheriff Pruitt.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n           I know.

HUNCHED OVER. BACK TO THE BOYS.\r\n          AND IT'S SAVAGELY EATING SOMETHING. IT MOVES A BIT: WE SEE\r\n          IT'S A HUMAN LEG. Joe and Cary would SCREAM if they didn't\r\n          need to stay quiet.

TIGHT ON JOE as he sees, among them, ALICE. His\r\n          heart POUNDS, his resolve quadruples.

Alice is cry-\r\n          laughing at seeing it work --\r\n                         \r\n                          CARY\r\n           -- what's he doing...?\r\n                         \r\n                          JOE\r\n           ... he's making a model.\r\n                         \r\n          AGAIN and AGAIN, pieces FLY OVERHEAD, beginning to FORM WHAT\r\n          IS CLEARLY AN ALIEN CRAFT -- LIGHTS BEGINNING TO ILLUMINATE\r\n          FROM INSIDE as it continues -- ONE OF THE SPOTLIGHTS\r\n          ILLUMINATING A JEEP THAT HAS JUST ARRIVED: JACK GETS OUT. HE\r\n          SEES JOE. JOE IS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM -- ALICE CONCERNED.\r\n           119.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          BUT THEN THE KIDS ARE BOTH INCREDULOUS TO SEE JACK HELP LOUIS\r\n          OUT OF THE JEEP -- THE TWO MEN MOVE THROUGH THE DEBRIS IN THE\r\n          STREETS, STUNNED AT THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING THEM, BUT\r\n          FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN; A TUMBLING TYPEWRITER ALMOST TAKES\r\n          OUT JACK, BUT HE AVOIDS IT AS IT SHOOTS UP TO THE WATER\r\n          TOWER.\r\n                         \r\n          JACK GETS TO HIS SON -- HOLDS HIS SHOULDERS -- LOOKS DEEPLY\r\n          INTO HIS EYES, TOUCHES HIS FACE AND EMBRACES HIM --\r\n                         \r\n                          JACK\r\n           -- I got you. I got you.\r\n                         \r\n          LOUIS, CRYING, DESPERATELY SORRY -- AND SHE SEES THIS IN HIS\r\n          SAD, WOUNDED FACE -- SHE HOLDS OUT A HAND -- HE TAKES IT AND\r\n          PULLS HER INTO AN EMBRACE, HUGGING HIS DAUGHTER DESPERATELY.\r\n                         \r\n          BEHIND THEM, THE SHIP CONTINUES TO TAKE SHAPE, ALMOST FULLY-\r\n          FORMED -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, Joe\r\n          LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he considers\r\n          it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it\r\n          out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the\r\n          LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.\r\n                         \r\n          Joe knows what this means. He looks up at his father, who\r\n          also understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --\r\n          FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE\r\n          NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING... TEARS\r\n          in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go,\r\n          but knowing he must. Jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the\r\n          verge of letting go. Alice watches Joe, on the verge of tears\r\n          -- except Joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not\r\n          ever. But then something happens.\r\n                         \r\n          Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And we\r\n          see what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER. A young\r\n          woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks at his\r\n          mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes\r\n          suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down\r\n          her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on\r\n          his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.\r\n                         \r\n          And finally... after all... JOE LETS GO.
