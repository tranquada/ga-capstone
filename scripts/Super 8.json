JOE'S HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER\r\n</b>                         \r\n          A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in\r\n          LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house,\r\n          notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.\r\n          Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit,\r\n          now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.\r\n                         \r\n          He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt\r\n          trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around\r\n          his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has\r\n          arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR\r\n          with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as\r\n          the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone\r\n          Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in\r\n          his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly\r\n          sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been\r\n          drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.\r\n                         \r\n          Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the\r\n          porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for\r\n          a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and\r\n          stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he\r\n          stares, TEARS come to his eyes.\r\n                         \r\n          A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns\r\n          toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something\r\n          BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts\r\n          open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never\r\n          forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED\r\n          Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad\r\n          car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of\r\n          freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable\r\n<b>                         THAN COMFORTING:\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>                          JACK\r\n</b>           I'll be home soon.\r\n                         \r\n          And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them\r\n          drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket\r\n          again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear\r\n          an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.\r\n                         \r\n          Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: \"I want you...\r\n          to want me!\" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS.

HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the\r\n          LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.\r\n                         \r\n          Joe knows what this means. He looks up at his father, who\r\n          also understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --\r\n          FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE\r\n          NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING... TEARS\r\n          in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go,\r\n          but knowing he must. Jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the\r\n          verge of letting go. Alice watches Joe, on the verge of tears\r\n          -- except Joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not\r\n          ever. But then something happens.\r\n                         \r\n          Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And we\r\n          see what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER. A young\r\n          woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks at his\r\n          mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes\r\n          suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down\r\n          her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on\r\n          his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.\r\n                         \r\n          And finally... after all...
