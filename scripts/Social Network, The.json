The BOUNCER motions to three SEXY\r\n          GIRLS who are let in through the velvet rope. If this reminds\r\n          us of the scene at the final club party at the beginning of\r\n          this story than that's fine.\r\n          The three SEXY GIRLS take us into\r\n\r\n          INT.

The\r\n          lower level is a giant dance floor packed\"with sweating 20-\r\n          somethings bouncing to pounding house music. There are raised\r\n          blocks where scantily dressed professional. dancers perform non-\r\n          stop. A huge lighting grid hangs from the ceiling shooting\r\n          colored lights and lasers everywhere. Also hanging from the\r\n          ceiling are two trapeze bars with two performers swinging and\r\n          contorting.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          120,\r\n          A WAITRESS holding a tray of colored drinks high over her head\r\n          takes us through the crowd to a spiral staircase that's being\r\n          guarded by two more BOUNCERS with clipboards. The staircase\r\n          leads up to the 2nd level which is all VIP tables that look\r\n          out over the dance floor. Each VIP area has a couple of\r\n          couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka, tequila, rum,\r\n          mixers, ice, glasses and a private waitress who's happy to\r\n          bend over and pour a drink for you,\r\n          And that's where we catch up with MARK and SEAN.

THE THAMES -- DAY\r\n\r\n          we're looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight\r\n          stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of\r\n          Henley, England--founded in 1179.\r\n          And after a moment of placid quiet--\r\n\r\n                         ---BOOSHI\r\n          Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for\r\n          the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and\r\n          prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.\r\n          The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The\r\n          port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the\r\n          Ilollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a\r\n          pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the \"H\" of\r\n          Harvard.\r\n          We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing\r\n          section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot\r\n          -- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n\r\n          blazers and brightly colored floral ties.\r\n          But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just\r\n          their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural.\r\n          straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half\r\n          torture test against the best competition they've ever faced.\r\n          And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the\r\n          Dutch.\r\n          The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of\r\n          them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late.\r\n          Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving\r\n          the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of\r\n          Americans.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          124.\r\n          We'll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and latex\r\n          we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next\r\n          to him is their mother, who can barely watch.\r\n          Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice\r\n          through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and\r\n          there's still no daylight between them.\r\n          We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin\r\n          to stream down his arm.\r\n          25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--\r\n          even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups\r\n          the closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\r\n          is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed--\r\n          the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.\r\n          The blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted\r\n          by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig,\r\n          and pull, and pull, and pull, and---\r\n\r\n          POP!\r\n          --the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of\r\n          the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.\r\n          CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch\r\n          group holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The\r\n          Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.\r\n          The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug\r\n          as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.\r\n          The MOTHER drops her head-and looks down. The FATHER refuses\r\n          to look away.\r\n          From CAMERON and TYLER, just the'breathing.,\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT.
