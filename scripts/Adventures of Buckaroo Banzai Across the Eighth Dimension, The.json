HIKITA\nYes, Perfect Tommy, in a way.  However...\n(slipping in another slide)\n...notice...although certain components resist identification, it \ncorresponds very closely to an ordinary praying mantis.\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\n(scrutinizing)\nToo closely.  Gotta be more than sheer coincidence.  Rawhide, you're \nkeen on bugs.  What do you think?\n\nRawhide takes a look as Reno hangs the phone up...\n\nRENO\nEverything's copacetic at the Institute, Buckaroo.  Sam's with the Jet \nCar and she's under lock and key.

She pours herself another drink, but booze won't do \nthe job.  She's all alone.  She needs some help.  Her name is PENNY \nPRIDDY.\n\n\t114\nOn-stage Buckaroo Banzai suddenly stops moving, stops singing and waves \nthe Cavaliers to cease as well.  EERIE STILLNESS, the only sound \nBuckaroo's lips on the silver mike.\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nI heard somebody crying.\n(no response)\nI said is someone out there crying in the darkness?\n\nYes, indeed...Penny's voice, weakly:\t115\n\nPENNY PRIDDY\nHere...here at the back. I'm sorry...\n\n\t116\nBuckaroo squints, spots her.  His voice comes mighty over the PUBLIC \nADDRESS SYSTEM.\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nRaise your hand...where?\n\nPENNY PRIDDY\n(raising her hand)\nThis is so embarrassing...\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nSomebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's \nyour name?\n\nPENNY PRIDDY\nPenny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.\n\nFor reasons out of their control, Penny's name coming across to \nBuckaroo and the Cavaliers as \"Peggy,\" said name immediately eliciting \na surprised reaction from the Cavaliers...\n\n...Buckaroo amazed as well...a not-too-distant pain deep in his soul \nmomentarily manifesting itself, although he makes a brave attempt at \nnonchalance...as now Penny is given that microphone.\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nDid you say...\"Peggy\"?\n\nPENNY PRIDDY\nMy name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean \nanything to you.  I'm a nobody.\n\nThe business of the names settled, Buckaroo and the Cavaliers breathing \na bit more easily...\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nNobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?\n\nPENNY PRIDDY\n(blowing her nose)\nDid I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat \n69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my \nluggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record \nproducer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for \nlife, and like a fool, well, I...\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nHe offered you money?\n\nPENNY PRIDDY\nDo I look like that kinda girl?\n(to tell the truth)\nI lost my room this morning.

C'mon, Rawhide, spill \nit.\n\nBuckaroo nodding his permission...\n\nRAWHIDE\nThe professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to \ndiscover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before \nBuckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a \nrocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half \nout...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was \norange...\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nAnd his soul black as the Ace of Spades.\n\nRAWHIDE\nHe went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, \ngot caught and judged insane.

So what's he up to?\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nI'm sure we'll find out soon enough.\n\nBuckaroo heading for the door...Rawhide drawing a receipt book from his \npocket.\n\nRAWHIDE\nAnd another thing.

Grossly abnormal high-altitude electrostatic \ndisturbance over Connecticut.  Fallout from the Jet Car, you think?\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nDoubt it.  Check NORAD command.  Could be a volcanic ash cloud.

Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nWyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?\n\nPENNY PRIDDY\nNo.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?

It appears to be solid matter, \nright?\n\nBuckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass, dropping \nit, splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces \noff the table...\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nBut in point of fact, the solid parts of this table... the protons, \nquarks, your neutrons and electrons...they comprise only about one \nquadrillionth of its total volume.\n\nSECRETARY OF DEFENSE\nWhich is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into.\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nExactly.  So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if \nsolid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover \na to travel inside things like tables.  And mountains.\n\nPROF. HIKITA\nWe at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating \ngradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its \nelectroweak forces!\n\nBUCKAROO BANZAI\nWhich we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, \nprofessor?\n\n2nd REPORTER\nWhat about the Pentagon?
