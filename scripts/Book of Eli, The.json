FOREST - DAWN\n          \n          Bare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white\n          like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.\n          \n          STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a\n          creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A\n          LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.\n          \n          A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as\n          the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and\n          rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.\n          \n          It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the\n          forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces\n          across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:\n          \n          A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare.\n          Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in\n          his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.\n          \n          As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:\n          \n          P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING\n          \n          About thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW,\n          DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.\n          \n          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES\n          \n          The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked\n          onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.\n          \n          THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More\n          cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.\n          \n          ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled\n          tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs\n          and bracken. A \"ghillie suit\" of the kind used by snipers.\n          \n          THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a\n          grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks\n          around again, checking its surroundings for predators.\n          \n          THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering\n          him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the\n          familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.\n          \n          THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the\n          watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An\n          interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?\n          \n          Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass,\n          nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers.\n          \n                                                                  2.\n          \n          \n          THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing\n          and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.\n          \n          THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing\n          him to us for the first time.\n          \n          He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater\n          with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work\n          boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.\n          \n          Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a\n          DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT\n          with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.\n          \n          Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT\n          hanging from a frayed twine cord.\n          \n          His name is ELI.\n          \n          He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches\n          beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood\n          from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.\n          \n          Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,\n          falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT\n          FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.\n          \n          Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the\n          ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the\n          writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.\n          \n          He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow.\n          He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath.\n          Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.\n          \n          For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat\n          and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie\n          suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.\n          \n          A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to\n          its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old\n          SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.\n          \n          He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on\n          his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK\n          SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.\n          \n          EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY\n          \n          Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured\n          asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees.\n          \n                                                                    3.\n          \n          \n          He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both\n          directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned-\n          out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it.\n          \n          The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch.\n          Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a\n          MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.\n          \n          Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle\n          but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually\n          wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.\n          \n          They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.\n          \n          He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he\n          walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn\n          loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.\n          \n          EXT. ROAD - DAY\n          \n          Eli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in\n          no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.\n          \n          The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now\n          through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.\n          \n          The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no\n          color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light\n          leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.\n          \n          CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of\n          a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise\n          from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED\n          AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.\n          \n          Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on\n          appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on\n          the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.\n          \n          After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down\n          the other fork, away from the city.\n          \n          EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY\n          \n          Little more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli\n          walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris.\n          Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.\n          \n          He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty\n          shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even\n          look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.\n          \n          Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old-\n          fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.\n          \n                                                                    4.\n          \n          \n                    ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR\n          \n          He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings\n          open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from\n          the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.\n          \n          INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been\n          cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the\n          floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.\n          \n          Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword\n          idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.\n          \n          As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe\n          box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off\n          hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.\n          \n          He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head\n          grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.\n          \n          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY\n          \n          On the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint,\n          broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.\n          \n          Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish,\n          overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting\n          sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.\n          \n          INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY\n          \n          The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,\n          revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun\n          unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.\n          \n          Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.\n          Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise\n          largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.\n          \n          KITCHEN\n          \n          Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in\n          the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.\n          \n          He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small\n          ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at\n          it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.\n          \n          Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.\n          Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick\n          enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.\n          \n                                                                  5.\n          \n          \n          BEDROOM\n          \n          A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have\n          been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves\n          toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.\n          \n          No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN\n          HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.\n          \n          Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old\n          pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal\n          ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.\n          \n          He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and\n          shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards\n          his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.\n          \n          He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the\n          new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.\n          \n          LATER\n          \n          Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat\n          over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he\n          watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking\n          it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.\n          \n          He clasps his hands together in prayer.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Dear Lord, thank you for your\n                    generosity in providing us today\n                    with this bountiful feast.\n          \n          He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so,\n          we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like\n          John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Thank you for the many gifts that\n                    you have given me. Thank you for\n                    your protection and your guidance.\n                    Thank you for bringing me this far.\n                    I know my long journey's end is\n                    near. I ask now only for the\n                    strength and the courage to\n                    complete the task that you in your\n                    infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow\n                    upon me over all men. I won't let\n                    you down. Amen.\n          \n          He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off\n          a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great\n          relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.\n          \n                                                                  6.\n          \n          \n                              ELI\n                    Hey. You hungry?\n          \n          It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT\n          emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli\n          offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.\n          \n          SUNDOWN\n          \n          The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's\n          broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a\n          SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.\n          \n          He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an\n          OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-\n          eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.\n          \n          Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the\n          beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.\n          \n          He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading\n          sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.\n          \n          MANY PAGES LATER\n          \n          Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.\n          Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.\n          \n          A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to\n          a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli\n          reaches into his pocket and produces:\n          \n          AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together\n          with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery\n          cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.\n          \n          The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.\n          Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.\n          \n          THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,\n          as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by\n          the music to another world, a world far from this one.\n          \n          MORNING\n          \n          Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the\n          exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.\n          \n          The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,\n          he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.\n          Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.\n          \n          He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.\n          All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.\n          \n                                                                  7.\n          \n          \n                              ELI\n                    Come on now.\n          \n          The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears\n          into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.\n          \n          EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING\n          \n          The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard.\n          \n          He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on\n          his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road.\n          \n          EXT. ROAD - DAY\n          \n          The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead\n          trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.\n          \n          The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a\n          world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road\n          reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: \"CIRCUIT CITY\".\n          \n          Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli\n          arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in\n          filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.\n          \n          The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a\n          roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of\n          food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.\n          \n          She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers\n          from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified.\n          \n                              YOUNG WOMAN\n                    Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here,\n                    take anything you want. You want\n                    some food? Take it.\n          \n          She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli\n          stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to\n          read behind the mirrored goggles.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I'm not going to hurt you.\n          \n                              YOUNG WOMAN\n                    That's what the last guys said.\n          \n          Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled\n          contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Here.\n          \n                                                                    8.\n          \n          \n          She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.\n          \n                              YOUNG WOMAN\n                    Could you help me? The wheel came\n                    off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I\n                    could get it out of the ditch. But\n                    I can't.\n          \n          Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just\n          inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.\n          \n          He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned,\n          revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg,\n          showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.\n          \n          He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the\n          cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert.\n          \n          Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched,\n          waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They\n          exchange anxious looks.\n          \n          ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    One good thing about no soap any\n                    more. You can smell the road agents\n                    a mile off.\n          \n          The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits\n          EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple\n          of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's.\n          \n          The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he\n          passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?\n          \n          He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap.\n          \n          Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding\n          in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    What you got there in the pack?\n          \n                               ELI\n                    Nothing.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    Yeah, that's what they all say. How\n                    about you take it off real slow and\n                    tip it out so's we can take a look?\n          \n                                                                  9.\n          \n          \n          BANDIT #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack.\n          \n                              BANDIT #2\n                    He's got a gun.\n          \n                               BANDIT LEADER\n                    Shit, it ain't loaded. They never\n                    are. Ain't that right, old man?\n                        (BEAT)\n                    Open the fucking pack or die.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I can't do that.\n          \n          The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within\n          striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    Want us to do it for you? We can\n                    get it off real easy after we've\n                    hacked your fucking arms off.\n          \n          Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft,\n          even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    It's real important you boys listen\n                    to me and understand. The man I\n                    work for, you do not want to cross\n                    him. See, I'm under his protection.\n                    You stand in my way, you stand in\n                    his. And he will cut you down with\n                    a righteous fury - through me. For\n                    I am his faithful instrument.\n          \n          BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and\n          then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    What the hell are you, some kinda\n                    preacher?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Something like that.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    Well I got news for you, preacher\n                    man. Whatever kinda God you reckon\n                    yourself to be working for, he left\n                    these parts a long time ago. He\n                    ain't here to protect your ass. Now\n                    take off the pack and set it on the\n                    ground.\n          \n                                                                 10.\n          \n          \n          Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes\n          another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    You fucking listening to me?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I hear you. You lay that hand on me\n                    again and you will not get it back.\n          \n          The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how\n          it's supposed to go.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    All right, I had just about enough\n                    of this shit...\n          \n          He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack.\n          \n          If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn\n          his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and\n          drips onto the asphalt.\n          \n          Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's\n          shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The\n          SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood.\n          \n          Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump\n          where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    What... you just... he just cut my\n                    fucking hand off! My fucking hand!\n          \n          Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto\n          the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to\n          the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    What you standin' around for? Kiss\n                    him!\n          \n                              BANDIT #3\n                    What's he talkin' about, kiss him?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    He's in shock. He means \"kill him\".\n          \n          A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI\n          ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing.\n          \n          Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But\n          it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill.\n          \n                                                                    11.\n          \n          \n          It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE\n          ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.\n          \n          The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards\n          away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.\n          \n                               ELI\n                    I told you you wouldn't be getting\n                    that back.\n          \n          Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down\n          on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a\n          moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.\n          \n                              BANDIT LEADER\n                    Who are you?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    My name is Eli.\n          \n          And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword.\n          \n          He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing.\n          She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next.\n          \n          He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the\n          shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches\n          incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Take it and go on your way. And\n                    don't fall in with men like these\n                    again. No good can come.\n          \n          She looks at him, puzzled.\n          \n                              YOUNG WOMAN\n                    Why are you doing this?\n          \n          Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches\n          beside them and begins searching their bodies.\n          \n          He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo\n          lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.\n          \n          LATER\n          \n          The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered\n          with dirt. The best burial they are going to get.\n          \n          Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks\n          quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.\n          \n                                                                   12.\n          \n          \n                              ELI\n                    God, the father of mercies, through\n                    the death and resurrection of his\n                    son has reconciled the world to\n                    himself and sent the holy spirit\n                    among us for the forgiveness of\n                    sins.\n          \n          The young woman stands a few yards away, watching him,\n          transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Through the ministry of the church\n                    may he give you pardon and peace,\n                    and I absolve you from your sins in\n                    the name of the father, and of the\n                    son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.\n          \n          He turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman.\n          \n                              YOUNG WOMAN\n                    Thank you. You're... a good man.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    There are no good men on the road.\n          \n                              YOUNG WOMAN\n                    Where are you going?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    West.\n          \n                              YOUNG WOMAN\n                    Can... can I come with you?\n          \n          He doesn't even turn back to look at her.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    No.\n          \n          He walks on, into the horizon.\n          \n          EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY\n          \n          Straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a\n          long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up.\n          \n          He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the\n          overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out\n          from where the roadway has been severed.\n          \n          Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the\n          wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze.\n          \n                                                                 13.\n          \n          \n          The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS\n          PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.\n          \n          Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he\n          FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes\n          cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:\n          \n          TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything\n          from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but\n          apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.\n          \n          The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as\n          the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's\n          rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.\n          \n          Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time\n          much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.\n          \n          FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on\n          the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try\n          desperately to steer the barrow off the road.\n          \n          The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount.\n          Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for\n          it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.\n          \n          The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers\n          swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.\n          \n          The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped\n          from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.\n          \n          Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for\n          his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    It ain't your concern. Stay on the\n                    path. It ain't your concern. Stay\n                    on the path.\n          \n          Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene,\n          but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and\n          waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And\n          then finally, suddenly, is silenced.\n          \n          Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and\n          bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the\n          wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt.\n          \n          They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we\n          don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel.\n          They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the\n          direction they came, dust pluming in their wake.\n          \n                                                                 14.\n          \n          \n          Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into\n          the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.\n          \n          EXT. ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAY\n          \n          Eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. He signs\n          a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer\n          under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road.\n          \n          EXT. ROAD FORK - DAY\n          \n          More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road\n          forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops.\n          \n          The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other\n          fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon.\n          \n          A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No\n          words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF\n          FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town.\n          \n          Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his\n          pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs.\n          \n          He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.\n          \n          EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY\n          \n          A primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like\n          structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded\n          plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world.\n          \n          HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many\n          wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun.\n          \n          Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he\n          braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner,\n          entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:\n          \n          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town\n          once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely\n          intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt\n          street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.\n          \n          It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through\n          earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.\n          \n          It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an\n          old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America,\n          but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An\n          unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new.\n          \n                                                                 15.\n          \n          \n          The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of\n          the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town,\n          badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.\n          \n          Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH,\n          hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    You got an engineer or a fuelman\n                    around here?\n          \n          The blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions\n          toward a storefront at the far end of the street.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Thanks.\n          \n          Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a\n          STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely\n          fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of\n          a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun.\n          \n          As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents\n          take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping.\n          \n          Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's\n          face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a\n          PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped\n          together at the waist, each man leading the one behind.\n          \n          Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND.\n          They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry\n          picks, shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG.\n          \n          Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like\n          cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a\n          stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.\n          \n                              CHAIN GANG BOSS\n                    Come on, move it!\n          \n          The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by. Eli doesn't\n          return the look, just continues crossing the street as the\n          blind are herded away. Headed toward a wooden building with a\n          pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.\n          \n          INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST-\n          APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods.\n          Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.\n          \n          An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings\n          of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around.\n          \n                                                                  16.\n          \n          \n          Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque\n          STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the\n          remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.\n          \n          Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its\n          reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.\n          \n          Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the\n          counter for something.\n          \n          Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training\n          a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    I don't know you.\n          \n          Eli slowly raises his hands.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I'm not from around here.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    No shit. Who are you?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I'm just a customer.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    A customer with a shotgun?\n          \n          He nods toward the shotgun visible on Eli's backpack.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    You come in here to rip me off?\n          \n          The engineer's hands tremble, his finger tight on the\n          trigger. This man needs to be talked down carefully.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    No. I'll set it down. Okay?\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    Slowly!\n          \n          Eli nods. Unhitches the pack and sets it down, steps away.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    You carry a gun in the outland, you\n                    don't bring one into town less you\n                    live there. Don't you know that?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on\n                    the road a long time.\n          \n                                                                    17.\n          \n          \n          This seems to make the engineer more suspicious of Eli.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    Show me your hand.\n          \n                                 ELI\n                    I'm not a-\n          \n          The engineer jerks the shotgun at Eli nervously.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    I said show me your fucking hand!\n          \n          Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced\n          downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of\n          ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I'm not one of them.\n          \n          The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a\n          little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    What do you want?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I'm just passing through. I need\n                    some help. I can pay.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    What kinda help? And what kinda\n                    pay?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I'm going to get something out of\n                    my pack. Okay?\n          \n          The engineer raises the shotgun nervously again.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I know, I know. Slowly.\n          \n          The engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his pack\n          and pulls out the car battery. When he sees it, he gasps.\n          \n                                 ENGINEER\n                    Holy shit.\n          \n          Eli places it on the counter. The engineer looks it over with\n          awe, like it's a priceless historical artifact.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    Where'd you find this?\n          \n                                                                 18.\n          \n          \n                              ELI\n                    Years ago, in the outland back east\n                    aways.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    Does it work?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can\n                    you do it? I got the cables.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    Depends if you also got the coin.\n          \n          Eli pulls the Zippo lighter from his pocket. The engineer\n          picks it up, sparks the flint, watches the flame flicker.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    It'll take a couple hours. There's\n                    a bar across the street you can\n                    wait, they just opened up.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I'll wait here.\n          \n                              ENGINEER\n                    You don't trust me?\n          \n                              ELI\n                        (SMILES)\n                    I don't know you.\n          \n          INT. PALLADIUM - AUDITORIUM - DAY\n          \n          This once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn\n          out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the\n          stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place.\n          \n          Looking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most\n          prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an\n          OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE\n          MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it.\n          \n          The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of\n          someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but\n          has no taste whatsoever.\n          \n          A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind\n          the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK.\n          \n          The book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title\n          still just visible: 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE.\n          \n                                                                   19.\n          \n          \n          The man is OLDER than most we've seen. His skin weathered by\n          the elements and by a long life's experience. One of the very\n          few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and\n          unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well-\n          groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth.\n          \n          He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches,\n          everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he\n          looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE.\n          \n          He looks up from his book at the sound of a POLITE COUGH O.S.\n          \n          REDRIDGE stands before him.

Concerned.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    How bad is it?\n          \n                              REDRIDGE\n                    Pressure is down again, and going\n                    by the new rod they sank levels're\n                    lower than they've ever been.\n          \n          Carnegie stands. Thinking. This is bad news.\n          \n                                CARNEGIE\n                    How long?\n          \n                              REDRIDGE\n                    Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A\n                    little longer if we're careful. But\n                    we're already-\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Halve the rations.\n          \n                              REDRIDGE\n                    We just halved `em last-\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    So halve them again!\n          \n          BEAT. Carnegie stares Redridge down. Nobody but nobody\n          questions his orders.\n          \n                                                                 20.\n          \n          \n                              REDRIDGE\n                    You're going to have to say\n                    something. Folks were none too\n                    happy last time. Gonna be worse\n                    now, you can count on it.\n          \n          Carnegie sighs, rubs his brow. He knows Redridge is right.\n          \n          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY\n          \n          A LARGE CROWD OF TOWNSFOLK - several hundred strong - has\n          assembled outside the Palladium theater. AN ARMED CREW OF\n          CARNEGIE'S GOONS keeps watch over the crowd.\n          \n          Carnegie stands on a BALCONY above the theater marquee. He\n          treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a\n          MICROPHONE connected to an old PA SYSTEM that carries his\n          words to the far reaches of the crowd.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    I want you all to remember how far\n                    we've come together. And how far we\n                    still can go, if only we believe.\n                    When I brought us here to this\n                    oasis - this promised land - we\n                    knew there would be hardships. Knew\n                    there would be sacrifices. But we\n                    also knew that we were creating for\n                    ourselves a world where we could be\n                    safe from the horrors of the\n                    forsaken lands beyond our borders.\n          \n          The crowd listens intently, hanging on Carnegie's every word.\n          He is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker - his\n          cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us\n          of a TELEVISION EVANGELIST.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    And I want you all to remember\n                    above all that it is not the water\n                    with which we have been blessed\n                    that is the true lifeblood of this\n                    town... but faith.\n          \n          This sends a MURMUR OF DISCONTENT through the crowd. Many\n          don't like where they suspect this may be going. Carnegie\n          senses this and dials up his rhetoric - delivering it now\n          with the fire-brand passion of an old-time baptist preacher.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    It is our faith that sustains us,\n                    brothers and sisters! Hallelujah!\n          \n                                                                 21.\n          \n          \n          The crowd is divided. Many return the \"Hallelujah\" with\n          varying levels of conviction. Others are not convinced. But\n          Carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    And mark me, the ultimate\n                    validation of that faith is coming!\n                    The sacred Word of Our Lord that\n                    formed the world before and will\n                    reform it once again is coming to\n                    this town to bring it succor, bring\n                    it nourishment, bring it new life!\n                    For the Almighty Himself has spoken\n                    unto me and promised it!\n          \n          Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's\n          almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his\n          words. His apparently unshakable belief is infectious.\n          \n                               CARNEGIE\n                    In the meantime, He has asked us\n                    all to be patient. To walk the hard\n                    road of the faithful just a little\n                    longer. And to do that, we must\n                    give just a little more.\n                        (BEAT)\n                    Water rations will be halved until\n                    further notice.\n          \n          This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the\n          crowd - this news has not been received well at all. Some\n          still \"keep the faith\" but many more are perturbed by this.\n          \n          Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    I understand your frustration. The\n                    road to salvation is a difficult\n                    one - but what lies at the end of\n                    that road is a greater glory,\n                    beyond anything you can imagine.\n          \n          A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward, pushing through the\n          crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie.\n          \n                              DISCONTENTED VILLAGER\n                    We've heard this all before! When\n                    are you going to-\n          \n          Carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently SILENCE THE\n          MAN, removing him from the crowd. Dissent is not tolerated\n          here. Carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened.\n          \n                                                                 22.\n          \n          \n                               CARNEGIE\n                    I know each and every one of you\n                    will understand the necessity of\n                    this action. It was faith that\n                    built this town - and faith that\n                    will sustain it even through the\n                    dark times that may lie ahead. But\n                    it is always darkest before dawn -\n                    and the new dawn is coming.\n                        (BEAT)\n                    May God go with you all.\n          \n          Carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among\n          themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard.\n          \n          As the assembled townsfolk disperse, FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar\n          into town and pull up outside the Palladium.\n          \n          As the riders dismount, one detaches a CLOTH SATCHEL from his\n          bike's cargo rack. The four riders head inside. They each\n          have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions.\n          \n          We recognize them now as the BIKER BANDITS who killed the\n          couple on the road under the freeway overpass.\n          \n          INT. PALLADIUM - SECOND FLOOR - DAY\n          \n          Carnegie emerges into the second-floor hallway from the\n          balcony, mopping his brow. Exhausted and stressed from his\n          grand theatrical display, and from its mixed reception.\n          \n          Redridge climbs the stairs to meet him.\n          \n                               REDRIDGE\n                    One of the road crews just rolled\n                    into town.\n          \n          Carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Of course they did, the bar's open.\n                    Outlanders, always looking for\n                    answers at the bottom of a bottle.\n          \n                               REDRIDGE\n                    Not these guys.\n                        (BEAT)\n                    These guys say they got something.\n          \n          That gets Carnegie's attention.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Get them up here now.\n          \n                                                                 23.\n          \n          \n          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY\n          \n          What was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the\n          rest of the theater, been largely gutted. But it's still\n          impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase\n          leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc.\n          FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls.\n          \n          The place has been shabbily converted into a kind of SALOON.\n          Old ripped-out theater seats arranged around tables. A\n          FIREPLACE sputters dimly.\n          \n          A MANGY TABBY CAT walks across the straw-laden floor. A dozen\n          or so CUSTOMERS in the place, a mixed, rough-looking bunch.\n          \n          Redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of\n          his MEN who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs.\n          \n          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX\n          \n          Carnegie checks his reflection in a CRACKED HAND MIRROR,\n          licks his palm and slicks his hair back. He adjusts his tie\n          as Redridge's men usher the bikers into his \"office\".\n          \n          Carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. Just as\n          when he gave his balcony address, Carnegie is in performance\n          mode - charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to\n                    see you again! I understand your\n                    latest excursion into the outland\n                    has been a profitable one?\n          \n          The bikers exchange looks. They understood maybe half the\n          words in that sentence. The lead biker - named HOG - speaks.\n          \n                              HOG\n                    We did good.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Well, let's see, shall we?\n          \n          Hog tips the satchel's contents out onto Carnegie's desk.\n          \n          BOOKS. About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and\n          sizes. Carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection.\n          \n          We see various titles as he sorts through them. Treasure\n          Island. The Da Vinci Code. A volume of encyclopedia. The\n          Diary of Anne Frank. Tuesdays with Morrie.\n          \n          In amongst the books are a few MAGAZINES. An old issue of\n          OPRAH magazine. A torn copy of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED...\n          \n                                                                 24.\n          \n          \n          ...And a NEWSWEEK. The cover graphic illustrates OPPOSING\n          NUCLEAR ARSENALS over a world globe. On one side the STARS\n          AND STRIPES, on the other flags indicating a SINO-ISLAMIC\n          ALLIANCE.

You\n                    want us to keep at it, reckon it's\n                    worth more than a few free glasses\n                    of that swill you call liquor.\n          \n          Carnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation.\n          Carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you\n                    once again to take the long view\n                    here. When we find this book - and\n                    believe me, we will find it - we\n                    are going to build a new world. A\n                    world far greater, far more\n                    righteous than this one. And you\n                    and I are going to be perched right\n                    on top of it, looking down upon it,\n                    masters of all creation!\n          \n          As always, his carefully stage-managed rhetoric is delivered\n          with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion\n          and persuasion. He's a master salesman, a true huckster.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    And you know, I think you're\n                    absolutely right.\n                              (MORE)\n          \n                                                                 25.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE (cont'd)\n                    That is worth more than a few\n                    glasses of liquor. A whole lot\n                    more.\n          \n          He steps forward and looks Hog right in the eye. His gaze\n          like a laser beam, utterly disarming.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    The book I want is out there\n                    somewhere, just waiting to be\n                    found.

She washes her\n          face in murky water in an old PORCELAIN BOWL on the dresser.\n          \n          Her name is CLAUDIA. Early 30s, pretty. She gazes into the\n          mirror as she dries her hands, but it's so cracked and warped\n          it's near impossible to see a reflection.\n          \n          The door opens and Carnegie enters.

If we\n                    don't find the right one soon - if\n                    I can't give these people what they\n                    want to hear...\n          \n          Carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate.\n          Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    You'll find what you're looking\n                    for. It's out there somewhere. You\n                    just have to have faith.\n          \n          This seems to anger Carnegie.

You\n                    know where it got me?\n          \n          He's in her face now.

This\n                    world is what you can see and touch\n                    and taste. It's what you make it.\n                    All these years with me, you still\n                    don't have any grasp of that?\n                    What's wrong with you, woman?\n          \n          He's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.\n          \n                                 CLAUDIA\n                    I'm sorry.\n          \n          Carnegie realizes he's frightened her.

You okay?\n          \n          He lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    You just get me all riled up with\n                    that kind of talk.

It's clear she's not in\n          the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. More out of\n          a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion.\n          \n          As they kiss, Carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall\n          and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.\n          \n          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY\n          \n          The original customers have now been joined by the four\n          bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and\n          pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar.\n          \n          Eli enters. All eyes are on him immediately, regarding him\n          with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar.\n          \n          The BARTENDER approaches, looks him up and down. Suspicious.\n          \n                              BARTENDER\n                    Outlander?

The bartender\n          takes it and looks it over. Not particularly impressed.\n          \n                              BARTENDER\n                    That'll get you maybe half-way.\n          \n          The bartender spies Eli's silver Saint Christopher pendant.\n          \n                              BARTENDER\n                    What about that?\n          \n          Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for\n          sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur\n          pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    That's the best I got.\n          \n          The bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat\n          leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts\n          with suspicion and HISSES at Eli.\n          \n          Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the\n          biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this.\n          \n          Satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along\n          with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.\n          \n                              BARTENDER\n                    Solara!\n          \n          A TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back. No older than 16 or 17.\n          Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair\n          tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's\n          clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman.\n          \n          The bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara\n          along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck.\n          \n                                                                 30.\n          \n          \n                              BARTENDER\n                    Take this out back and get it\n                    filled.\n          \n          Solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up\n          and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued.\n          There's something about him she can't put her finger on...\n          \n          He doesn't look back at her. She turns and exits.\n          \n          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Solara exits via the Palladium's STAGE DOOR and walks across\n          the busy street to where TWO OF CARNEGIE'S ARMED MEN stand\n          guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH\n          RAZOR WIRE. TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets.\n          \n          One of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the\n          front of the line. He punches two holes in her ration card\n          and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure.\n          \n          Inside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging\n          from the earth. Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes a\n          few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak\n          trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen.\n          \n          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          As Eli sits at the bar, a SHADOW comes into view and looms\n          large over him. Hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting\n          a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers.\n          \n          Solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking Eli's\n          canteen away into the back room.\n          \n                              HOG\n                    That was my cat.\n          \n          Eli doesn't turn.

Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing\n          more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in\n          his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I know you. Murderer of innocent\n                    travelers on the road.

Did you know that?\n          \n          The other bikers stand and approach, the OTHER CUSTOMERS\n          following suit. Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    You go on back to your table and\n                    I'll be on my way. All right?\n          \n          It's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases\n          his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath.\n          \n          Eli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and\n          other patrons have moved to block his exit.\n          \n                              BURLY PATRON\n                    You push Hog, you push all of us.\n          \n          Eli sighs, looks down at the floor. He's been pushed one time\n          too many today. For the first time, we see anger in his face.\n          \n                                                                    32.\n          \n          \n                              ELI\n                    Cursed be the ground because of\n                    you.

For dust you are.\n          \n          The patrons look at Eli strangely. Who is this guy?\n          \n          Eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword. Carves a line\n          in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    And to dust you shall return.\n          \n          INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY\n          \n          Carnegie has Claudia pinned against the wall, his pants\n          bunched around his ankles, ass bared as he pounds away at\n          her. Not making love. This is mechanical, loveless sex.\n          \n          Claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as\n          Carnegie thrusts into her again and again. Deeply\n          uninterested, just waiting for it to be over.\n          \n          Suddenly, we hear a CRASH O.S.

Claudia just stands there for a moment,\n          then reaches down and pulls up her panties.\n          \n          She moves from the wall and makes her way across the room,\n          feeling her way with her hands, gazing off into nothingness.\n          Only now do we finally realize that she is BLIND.\n          \n          INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony. Looks\n          down over the railing - and is stunned by what he sees.\n          \n                                                                 33.\n          \n          \n          CHAOS in the bar below. Eli cutting a one-man swath of mayhem\n          through the dozen brawlers. Most already lie dead. TWO MORE\n          MEN ATTACK Eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword.\n          \n          Carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing, banging loudly\n          on the doors of the upstairs rooms.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Get your asses out here!\n          \n          ON ELI. Surrounded by the dead, only one man left standing.\n          Hog. He backs away as Eli circles him like a predator. Sword\n          held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood.\n          \n          SOLARA re-emerges from the back room with Eli's refilled\n          canteen. She stops and emits a horrified GASP when she sees\n          the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her.\n          \n          She watches, mortified, as Eli moves toward the helpless,\n          terrified Hog, going in for the kill. Raising his sword...\n          \n          Suddenly, Solara steps forward and CRIES OUT:\n          \n                                 SOLARA\n                    Stop!\n          \n          Eli FREEZES. Sword hanging in the air, poised to strike.

Get out of here.\n          \n          Hog stumbles backward through the door, into the sunlight.\n          Eli moves toward Solara, who stands petrified behind the bar.\n          Reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip.\n          \n                                 ELI\n                    Thank you.\n          \n                                                                    34.\n          \n          \n          In the exitway, Hog turns back inside, grabbing up a BROKEN\n          BOTTLE from the bloody floor as he goes.\n          \n          Hog rushes Eli from behind. Solara sees him coming and goes\n          to SCREAM - but before any sound can come, Eli flips his\n          sword backward and Hog runs right onto it, SKEWERING HIMSELF.\n          \n          BEAT. Hog just stands there for a moment, eyes wide, frozen\n          in shock. His fingers go limp, dropping the bottle.\n          \n          He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead.\n          \n          Eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it. Looks around at\n          the bloodied, fallen bodies. Then back at Solara.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I'm sorry for all the mess.\n          \n          As he turns and heads toward the door:\n          \n                              CARNEGIE (O.S.)\n                    Hold it right there.\n          \n          Accompanied by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS COCKING.\n          \n          Carnegie is on the landing, training his rifle down at Eli.\n          Alongside him, FIVE GUNMEN do the same. They've got him cold.\n          \n          INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX\n          \n          Carnegie sits at his desk, the huge auditorium and stage area\n          visible behind him. Eli stands before him. Around him are the\n          other gunmen, who keep their weapons trained on him.\n          \n          Standing at Carnegie's side are REDRIDGE and CLAUDIA.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    So, who are you?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Nobody.

Laws\n                    set down long before any of us ever\n                    walked this earth. And one of them\n                    is, you don't eat the flesh of your\n                    brother. Else you're no better than\n                    an animal. And not welcome here.\n          \n          Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there in Carnegie's gaze.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    So what's your business here,\n                    friend? Walkers don't usually come\n                    into town less they want something.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I had a battery needed charging and\n                    a canteen needed filling. I didn't\n                    come here looking for trouble.\n          \n          Barely noticeable, Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen,\n          who nods in acknowledgement and leaves.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Well, you sure as hell found it.

A small\n                    tribute from a grateful people. I\n                    was deeply touched.\n          \n                                                                 36.\n          \n          \n                              ELI\n                    You had slaves build you a monument\n                    to yourself?\n          \n          The mention of that word rankles Carnegie. He walks around\n          the desk toward Eli, waves an admonishing finger at him.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Don't call them slaves. That's an\n                    old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm\n                    trying to help these people.\n          \n          Carnegie can't help himself - once again he is in his natural\n          element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. Selling.\n          \n                               CARNEGIE\n                    In the outland the sightless are\n                    preyed upon like sick animals. Here\n                    at least they're protected. They do\n                    the essential work others don't\n                    want. And in return they eat, they\n                    drink, they survive. Last year, a\n                    couple of them even got married -\n                    performed the ceremony myself.\n                        (BEAT)\n                    You see, I'm not exploiting these\n                    people - I'm saving them! Any one\n                    of them is free to leave whenever\n                    they wish. But here they stay. And\n                    they thank me every single day for\n                    their salvation!\n          \n          An impressive, impassioned performance. He sounds just like\n          an old-school TV evangelist. But Eli is unmoved.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    It's none of my business what you\n                    do here.

Good man. We educated\n          folk, we need to stick together, if\n          we're ever going to rebuild this\n          world.

I like that.\n          Fact is, you could be in a lot of\n          trouble.

A threadbare rug.\n          Bed with relatively clean sheets. A sink for washing.\n          \n                              REDRIDGE\n                    Enjoy your stay.

Eli\n          paces across the room. Finally sits down on the creaky old\n          bed. Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here.\n          \n          He unshoulders his pack, sets it down. Lies down on the bed.\n          It's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back.\n          \n          A KNOCK at the door.

He told me he was going\n                    to make a place where we could be\n                    safe. And he did. He did all that.\n                    He built this whole town. He kept\n                    us safe. And he raised that child\n                    like she was his own. He's been so\n                    good to both of us. He saved us,\n                    really.\n          \n          There's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As though\n          there is more to the story than she is telling.\n          \n          Eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    You want to eat some?\n          \n          She smiles and sits.

I was already used to\n                    being like this by the time... by\n                    the time it all happened. So I got\n                    around pretty good even when I was\n                    on my own. And now it's easy. I\n                    know every creaky old floorboard in\n                    here, and it's not like I ever go\n                    any place else. Bill would never\n                    allow it. He worries about me so\n                    much.\n          \n          Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped.\n          Thinking about it begins to upset her.

It makes Claudia nervous.\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    He wanted to talk.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Oh? What about?\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    Nothing really. He asked me what it\n                    was like to be blind.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    He tell you anything about him?\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    No. I don't think he likes to talk\n                    about himself much.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Yeah, I got that.\n          \n          Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    I don't think he's going to change\n                    his mind by morning. I don't think\n                    he's going to stay.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    What makes you say that?\n          \n                                                                44.\n          \n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    Just strikes me as the kind of man\n                    who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't\n                    seem like the type to go changing\n                    it once it's set.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Well, we'll just see about that.\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    You saw him. He's not like the\n                    others. You won't be able to smooth-\n                    talk him and wrap him around your\n                    finger like you usually do.\n          \n                               CARNEGIE\n                    Who said anything about me?\n                        (BEAT)\n                    I'm sending Solara.\n          \n          Claudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry.\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    You're doing what?\n                              CARNEGIE\n                    You know how often these walkers\n                    get laid? Never. Least not by\n                    anything living or willing. Girl\n                    like her can be very persuasive.\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    You can't send her in there with\n                    him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    You went in there readily enough.\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    That's different. Solara's just a\n                    child, she can't-\n          \n          Carnegie sighs, tiring of this.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    She's a grown woman now, Claudia.\n                    Sooner or later you're going to\n                    have to accept that. She has to\n                    earn her keep around here, same as\n                    the rest of us.\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    By working as a whore? That's all\n                    you think she's fit for?\n          \n                                                                    45.\n          \n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    We've each been given a talent to\n                    help us make our way in this world.\n                    Some people's gift is more evident\n                    than others. Solara's sure as hell\n                    is.\n          \n          Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust.\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    What kind of a man are you?\n          \n          Now it's Carnegie's turn to get angry. He rounds on her\n          menacingly. She backs off as he approaches.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    I'm the kind of man who'd pull a\n                    helpless blind girl off the road, a\n                    girl who'd been beaten and raped,\n                    and give her a place where she can\n                    live without fear! Without me you'd\n                    be just another no-eye, lying dead\n                    in the outland, picked clean by the\n                    buzzards, or shoveling dirt down\n                    there with the others. That's the\n                    kind of man I am!\n          \n          He has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    I don't live without fear. I\n                    haven't for a long time now.\n          \n          Carnegie calms himself, backs off. Claudia goes to leave.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    Where are you going?\n          \n                              CLAUDIA\n                    I'm not going to let you do this.\n          \n          Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall.\n          \n                               CARNEGIE\n                    You're not going to let me?\n                        (BEAT)\n                    Nobody tells me what I can and\n                    can't do in my own town. Nobody. I\n                    built this world, and I am God\n                    here! So don't go thinking about\n                    screwing with my plans. You know\n                    how this works. Solara goes against\n                    me, you get hurt. You go against\n                    me, she gets hurt.\n          \n                                                                 46.\n          \n          \n          He releases his grip on her.\n          \n                              CARNEGIE\n                    So let's not see anybody get hurt.\n                    Okay?\n          \n          He speaks more softly now. As he strokes his hand tenderly\n          through Claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.\n          \n          INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the\n          oil lamp. Eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old\n          leather-bound book from his backpack.\n          \n          Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides\n          the book inside his shirt.\n          \n                               ELI\n                    Come in.\n          \n          The door opens to reveal Solara. Looking very different than\n          she did before. Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer\n          dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. Stunning.\n          \n          Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at\n          least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. Far\n          too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    Hi. Can I come in?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Someone was already here with food\n                    and water. I got everything I need.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    You sure about that?\n          \n          She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. Very\n          seductive. Eli is totally disarmed in her presence.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    It's too bright in here. Mind if I\n                    turn it down a little?\n          \n          She doesn't wait for an answer. Moves to the table and turns\n          down the oil lamp. A darker, more seductive lighting scheme.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    That's better. I'm Solara. You're\n                    Walker, right?\n          \n                                                                   47.\n          \n          \n                              ELI\n                    No. My name's Eli.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    That short for something? Elias?\n          \n                               ELI\n                    Elijah.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    Elijah. I never heard that one\n                    before. It's kinda cute.\n          \n          She sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. Her light\n          cotton dress revealing in all the right places. The\n          silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the\n          oil lamp. No red-blooded man on earth could resist her.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Look, I don't mean to be rude. But\n                    I'm really not interested.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    You sure about that? It gets mighty\n                    lonely out there on the road.\n          \n          She leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. Her hair\n          cascades down. God damn, she looks good.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    If you're worried about money, this\n                    is all paid for. The whole night.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    It's not that. You're a very nice\n                    girl. But I'm not that kind of man.\n          \n          She slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the\n          buttons of his shirt.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    They're all that kind of man.\n          He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step.\n          \n                               ELI\n                    I'm not.\n          \n          She is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And\n          then she seems a little insulted.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    They told me you were crazy. Maybe\n                    they were right.\n          \n                                                                 48.\n          \n          \n          Eli opens the door for her.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I'm sorry. Good night.\n          \n          Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves\n          to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    Please don't make me leave. I have\n                    to stay the night. If I don't...\n          \n                              ELI\n                    If you don't, what?\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    He'll hurt my mom.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Who will? Carnegie?\n          \n          She nods, fighting back a tear. This angers Eli.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Maybe he and I oughta have words.\n          \n          He goes for the door handle, but she stops him.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    No! Please, don't!\n          \n                              ELI\n                    He's hurting you. He's hurting your\n                    mother. He's-\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    He's my dad.\n          \n          BEAT. Eli moves his hand away from the door.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    Look, if you want to help me, just\n                    let me stay here tonight. We don't\n                    have to do anything. I'll sleep on\n                    the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my\n                    dad that we had a good time. I'll\n                    be no trouble, I swear.\n          \n          She looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer the\n          teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    You want to have a conversation?\n          \n                                                                 49.\n          \n          \n          She smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek.\n          \n          LATER\n          \n          Eli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At\n          first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.\n          \n                                ELI\n                      You know, you don't have to be\n                      afraid of me.

Nowadays it's\n                    not the same. If you're sick or\n                    you're weak or you're old you won't\n                    last long out on the road.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    So how come you have?\n          \n          BEAT.

An\n          embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover.\n          \n          Eli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he\n          finds the passage he's looking for.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    The Lord is my shepherd.

He restores my soul.\n                    He leads me in the paths of\n                    righteousness.\n          \n          ON SOLARA as she listens to Eli read.

For you are with me. Your rod\n                    and your staff, they comfort me.\n                    You prepare a table before me in\n                    the presence of my enemies. You\n                    anoint my head with oil. My cup\n                    runs over. Surely goodness and\n                    mercy shall follow me, all the days\n                    of my life.

It's from the Holy Bible.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    I never heard of it. What's it\n                    about?\n          \n          BEAT as Eli thinks.

I guess it's\n                    about a little bit of everything.\n          \n                                 SOLARA\n                    Can I see?\n          \n          She reaches out for the book but he snatches it away.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    What?

There are no\n                    other books like this. All the\n                    others are gone - destroyed by the\n                    war or in the burnings that came\n                    after.

There were\n                    still a lot of people around back\n                    then, in the beginning. I didn't\n                    really know what I should do or\n                    where I was going. I was just\n                    moving from place to place, trying\n                    to stay alive. And then one day I\n                    heard this voice. I don't know how\n                    to explain it, it's like it was\n                    coming from inside me. But I could\n                    hear it, clear as day. Clear as I\n                    can hear you talking to me now.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    What did it say?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    It led me to this place, I don't\n                    really know where. And I found this\n                    book buried deep under some rubble.\n                    No way no-one was ever going to\n                    find it if they didn't know exactly\n                    where to look.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    But you knew because the voice told\n                    you?\n          \n                              ELI\n                    That's right.

He takes a moment to\n          collect himself, reloads the shotgun.\n          \n          The three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily.\n          \n          Eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to the\n          sky and offers up a silent prayer. Then emerges from around\n          the junkpile back into the street. All three gunmen OPEN\n          FIRE, their bullets whipping past on either side of him.\n          \n                                                                 61.\n          \n          \n          In one swift motion Eli raises the shotgun and FIRES. Three\n          shots in quick succession. And then there is silence. Smoke\n          wisps from the shotgun's sawn-off barrel.\n          \n          The three gunmen LIE DEAD IN THE STREET. One hit square in\n          the chest. The other two each have maybe one half of their\n          heads remaining.\n          \n          Eli looks around. He's right at the end of the main road, the\n          perimeter where the town meets the open desert. He's free.\n          \n          And then, A GIRL'S SCREAM. Distant but unmistakable.\n          \n          Eli whips around. In the upstairs window of the theater,\n          Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall. Barking\n          angrily at her, shaking her.\n          \n          Eli looks at the road. Then up at the theater. Then back to\n          the road again.\n          \n                              ELI\n                        (quietly; to himself)\n                    It ain't your concern.

She ain't got nothing!\n          \n          The BRIGAND LEADER looks Solara up and down lustfully.\n          \n                                BRIGAND LEADER\n                      I ain't too sure about that.\n          \n          Solara is reviled by the man. He's filthy, his stench\n          overpowering. One eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. He\n          licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.\n          \n                                YOUNG WOMAN\n                      This wasn't the deal!\n          \n          The brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat.\n          \n                                                                    73.\n          \n          \n                              BRIGAND LEADER\n                    Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta\n                    be grateful you're getting a break.\n          \n          He releases her. She slumps to the dirt, whimpering.\n          \n                              BRIGAND LEADER\n                    Never did care much for that dried-\n                    up old snatch anyhow.\n          \n          He looks back to the struggling Solara.\n          \n                              BRIGAND LEADER\n                    This one, though... this one looks\n                    fresh. You a virgin?\n          \n          She says nothing, just sobs helplessly.\n          \n                              BRIGAND LEADER\n                    Well, let's find out.\n          \n          He unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles.\n          \n          We hear a sound. It's hard to place. Something like a THHUP.\n          \n          The brigand leader is frozen in shock. His face goes pale,\n          the blood draining from it. The two bandits holding Solara\n          look at their leader in dismay. Staring down at his crotch.\n          \n          A quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down.\n          \n          There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down\n          there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood\n          streams down his thighs. A real horror show.\n          \n          He staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down\n          at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends.\n          \n          The two other brigands release Solara and whip around,\n          scanning the horizon. They see nothing. One of them has a\n          RIFLE. He unslings it and aims it frantically around.\n          \n          Then they both see it. Coming right at them. The most\n          terrifying thing either has ever seen.\n          \n          ELI, WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD, OUT OF THE SUN. His\n          silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. An avenging angel.\n          \n          He pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit\n          trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger.\n          \n          Eli SHOOTS. The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO\n          THE RIFLE BARREL. The feathers at the end of the shaft\n          plugging the muzzle tight.\n          \n                                                                  74.\n          \n          \n          Rifle bandit pulls the trigger. The gun EXPLODES, BLOWING HIS\n          HANDS CLEAN OFF. He falls to the ground, screaming.\n          \n          Eli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws his\n          sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. The\n          two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch.\n          \n          BEAT. The knife brigand hesitates, trembling. And then RUSHES\n          ELI WITH THE KNIFE. Eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the\n          sword. So quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all.\n          \n          The knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. His\n          hand goes limp and drops the knife.\n          \n          And then his HEAD FALLS BACKWARD like a Pez dispenser. Almost\n          completely decapitated, but not quite. Blood fountains from\n          the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt.\n          \n          Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded\n          on the ground, but still breathing. He stands over their\n          fallen bodies. They stare back up at him, helpless.\n          \n          He crouches down between them in the dust.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I offer you both one final chance\n                    in this life to seek forgiveness\n                    for your sins so that your souls\n                    may find salvation. Will you say\n                    with me the act of contrition?\n          \n          The brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.\n          \n                                BRIGAND LEADER\n                    Fuck you.\n          \n          Eli sighs. Stands and looks down on him without pity.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Some might think it'd be most\n                    fitting to leave you here like\n                    this. Let you die slow in the sun.\n                    But I know better. I know where\n                    you're going. And the sooner you\n                    get there, the sooner you'll get\n                    what's coming to you.\n          \n          He plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him\n          off. Pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean.\n          \n          He turns to the other man, raising his sword.\n          \n                                RIFLE BANDIT\n                    Wait!\n          \n                                                                   75.\n          \n          \n          Eli pauses, sword hovering over him, poised to strike.\n          \n                              RIFLE BANDIT\n                    I want to say it. I want to be\n                    forgiven.\n          \n          Eli crouches once more by his side.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Repeat after me. Oh God, I am\n                    heartily sorry for having offended\n                    thee, and I detest all my sins.\n          \n          The bandit follows along with Eli, mouthing the words\n          quietly. The life ebbing from him with each moment.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    I firmly resolve, with the help of\n                    thy grace, to confess my sins, and\n                    do penance, and to amend my life.\n                    Amen.\n          \n                              RIFLE BANDIT\n                    Amen...\n          \n          His eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him. Dead. Eli\n          signs a cross over his body, then stands and walks away.\n          \n          Solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. Eli approaches and\n          gathers her up in his arms. She clings on to him tightly.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    You came back for me.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    What are friends for?\n          \n          She laughs, a tear rolling down her cheek. Grips him tighter.\n          \n          He helps her up and escorts her back to the road.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    This is the deal. You keep up. You\n                    pull your weight. You fall behind,\n                    I can't help you. Okay?\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    Okay.\n          \n          She looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    What about her?\n          \n                                                                    76.\n          \n          \n                              ELI\n                    There's nothing can be done for\n                    her.\n          \n          They walk on down the road.\n          \n          EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY\n          \n          METAL GARAGE DOORS roll back to reveal darkness within.\n          \n          A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS fires up. Full beam right at us.\n          \n          A VEHICLE roars out of the darkness onto the street. Heavily\n          modified with plate armor and turret-mounted weapons. But its\n          original form still recognizable underneath.\n          \n          It's a HONDA ODYSSEY minivan. Once the #1 choice of soccer\n          moms, transformed now into an armored personnel carrier.\n          \n          Another minivan roars from the garage behind it. A DODGE\n          GRAND CARAVAN, similarly customized and armed to the teeth.\n          \n          THREE MORE CARS follow. As eclectic an assortment as you\n          could imagine. A MINI COOPER. FORD EXPLORER. A PRIUS. Each\n          adorned with plate armor and weapons.\n          \n          In the lead Minivan is REDRIDGE, heavily armed. He nods to\n          the DRIVER, who guns the engine.\n          \n          The fleet of armored vehicles moves out, kicking up a great\n          funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town.\n          \n          EXT. DESERT - DAY\n          \n          Late afternoon. The sun hangs low on the horizon. We're far\n          from the road. Nothing but scrub brush and a few PRAIRIE DOG\n          BURROWS dotted around.\n          \n          A PRAIRIE DOG pops its head up, scans the horizon. Sniffing\n          the air, whiskers twitching... and is SKEWERED BY AN ARROW.\n          \n          Thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears\n          to COME ALIVE. And then we realize it is Eli's GHILLIE SUIT,\n          camouflaging both he and Solara beneath it.\n          \n          Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead\n          prairie dog. Solara just stands there, appalled.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    You killed it! That cute little\n                    thing!\n          \n          Eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff.\n          \n                                                                    77.\n          \n          \n                              ELI\n                    It's good eating, is what it is.\n          \n          He yanks out the bloody arrow. Solara looks away.\n          \n          When she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding the\n          dead animal in front of her face. She YELPS in surprise and\n          staggers backward, falling on her butt.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    That's not funny.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    If you're going to be on the road,\n                    you can't be picky about what you\n                    eat. You eat what's there to eat.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    I'm not eating that.\n          \n                              ELI\n                        (SHRUGS)\n                    More for me.\n          \n          EXT. WASTELAND CAVE - DUSK\n          \n          Eli and Solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around a\n          flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit.\n          \n          Eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out\n          clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes down\n          penitently at the ground.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Father, we thank you for your\n                    generosity in providing us with\n                    this meal. Bless this food to our\n                    use and us to thy service, and keep\n                    us ever mindful of the needs of\n                    others. Amen.\n          \n          Eli carves off a piece of meat. Juicy and succulent. He bites\n          into it, teasing Solara by making a show of how good it\n          tastes. He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder.\n          \n          Solara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    What does that taste like?\n          \n          He takes another bite, thinks on this as he chews.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Tastes like chicken.\n          \n                                                                 78.\n          \n          \n          She tries to fight the temptation to try it... but she can't.\n          She reaches out and tears off a piece. Sniffs at it, takes a\n          small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. Eli smiles.\n          \n          As she eats, she gestures toward Eli's Saint Christopher.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    What is that?\n          \n          Eli reaches up and touches his hand to it.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    It's a Saint Christopher medal.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a\n                    character from your book?\n          \n          Eli smiles and shakes his head.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Christopher was a man who lived a\n                    long time ago. He wanted to be a\n                    good man, he wanted to help people.\n                    So he would stand by a river that\n                    had no bridge and carry people\n                    across. He was a big strong man and\n                    there was no one he couldn't carry.\n          \n          Solara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    Then one day a young child came to\n                    the river and asked to be carried\n                    across. Christopher tried to carry\n                    him but he was too heavy. He was\n                    just a small boy but he was heavier\n                    than any man he had ever carried.\n                    The boy explained that he was the\n                    son of God, and that he was so\n                    heavy because he bore all the sins\n                    of the world. After that,\n                    Christopher was able to carry him\n                    across and when they got to the\n                    other side the boy baptized him in\n                    the river. And that's how he became\n                    a saint. Later on, he was known as\n                    the patron saint of travelers.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    What is a saint, anyway?\n          \n                                                                 79.\n          \n          \n                              ELI\n                    It's someone who spent their life\n                    doing good things for others.\n                    Enough that God himself took a\n                    special interest in them.\n          \n          Solara looks at Eli tenderly, with admiration.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    Someone like you.\n          \n          Eli looks away, down at the ground.

Spilled too much blood.\n          \n          BEAT.

Eli sleeps next to his\n          pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His hat\n          and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword.\n          \n          Solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep after\n          all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and so\n          impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    Eli?\n          \n          No response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his\n          side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty.\n          \n          She goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing,\n          stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel,\n          hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop.\n          \n          It's a RECTANGULAR PLASTIC BADGE. The red, white and blue\n          colors faded and worn. It reads:\n          \n                               WELCOME TO WAL-MART\n                                 MY NAME IS \"ELI\"\n                               HOW MAY I HELP YOU?\n          \n                                                                  80.\n          \n          \n          She stares at it for a moment, not knowing what to make of\n          it. Then moves on, continuing to pat him down.\n          \n          Whatever she's looking for is not here. She turns her\n          attention to the backpack. Slowly, carefully, opens it up.\n          \n          There it is. THE BIBLE, wrapped carefully in its neat little\n          package of cloth and twine. She reaches in for it.\n          \n          Suddenly, ELI'S HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIST.\n          She cries out, startled. Eli sits up, his face just a dark\n          shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a little\n          scary to Solara.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    What are you doing?\n          \n                              SOLARA\n                    You scared me!

I understand! Ow!\n          \n          Eli releases her wrist. Takes the pack from her and closes it\n          up. Pulls it closer to him and lies back down.\n          \n                              ELI\n                    It's no use to you anyway.

Eli\n          drops his shotgun to the ground.\n          \n          They hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze.\n          \n          The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal...\n          \n          AN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat\n          bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses.

A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal.\n          \n          Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and\n          looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment.\n          \n          George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them\n          inhospitably.

Eli and Solara stare\n          at the cups, unsure. Martha gestures toward them.\n          \n                              MARTHA\n                    Please.\n          \n          They raise their cups and take a sip.

The tears dried on her\n          cheeks. She sits staring blankly at the DRIVER in front.\n          \n          And then she LUNGES VIOLENTLY FORWARD. Clawing and biting at\n          the driver, who struggles to fight her off. His hands come\n          off the wheel and the car FISHTAILS WILDLY.\n          \n          REDRIDGE'S VEHICLE\n          \n          The DRIVER sees something odd in the rear-view mirror.\n          \n                              DRIVER\n                    What the hell...?\n          \n          Redridge turns to see the car behind VEERING ERRATICALLY then\n          SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES, stopping in the middle of the road.\n          \n                              REDRIDGE\n                    Stop, stop!\n          \n          The car screeches to a halt.

HOUSE - DAY\n          \n          Solara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking\n          wreckage of the besieged house.

At first just a dot on the horizon.\n          But unmistakably Eli. By now, she'd know him anywhere.\n          \n          Suddenly the engine SPLUTTERS. She checks the fuel gauge; the\n          needle deep in the red. She pounds the wheel in frustration.\n          \n                                SOLARA\n                    No... No!\n          \n          The car grinds to a halt, dead. She flings open the door and\n          leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after Eli on foot.\n          \n          ON ELI. As always, his pace steady and slow. The sun directly\n          ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. Headed always west.\n          \n          Solara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back.\n          \n                                SOLARA\n                    Eli!

Trying to process this.\n          This kind of compassion is totally foreign to her.\n          \n          She holds out the sword, offering it to Eli by way of\n          atonement.\n          \n                               SOLARA\n                    Here.

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - MONTAGE - DAY\n          \n          Eli and Solara follow the road through burned-out towns and\n          retail neighborhoods. Gutted and dead, like every place else.\n          \n          But something is different here. Things are greener. Tufts of\n          grass here and there.

Straddled by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - the\n          once-great structure has partially collapsed from decades of\n          neglect and disrepair. The span sags and hangs low over the\n          ocean, the asphalt cracked and ruptured.\n          \n          On the other side of the bay, SAN FRANCISCO - or the little\n          that remains of it. The city has been almost TOTALLY\n          DESTROYED - entire areas reduced to rubble, the few buildings\n          still standing looking on the verge of collapse.\n          \n          Solara looks at it all in horrified awe.
