A hint of what's to come.\r\n\r\n          1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1\r\n\r\n          A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set\r\n          amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves\r\n          down the street and heads out of town.\r\n\r\n          2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2\r\n\r\n          The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels\r\n          of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a\r\n          variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point\r\n          at the sky.\r\n          JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She\r\n          positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the\r\n          constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from\r\n          spare parts of other devices.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Hurry!\r\n          We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.\r\n          Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as\r\n          well, rubbing his head.\r\n\r\n          JANE (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh-- watch your head.\r\n\r\n                         SELVIG\r\n          Thanks. So what's this \"anomaly\"\u009d\r\n          of yours supposed to look like?\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          It's a little different each time.\r\n          Once it looked like, I don't know,\r\n          melted stars, pooling in a corner\r\n          of the sky. But last week it was a\r\n          rolling rainbow ribbon--\r\n\r\n                         SELVIG\r\n\r\n                         (GENTLY TEASING)\r\n          \"Racing \"\u0098round Orion?\"\u009d I've always\r\n          said you should have been a poet.\r\n          Jane reigns in her excitement.

Pass up the bubbly and\r\n          my gloves, will you?\r\n          Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and\r\n          a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to\r\n          Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large\r\n          and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the\r\n          foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.\r\n\r\n          JANE (CONT'D)\r\n          Not until you see it!\r\n\r\n                         SELVIG\r\n          (re: the gloves)\r\n          I recognize those. Think how proud\r\n          he'd be to see you now.\r\n          Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Thank you.\r\n\r\n                         SELVIG\r\n          For what?\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          The benefit of the doubt.\r\n          The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while\r\n          they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.\r\n\r\n          JANE (CONT'D)\r\n          It's never taken this long before.\r\n          Darcy calls up from the front seat.\r\n\r\n          DARCY (O.S.)\r\n          Can I turn on the radio?\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          (an edge to her voice)\r\n          Sure, if you like rocking out to\r\n          KFRM, \"All agriculture, all the\r\n          time.\"\u009d\r\n          Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.\r\n\r\n          3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3\r\n\r\n          The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring\r\n          equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held\r\n          together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of\r\n          handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the\r\n          frustrated Jane with sympathy.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          The anomalies are always\r\n          precipitated by geomagnetic storms.\r\n          She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,\r\n          tracking occurrences and patterns.\r\n\r\n          JANE (CONT'D)\r\n          The last seventeen occurrences have\r\n          been predictable to the minute... I\r\n          just don't understand.\r\n          Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.\r\n          She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in\r\n          the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n          Jane?\r\n          Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of\r\n          champagne begins to vibrate.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          There's got to be some new\r\n          variable... Or an equipment\r\n          malfunction...\r\n          The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around\r\n          them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A.\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n          I don't think there's anything\r\n          wrong with your equipment...\r\n          The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it\r\n          shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.\r\n          They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when\r\n          the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing\r\n          everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.\r\n\r\n          DARCY (CONT'D)\r\n          Jane?\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          What?!\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n          I think you want to see this.\r\n          Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over\r\n          the desert --\r\n\r\n          MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT\r\n          Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Holy. Shatner.\r\n\r\n                         SELVIG\r\n          That's your \"subtle\"\u009d aurora?!\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          No-- yes! Let's go!\r\n\r\n          4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4\r\n\r\n          The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange\r\n          event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body\r\n          out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.\r\n          The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs\r\n          her, yanks her back in.\r\n\r\n          5 INT. SUV 5\r\n\r\n          Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Isn't this great?!\r\n          A thought strikes her.\r\n\r\n          JANE (CONT'D)\r\n          You're seeing it too, right? I'm\r\n          not crazy?\r\n\r\n                         SELVIG\r\n          That's debateable. Put your seat\r\n          belt on!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A.\r\n          The SUV lurches.\r\n\r\n          6 EXT. DESERT 6\r\n\r\n          Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from\r\n          out of the clouds comes --\r\n\r\n          AN ENORMOUS TORNADO\r\n          Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a\r\n          thousand freight trains as it touches down.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.\r\n\r\n          7 INT. SUV 7\r\n\r\n          Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the\r\n          enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers\r\n          into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the\r\n          window, TAPING the storm.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          You've gotta get us closer so I can\r\n          take a magnetic reading.\r\n          Darcy laughs.\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n          Yeah, right! Good one!\r\n          (then, realizing)\r\n          Oh God, you're serious...\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          You want those college credits or\r\n          not?\r\n\r\n          8 EXT. SUV 8\r\n\r\n          The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane\r\n          leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs\r\n          two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds\r\n          take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING\r\n          strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before\r\n          them with a terrifying intensity.\r\n\r\n          9 INT. SUV 9\r\n\r\n          The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns\r\n          the wheel, starts to head away.\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n          Keep the credits. I'll intern at\r\n          Burger King.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          What are you doing?!\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n          Saving our lives!\r\n          Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They\r\n          struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --\r\n\r\n                         A MAN\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.\r\n          Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy\r\n          slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.\r\n          The SUV swerves -- but too late.\r\n\r\n          10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10\r\n\r\n          The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending\r\n          him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.\r\n\r\n          11 INT. SUV 11\r\n\r\n          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.\r\n          They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.\r\n          A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.\r\n\r\n          12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12\r\n\r\n          The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the\r\n          man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,\r\n          charred and blackened.\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n          I think that was legally your\r\n          fault.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Get the first aid kit.\r\n          Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels\r\n          next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.\r\n          She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him\r\n          clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,\r\n          long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted\r\n          features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing\r\n          the life back into him.\r\n\r\n          JANE (CONT'D)\r\n          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor\r\n          and don't be dead, okay? Open your\r\n          eyes and look at me.\r\n          Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as\r\n          his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,\r\n          azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto\r\n          them.\r\n          For a moment, they each forget to breathe.\r\n          The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She\r\n          freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I\r\n          know CPR.\r\n          A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.\r\n          She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n\r\n                         HIS EYES--\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n\r\n                         (DREAMILY)\r\n          --are beautiful.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          --are dilating.

SPACE 13\r\n\r\n          EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and\r\n          resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.\r\n\r\n          HEIMDALL (V.O.)\r\n          Questions, they've always asked\r\n          questions -- this race called man,\r\n          on this planet they call earth.\r\n          Passionately longing to know how\r\n          they are connected to the heavens.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.\r\n          We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,\r\n          cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our\r\n          galaxy.\r\n\r\n          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          In ages past, they looked to us as\r\n          gods, for indeed so many times we\r\n          saved them from calamity. We tried\r\n          to show them how their world was\r\n          but one of the Nine Realms of the\r\n          Cosmos, linked to all others by the\r\n          branches of Yggdrasil...\r\n          We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,\r\n          sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague\r\n          shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching\r\n          out into the black void of space.\r\n\r\n          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in\r\n          a universe of wonder, beauty, and\r\n          terror that they barely\r\n          comprehended.\r\n          We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like\r\n          a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.\r\n\r\n          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          But for all their thirst for\r\n          knowledge, they let our lessons\r\n          fall into myth and dreams.\r\n          Where did he come from? He came\r\n          from us, the proudest race of\r\n          warriors the Worlds have ever seen.\r\n          He came from this -- the greatest\r\n          Realm the universe has ever known.\r\n          We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then\r\n          over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal\r\n          what's on the other side:\r\n\r\n          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          He came... from Asgard!\r\n\r\n          14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14\r\n\r\n          Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent\r\n          landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,\r\n          modern yet timeless.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A.\r\n\r\n          15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15\r\n\r\n          The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an\r\n          other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled\r\n          out before it.\r\n          We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE\r\n\r\n                         STANDS --\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN ALLFATHER\r\n          Stares out at his kingdom.

His wife FRIGGA sits at a\r\n          vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          Do you think he's ready?\r\n\r\n                         FRIGGA\r\n          He thinks he is.

Loki will be\r\n          at his side to give him counsel.\r\n          Have faith in your sons.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He\r\n          could be a great King...\r\n          Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of\r\n          synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail\r\n          as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,\r\n          trying to stop the strange event through the force of his\r\n          sheer will.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.\r\n          Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.\r\n          A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.\r\n\r\n          ODIN (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (QUIETLY)\r\n          ...if we only had more time.\r\n\r\n                         FRIGGA\r\n          For once, our son needs something\r\n          we cannot provide.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          I can fight it a little longer...\r\n\r\n                         FRIGGA\r\n          No. You've put it off too long! I\r\n          worry for you.\r\n          He touches her cheek.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          I've destroyed demons and monsters,\r\n          devastated whole worlds, laid waste\r\n          to mighty kingdoms, and still you\r\n          worry for me?\r\n\r\n                         FRIGGA\r\n          Always.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          Not today.

PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17\r\n\r\n          Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners\r\n          hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the\r\n          fire lit room.\r\n          Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted\r\n          against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we\r\n          recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.\r\n          Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.\r\n          An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.\r\n          He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly\r\n          below.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Another!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.\r\n          The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow\r\n          intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full\r\n          length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.\r\n          He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of\r\n          the Hall.\r\n          We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively\r\n          shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great\r\n          horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,\r\n          from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his\r\n          horned headpiece.\r\n          Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by\r\n          a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded\r\n          throne room.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n\r\n                         (TO THOR)\r\n          Nervous, brother?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Have you ever known me to be\r\n          nervous?\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          There was the time in Nornheim...\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          That wasn't nerves, brother. It\r\n          was the rage of battle. How else\r\n          could I have fought my way through\r\n          a hundred warriors and pulled us\r\n          out alive?\r\n          The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for\r\n          Thor.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          As I recall, I was the one who\r\n          veiled us in smoke to ease our\r\n          escape.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Some do battle, others just do\r\n          tricks.\r\n          The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like\r\n          it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.\r\n          EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and\r\n          across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the\r\n          goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.\r\n\r\n          THOR (CONT'D)\r\n          Loki...\r\n          Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn\r\n          back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.\r\n\r\n          THOR (CONT'D)\r\n          Now that was just a waste of good\r\n          wine.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          Just a bit of fun.\r\n          (to the Attendant)\r\n          Right, my friend?\r\n          The Attendant isn't so sure.

Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his\r\n          brother's shoulder.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Thank you.\r\n          The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          Give us a kiss.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Stop.\r\n          Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.\r\n\r\n          THOR (CONT'D)\r\n          How do I look?\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          Like a king.\r\n          They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.\r\n\r\n          LOKI (CONT'D)\r\n          It's time.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          You go ahead.\r\n          Loki casts him a wary look.\r\n\r\n          THOR (CONT'D)\r\n          I'll be along.

ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A\r\n\r\n          VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big\r\n          event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE\r\n          stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then\r\n          eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.\r\n          FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his\r\n          moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN\r\n          holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on\r\n          dreamily.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          Thank you, love.\r\n          (to the Maidens)\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL (CONT'D)\r\n          Now who'd like to polish my sword\r\n          for me?\r\n          The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.\r\n          HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front\r\n          of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and\r\n          the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL\r\n          ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.\r\n          Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the\r\n          Attendant quickly backs away.\r\n          From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her\r\n          SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several\r\n          HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We\r\n          reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons\r\n          on the table.\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          (to the weapons)\r\n          I'll miss you.\r\n\r\n          18 INT.

Thor is nowhere to be\r\n          seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.\r\n          A murmur spreads through the crowd.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          (sotto, to Loki)\r\n          Where is he?\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          He said he'd be along.\r\n          Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          He wants to make an entrance.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          Well, if he doesn't show up soon,\r\n          he shouldn't bother.

The CROWD erupts in\r\n          CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up\r\n          before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the\r\n          adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          Oh, please.\r\n          Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.\r\n\r\n          21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21\r\n\r\n          As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold\r\n          breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to\r\n          warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing\r\n          something's not right.\r\n          They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's\r\n          hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a\r\n          pedestal.\r\n          LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and\r\n          SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.\r\n\r\n          22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22\r\n\r\n          Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front\r\n          of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.\r\n          Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at\r\n          her. She can't help but smile.\r\n          Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.\r\n          The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless\r\n          authority.\r\n          He raises Gungnir before him.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          Gungnir.

RAINBOW BRIDGE 31\r\n\r\n          The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into\r\n          the Observatory.\r\n\r\n          32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32\r\n\r\n          Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The\r\n          Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a\r\n          section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his\r\n          sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,\r\n          the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.\r\n          The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor\r\n          and his five comrades stand.\r\n\r\n                         HEIMDALL\r\n          All is ready.

Don't be bashful.\r\n          The others join him at his side, then step towards the\r\n          Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,\r\n          changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being\r\n          elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked\r\n          off the platform and inside the vortex.\r\n\r\n          33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33\r\n\r\n          A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting\r\n          out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor\r\n          and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are\r\n          imprinted on the ice around them.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.\r\n          Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly\r\n          grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling\r\n          precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's\r\n          inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Come on, big fella. Up...!\r\n          With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the\r\n          ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          This belt! This belt is now my\r\n          lucky belt! I will never remove\r\n          it!

The whole planet\r\n          is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking\r\n          apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges\r\n          and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks\r\n          and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun\r\n          city lies in the distance.\r\n\r\n                         HOGUN\r\n          We shouldn't be here.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Too late now.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          Actually, it's not. We could turn\r\n          right around, hop back to Asgard,\r\n          share a mug by the fire. Could be\r\n          nice.\r\n          Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          Perhaps we should wait.\r\n          Thor turns back to his brother.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          For what?\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          To survey the enemy.

JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34\r\n\r\n          The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland,\r\n          shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki\r\n          looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers.\r\n          Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          It feels good, doesn't it?

A TEMPLE lies before them, across a\r\n          central plaza.\r\n\r\n          SIF (CONT'D)\r\n          Where are they?\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Hiding.

They sense the Frost Giants in\r\n          the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.\r\n          The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.\r\n          A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.\r\n\r\n                         JOTUN SENTRY\r\n          What is your business here,\r\n          Asgardian?\r\n          The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 26.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          I speak only to your King.

The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too\r\n          proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and\r\n          his people have endured.\r\n\r\n                         LAUFEY\r\n          I am Laufey, King of this Realm.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          And I am--\r\n\r\n                         LAUFEY\r\n          We know who you are, Odinson.

The other Jotuns step in\r\n          front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost\r\n          Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet\r\n          tall.

We are outnumbered.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Know your place, brother...\r\n\r\n                         LAUFEY\r\n          You should listen to his counsel.\r\n          You know not what your actions\r\n          would unleash.\r\n          Laufey steps out of the shadows.\r\n\r\n          LAUFEY (CONT'D)\r\n          But I do. Go now, while I still\r\n          allow it.\r\n          Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          We will accept your most gracious\r\n          offer.\r\n          The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down\r\n          a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades\r\n          breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant\r\n          nearby mutters under his breath.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.\r\n\r\n                         JOTUN\r\n          Run back home, little princess.\r\n          Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's\r\n          coming.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          Damn.\r\n          In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS\r\n          the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly\r\n          draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.\r\n          Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          Silly hammer! Has a mind of its\r\n          own!\r\n          ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR\r\n          around them, extending off the ends of their arms like\r\n          SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          I'm hoping that's just decorative.\r\n          Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost\r\n          Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,\r\n          separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer\r\n          around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying\r\n          this.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Next!\r\n          Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          Well? What move, do you think?\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          I say we use \"The Norn's Revenge.\"\u009d\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          At this close range? I think \"The\r\n          Alfheim Lunge\"\u009d is a better move.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n\r\n                         (DISGUSTED)\r\n          Maybe if they were three feet tall!\r\n          No! How about \"The Randy\r\n          Valkyrie\"\u009d?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A.\r\n\r\n                         HOGUN\r\n          Shut up!\r\n          Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks\r\n          loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.\r\n          A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant\r\n          hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his\r\n          mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and\r\n          hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over\r\n          him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins\r\n          back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun\r\n          with his mace.\r\n          Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her\r\n          double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          If you don't treat me like a lady,\r\n          I won't act like a lady!\r\n          She takes out the Jotun.\r\n          Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at\r\n          the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,\r\n          swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.\r\n          The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes\r\n          out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the\r\n          crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          (to the falling Giant)\r\n          Pathetic.\r\n          He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from\r\n          either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at\r\n          once.\r\n          Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.\r\n          The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then\r\n          punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a\r\n          long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in\r\n          front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.\r\n          Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Come on! At least make it a\r\n          challenge for me!\r\n          He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a\r\n          tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor\r\n          rises, grins.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.\r\n\r\n          THOR (CONT'D)\r\n          Now that's more like it!\r\n          He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute\r\n          head over heels.\r\n          Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies\r\n          back to his grasp.\r\n\r\n          THOR (CONT'D)\r\n          (re: the fallen Brute)\r\n          Ugly and stupid.\r\n          Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the\r\n          ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.\r\n          Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his\r\n          sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in\r\n          the chest. The Jotun falls dead.\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          (to Hogun, re: knife)\r\n          I'm so glad I taught him how to do\r\n          that!\r\n          Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good\r\n          hits in.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          You may want to put some ice on\r\n          that!\r\n          The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in\r\n          a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.\r\n          Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.\r\n\r\n          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\r\n          You may be taller, but I'm wider!\r\n          Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him\r\n          flying.\r\n          Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and\r\n          sending him crashing to the ground.\r\n\r\n          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\r\n          It's not too late for you to\r\n          surrender.\r\n          Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's\r\n          bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the\r\n          Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing\r\n          Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.\r\n          Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's\r\n          ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.\r\n          Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies\r\n          to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he\r\n          opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes\r\n          out a small FLASK.\r\n          Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells\r\n          to his comrades.\r\n\r\n          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\r\n          Don't let them grab hold of you!\r\n          He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the\r\n          battle.\r\n          Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword\r\n          stops mid ice layer.\r\n          The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,\r\n          and the warrior drops to one knee.\r\n          Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one\r\n          quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using\r\n          her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's\r\n          chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.\r\n\r\n          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\r\n          (on his belly)\r\n          Thank you, my lady. But I nearly\r\n          had him!\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          Of course you did.\r\n          Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling\r\n          them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the\r\n          bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into\r\n          the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them\r\n          out.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29.\r\n          A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-\r\n          FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.\r\n          Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he\r\n          goes.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          Hang on!\r\n          Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around\r\n          Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly\r\n          worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously\r\n          close to hacking into Hogun's legs.\r\n\r\n                         HOGUN\r\n          Watch the legs!\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n\r\n                         (REALIZING)\r\n          Right. Sorry.\r\n          Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally\r\n          freeing Hogun's feet.\r\n          Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          You really think your icicles are a\r\n          match for Asgardian steel?\r\n          Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade\r\n          away.\r\n\r\n          FANDRAL (CONT'D)\r\n          Fair enough.\r\n          Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's\r\n          sword and snaps it in half.\r\n\r\n          FANDRAL (CONT'D)\r\n          Could we stop just a moment while I\r\n          get another sword?\r\n          Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun\r\n          then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of\r\n          the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant\r\n          through with his own weapon.\r\n          The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a\r\n          pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,\r\n          forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,\r\n          rendering him helpless.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.\r\n          Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and\r\n          felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-\r\n          unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights\r\n          them off.\r\n          Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          That's unfortunate.\r\n          He hurries to his wounded comrade.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          I may need a bit of help. Not a\r\n          good look, is it?\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          Just try not to bleed.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          How's the face?\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          Flawless.\r\n          Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice\r\n          stalagmite.\r\n          Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost\r\n          Giants.\r\n          The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his\r\n          hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's\r\n          grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees\r\n          his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.\r\n          Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead\r\n          of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE\r\n          -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads\r\n          painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.\r\n          The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the\r\n          unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the\r\n          distraction, KICKS the Giant.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.\r\n          Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts\r\n          the Jotuns around him.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Come on!\r\n          But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost\r\n          Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor\r\n          from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.\r\n          Mjolnir falls to the ground.\r\n          A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the\r\n          ground, to no avail.\r\n          Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg\r\n          slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to\r\n          leave.\r\n          From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides\r\n          it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the\r\n          palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the\r\n          wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.\r\n          The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their\r\n          feet.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          That can't be good.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          Yes, it could!

Loki sees the\r\n          look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat\r\n          of battle.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Then go!\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          There are too many of them!\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          I can stop them!\r\n          The others hesitate.

After a\r\n\r\n                         MOMENT --\r\n\r\n          THOR'S FIST\r\n          Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.\r\n          He opens his hand, beckoning.\r\n          One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind\r\n          him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in\r\n          the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor\r\n          raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground\r\n          with all his might.\r\n          KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer\r\n          channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the\r\n          Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive\r\n          shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32.\r\n          But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the\r\n          shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to\r\n          where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground\r\n          beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.\r\n\r\n          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\r\n          What's Thor done?\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          Likely killed us all!\r\n          As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their\r\n          mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists\r\n          quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.\r\n          The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes\r\n          a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not\r\n          move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.\r\n          Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He\r\n          raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off\r\n          the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his\r\n          comrades.\r\n\r\n          35A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A\r\n\r\n          Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Loki, we have to see.\r\n          Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating.\r\n          But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of\r\n          the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too\r\n          many, even for a Thunder God.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n\r\n                         (TO LOKI)\r\n          Actually, could you bring the mists\r\n          back, please?\r\n          Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.\r\n          The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening\r\n          ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts\r\n          down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom\r\n          comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of\r\n          all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --\r\n\r\n                         ODIN ALLFATHER\r\n          Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad\r\n          in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A.\r\n          The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,\r\n          stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.\r\n          Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath\r\n          his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to\r\n          react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-\r\n          to-face with Odin.\r\n          Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's\r\n          about to happen.\r\n          Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the\r\n          Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's\r\n          not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of\r\n          earshot of the others.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          Laufey. End this.\r\n\r\n                         LAUFEY\r\n          Your boy sought this out.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          You're right. These are the\r\n          actions of a boy. Treat them as\r\n          such. You and I can stop this\r\n          before there's further bloodshed.\r\n          Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice\r\n          blade at the end of his arm.\r\n\r\n                         LAUFEY\r\n          We are beyond diplomacy now,\r\n          Allfather. He'll get what he came\r\n          for -- war and death.\r\n          Odin looks grim, determined.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          So be it.\r\n          Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but\r\n          Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon\r\n          the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards\r\n          in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.\r\n          The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the\r\n          fleeing Jotuns with delight.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Now! We'll finish them together!\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          Silence!\r\n          Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the\r\n          Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops\r\n          the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the\r\n          hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.\r\n          Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.\r\n\r\n          36 INT.

HEALING ROOM - DAY 53\r\n\r\n          Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-\r\n          shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a\r\n          ROARING central fire.\r\n          Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING\r\n          STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he\r\n          carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,\r\n          the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His\r\n          comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.\r\n          Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.\r\n          Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still\r\n          blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.\r\n          Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the\r\n          Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to\r\n          its normal color.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          We should never have let him go.\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          There was no stopping him.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          At least he's only banished, not\r\n          dead.

And Thor's. I\r\n          had no idea Father would banish him\r\n          for what he did.\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          Loki, you're the only one who can\r\n          help Thor now.

I love\r\n          Thor more dearly than any of you,\r\n          but you know what he is. He's\r\n          arrogant. He's reckless. He's\r\n          dangerous.

A fire starts to glow within its black\r\n          metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it --\r\n          the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48.\r\n\r\n           ODIN (O.S.)\r\n          Stop!\r\n          Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer\r\n          goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it.\r\n          Odin eyes Loki with dismay.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          Am I cursed?\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          No. Put the Casket down.\r\n          Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly\r\n          returning to its normal form and color.

INSIDE OF CRATER 59\r\n\r\n          It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on\r\n          lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They\r\n          watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a\r\n          line to take a turn with the mysterious object.\r\n          One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up,\r\n          the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the\r\n          effort.

An EAGER\r\n          TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain\r\n          from the back of the truck.\r\n          He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes\r\n          the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.\r\n\r\n                         EAGER TOWNIE\r\n          This'll do it.\r\n          He yells to the driver.\r\n\r\n          EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Okay, let 'er rip!\r\n          The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then\r\n          STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear\r\n          of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off\r\n          and go flying.\r\n          People dive out of the way.\r\n          The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN \"THE MAN\"\u009d\r\n          LEE. He looks back, shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party\r\n          continuing.

ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61\r\n\r\n          Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin\r\n          lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the\r\n          space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The\r\n          walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting\r\n          him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight.\r\n          Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks\r\n          softly to him.\r\n\r\n                         FRIGGA\r\n          I asked him to be honest with you\r\n          from the beginning.

You must know\r\n          that.\r\n          Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.\r\n\r\n          FRIGGA (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (RE: ODIN)\r\n          You can speak to him.

The most powerful being in\r\n          the Nine Realms lying helpless\r\n          until his body is restored.\r\n\r\n                         FRIGGA\r\n          But he's put it off for so long\r\n          now, I fear...\r\n          Loki takes her hand.

Thor\r\n          may yet find a way home.\r\n          Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for\r\n          the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS\r\n          hurriedly approaching.\r\n\r\n          THE EINHERJAR GUARD\r\n          Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for\r\n          the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is\r\n          baffled.\r\n\r\n          FRIGGA (CONT'D)\r\n          Thor is banished. The line of\r\n          succession falls to you.

Another\r\n          EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels\r\n          before Loki, offers the spear to him.\r\n\r\n          FRIGGA (CONT'D)\r\n          Make your father proud.\r\n          Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it.

ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62\r\n\r\n          Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local\r\n          diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a\r\n          huge mound of steak and eggs.

As we move\r\n          closer, we see the glow comes from --\r\n\r\n          A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE\r\n          Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers,\r\n          barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence\r\n          that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the\r\n          complex.\r\n          Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a\r\n          translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the\r\n          crater.\r\n          Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see\r\n          Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work.\r\n          Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS\r\n          work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the\r\n          center of it all -- Mjolnir.\r\n\r\n          72 EXT.

He checks a computer.\r\n\r\n          TECHIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey, we've got a commercial\r\n          aircraft coming in right over us,\r\n          Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.\r\n\r\n                         SITWELL\r\n          Reroute it, like all the others.\r\n\r\n                         TECHIE\r\n          Right.

Through the haze, it shows a\r\n          THERMAL IMAGE huddled beside the fence.\r\n\r\n                         SITWELL\r\n          (into a radio)\r\n          DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.\r\n\r\n          74A EXT.

SHIELD SECURITY ROOM 74B\r\n\r\n          Sitwell looks out the window, something strange catching his\r\n          attention. We see in the window's reflection that a glow is\r\n          coming from the hammer containment area.\r\n\r\n          75 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - FENCE - MOMENTS LATER 75\r\n\r\n          The jeep pulls up as the Agents scan the fence with a\r\n          flashlight, see nothing unusual.\r\n\r\n                         AGENT JACKSON\r\n\r\n                         (INTO RADIO)\r\n          Looks like we're good here. Must\r\n          have been another coyote.\r\n          Just then, the Agents notice a section of the fence has been\r\n          bent up from the ground, leaving a gap.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66.\r\n          Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING\r\n          illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a\r\n          large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of\r\n          the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.\r\n\r\n                         AGENT DELANCEY\r\n          Jackson?\r\n          The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver\r\n          across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson\r\n          slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a\r\n          shotgun at Thor.\r\n          Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and\r\n          thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw.\r\n          Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.\r\n\r\n          75A INT.

RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 78A\r\n\r\n          A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the\r\n          ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight.\r\n          She pulls out her cellphone and dials.

SHIELD DESERT BASE - COMMAND TRAILER 79\r\n\r\n          Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches\r\n          across the mud, radio to his ear.

SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 80\r\n\r\n          A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From\r\n          the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.\r\n          As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly\r\n          rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the\r\n          ground.\r\n          Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the\r\n          fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As\r\n          more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes\r\n          cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by.\r\n          Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main\r\n          entrance tube to the center of the site.\r\n          A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to\r\n          see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight\r\n          right on him.\r\n          Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver\r\n          raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.\r\n          He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and\r\n          catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then\r\n          hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing\r\n          the ATV's spotlight.\r\n          Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off\r\n          the wheel to protect himself.\r\n          The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube\r\n          entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.\r\n          Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning\r\n          the site entrance.\r\n\r\n          80A EXT.

Selvig\r\n          awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.\r\n\r\n                         SELVIG\r\n          I still don't believe you're the\r\n          God of Thunder.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          But you ought to be.\r\n          Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to\r\n          sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.\r\n          Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by\r\n          Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          These are your chambers?\r\n          Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up\r\n          the mess around her.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Well, it's more of a temporary\r\n          living space, really. I don't\r\n          usually have visitors in here.\r\n          Actually, never...\r\n          Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from\r\n          him, puts it away.\r\n\r\n          JANE (CONT'D)\r\n          Can we go outside?\r\n\r\n          100 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100\r\n\r\n          Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He\r\n          offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set\r\n          up, a couple chairs, some blankets.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          I come up here sometimes when I\r\n          can't sleep.

Not\r\n          as much as I promised. I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          No, this is good. Thank you. This\r\n          means I don't have to start from\r\n          scratch...\r\n          She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a\r\n          harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          What's wrong?\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          SHIELD, whatever they are. They're\r\n          never going to let this research\r\n          see the light of day.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          You must do this.

It's taken\r\n          so many generations for your people\r\n          to get to this point. You're\r\n          nearly there. You just need\r\n          someone to show you how close you\r\n          really are.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83.\r\n          Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page\r\n          which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from\r\n          the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one\r\n          point to another in space.\r\n\r\n          THOR (CONT'D)\r\n          Look -- your ancestors called it\r\n          magic. You call it science. I\r\n          come from a place where they're one\r\n          and the same thing.\r\n          We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil\r\n          as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          What is it?\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          This is how my father explained it\r\n          to me...\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          Your world is one of the Nine\r\n          Realms of the Cosmos, linked to\r\n          each other by the branches of\r\n          Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now,\r\n          you see it every day, without\r\n          realizing. Images glimpsed through\r\n          -- what did you call it?...\r\n          (checks her notebook)\r\n          ...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine\r\n          Realms...\r\n          They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is\r\n          going to be a long night.\r\n\r\n          101 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - LATER 101\r\n\r\n          Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He\r\n          stares up at the night sky.\r\n          She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He\r\n          looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at\r\n          the town beyond her.\r\n\r\n          102 INT.

Don't you care?!\r\n          Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg\r\n          pulls his weapon, stopping him.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          Do not mistake my appetite for\r\n          apathy.\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          Stop it, both of you!

BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111\r\n\r\n          Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and\r\n          Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They\r\n          clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the\r\n          hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes\r\n          cover the desert sand around them.\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          He must have landed nearby. It's\r\n          time to put our tracking skills to\r\n          work. Spread out.

Volstagg\r\n          and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          It's worth a look, I suppose.\r\n          The party tromps towards the town.\r\n\r\n          112 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 112\r\n\r\n           Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as\r\n           they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.\r\n\r\n          113 EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 113\r\n\r\n           A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He\r\n           runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side \r\n           of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth \r\n           dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car \r\n           up with one hand. \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 88.\r\n           Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He \r\n           hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair. \r\n\r\n                          VOLSTAGG \r\n           There you go, lad!\r\n           The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head \r\n          off.\r\n\r\n          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\r\n          Is it just me, or does Earth look a\r\n          little different to you?\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          It has been a thousand years...\r\n\r\n                         VOLSTAGG\r\n          Things change so fast here.

Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a\r\n          bite. He likes what he tastes.\r\n\r\n          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\r\n          Exquisite.\r\n\r\n          115 EXT.

He knows who's responsible.\r\n\r\n          116 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 116\r\n\r\n          Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.\r\n\r\n                         HEIMDALL\r\n          Tell me, Loki, how did you get the\r\n          Jotuns into Asgard?\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          You think the Bifrost is the only\r\n          way in and out of the Realm? There\r\n          are secret paths between worlds to\r\n          which even you with all your gifts\r\n          are blind.

As it\r\n          quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --\r\n\r\n          THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.\r\n          The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki\r\n          opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching.\r\n          From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of\r\n          the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but\r\n          SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight\r\n          towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but\r\n          still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.\r\n          Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his\r\n          massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen,\r\n          just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of\r\n          relief and steps past him.\r\n\r\n          117 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 117\r\n\r\n          Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and\r\n          opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER\r\n          appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns\r\n          its head toward its King.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          Ensure my brother does not return.\r\n\r\n          118 INT.

It looks like it might actually\r\n          work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It\r\n          lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs\r\n          apologetically.\r\n          The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral,\r\n          smashing into them, when --\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and\r\n          plunges it deep into the back of the creature.\r\n          The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its\r\n          faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a\r\n          brief moment of hope.\r\n          But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once\r\n          again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation.\r\n          Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180\r\n          degrees to face its attackers.\r\n          The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off\r\n          of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer\r\n          rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's\r\n          staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.\r\n          Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer\r\n          unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying\r\n          in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks\r\n          free, landing in the middle of the street.\r\n\r\n          131 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 131\r\n\r\n          Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no\r\n          time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.\r\n          A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane,\r\n          and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when\r\n          they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris,\r\n          impaled by a twisted piece of iron.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Erik!\r\n          She and Thor hurry to his side.

He makes a break\r\n          for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the\r\n          pouch and races back.\r\n          He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and\r\n          useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Come on... give me one!\r\n          Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still\r\n          intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over\r\n          the end of the iron rod.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          What are you doing? What is that?\r\n          As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.\r\n          Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the\r\n          piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it\r\n          reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound\r\n          completely.\r\n          Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still\r\n          lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He\r\n          reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed\r\n          flesh.\r\n\r\n                         SELVIG\r\n          (to Jane, re: Thor)\r\n          I'm really starting to like him.\r\n          Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.\r\n\r\n          132 EXT. DOWN THE STREET 132\r\n\r\n          Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on\r\n          the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Go, while you can!\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          But the others...\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          You can't help them now.

Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious,\r\n          with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way\r\n          towards them.\r\n          Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to\r\n          safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun\r\n          and Fandral.\r\n\r\n          THOR (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (RE: VOLSTAGG)\r\n          Get him out of here!\r\n\r\n                         FANDRAL\r\n          No. We can still fight!\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          But not win.

I have a\r\n          plan.\r\n          The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and\r\n          drag him away from the battlefield.\r\n          After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then\r\n          tosses Sif's shield aside.\r\n          He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely\r\n          defenseless.\r\n\r\n          THOR (CONT'D)\r\n          Brother... for whatever I have done\r\n          to wrong you, whatever I have done\r\n          to lead you to do this, I am sorry.\r\n          But these people have done nothing\r\n          to you.

We hear the sickening CRACK\r\n          of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.\r\n          Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith\r\n          Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.\r\n          The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,\r\n          a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to\r\n          Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.\r\n\r\n                         SELVIG\r\n          Jane, no!\r\n          He pulls her into Smith Motors.

SMITH MOTORS - DAY 134\r\n\r\n          Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The\r\n          Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards\r\n          him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to\r\n          unleash its fiery blast.\r\n\r\n          135 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 135\r\n\r\n          Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear,\r\n          burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the\r\n          hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it\r\n          vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up.\r\n          Clouds form in the sky above.\r\n          Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies\r\n          straight up into the air like a rocket.\r\n\r\n          136 EXT. MAIN STREET 136\r\n\r\n          The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --\r\n\r\n          KRAKAKABOOM!\r\n          A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above,\r\n          colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is\r\n          massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust\r\n          enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Oh. My.

Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir\r\n          down onto the ground.\r\n\r\n          KRAKABOOM!\r\n          Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings\r\n          Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the\r\n          Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder\r\n          God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale\r\n          force winds.\r\n          Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The\r\n          Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101.\r\n          It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,\r\n          locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards\r\n          straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.\r\n          Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,\r\n          overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the\r\n          Destroyer.\r\n          Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.\r\n          The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES\r\n          within him, firing out of all his openings.\r\n          Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous\r\n          heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.\r\n          Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its\r\n          lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris\r\n          pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the\r\n          skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.\r\n          Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.\r\n          A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.\r\n\r\n                         COULSON\r\n          Donald...

He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey\r\n          and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and\r\n          respect.

HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 157\r\n\r\n          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending\r\n          Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his\r\n          hand.\r\n          The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.\r\n          Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it\r\n          back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too\r\n          powerful.\r\n          Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides\r\n          towards the Bifrost.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          If you care so much for the Jotuns,\r\n          then die with them.\r\n          The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to\r\n          drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he\r\n          concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand\r\n          towards the Bifrost.\r\n          MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.\r\n          The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another\r\n          blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his\r\n          brother.\r\n\r\n          158 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158\r\n\r\n          Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and\r\n          land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets\r\n          to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          Thor! Help me!\r\n          Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking\r\n          up at him desperately.\r\n\r\n          LOKI (CONT'D)\r\n          Please...\r\n          Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his\r\n          brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just\r\n          then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls\r\n          around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.\r\n          Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls\r\n          him across the bridge.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110.\r\n          Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind\r\n          him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.\r\n          It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next\r\n          to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.\r\n          Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,\r\n          never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The\r\n          Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.\r\n\r\n                         LOKIS\r\n          I was always more clever than you.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Yet still not clever enough.\r\n          With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,\r\n          summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then\r\n          channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the\r\n          Lokis.\r\n          All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real\r\n          Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir\r\n          knocked from his grasp.\r\n          Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his\r\n          back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps\r\n          away.\r\n          Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks\r\n          confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop\r\n          his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's\r\n          pinned to the ground.\r\n          Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing\r\n          towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of\r\n          energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to\r\n          do.\r\n          Loki watches him smugly.\r\n\r\n                         LOKI\r\n          Look at you, the Mighty Thor.\r\n          With all your strength, what good\r\n          does it do you now?\r\n          Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's\r\n          happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,\r\n          VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy\r\n          feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.\r\n          He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.\r\n          Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The\r\n          hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.\r\n          Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,\r\n          thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he\r\n          channels the power of the storm into it, then --\r\n          He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is\r\n          massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking\r\n          the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears\r\n          where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.\r\n\r\n          LOKI (CONT'D)\r\n          Stop! What are you doing?!\r\n          Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!\r\n          The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream\r\n          out from it. Loki thinks fast.\r\n\r\n          LOKI (CONT'D)\r\n          If you destroy the Bridge, you'll\r\n          never see her again!\r\n          Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor\r\n          through the back.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Forgive me.\r\n          Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises\r\n          Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all\r\n          sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --\r\n          KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING\r\n          out of it.\r\n          Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of\r\n          the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the\r\n          Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.\r\n          The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.\r\n          As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of\r\n          Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall\r\n          towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out\r\n          from the broken Bridge.\r\n          They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive\r\n          force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized\r\n          by the debris, when --\r\n\r\n          A POWERFUL HAND\r\n          Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir\r\n          as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to\r\n\r\n                         SEE --\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 112.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN ALLFATHER\r\n          Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the\r\n          Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.\r\n          Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of\r\n          approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is\r\n          disappointment and regret.\r\n          Loki lets go.\r\n\r\n          THOR (CONT'D)\r\n          No!\r\n          But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki\r\n          falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries\r\n          him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the\r\n          Observatory, disappearing out of sight.\r\n          Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge.

He rises and leaves the hall.\r\n\r\n                         FRIGGA\r\n          He will need his friends now more\r\n          than ever.\r\n\r\n                         SIF\r\n          I will always be at his side.\r\n          Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.\r\n\r\n          161 EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161\r\n\r\n          Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin\r\n          walks up behind him.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          You'll be a wise King.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          There will never be a wiser king\r\n          than you. Or a better father.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          I have much to learn. I know that\r\n          now. But some day, perhaps, I will\r\n          make you proud.\r\n\r\n                         ODIN\r\n          You've already made me proud.\r\n          Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.\r\n\r\n          162 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162\r\n\r\n          Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost\r\n          energy, drifting off into space.\r\n          Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.\r\n          Thor stares out at the stellar void.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 114.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          Can you see her?\r\n          Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.\r\n\r\n                         HEIMDALL\r\n          Yes.\r\n\r\n                         THOR\r\n          How is she?\r\n\r\n          163 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163\r\n\r\n          Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged\r\n          ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull\r\n          away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly\r\n          inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see\r\n          that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research\r\n          facility, abuzz with activity.\r\n          SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-\r\n          the-art equipment.\r\n          Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the\r\n          SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass\r\n          windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the\r\n          roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at\r\n          hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE\r\n          before her, which bears the \"STARK INDUSTRIES\"\u009d logo.\r\n          From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n          Here you go.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          Thanks.\r\n          Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.\r\n\r\n                         DARCY\r\n          He would have come back if he\r\n          could.\r\n\r\n                         JANE\r\n          I know. But if he can't get here\r\n          on his own...\r\n          Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D\r\n          HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,\r\n          bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --\r\n          YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\"\r\n\r\n           JANE (CONT'D)\r\n           ...maybe we can help him find his\r\n           way back.\r\n\r\n          164 OMITTED COMBINED WITH SCENE 163 ABOVE 164\r\n\r\n                          FADE OUT:\r\n\r\n                          THE END\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nThor\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Ashley Miller\u00a0\u00a0Zack Stentz\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:37:11.288968"}
