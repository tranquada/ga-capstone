NEW YORK STREETS--NIGHT\n\n     An EMS \"bus\" careens around a corner, tires squealing, lights\n     flashing, siren whoop-whooping, swooping through Stygian\n     canyons of New York.\n\n     FRANK PIERCE, 28, drives. He wears dark cargo pants, black\n     boots, a white shirt with the paramedic badge, \"EMS\" gold \n     logo on one collar, \"OLM\" on the other. \"Our Lady of Mercy \n     Paramedic\" is inscribed in white across the back of his\n     navy jacket. On his belt: two-way radio, leather gloves,\n     beeper, drug kit, multi-purpose tool kit, mini-flashlight,\n     collapsible baton.\n\n     LARRY, 35, overweight, his partner for the night, rides techie\n     (shotgun), both hands clutching the dash.\n\n     Frank scans the blurring cityscape for hidden danger. He is\n     a young man of slight frame and open face--his life, his\n     possible futures, still before him: behind those open eyes,\n     beneath those dark shadows: hollowness beckons.\n\n     Dispatcher's voice crackles through the cab static: \"Ladder \n     4, respond to a 10-22, four flight residential, 417 East 32. \n     13 Boy, men's room Grand Central, man set his pants on fire.\n     Bad burns. 17 David, at 177 East 24, there's a\n     woman who says a roach crawled in her ear. Can't get it out,\n     says she's going into cardiac arrest ...\"\n\n     Frank's detached voice speaks over the urban landscape:\n\n                           FRANK (V.O.)\n               Thursday started out with a bang: a\n               gunshot to the chest on a drug deal\n               gone bad. Heat, humidity, moonlight--\n               all the elements in place for a long\n               weekend. I was good at my job: there\n               were periods when my hands moved\n               with a speed and skill beyond me and\n               my mind worked with a cool authority\n               I had never known. But in the last\n               year I had started to lose that\n               control. Things had turned bad. I\n               hadn't saved anyone for months. I\n               just needed a few slow nights, a\n               week without tragedy followed by a\n               couple of days off.\n\n     The radio continues: \"Zebra, 13Z, 524 East 17--\"\n\n                           LARRY\n                    (on radio)\n               We're there.\n\n     The ambulance breaks to a halt in front of a row of vintage\n     walk-ups. Frank and Larry jump out: Frank lugs the EKG monitor\n     and airway bag, Larry the drug box, yellow oxygen\n     pack slung over his shoulder. Neighbors crowd around.\n\n                           OLD WOMAN\n               Which apartment? Which apartment?\n\n                           FRANK\n               Move back.

TENEMENT STAIRWELL--NIGHT\n\n     Four flights up: Frank and Larry climbing rotting steps, \n     gray-yellow painted walls, red doors with three locks each,\n     Larry, out of breath, his stomach rolling around like a\n     bowling ball in a bag.\n                                                               \n                                                          CUT TO:\n\n     INT. BURKE APARTMENT--NIGHT\n\n     They enter 5A. MRS. BURKE, 55, her eyes run dry, standing in\n     the center of the room, surrounded by neighbors. Someone\n     leads them to the BEDROOM where Mr. Burke, 60, lies unmoving,\n     stretched on the bed. A young woman, MARY BURKE, 24, kneels \n     over the old man, pressing her lips to his flaccid mouth.\n\n     JOHN BURKE, 30, grabs Franks arm:\n\n                           JOHN\n               We were just watching TV and Dad\n               yelled out and started punching his\n               chest, next thing he locked himself\n               in the bathroom. I said we were gonna\n               call you guys and he said not to.\n               He was crying, I never heard him \n               crying before, then he sorta stopped.\n               We pulled him out and put him on the\n               bed.\n\n     Frank and Larry moving the body to the floor:\n\n                           FRANK\n               How long ago did he stop breathing?\n\n                           JOHN\n               Maybe ten minutes. Woman on the phone\n               tried to tell us how to do CPR.\n               Please, you gotta do something.\n\n                           FRANK\n               We'll do all we can.\n\n     Larry ripping open Mr. Burke's shirt, prepping electrode \n     patches, hooking wires, Frank opening Burke's mouth, feeling \n     a puff of gas escape; Larry calling for backup. Burke's EKG \n     rhythm on the monitor a flat green line.\n\n     Frank's training takes over: he injects the long steel \n     laryngoscope down Burke's throat, he finds a vein, injects \n     epinephrine, followed by atrophine, followed by another epi:\n     no response on the monitor. Larry pulls out the paddles:\n\n                           FRANK (CONT'D)\n               Clear! Clear!\n\n     Larry activates defibrillator, shock--Burke's body heaves.\n     Sweat drips from Larry's nose onto Burke's chest.\n\n                           MARY\n               No more, please don't!\n\n     They shock him again. This time the body moves less. Frank \n     glances up: Mr. and Mrs. Burke's wedding photo sits on the \n     nightstand. Other pictures: a day at the beach, a young \n     serviceman, happy parents. Frank's mind drifts:\n\n                           FRANK (V.O.)\n               In the last year I had come to believe \n               in such things as spirits leaving \n               the body and not wanting to be put \n               back, spirits angry at the awkward \n               places death had left them.  I \n               understood how crazy it was to think \n               this way, but I was convinced if I \n               turned around, I'd see Old Man Burke \n               standing at the window, watching, \n               waiting for us to finish.\n\n     Frank feels Burke's heart beneath cracked ribs. The EEG \n     remains flat. He's dead. It's time to quit.\n\n                           FRANK (CONT'D)\n                    (to Larry)\n               I'll take over. Call ER and ask for \n               an eighty-three.\n                    (to Mrs. Burke)\n               Sorry.\n\n     Larry stands, breathing heavy, looks for a phone. Frank turns \n     to notice relatives and neighbors standing around.\n\n                           FRANK (CONT'D)\n               Do you have any music?\n\n                           MARY\n               What?\n\n                           FRANK\n               Music. I think it helps if you play \n               something he liked.\n\n                           MARY\n               John, play the Sinatra.\n\n     John enters crying. Mary repeats softly:\n\n                           MARY\n               Play the Sinatra.\n\n     John exits. Frank notices Mary for the first time: blond \n     hair dyed black, cut short, loose fitting tank dress, black \n     makeup running down her cheeks. He notices her prom picture, \n     glances back to Mary: it seems she hasn't smiled since that \n     day eight years before. Something special about her, that \n     something that hits you right away.\n\n     \"September of My Years\" plays from the other room. Frank \n     continues massaging Mr. Burke's chest (now to Sinatra beat), \n     even though it's hopeless. Larry returns:\n\n                           LARRY\n               It's OK, Frank. We can call it. Eighty-\n               three.\n\n     Frank feels something strange, looks into Burke's pupils, \n     checks his neck pulse, wrist pulse. His eyes go to Larry:\n\n                           FRANK\n               No we can't. He's got a pulse.\n\n                           LARRY\n               No shit.\n\n     Larry checks the monitor: the green line up and down. Mary \n     senses a change in status:\n\n                           MARY\n               Is he going to be alright?\n\n                           FRANK\n                    (not encouraging)\n               His heart's beating.\n\n     A distant siren signals the arrival of backup. Frank turns \n     to Larry:\n\n                           FRANK (CONT'D)\n               Have 'em bring up a stretcher.\n\n     He looks from Mary back to Mr. Burke--breathing but comatose.\n\n                                                          CUT TO:\n\n     INT. AMBULANCE--NIGHT\n\n     Larry climbing through the back doors, sitting in the jumpseat \n     at the stretcher's head as Frank hangs IV bags, replugs EKG \n     wires that have come loose.\n\n     Frank looks up, sees Mary entering; he takes her arm, turns \n     her toward the rear doors:\n\n                           FRANK\n               Help your family. Ride with your \n               mother and brother.\n                    (she hesitates)\n               Help your family. They need you more.   \n               Help yourself.\n\n     Mary steps out, stands in the red flashing light as Larry \n     closes the door, Frank climbs in the driver's seat.\n\n                                                          CUT TO:\n\n     EXT. SECOND AVENUE--NIGHT\n\n     The EMS bus cruises up Second. Frank checks the side mirror: \n     John, Mary and Mrs. Burke pull behind in a black Ford. Seeing \n     their faces, Frank flips the lights and siren on. It's too \n     late to help Mr. Burke, but it's important to the family \n     that it look urgent. Frank watches passing lights, cars, \n     faces:\n\n                           FRANK (V.O.)\n               I needed to concentrate because my \n               mind tended to wander on these short \n               trips. It was the neighborhood I \n               grew up in and where I had worked \n               most as a paramedic, and it held \n               more ghosts per square foot than any \n               other.\n\n                                                          CUT TO:\n\n     EXT. OUR LADY OF MERCY--NIGHT\n\n     Larry and Frank's 13 Zebra ambulance lined up beside two \n     others outside a blazing \"Emergency\" sign on the crowded \n     side street.\n\n                                                          CUT TO:\n\n     INT. MERCY ER--NIGHT\n\n     Every large city has a hospital Emergency Room so replete \n     with trauma, violence and suffering it picks up the sobriquet \n     \"Knife and Gun Club.\" On Manhattan's Lower East Side it's \n     our Lady Of Mercy, aka, Our Lady of Misery.\n\n     ER: a white-lit cement box painted yellow and decorated with \n     old framed Playbills. Four rows of six plastic chairs face a\n     TV bolted and chained to the ceiling. The seats are filled \n     with backed-up drunks, assault victims and \"regulars,\"\n     bleeding and spilling over against the walls and the floor, \n     getting up to ask their status or going out to throw up and \n     have a smoke.\n\n     Larry and Frank wheeling Burke in, two IV lines, each \n     connected to an elbow, tangled in EKG cables. Two LACERATED \n     RUSSIANS scramble out of their way as they approach GRISS, \n     the large black sunglassed security guard. He looks up from \n     his television guide:\n\n                           GRISS\n               Hey partner. Your man does not look\n               well. They're not gonna appreciate\n               you inside.\n\n                           FRANK\n                    (pumping Ambu-bag)\n               Griss, let us in.\n\n                           GRISS\n               Things are backing up.\n\n     Griss pushes a button, activating the automatic door, striking \n     the bandaged leg of a man lying down on a stretcher in the \n     hall. Larry and Frank wheel Burke inside. A pleading family \n     tries to follow. Griss stretches out his hand:\n\n                           GRISS (CONT'D)\n               You can't go in there, folks.\n\n     Mary, John and Mrs. Burke rush in from the street, hoping \n     some miracle has occurred during the drive to the hospital, \n     approach the sign-in desk.\n\n     Frank and Larry pass four stretchers lined against the wall--\n     a passage nicknamed \"Skid Row\" leading past triage NURSE \n     CONSTANCE's station.\n\n                           NURSE CONSTANCE\n               Just keep moving. Don't even slow \n               down.\n\n     Nurse Constance turns back to the nervous man seated beside \n     her:\n\n                           NURSE CONSTANCE (CONT'D)\n               Sir, you say you've been snorting \n               cocaine for three days and now you \n               feel your heart is beating too fast \n               and you would like us to help you. \n               To tell the truth, I don't see why I \n               should. If I'm mistaken, correct me. \n               Did we sell you the cocaine? Did we \n               push it up your nose?\n\n     Larry and Frank slow at the last Skid Row stretchers. On \n     one, NOEL, a young dark-skinned man with chaotic mess of \n     dreadlocks, pulls feverishly at his restraints:\n\n                           NOEL\n               For God's sake, give me some water.\n\n     From the next stretcher a man with feet swollen purple like \n     prize eggplants replies:\n\n                           BIG FEET\n               Shut up! Goddamn civilians.\n\n                           NOEL\n               Give me some water!\n\n     NURSE CRUPP stops Frank and Larry as they approach the \n     Critical care room. inside, the staff appears as if under \n     siege by a battalion of shriveled men and women lying on a \n     field of white sheets.\n\n                           NURSE CRUPP\n               Don't take another step. We're on \n               diversion. Can't accept any more \n               patients.

What's wrong \n               with him?\n\n                           LARRY\n               You should know. You pronounced him.\n\n                           HAZMAT\n               You told me he was dead. Flatline.\n\n                           FRANK\n               He got better.\n\n                           HAZMAT\n               I hate pronouncing people dead over \n               the phone.\n                    (flashes light in \n                    Burke's eyes)\n               Better, huh? They're fixed and \n               dilated. He's plant food.\n\n                           NURSE CRUPP\n                    (returning)\n               We stole a stretcher from X-ray. No \n               pad on it, but I don't think he'll \n               mind. Put him in three, next to the \n               overdose.\n\n                           HAZMAT\n               He's our lowest priority now. He \n               shouldn't even be here. All this \n               technology. What a waste.\n\n     Back at SECURITY, the Burkes confront Griss.\n\n                           GRISS\n               Please folks, step back.\n                    (they hesitate)\n               Don't make me take off my sunglasses.\n\n     In CRITICAL CARE, Larry wheels Burke into unit three as Dr. \n     Hazmat turns Frank to face the room, explaining:\n\n                           HAZMAT\n               First-time heart attack, age 45. \n               Should have gone to the CCU ten hours \n               ago. There's three bodies up there \n               Mike the one you just brought in. \n               over there, two AIDS patients, one \n               in twelve filling up with liquid. \n               I'm gonna hafta intubate because the \n               kid's mother won't sign the Do Not\n               Resuscitate. Mercy killing doesn't \n               translate well in Spanish. It's a \n               sin to tube this kid. Three more ODs \n               from some new killer junk. They call \n               it Red Death.\n\n     Hazmat pulls out a vial marked with a red skull and \n     crossbones, shows it to Frank.\n\n                           NOEL\n               Water, water, water, doctor man, \n               water.\n\n                           HAZMAT\n               A mix of heroin and I don't know \n               what else, some kind of amino acid \n               maybe. Stuff so strong they're \n               drinking it with grain alcohol. You \n               have to use ten times the usual amount \n               of Narcan and watch out when they \n               wake up, liable to go nuts on you.\n\n                           FRANK\n                    (about Noel)\n               He one of them?\n\n                           HAZMAT\n               No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular \n               off and on, hasn't been in in a while. \n               He seized and almost coded--I gave \n               him a hypertonic solution. He drank \n               so much the kidneys were taking out \n               salt. One for the textbooks.\n\n                           NOEL\n               Oh doctor, you are the greatest. You \n               must help me.\n\n                           BIG FEET\n               For God's sake, give him a drink of \n               water.\n\n                           HAZMAT\n               I am helping you, Noel. You could \n               die if you drink more water.\n\n     Nurse Crupp pulls on Hazmat's arm.\n\n                           HAZMAT (CONT'D)\n               What is it?\n\n     She points to Burke. His monitor is ringing like a fire alarm. \n     Hazmat and Crupp rush over, wave to others:\n\n                           HAZMAT (CONT'D)\n               Crupp, start CPR. Milagros, get me \n               an epi. Odette wake up Dr. Stark. \n               Tell him I need a blood gas, stat.\n\n     As the staff crowds around Burke, pulling the paddles from \n     off the monitor, Frank, pushing his stretcher away, notices \n     Big Feet climb onto his infected feet, hobble over, work to \n     untie Noel.\n\n                           NOEL\n               Bless you sir, bless you.\n\n                           BIG FEET\n               Shut up.\n\n     Frank heads down Skid Row pushing the stretcher, passing \n     Nurse Constance speaking with a man with a gash over his \n     eye:\n\n                           NURSE CONSTANCE\n               ... so you get drunk every day and \n               you fall down. Tell me why we should \n               help you when you're going to get \n               drunk tomorrow and fall down again?\n\n     Frank pushes the automatic door button--and is suddenly hit \n     from behind by Noel. The stretcher spins sideways. Noel \n     dives out the doors for the water fountain, snorting up water \n     like a bull. Mary Burke, standing with her family, looks at \n     Frank.\n\n                           FRANK\n                    (stock reply)\n               He's very very sick.\n\n                           MARY\n               I know him. That's Noel.\n\n                           FRANK\n               We'd better go outside. Quickly.\n\n     Frank and Mary step out into the humid night.\n\n                                                          CUT TO:\n\n     EXT. MERCY EMERGENCY--NIGHT\n\n     Checking behind then, Frank stops. Mary pauses before she \n     speaks:\n\n                           MARY\n               Is there any chance?\n\n                           FRANK\n                    (shakes head)\n               I guess there's always a chance.\n\n     The doors break open. Noel comes flying out, bounces on the \n     sidewalk. Griss, in the doorway, closes the doors.\n\n     Mary goes over to Noel:\n\n                           MARY\n               Noel, Noel, it's me, Mary. From 17th \n               Street.\n\n                           NOEL\n               Mary, Mary, Mary. I'm so thirsty. \n               They won't give me anything to drink. \n               Please, Mary.\n\n                           MARY\n                    (heading inside)\n               I'll get you some.\n\n     Frank watches: Mary returns with a cup of water, gives it to \n     a grateful Noel.\n\n                           FRANK\n               I wouldn't do that.\n                    (Noel drinks)\n               The doctor seems to think he's \n               suffering from some rare disorder.\n\n                           MARY\n               It's not so rare. He grew up on our \n               street. He's had a rough life and \n               he's a little crazy from it, but \n               that's no excuse for not giving \n               someone a lousy cup of water.\n\n     Mary starts to cry. Frank fumbles in his pocket, finds a \n     tissue, gives it to her.\n\n                           MARY (CONT'D)\n               My father's dying, Noel.\n\n                           NOEL\n               Oh Mary, Mary, Mary.\n\n     Noel hugs her clumsily, his shoulders bobbing. Frank watches, \n     realizing this is what he should have done for her.\n\n                                                          CUT TO:\n\n     EXT. EAST SIDE STREETS--NIGHT\n\n     13 Zebra cruising down Avenue C, Frank at the wheel, Larry \n     shotgun.\n\n                           LARRY\n               The Chinese close in five minutes.\n               Beef lo mein.

You missed it. The Chink \n               is on 3rd.\n\n     Franks turns, gets jammed up behind a pimp car at Second and \n     Avenue B, a corner populated by pushers and hookers. TWO \n     WHORES stand in front of an abandoned building. Frank turns \n     to look.\n\n                           WHORE #1\n                Hey ambulance man. What you looking \n                at?\n\n     The second whore, wearing a yellow vinyl coat, turns. She \n     has a face that instantly freezes Frank: the Rose face. \n     Pregnant, she gestures to her belly:\n\n                           WHORE #2\n               Pretty soon you'll be coming for me.\n\n                           LARRY\n               Some partner you are Frank. I coulda \n               walked there faster. I'm starving \n               and you stop to talk to hookers. \n               You're making me nuts. Is that what \n               you're trying to do, drag me down \n               with you to nutsville?\n\n     Frank hits the whoop-whoop siren. The pimps in the black BMW \n     jump, look back, realize its only an ambulance, and pull \n     away.\n\n                           LARRY (CONT'D)\n                    (slams dashboard)\n               Oh no!--I just remembered.\n\n                           FRANK\n               What?\n\n                           LARRY\n               I'm so stupid.

It's almost \n               two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna \n               do? What you getting?\n\n                           FRANK\n               I'm not hungry.\n\n                           LARRY\n               Oh yeah, you don't eat food.\n\n                           FRANK\n               I eat.

Wait, I've got \n               it. Half fried chicken with fries. \n               Let's go, hurry up. Come on.\n\n     Frank speeds up Avenue B. Noel, wearing generic homeless \n     combat fatigues, muttering to his friends in Hell, passes on \n     the sidewalk. Frank notices another hooker, catches her face: \n     the same face as the pregnant Whore #2. The Rose face. His \n     mind drifts:\n\n                           FRANK (V.O.)\n               Rose was getting closer. Ever since \n               the call a month before, when I'd \n               lost her, she seemed like all the \n               girls in the neighborhood. One of \n               the first things you learn is to \n               avoid bad memories. I used to be an \n               expert, but lately I'd found some \n               holes. Anything could trigger it. \n               The last month belonged to Rose, but \n               there were a hundred more ready to \n               come out.\n\n                                                          CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.

Larry orders, \n     waits.\n\n                           FRANK (V.O.)\n               These spirits were part of the job. \n               It was impossible to pass a building \n               that didn't bold the spirit of \n               something: the eyes of a corpse, the \n               screams of a loved one. All bodies \n               leave their mark. You cannot be near \n               the new dead without feeling it.\n\n     Larry gets his chicken, chats with counter clerk, returns.\n\n                           FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n               I could handle that. What haunted me \n               now was more savage: spirits born \n               half-finished, homicides, suicides, \n               overdoses, innocent or not, accusing \n               me of being there, witnessing a \n               humiliation which they could never \n               forgive.\n\n     Larry climbs in, sets his take-out on the dash, hands Frank \n     a coffee.

His eyes are permanently half open. Burke's hands and \n     feet are tied by white nylon restraints.

His back arches, his body \n     shakes, his arms yank at their restraints as if reaching to \n     pull out the wires and tubes. Green lights dance across the \n     EKG screen, ALARMS sound: first the cardiac monitor, next \n     the ventilator.\n\n                           HAZMAT\n               Nurse Crupp, I need ten milligrams \n               of Valium.\n\n     Hazmat and Milagros hold down Burke's arms as Crupp prepares \n     the Valium.

He hears a woman \n     crying, shoots his flashlight her direction: nothing.\n\n     Frank hears the voice again: Rose's voice:\n\n                           ROSE'S VOICE\n               Why did you kill me, Frank?\n\n                           FRANK\n               I didn't mean to.\n\n                           ROSE'S VOICE\n               You should have helped me.\n\n                           FRANK\n               I tried to help.

The shadows swing like \n     baseball bats. Noel SCREAMS.\n\n     Suddenly, before him, a blurry mass of bloody dreadlocks--\n     Noel goes flying to the ground, Walls standing over him \n     swinging the bat, hitting him, killing him.\n\n                           WALLS\n               I got him, Frank!\n\n     Frank stands back, watching Walls and Noel like some static \n     black and white TV screen from his childhood.

Frank bends over Noel: Noel's \n     face covered with blood, gasping for air, blowing red bubbles, \n     convulsing.\n\n                           FRANK\n                    (to Walls)\n               Get the kit!

You're going \n               to make it!\n\n      Pressing Noel's chest, Frank lowers his mouth, starts CPR. \n      His mouth to Noel's.

On the EKG monitor: a slow steady \n     green endless line: up, down.\n\n     Frank takes a moment, exhales.\n\n     One by one, Frank flips off the machines. The clanging EKG \n     ALARM is followed by the bass honking of the respirator alarm \n     and two tweetering IV-drip alarms.\n\n     Frank, holding Burke's pulse, watches the life go out of \n     him. Hearing commotion outside, Frank flips the machines \n     back on: the EKG monitor is flatline.\n\n     A FLOOR NURSE rushes in, feels for Burke's pulse.\n\n                           FLOOR NURSE\n               What happened?\n                    (calling out)\n               Code!\n\n     Frank steps back as the Nurse hits the emergency switch.\n\n                           FLOOR NURSE (CONT'D)\n               Are we doing CPR?\n\n     Dr. Hazmat, out of breath, enters:\n\n                           FLOOR NURSE (CONT'D)\n               He coded.\n\n                           HAZMAT\n               Christ, what a way to start the day. \n               He's in V-fib.
