NEW YORK STREETS--NIGHT\n</b>\n     An EMS \"bus\" careens around a corner, tires squealing, lights\n     flashing, siren whoop-whooping, swooping through Stygian\n     canyons of New York.\n\n     FRANK PIERCE, 28, drives. He wears dark cargo pants, black\n     boots, a white shirt with the paramedic badge, \"EMS\" gold \n     logo on one collar, \"OLM\" on the other. \"Our Lady of Mercy \n     Paramedic\" is inscribed in white across the back of his\n     navy jacket. On his belt: two-way radio, leather gloves,\n     beeper, drug kit, multi-purpose tool kit, mini-flashlight,\n     collapsible baton.\n\n     LARRY, 35, overweight, his partner for the night, rides techie\n     (shotgun), both hands clutching the dash.\n\n     Frank scans the blurring cityscape for hidden danger. He is\n     a young man of slight frame and open face--his life, his\n     possible futures, still before him: behind those open eyes,\n     beneath those dark shadows: hollowness beckons.\n\n     Dispatcher's voice crackles through the cab static: \"Ladder \n     4, respond to a 10-22, four flight residential, 417 East 32. \n     13 Boy, men's room Grand Central, man set his pants on fire.\n     Bad burns. 17 David, at 177 East 24, there's a\n     woman who says a roach crawled in her ear.

Heat, humidity, moonlight--\n               all the elements in place for a long\n               weekend. I was good at my job: there\n               were periods when my hands moved\n               with a speed and skill beyond me and\n               my mind worked with a cool authority\n               I had never known. But in the last\n               year I had started to lose that\n               control. Things had turned bad. I\n               hadn't saved anyone for months. I\n               just needed a few slow nights, a\n               week without tragedy followed by a\n               couple of days off.\n\n     The radio continues: \"Zebra, 13Z, 524 East 17--\"\n\n<b>                           LARRY\n</b>                    (on radio)\n               We're there.\n\n     The ambulance breaks to a halt in front of a row of vintage\n     walk-ups.

BURKE APARTMENT--NIGHT\n</b>\n     They enter 5A. MRS. BURKE, 55, her eyes run dry, standing in\n     the center of the room, surrounded by neighbors. Someone\n     leads them to the BEDROOM where Mr. Burke, 60, lies unmoving,\n     stretched on the bed. A young woman, MARY BURKE, 24, kneels \n     over the old man, pressing her lips to his flaccid mouth.\n\n     JOHN BURKE, 30, grabs Franks arm:\n\n<b>                           JOHN\n</b>               We were just watching TV and Dad\n               yelled out and started punching his\n               chest, next thing he locked himself\n               in the bathroom. I said we were gonna\n               call you guys and he said not to.\n               He was crying, I never heard him \n               crying before, then he sorta stopped.\n               We pulled him out and put him on the\n               bed.\n\n     Frank and Larry moving the body to the floor:\n\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>               How long ago did he stop breathing?\n\n<b>                           JOHN\n</b>               Maybe ten minutes.

Burke's EKG \n     rhythm on the monitor a flat green line.\n\n     Frank's training takes over: he injects the long steel \n     laryngoscope down Burke's throat, he finds a vein, injects \n     epinephrine, followed by atrophine, followed by another epi:\n     no response on the monitor. Larry pulls out the paddles:\n\n<b>                           FRANK (CONT'D)\n</b>               Clear! Clear!\n\n     Larry activates defibrillator, shock--Burke's body heaves.\n     Sweat drips from Larry's nose onto Burke's chest.\n\n<b>                           MARY\n</b>               No more, please don't!\n\n     They shock him again. This time the body moves less. Frank \n     glances up: Mr. and Mrs. Burke's wedding photo sits on the \n     nightstand. Other pictures: a day at the beach, a young \n     serviceman, happy parents. Frank's mind drifts:\n\n<b>                           FRANK (V.O.)\n</b>               In the last year I had come to believe \n               in such things as spirits leaving \n               the body and not wanting to be put \n               back, spirits angry at the awkward \n               places death had left them.  I \n               understood how crazy it was to think \n               this way, but I was convinced if I \n               turned around, I'd see Old Man Burke \n               standing at the window, watching, \n               waiting for us to finish.\n\n     Frank feels Burke's heart beneath cracked ribs. The EEG \n     remains flat. He's dead. It's time to quit.\n\n<b>                           FRANK (CONT'D)\n</b>                    (to Larry)\n               I'll take over. Call ER and ask for \n               an eighty-three.\n                    (to Mrs. Burke)\n               Sorry.\n\n     Larry stands, breathing heavy, looks for a phone. Frank turns \n     to notice relatives and neighbors standing around.\n\n<b>                           FRANK (CONT'D)\n</b>               Do you have any music?\n\n<b>                           MARY\n</b>               What?\n\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>               Music. I think it helps if you play \n               something he liked.\n\n<b>                           MARY\n</b>               John, play the Sinatra.\n\n     John enters crying. Mary repeats softly:\n\n<b>                           MARY\n</b>               Play the Sinatra.\n\n     John exits. Frank notices Mary for the first time: blond \n     hair dyed black, cut short, loose fitting tank dress, black \n     makeup running down her cheeks. He notices her prom picture, \n     glances back to Mary: it seems she hasn't smiled since that \n     day eight years before. Something special about her, that \n     something that hits you right away.\n\n     \"September of My Years\" plays from the other room. Frank \n     continues massaging Mr. Burke's chest (now to Sinatra beat), \n     even though it's hopeless. Larry returns:\n\n<b>                           LARRY\n</b>               It's OK, Frank. We can call it. Eighty-\n               three.\n\n     Frank feels something strange, looks into Burke's pupils, \n     checks his neck pulse, wrist pulse. His eyes go to Larry:\n\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>               No we can't. He's got a pulse.\n\n<b>                           LARRY\n</b>               No shit.\n\n     Larry checks the monitor: the green line up and down. Mary \n     senses a change in status:\n\n<b>                           MARY\n</b>               Is he going to be alright?\n\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>                    (not encouraging)\n               His heart's beating.\n\n     A distant siren signals the arrival of backup. Frank turns \n     to Larry:\n\n<b>                           FRANK (CONT'D)\n</b>               Have 'em bring up a stretcher.\n\n     He looks from Mary back to Mr. Burke--breathing but comatose.\n\n<b>                                                          CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     INT. AMBULANCE--NIGHT\n</b>\n     Larry climbing through the back doors, sitting in the jumpseat \n     at the stretcher's head as Frank hangs IV bags, replugs EKG \n     wires that have come loose.\n\n     Frank looks up, sees Mary entering; he takes her arm, turns \n     her toward the rear doors:\n\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>               Help your family.

They need you more.   \n               Help yourself.\n\n     Mary steps out, stands in the red flashing light as Larry \n     closes the door, Frank climbs in the driver's seat.\n\n<b>                                                          CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT. SECOND AVENUE--NIGHT\n</b>\n     The EMS bus cruises up Second. Frank checks the side mirror: \n     John, Mary and Mrs. Burke pull behind in a black Ford. Seeing \n     their faces, Frank flips the lights and siren on. It's too \n     late to help Mr. Burke, but it's important to the family \n     that it look urgent. Frank watches passing lights, cars, \n     faces:\n\n<b>                           FRANK (V.O.)\n</b>               I needed to concentrate because my \n               mind tended to wander on these short \n               trips. It was the neighborhood I \n               grew up in and where I had worked \n               most as a paramedic, and it held \n               more ghosts per square foot than any \n               other.\n\n<b>                                                          CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT.

Four rows of six plastic chairs face a\n     TV bolted and chained to the ceiling. The seats are filled \n     with backed-up drunks, assault victims and \"regulars,\"\n     bleeding and spilling over against the walls and the floor, \n     getting up to ask their status or going out to throw up and \n     have a smoke.\n\n     Larry and Frank wheeling Burke in, two IV lines, each \n     connected to an elbow, tangled in EKG cables. Two LACERATED \n     RUSSIANS scramble out of their way as they approach GRISS, \n     the large black sunglassed security guard. He looks up from \n     his television guide:\n\n<b>                           GRISS\n</b>               Hey partner. Your man does not look\n               well.

Larry and Frank wheel Burke inside. A pleading family \n     tries to follow. Griss stretches out his hand:\n\n<b>                           GRISS (CONT'D)\n</b>               You can't go in there, folks.\n\n     Mary, John and Mrs. Burke rush in from the street, hoping \n     some miracle has occurred during the drive to the hospital, \n     approach the sign-in desk.\n\n     Frank and Larry pass four stretchers lined against the wall--\n     a passage nicknamed \"Skid Row\" leading past triage NURSE \n     CONSTANCE's station.\n\n<b>                           NURSE CONSTANCE\n</b>               Just keep moving.

On \n     one, NOEL, a young dark-skinned man with chaotic mess of \n     dreadlocks, pulls feverishly at his restraints:\n\n<b>                           NOEL\n</b>               For God's sake, give me some water.\n\n     From the next stretcher a man with feet swollen purple like \n     prize eggplants replies:\n\n<b>                           BIG FEET\n</b>               Shut up!

Noel, wearing generic homeless \n     combat fatigues, muttering to his friends in Hell, passes on \n     the sidewalk. Frank notices another hooker, catches her face: \n     the same face as the pregnant Whore #2. The Rose face.

One of \n               the first things you learn is to \n               avoid bad memories. I used to be an \n               expert, but lately I'd found some \n               holes. Anything could trigger it. \n               The last month belonged to Rose, but \n               there were a hundred more ready to \n               come out.\n\n<b>                                                          CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT.
