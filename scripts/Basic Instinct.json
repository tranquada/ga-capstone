There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling.  \n          On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine.  A \n          tape deck PLAYS the Stones \"Sympathy for the Devil.\"\n\n          Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.  \n          He cups her breasts.  She leans down, kisses him...\n\n          JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking.  We don't \n          see the woman's face.  She has long blonde hair.  The CAMERA \n          STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them.\n\n          She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...  she \n          kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms \n          above his head.\n\n          She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the \n          bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his \n          face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains \n          towards her.\n\n          The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it...  \n          gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...  tighter... \n          lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his \n          navel.  The SONG plays.\n\n          He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white.\n\n          She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high...\n\n          Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she \n          extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...  the \n          steel flashes... his throat is white...\n\n          He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...\n\n          It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...  and \n          up... and...\n\n          EXT.

THE BEACH HOUSE AT STINSON - DAY\n\n          The black Ferrari is in the driveway.  He sits in an unmarked \n          police car on a hillside above the house, watching.  It is a \n          bleak, leaden gray day.\n\n          Catherine comes out of the house.  She is dressed casually.\n\n          She gets into the Ferrari.\n\n          INT. HIS POLICE CAR\n\n          He stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic \n          highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson \n          Beach into Marin County.\n\n          She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting \n          in and out, passing cars very fast.\n\n          He has to start cutting around cars to keep up.  This woman \n          really drives.\n\n          He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey \n          Lines Tour Bus head-on.  Close call: sheer drops on either \n          side.\n\n          He looks frazzled.\n\n          INT. HIS POLICE CAR\n\n          He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road -- \n          little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns.\n\n          He goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her.  And then \n          he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured \n          by hedges.\n\n          He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a \n          long beat.  He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks.  \n          A small, nondescript house.  He watches.  He can't see anything \n          inside the house.\n\n          A beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it.  He takes \n          an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins.\n\n          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n\n          He watches as she comes out of the house.  A frail old woman \n          in her 70's is with her.  She hugs the old woman, gets into \n          the Ferrari, STARTS it up.\n\n          He waits a beat and then STARTS after her.  He stays behind \n          her at a distance -- she is going slowly.  And then she suddenly \n          GUNS it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH.\n\n          He GUNS his car after her.  He makes a turn.  She is gone.\n\n          There is a fork in the road.  He turns one way, goes a few \n          hundred feet.\n\n          Nothing.  Blackness.  He stops.\n\n                                    NICK\n                               (quietly)\n                        Shit.\n\n          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n\n          He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach.  The black \n          Ferrari is in the driveway.\n\n          A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom.  The curtain is drawn.  \n          He sees the outline of her body now.\n\n          She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, \n          behind the curtain.  He watches her body as she does an almost \n          languorous strip.  His eyes are intense... ravishing.\n\n          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT\n\n          He is alone, nobody else in the big room.\n\n          He sits in front of a computer.  We see the screen.  He has \n          punched in\n\n          HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY.\n\n          He is waiting for a response.  We see it come on screen\n\n          NOTHING CURRENT.\n\n          A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these \n          words\n\n          RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965.\n\n          We see him type in the words\n\n          PRIOR ARREST RECORD.\n\n          A long beat, and then it comes up\n\n          HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO\n\n          He stares at the screen a long beat.\n\n                                    GUS\n                               (behind him)\n                        Ain't you go nothin' better to do \n                        than to come in here and jack off \n                        the damn machine?\n\n                                    NICK\n                               (after a beat; lost \n                               in his thoughts)\n                        What are you doing here, Pop?\n\n                                    GUS\n                               (grins)\n                        I came in here to jack off the \n                        damn machine.\n                               (a beat)\n                        One dead psychology professor.\n                        Noah Goldstein.

THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY\n\n          He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.  \n          He stands there a beat, thinking.  He walks down to the beach \n          entrance of the house.  He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing \n          inside.  He stands there.  The door suddenly opens.  Catherine \n          stands there, smiles.  She wears very tight-fitting spandex \n          leotards.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        Hi.\n\n          He looks at her a beat, then --\n\n                                    NICK\n                        Am I... disturbing you?\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        No.  Come in.\n\n          They have their eyes on each other.  A beat, and she turns to \n          go in.\n\n          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE\n\n          She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches \n          her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns \n          the Stones DOWN.\n\n          On a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread \n          around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him.\n\n          We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW.  \n          She sees him glancing at the clips.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        I'm using you for my detective.  \n                        In my book.

You're off the Jack \n                        Daniels too, aren't you?\n\n          She is making herself a drink.  She takes the ice out and then \n          opens a drawer and gets an icepick.  It has a fat wooden end.  \n          She uses the icepick on the ice, her back to him.  He watches \n          her.\n\n                                    NICK\n                        I'd like to ask you a few more \n                        questions.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        I'd like to ask you some, too.\n\n          She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        For my book.\n\n          She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick.  She \n          raises her arm, plunges it.  Raises it, plunges it.

At one time, this club was a church.\n\n          He walks around the sides, a drink in his hand, looking for \n          her.  He doesn't see her.\n\n          The he catches a glimpse of Roxy.  She is dancing with another \n          woman.  He watches her.  She is wearing pants and a jacket, \n          her hair off to the side.  She looks very masculine tonight.\n\n          Roxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts \n          moving through the sea of dancers.

A long beat.\n\n          Catherine stops dancing.  he reaches for her.  She moves away.  \n          A beat their eyes are on each other.  She moves a step towards \n          her.  A beat, as they look at each other...  and they start to \n          move together.\n\n          Their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyes burning... \n          the movements tighter, hotter... and he suddenly grabs her and \n          kisses her... as they keep moving... the song seques into the \n          Stones's \"Gimme Shelter.\"\n\n          She is melting into him now, kissing him...

Nick looks after him a long beat, shakes \n          his head.\n\n          INT. A CAR - NIGHT\n\n          Someone is following him slowly as he walks down the street.  \n          He turns a corner, walks down the alley towards his Porsche, \n          parked behind the country and western bar.\n\n          The car suddenly speeds up -- ROARS down on him from the back, \n          full bore.\n\n          EXT. THE ALLEY\n\n          He hurls himself across the Porsche's hood... barely avoiding \n          the car.  He sees the car at the end of the alley, turning out \n          It is a black Ferrari.\n\n          INT. HIS PORSCHE\n\n          He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction \n          the Ferrari turned.\n\n          EXT. THE STREET\n\n          The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping \n          them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming.\n\n          INT. THE PORSCHE\n\n          He sees the Ferrari turn ahead.  When he gets to where it \n          turned, he turns wildly.\n\n          EXT. THE STREET\n\n          The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in \n          North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining \n          ground behind it, making turns.\n\n          INT. THE PORSCHE\n\n          The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a \n          road going up a hillside.  He yanks the wheel hard.\n\n          EXT. THE STEPS\n\n          The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the \n          air, almost out of control.                                                                     \n\n          INT. THE PORSCHE\n\n          As it crests the steps and gets to the street.  Nick GUNS it \n          and it looks like it flies high down the hill-side into \n          blackness.\n\n          EXT. THE STREET\n\n          But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking, \n          almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street.\n\n          INT. THE PORSCHE\n\n          Another set of steps leading up he GUNS it, it rockets up, \n          ROARS, bucking --\n\n          EXT. THE STREET\n\n          And lands on the next street.  Nick makes a wild right turn \n          onto the street.  And the black Ferrari appears from around a \n          curve to the right, heading right for him.\n\n          INT. THE PORSCHE\n\n          Nick steps on the GAS and heads head-on for the Ferrari.\n\n          The Ferrari SCREAMS head-on for him.\n\n          EXT. THE STREET\n\n          And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari \n          tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of \n          control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls \n          down the hillside.\n\n          EXT. THE HILLSIDE\n\n          The Ferrari has landed right-side up.\n\n          He runs down the hillside and gets to it.  A beat, and he opens \n          the car door.\n\n          Roxy lies hunched over the wheel, her eyes open.  Her neck is \n          broken.  She is dead.\n\n          EXT. THE HILLSIDE - NIGHT\n\n          Police lights have been set up.  He stands there with Lt.  \n          Walker and several of the Internal Affairs men.\n\n                                    LT.

Walker goes into the kitchen.  Nick follows him.\n\n          There are several cops around a kitchen cabinet.  A drawer is \n          open.\n\n          Walker looks -- we look with him.  We see a copy of Love hurts, \n          Catherine's paperback book, and a stack of photos of Catherine.\n\n          Walker picks the photos up, goes through them -- we see shots \n          of Catherine in college -- Catherine at a fight --Catherine \n          with Johnny Boz -- Catherine with Roxy.\n\n          He hands the photos to Nick.\n\n          Nick stares at them.\n\n                                    LT.

A long beat.\n\n                                    LT.

HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n          He parks his car.  It is dark.  Foggy.\n\n          He starts heading inside.\n\n          INT. HIS APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n          He goes in.  He starts to walk up the dark stairway, we see \n          him walking up several flights of steps.\n\n          INT. THE CORRIDOR TO HIS APARTMENT\n\n          He opens his door with his key.\n\n          INT. HIS APARTMENT\n\n          He walks in.  The apartment is dark.\n\n                                    A VOICE\n                               (behind him)\n                        Hi.\n\n          It is a whisper, almost a hiss.  He spins, fast.  Catherine \n          stands there, pressing herself against a wall.  They look at \n          each other a long beat.  She looks like she is almost in a \n          trance.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        I heard about it... on TV.\n\n          He looks at her, expressionless.  A long beat, their eyes are \n          into each other.  She looks like she is almost shivering.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        I can't allow myself to care about \n                        you -- I can't allow myself to \n                        care -- I can't -- I can't --\n\n          She looks very emotional.  He moves towards her, puts his arms \n          around her, holds her very close.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                               (in a whisper)\n                        I don't want to do this -- please --\n                        I don't want to do this -- I lose \n                        everybody -- I don't want to lose \n                        you -- I don't want to --\n\n          He presses her closer and closer to himself, holds her.\n\n          INT. HIS BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          It is dark; we can't see clearly.\n\n          Atop her... he makes love to her... gently... tenderly...  \n          hardly moving inside her... there are tears in her eyes...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n          INT.

The CAMERA faces them.  \n          He lies, staring at the ceiling, on the left side of the bed, \n          smoking a cigarette.  She is curled away from him toward the \n          right side of the bed.  A long beat, then --\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        What do we do now, Nick?\n\n                                    NICK\n                               (after a long beat)\n                        We fuck like minks.

We live happily ever \n                        after.\n\n          We see her right arm go to the side of the bed and then over.  \n          He stares at the ceiling.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        I hate rugrats.\n\n                                    NICK\n                               (after a long beat)\n                        We fuck like minks.

We live happily ever \n                        after.\n\n          We see from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now Her face \n          is expressionless.  Her right arm dangles over the right side \n          of the bed.  Her right hand is clenched.  Is she holding \n          something in it against her arm?\n\n          We see them from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now: He \n          turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette.\n\n          We see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the CAMERA.  \n          A beat, and he turns towards her.\n\n          They look at each other.  A long beat as the SONG gets louder.  \n          We see them in CLOSEUP.

The CAMERA BACKS AWAY from them \n          slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss, and we --\n\n                                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n          ...

And then the \n          CAMERA LOWERS SLOWLY as they kiss with more and more passion.\n\n          It keeps going LOWER.\n\n          There is something under the bed.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER \n          towards it as \"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL\" plays louder.  We see \n          it now in CLOSEUP as the bed rustles above...\n\n          It is a thin, steel-handled icepick.\n\n          The SONG plays LOUDER and LOUDER, and we --\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n                                     THE END\n\n\n\n\nBasic Instinct\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Joe Eszterhas\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:20:24.474723"}
