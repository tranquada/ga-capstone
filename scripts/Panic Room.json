TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY\n\t\n\tEvan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of\n\tthe townhouse.  The place is completely empty.  He talks\n\tfast, races through the tour.  The three of them come in,\n\tSarah still bouncing her basketball.\n\t\n\t                     EVAN\n\t          This is the middle of the house, the\n\t          entry floor, living room's over\n\t          there.  The kitchen floor's below us\n\t          and there's two bedroom floors\n\t          above.\n\t\n\tThe front door closes behind them, with a THUD so\n\tauthoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out.

She wanders into the\n\tliving room, peers through the big French doors, which look\n\tout over the courtyard area.  There's another row of\n\tbrownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to\n\tone another.  It looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city.\n\t\n\tSarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the\n\twindow.  There is a profound melancholy about her.  Meg\n\twatches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection.\n\tCan't.\n\t\n\tEvan flings open the door of an old-fashioned cage-style\n\televator.\n\t\n\t                     EVAN\n\t          Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine,\n\t          the previous owner, was disabled the\n\t          last ten years of his life.

That kid's got an attitude.  Meg takes a deep breath,\n\tturns to Lydia.  She brushes her hair behind an ear, we\n\tnotice her thin hand is shaking.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          I'm sorry.

MASTER BEDROOM - DAY\n\t\n\t                     EVAN\n\t          And we emerge in the master bedroom.\n\t\n\tHe checks his watch.\n\t\n\tMeg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room.  She\n\tlooks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next\n\tdoor.  She looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the\n\twindow wall.  She takes two steps back from it.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Something's weird.\n\t\n\t                     LYDIA\n\t          What?\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          I don't know, doesn't that corner\n\t          seem funny to you?\n\t\n\tShe points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to\n\tthe closet.  There is a mirrored door that leads to the\n\tcloset, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look\n\tclosely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly\n\ttoward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which\n\tthe corner of the room appears much closer to the door than\n\tit is.\n\t\n\t                     EVAN\n\t          I was waiting to see if you'd\n\t          notice!  On caravan, no one from our\n\t          office had the slightest idea.\n\t\n\tHe pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall.  It makes a\n\tfaint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He\n\tpulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty\n\tdegrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the\n\tclosed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look\n\tclosely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall.\n\t\n\tMeg looks at him -- what in the world?  Even pushes again,\n\ttwice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and\n\tthe smooth wall CLICKS ajar.  He pulls it wide open.  Meg and\n\tLydia step forward, fascinated.\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - DAY\n\t\n\tFrom the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we\n\tsee the three of them standing in the open doorway,\n\tsilhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom\n\twindows behind them.\n\t\n\t                     EVAN\n\t          It's called a panic room.\n\t\n\tHe hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          A what?\n\t\n\t                     EVAN\n\t          A safe room.

She's bleary, her head feels like\n\tsomeone rested a manhole cover on it.  She gets up, in the\n\tdark, and staggers off toward the bathroom door, feeling her\n\tway with her arms, her eyes not adjusted to the dark.\n\t\n\tShe steps through the door.\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tShe walks into the bathroom and feels around for a light\n\tswitch, but can't find it.  She blinks, squints, tries to get\n\ther bearings.  The only light is a harsh white glow that\n\tcomes from along one wall, from a bank of tiny video\n\tmonitors.\n\t\n\tShe finds the light switch, flicks it on, it nearly blinds\n\ther.  She's not in the bathroom.  She's wandered into the\n\tpanic room by mistake.\n\t\n\tShe turns around, walks out, leaving the lights on behind\n\ther.\n\t\n\tWe linger for a look at the video screens.  If only she'd\n\tdone the same, she'd see what we see.\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\twe see the three men, still in the kitchen, huddled in a\n\tgroup, silently debating what to do.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tUsing the light that spills from the open door to the panic\n\troom, Meg comes back into the master bedroom and finds the\n\tproper door to the bathroom.\n\t\n\tINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg SNAPS the cap off a jug of Advil and dumps three into her\n\tpalm.  She pops them in her mouth, searches for a glass for\n\twater, finds none, bends to the spout for a gulp to wash them\n\tdown.\n\t\n\tShe turns to the toilet.\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tOn the monitor, we see the three men leave the kitchen and\n\tstart up the stairs.\n\t\n\tINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg stands, flushes the toilet.\n\t\n\tINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tOne floor down, Burnham, Raoul, and Junior freeze, just\n\tcoming up the stairs from the kitchen.  They look up, hearing\n\tthe water rushing through the pipes in the ceiling directly\n\tabove them.\n\t\n\tThey stare at the ceiling, following with their eyes as a\n\tpair of feet pad across the CREAKY floor.  Finally, they hear\n\ta SQUEAK of bedsprings as Meg climbs back into bed.\n\t\n\tThey hold a moment longer, a silence grows.  Raoul reaches\n\tinto his jacket pocket and pulls out a ski mask.  He pulls it\n\tover his head.  They look at him.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t               (whispers)\n\t          No face.\n\t\n\tBurnham rolls his eyes.  Doesn't know this guy much, but\n\thates him so far.  They start across the foyer toward the\n\tstairs.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg rolls over, to go back to sleep.  She sees she's left the\n\tlights on in the panic room.  She TSKS, gets out of bed, and\n\twalks across the floor toward it.\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg steps into the panic room, raises her hand to the light\n\tswitch --\n\t\n\t-- and stops, her hand frozen in mid-air.  She cocks her\n\thead, looking at something she can't understand.\n\t\n\tShe blinks.  Takes a step, further into the room.  She stares\n\tat the video monitors -- at the three men in dark clothes,\n\tstealing silently across the foyer.\n\t\n\tThis can't be.  These are just pictures, they have no\n\trelation to reality.  She drops to her knees, her face inches\n\tfrom the screens, and reaches out to touch them, as if trying\n\tto make sure they're really there.\n\t\n\tINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n\t\n\tThey reach the base of the stairs, Junior in the lead.  As he\n\treaches a bend at the base of the stairs, he places one foot\n\tshort on an angled step and it slips off.  He trips, falls\n\tforward.\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tWatching the video monitors, Meg stares in horror as the\n\timage of Junior slipping is verified by the SLAP of his hands\n\ton the stairs as he catches himself, audible through the open\n\tdoor to the panic room.\n\t\n\tShe GASPS.  It is real.\n\t\n\tINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n\t\n\tIn the living room, Burnham's eyes are wide as saucers,\n\tstaring at Junior as he turns and pulls himself to his feet.\n\t\n\tJunior points at Raoul, speaks in an urgent whisper.\n\t\n\t                     JUNIOR\n\t          Top floor, get the little girl and\n\t          keep her there.  I'll bring the\n\t          woman up.  Gimme.\n\t\n\tHe holds out his hand for the gun and Raoul gives it to him.\n\t\n\t                     JUNIOR\n\t               (points to Burnham)\n\t          Stay here.  Nobody gets past you.\n\t\n\tHe heads for the stairs.  Raoul follows close behind him.\n\tBurnham stays, reluctant -- what the fuck has he gotten\n\thimself into?\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg moves.  Leaps to her feet and dashes out of the room.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg races across her bedroom, flies out the door, and bolts\n\tup the carpeted stairs, headed for the top floor.\n\t\n\tINT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg races into Sarah's room, drops onto the bed, and grabs\n\tSarah by the shoulders, trying to rouse her.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Wake up... wake up...\n\t\n\tBut she's in a profound child's sleep and won't wake up.\n\t\n\tINT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tOne floor down, Junior and Raoul reach the third floor\n\tlanding.  Still moving stealthily, Junior heads down the hall\n\tfor the master bedroom, where he thinks Meg is sleeping.\n\tRaoul heads for the stairs that lead to the top floor.\n\t\n\tINT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg is desperate, still can't wake Sarah.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Wake up...come on, come on...\n\t\n\tShe sees a plastic cup on her night table/box, half filled\n\twith water.  She snatches it and tosses the water in her\n\tface.\n\t\n\tNow she's awake.  And pissed off.  She SPUTTERS, SHOUTS.\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!\n\t\n\tINT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tRaoul, at the base of the stairs that lead to the top floor,\n\thears the kid shouting.  He starts up the stairs, quickly.\n\t\n\tINT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tOn the top floor, Meg is already dragging Sarah out of the\n\troom and into the hallway.\n\t\n\tINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg and Sarah come out of Sarah's bedroom just as Raoul\n\treaches the top of the stairs at the other end.  They're cut\n\toff.\n\t\n\tMeg freezes, staring at the hulking ski-masked figure at the\n\tend of the hallway.  She thinks, no idea what to do for a\n\tsecond.  She looks frantically to her right -- the bathroom,\n\tdead end.\n\t\n\tShe looks to her left.\n\t\n\tThe elevator.\n\t\n\tShe yanks open the elevator door, throws aside the gate, and\n\traces inside with Sarah.\n\t\n\tRaoul takes off down the hall, lunging for the elevator.\n\t\n\tINT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg SLAMS the gate shut and PUNCHES the button for the first\n\tfloor.  The elevator GROANS to life and starts down --\n\tslowly.\n\t\n\tSarah looks up at her, terrified.\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          What's going on?!\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          People.  In the house.\n\t\n\tAs the elevator descends, they see Raoul, through the window\n\tin the door, as he drops to his knees, to get a good look at\n\tthem.\n\t\n\tINT.  TOP FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tRaoul turns from the elevator, SHOUTS to the open stairwell.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          IN THE ELEVATOR!  BOTH OF 'EM HEADED\n\t          TOWARD YOU!\n\t\n\tINT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tJunior turns from the open doorway of the master bedroom and\n\traces back down the hall, toward the elevator.  He reaches\n\tthe door, peers through the window.\n\t\n\tHe sees the bare feet of Meg and Sarah, dropping toward him.\n\tHe grabs the door handle, pulls as hard as he can, but it\n\tstays locked, with the elevator moving beyond.\n\t\n\tHe bangs on the button, hoping the elevator will stop.  As\n\tMeg and Sarah drop fully into view, he stands there, eye to\n\tmoving eye with her for a moment.  But the elevator doesn't\n\tstop, it keeps going down.\n\t\n\tINT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg stands frozen, terrified, staring at Junior as they move\n\tpast him.\n\t\n\tJunior has another go at the door, pulling as hard as he can,\n\tactually bending the door, but the elevator is still moving,\n\tthe catch holds fast and the door won't open.\n\t\n\tAs they pass, his face suddenly disappears, he takes off.\n\t\n\tINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n\t\n\tJunior flies down the stairs, to cut them off at the first\n\tfloor.\n\t\n\tINT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          He's going down.\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          That room!\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          What?!\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          PANIC ROOM!\n\t\n\tMeg thinks, then punches the button for three, to go back up.\n\t\n\tBut the elevator continues down.  She jabs at it, futilely.\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          No.  you gotta...\n\t\n\tShe reaches past her, pushes the STOP button.  The elevator\n\tjerks to a halt.  Then Sarah pushes three.  Now the elevator\n\tstarts to rise.\n\t\n\tMeg looks at her, impressed.  Love that kid.\n\t\n\tINT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT\n\t\n\tIn the foyer, Junior freezes, hearing the elevator stop and\n\tstart again.\n\t\n\t                     JUNIOR\n\t          SHE'S COMING BACK UP TOWARD YOU!!\n\t\n\tHe takes off up the stairs again.  Burnham can't take it\n\tanymore, he takes off after Junior, following him upstairs.\n\t\n\tINT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tRaoul, still on the top floor, heads for the stairs, fast.\n\t\n\tINT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n\t\n\tJunior races back up the stairs.  They have her caught in the\n\tmiddle.\n\t\n\tINT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tThe door to the elevator BANGS open on three, the gate\n\tRATTLES aside, and Meg and Sarah leap out.  They take off\n\tdown the hall, toward the doorway to the master bedroom.\n\t\n\tRaoul flies down the stairs, not twenty feet behind them.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg and Sarah run through the master bedroom.  As she passes\n\tthe night table, Sarah swings an open hand to grab her cell\n\tphone from its cradle.  But in her haste she starts to pull\n\tit out at an angle and the prongs at the bottom stick in the\n\tcharger.  The phone slips from her fingers, bounces off the\n\tcorner of the table, caroms off her foot, and skitters under\n\tthe bed.\n\t\n\tSarah turns, looks to the head of the stairs just as Junior\n\tturns the corner and Raoul thunders down the steps from four.\n\t\n\tShe abandons the phone, grabs Sarah, and they lunge through\n\tthe open doorway to the panic room.\n\t\n\tJunior and Raoul burst through the doorway to the bedroom,\n\tjust a few steps away.\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg and Sarah trip over each other coming through the\n\tdoorway, they tumble to the floor of the panic room, the door\n\twide open behind them.  Meg spins around, hurls herself at\n\tthe red button on the wall --\n\t\n\t-- Junior leaps, sailing through the air toward them --\n\t\n\t-- Meg SLAMS her open palm on the red button, the massive\n\tcoiled spring that holds the metal door open is released, the\n\tsteel barrier leaps forward out of the wall --\n\t\n\t-- and WHANGS shut in a split-second.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tJunior SLAMS into the closing metal door, banging his\n\tshoulder into it, and slithers to the ground, too late.\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg rolls over and pulls Sarah into her arms, both of them\n\tbreathing hard, asking each other if they're okay, scared out\n\tof their minds.\n\t\n\tBut safe.\n\t\n\tShe spots the telephone, the one with the special buried\n\tphone line.  She lunges for it, snatches it from its cradle,\n\tlistens for a dial tone.\n\t\n\tNothing there either.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Damn it!\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          It doesn't work?!\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Different phone line, I never hooked\n\t          it up!\n\t\n\tShe hurls it down, looks back at Sarah.  She seems a bit\n\tpale, scared.  She goes to her, holds her, reassures her.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tJunior is slumped at the base of the door, livid, in pain,\n\tpounding on it with his fists, screaming \"NO!\" over and over\n\tagain, crazy with rage.\n\t\n\tRaoul stands in the middle of the room, chest heaving, hands\n\ton his knees.\n\t\n\tBurnham finally walks into the room and stops in the doorway,\n\tlooks from Raoul to Junior to the door to the panic room,\n\tfigures out the situation.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Tell me... tell me they're not in\n\t          there...\n\t\n\tWe rise up, above them, above the room, looking down on them,\n\tthe rats-in-a-maze shot.\n\t\n\tWe rise up further still, above where the ceiling ought to\n\tbe, to look down on this room and the one beside it, the room\n\tbehind the four inches of reinforced steel, the panic room in\n\twhich Meg and Sarah kneel in the middle of the floor, holding\n\teach other tight.\n\t\n\tStandoff.\n\t\n\t                                                  CUT TO:\n\t\n\tINT.

Even one with a shot of the inside of the\n\televator.\n\t\n\tThe three intruders are gathered in the living room, standing\n\tin a tight circle, having a hell of an argument.  Lots of\n\tgesturing, fingers jabbing in chests, but we can't hear a\n\tword.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tMeg furrows her brow, noticing something interesting to the\n\tright of the video monitors.

LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBurnham, Raoul, and Junior are standing in the half-darkened\n\tliving room, in the middle of their argument, when a VOICE\n\tbooms around them.\n\t\n\t                     MEG (O.S.)\n\t          Excuse me.\n\t\n\tThey practically jump out of their shoes, looking around for\n\tthe source of the voice.\n\t\n\t                     MEG (O.S.)\n\t          The police are on their way.\n\t\n\tOnly Burnham has remained relatively calm.  After he gets\n\tover the initial shock, he walks toward the tiny camera\n\tthat's hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and\n\tstares up at it.  Raoul, who has taken off his ski mask, is\n\tcareful to move out of the camera's range, and turn his back\n\tto it.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          I suggest you leave.\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\tBurnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head, wagging a\n\tfinger from side to side.  He raises a hand, makes a gesture\n\tlike a telephone, then wags his finger again.  The message is\n\tclear -- you don't have a phone.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tMeg is puzzled.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          How'd he know that?\n\t\n\tShe presses the talk button again.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t               (into speaker)\n\t          Take what you want and get out.\n\t\n\tThat sounded fairly tough.  She looks at the monitor again.\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\tthe three of them have an urgent, whispered conference, then\n\tthey all start patting their pockets for some reason, turning\n\tin circles, looking for something.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tMeg and Sarah watch them, confused.\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\tBurnham holds up a finger to the camera -- wait a second --\n\twhile Raoul and Junior rush off screen, looking for\n\tsomething.  Junior returns a moment later holding something\n\tand the three of them hunch over a box, working on something.\n\t\n\tAfter a moment, they break apart and Junior steps up to the\n\tcamera holding a pad of paper.  He shows it to the camera.\n\tOn the top page, in big block letters, they've written.\n\t\n\tWHAT WE WANT\n\t\n\tAfter a suitable pause for reading, he turns to the second\n\tpage, where four more words are written.\n\t\n\tIS IN THAT ROOM.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tSarah GASPS, Meg sits back.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          \"What we want is in that room.\"\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          They're coming in here, aren't they?\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          No, I told you, they can't.

Meg blinks, wipes the sweat\n\tfrom her forehead, begins to come back around.  She turns her\n\thead, sneaks a look at the funny wristwatch Sarah wears,\n\ttries to look without her daughter knowing.  It's not an\n\tordinary watch, it only has one number, a tall, flashing\n\tdigital display:\n\t\n\t120\n\t\n\tMeg nods, as if reassuring herself.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          We're fine.  We're okay.\n\t\n\tShe turns, looks at the video monitors to see what the hell\n\tthey're doing out there.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBAM!\n\t\n\tIn the master bedroom, a claw hammer CRUNCHES into the\n\tsheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room.\n\t\n\tThe intruders are in the master bedroom now, and Burnham is\n\tlike a man possessed, tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp\n\tend of the tool while Junior shines a flashlight into the\n\thole.\n\t\n\tAs the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the wall\n\tbehind it.  There's a latticework of two by four studs, and\n\tbeyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core.\n\t\n\tBut that's not what he's after.  He continues tearing,\n\treveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding into\n\tthe panic room through a welded hole in the steel.  Burnham\n\ttears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of the\n\tduct.\n\t\n\tCLANG!  The claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox.\n\tBurnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case.\n\tThis one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, along\n\twith a couple dozen specialized bits.  He selects one, twists\n\tit into the drill.\n\t\n\tAt the wall, Burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch.\n\tA horrendous METAL SCREECH fills the air and the drill bit\n\ttears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the size\n\tof a quarter.\n\t\n\tRaoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carrying a\n\tcoiled garden hose.  Burnham snaps his fingers for it, Raoul\n\ttosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils in\n\tthe air as it snakes across the room.\n\t\n\tBurnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole he's\n\tjust drilled in the air duct.\n\t\n\tRIP!  He tears off a length of duct tape and seals the\n\tconnection, makes it airtight.\n\t\n\tSLIT!  Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foot\n\tsection of the garden hose off the coil.\n\tHe stretches it out, across the room, to the white five\n\tgallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor\n\tup here.  We move in close as Burnham snugs the cut end of\n\tthe garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank.  Red\n\tblock letters are easy to read on the side of the tank.\n\t\n\tPROPANE\n\tCAUTION - FLAMMABLE\n\t\n\tAlong with a number of other dire warnings.\n\t\n\tBurnham raises his hand to the knob, hesitates, doesn't\n\treally want to do this, but doesn't stop himself either.\n\t\n\tHe spins it open.  Halfway.\n\t\n\t                     JUNIOR\n\t          Open it.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          I did.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          He said open it.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Just sending a message.  She'll get\n\t          the point.\n\t\n\tGas HISSES through the spigot and into the hose.  We follow\n\talong the length of the hose, across the floor of the room,\n\tthrough the hole in the sheetrock, into the hole that's been\n\tdrilled in the air duct --\n\t\n\tINSIDE THE WALL\n\t\n\t-- through the wall itself, where we see the horizontal lines\n\tof an air vent up ahead.  We squeeze between two of the\n\thorizontal lines --\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\t-- and come out in the panic room.  Three red streamers, tied\n\tto the air vent, flap to life as the gas HISSES into the\n\tpanic room.\n\t\n\tDirectly underneath the vent, Meg is hunched up against the\n\twall, her arm around Sarah.\n\t\n\tShe sniffs.\n\t\n\tAgain.\n\t\n\tSarah sniffs.\n\t\n\tThey look at each other.\n\t\n\tShe looks up.  Sees the streamers floating above her.\n\t\n\tShe leaps to her feet, steps up onto a shelf, and stretches\n\ther nose toward the streamers.  Just as she does --\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tNear the tank, Raoul shoves Burnham out of the way.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          We ain't playin', here.\n\t\n\tHe cranks the valve handle of the grill open all the way.\n\tThe gas pours into the hose with an audible WHOOSH.\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg, at the vent, falls back, two lungfuls of propane, and\n\tdrops to her knees on the floor.\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          What, what, what is it?!\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          On the floor!

We're\n\t          just getting them to come out for\n\t          forty-five minutes, forty-five\n\t          fucking minutes!  The worst that's\n\t          gonna happen is they pass out, we\n\t          drag 'em out here into the fresh\n\t          air, and they'll be fine.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are\n\t          we supposed to get into the room if\n\t          they pass out?\n\t\n\tPause.  Junior turns to Raoul.\n\t\n\t                     JUNIOR\n\t          Cut it back a little bit.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          No fucking way.\n\t\n\t                     JUNIOR\n\t          He's right, we can't get into the\n\t          room if they're dead!\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg and Sarah are down on the floor, rags covering their\n\tmouths, trying like crazy to filter the air, but it's not\n\tworking.  Sarah is crawling around the base of the wall, near\n\tto where she was before, clawing at the strange portal thing\n\tagain.\n\t\n\tFinally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the\n\tclover-leaf seal on the portal.  She unfolds it, twists it.\n\t\n\tThe portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a\n\ttube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source\n\tdirectly through to the exterior of the house.  She bends\n\tdown and looks through it.  It's covered by a metal mesh at\n\tthe opposite end, but she can see and smell the outside\n\tthrough it.\n\t\n\tShe sits up, gestures to her mother to bend down next to her.\n\tShe does, and they both jam their mouths up near the end of\n\tthe tube, gulping fresh air greedily.\n\t\n\tMeg looks at Sarah, good job, and they both drop to the floor\n\tat the portal and suck air.  It's temporary, but it works.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tIn the master bedroom, the debate has turned physical.\n\tBurnham lunges across the room at Raoul, to get his hands on\n\tthe valve, to turn off the gas.  But Raoul catches him and\n\thurls him aside.\n\t\n\tBurnham SLAMS into the wall, bounces off and SCREAMS at\n\tRaoul, who SCREAMS right back.  Junior leaps into the middle,\n\ttrying to break it up, to get them to shut up, keep their\n\tvoices down.\n\t\n\tIt's bedlam.\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tIn the panic room, Meg knows this can't go on forever.  She\n\tturns away from the portal, looks up at the vent, where the\n\tstreamers still stream.\n\t\n\tShe looks to the other side of the room, to where Sarah found\n\tthe waterproof matches and lighters.\n\t\n\tShe thinks.  Takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube\n\tand crawls over to the lighters.  She selects one, snatches\n\tup a screwdriver.\n\t\n\tSarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking,\n\tbut can't believe it.  She shakes her head vehemently.\n\t\n\tIn response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof\n\tblankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her\n\tdisbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of\n\tair.  but she's getting woozy.  This can't go on much longer.\n\t\n\tShe staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the\n\tshelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the\n\tvent.  Holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas,\n\tshe unscrews the vent cover.\n\t\n\tThe duct is wide enough to put your arm in.  She reaches in,\n\tpast a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the\n\twall.  She reaches all the way in, lighter in hand.\n\t\n\tINSIDE THE DUCT,\n\t\n\twe see her hand crawl in, lighter clenched between her\n\tfingers.  She raises a thumb to the flint wheel, cranks it\n\tonce.\n\t\n\tToo slow.  Not even a spark.\n\t\n\tHer hand shakes.  She tries again.  Still no spark.  But with\n\tthe effort and the angle, when she thumbs the lighter it\n\tmakes her hand twitch, banging up against the sides of the\n\tduct with a hollow BOOM.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBurnham turns abruptly.\n\t\n\tHe turns around.  They all freeze, listening.  He hears it\n\tagain.  The hollow BOOM, coming from inside the wall.  Now a\n\tthird time.\n\t\n\tHe walks forward, slowly, toward the wall.\n\t\n\tBOOM.\n\t\n\tHe moves closer, gets right up next to the wall.  He leans\n\tinto the wall, putting his ear right up next to the air duct.\n\tThis close, he hears the sound in more detail, realizes it's\n\ttwo sounds.\n\t\n\tSCRATCH.  BOOM.\n\t\n\tHe arches an eyebrow.\n\t\n\tINSIDE THE DUCT,\n\t\n\tMeg's hand is trembling, tiring.  She tries again, thumbs the\n\tflint wheel.  It SCRATCHES as it rolls, her hand twitches,\n\tBOOMS against the side of the duct.\n\t\n\tStill, the gas HISSES through.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tMeg's face is turning color, she's running out of air.  Her\n\tfeet tremble on the shelf, she's about to lose her footing.\n\t\n\tINSIDE THE DUCT,\n\t\n\tshe tries again.  SCRATCH.  BOOM.\n\t\n\tIN THE BEDROOM,\n\t\n\tBurnham's eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Oh.\n\t\n\tHe tears himself away from the wall --\n\t\n\tINSIDE THE DUCT,\n\t\n\t-- Meg's thumb tenses for one good hard turn --\n\t\n\tIN THE BEDROOM,\n\t\n\t-- Burnham leaps through the air, hurling himself toward the\n\tpropane tank --\n\t\n\tINSIDE THE DUCT,\n\t\n\t-- Meg cranks the wheel, a spark sparks, a flame flames, and\n\ta hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions, one toward the\n\tpanic room, the other toward the bedroom.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tMeg jumps off the shelf, throwing herself as far away from\n\tthe vent as she can, her arm engulfed by licking blue flame.\n\tShe drops to the floor of the room, covering her daughter's\n\tbody just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into\n\ta lake of fire with a deafening WHOOMP.  The fluorescent\n\tlight tubes EXPLODE, showering glass everywhere.\n\t\n\tIN THE BEDROOM,\n\t\n\tthe blue flame shoots out of the wall, into the hose, through\n\tthe hose, backing up toward the tank.\n\t\n\tBurnham CRUNCHES to the floor next to the tank, knocking the\n\tother end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue\n\tflame erupts from the end of the hose.\n\t\n\tThe flame engulfs his entire body, his hair starts on fire,\n\this chest, his arms.  Raoul lunges forward, Junior tears the\n\tblankets from the bed and throws them over him, Burnham HOWLS\n\tand rolls on the floor in pain.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tthe blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with\n\tanother angry WHOOMP, leaving a few little pockets of flame\n\tthat Meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket.  Only one\n\tof the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a\n\tflickering, uneven light on the room.\n\t\n\tShe stands in the middle of the still-smoky panic room,\n\tbreathing hard.  She shouts, SCREAMS incomprehensibly, making\n\tno sense whatsoever.\n\t\n\tShe stops, noticing the look Sarah is giving her.  Wide-eyed\n\tadmiring, frightened, you are an insane woman.\n\t\n\tMeg looks to herself.  Her arm is signed, the hair burned\n\toff.  The sleeve of her T-shirt is burned back to the\n\tshoulder.  Her face is sooty, blackened.\n\t\n\tMeg GRUNTS, half frightened by herself.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tOut in the bedroom, it's worse for Burnham, who has lost most\n\tof his hair and shirt.  But his skin isn't badly burned,\n\twhich is something, I guess.\n\t\n\tStill, he's in a rage.  He POUNDS the metal door of the panic\n\troom.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          I'M COMING IN THERE, BITCH, I AM\n\t          COMING IN THERE!  I AM COMING IN\n\t          THERE!\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg whirls, goes to the door herself, SCREAMS right back.  We\n\tcan hardly make out a word she's saying, but it sounds\n\tthreatening.\n\t\n\tSuddenly, she stops, hearing something else.  Outside the\n\tdoor, Burnham continues to rant, but there's a second sound,\n\ta sound coming from the long wall of the panic room, the wall\n\tthat's shared with the brownstone next door.\n\t\n\tIt's a faint -- very faint -- POUNDING sound, along with a\n\thigh pitched, complaining voice, so faint it can hardly be\n\theard.  Sarah hears it too.\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          Neighbor!\n\t\n\tMeg and Sarah leap as one, facing the common wall, SHOUTING\n\tat the tops of their lungs -- get help, call the police,\n\tplease, call the police, that sort of thing.\n\t\n\tThey shout and shout, but the soft pounding continues, and if\n\ttheir voices are as soft on the other side as the COMPLAINING\n\tVOICE is on this side, they have no hope.\n\t\n\tTheir voices crack and they begin to cough, too irritated by\n\tthe gas to shout for very long.  Long after they stop, the\n\tsoft POUNDING from next door continues.\n\t\n\tTheir pleas are not heard.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tThe Intruders have stopped their racket too, and are\n\tlistening carefully at the common wall.  Eventually, the soft\n\tPOUNDING stops, the complaining voice complains no more.\n\t\n\tBurnham stands there, in pain.  Things are falling apart.\n\tRaoul stands in the doorway, silhouetted by the hallway\n\tlight.  He draws himself up to his full, bulky height.  He's\n\tbig.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t               (to Junior)\n\t          We're gonna talk.  Downstairs.\n\t\n\tJunior nods and starts out.  Raoul lets him pass, but when\n\tBurnham tries to follow him, Raoul puts a big hand on his\n\tchest stopping him.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          You stay.  Make sure she don't come\n\t          out.\n\t\n\tBurnham swallows.  But stays.\n\t\n\tRaoul turns, follows Junior downstairs.  As he descends, he\n\tlooks up, making eye contact with Burnham.  And holding it.\n\tSomething on his mind, that's for sure.\n\t\n\t                                                  CUT TO:\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tTHUNK.  Meg's head falls back against a wall; she sags to the\n\tfloor, legs folded in front of her, completely drained.\n\t\n\tBut Sarah's not drained, Sarah's full of nervous ingenuity,\n\trustling around through the stuff in the panic room, an idea\n\tforming in her head.  She finds a powerful-looking flashlight\n\tand loads it up with batteries.  She tries it, flashing\n\taround the room.\n\t\n\tHalogen bulb, very powerful, hurts her mother's eyes as she\n\tflashes it past.  Meg watches her.  What's she up to?\n\t\n\tSarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she\n\tdiscovered earlier.  She squints through it.\n\t\n\tTHROUGH THE TUBE,\n\t\n\tshe can see out of the house, into the courtyard behind the\n\tbrownstone.\n\t\n\tAbout thirty yards away she can see the backs of the\n\tbrownstones on the next block, and directly across (because\n\tthe tube doesn't leave much room for lateral vision) she can\n\tsee straight into somebody's bedroom.\n\t\n\tThere's a light on.  A SLEEPING MAN is in bed, an open book\n\ton his chest.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tSarah sits back.\n\t\n\tShe grabs the flashlight, looks for a little button on the\n\ttop, the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with.\n\tShining it on the wall of the panic room, she flashes it at a\n\twall, three times, on and off.  Satisfied, she turns back to\n\tthe tube.\n\t\n\tMeg, curious, crawls across the floor to join her.  Sarah\n\tshoves the flashlight all the way into the tube, leaving\n\tenough room on either side of it for them to see through.\n\tMeg lays down flat, squints into the tube, Sarah alongside\n\ther.  She looks at her daughter, curious -- your plan?\n\t\n\tSarah reaches into the tube, finds the little flash button on\n\tthe top of the flashlight.\n\t\n\tTHROUGH THE TUBE,\n\t\n\tthe piercing halogen beam begins to flash, across the\n\tcourtyard and into the bedroom of the Man in the bedroom.\n\tThe light flashes on the wall over his bed.\n\t\n\tThe flashes are in a rhythm.  Short.  Short.  Short.  Long.\n\tLong.  Long.  Short.  Short.  Short.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tMeg turns to Sarah, impressed.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Morse code?\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t               (nods)\n\t          Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot\n\t          dot.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Where'd you learn S.O.S.?\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          \"Titanic.\"\n\t\n\tTHROUGH THE TUBE,\n\t\n\tthe flashes continue -- dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot\n\tdot.  But the Man continues to sleep, the light on the wall\n\tbehind him has no effect.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tSarah is frustrated.  She adjusts the flashlight.\n\t\n\tTHROUGH THE TUBE,\n\t\n\tthe beam of light lowers jerkily from the wall until it is\n\tshining directly into the Sleeping Man's eyes.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tSarah strains to keep the light in that perfect spot.  She's\n\tstarting to sweat.  Meg leans over, sneaks a peek at the\n\twatch Sarah wears on her left wrist.  The readout:\n\t\n\t114\n\t\n\tTHROUGH THE TUBE,\n\t\n\tthe Sleeping Man stirs.  Opens his eyes.  Winces from the\n\tlight, which is flashing directly in his eyes.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Got him!\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          Come on, come on...\n\t\n\tTHROUGH THE TUBE,\n\t\n\tthe Sleeping Man sits up.  Raises a hand, trying to block the\n\tlight, which keeps flashing on him.\n\t\n\tHe gets up, out of bed.  He comes to the window.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Yes, yes, yes, yes...\n\t\n\tSarah keeps it up, flashing faster.\n\t\n\tTHROUGH THE TUBE,\n\t\n\tthey see the Man come all the way to his window.  He leans\n\tagainst it, cups his hands so he can see better.  The flashes\n\tcontinue, right on top of him now.\n\t\n\tClearly, the Man is reading the flashes!  He takes a steps\n\tback from the window --\n\t\n\t-- gives them the finger --\n\t\n\t-- and angrily yanks shut his drapes.\n\t\n\tA moment later, the light goes out and the room is black.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tMeg and Sarah drop their heads to the carpet, defeated.\n\t\n\tSarah rolls over, knocks the flashlight away, stares up at\n\tthe ceiling.\n\t\n\tMeg puts a hand in her hair.

The BEEPING sound grows louder, she checks\n\tSarah's wristwatch, the reading is dire:\n\t\n\t57\n\t\n\tMeg GASPS, horrifies.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Oh God, oh my God...\n\t\n\tSarah begins to convulse, she bucks right out of Meg's arms\n\tand falls back onto the floor of the panic room.  Meg clears\n\teverything away from her, tries to make room for her.\n\t\n\tThe convulsion worsens.  Meg searches through the piles of\n\tsupplies, comes up with a plastic-handled screwdriver.  She\n\topens Sarah's jaws, wedges the plastic handle between her\n\tteeth.\n\t\n\tShe helps Sarah ride out the convulsion.  Finally, her eyes\n\troll back into her head, she slowly re-orients herself.\n\tSarah reaches over, turns off her still-BEEPING\n\twristwatch/monitor herself.\n\t\n\tSarah sighs, a shuddering sigh of relief, but she is nowhere\n\tnear normal.\n\t\n\tHer skin has passed through white and is turning a sallow\n\tyellow color.  She moves her lips, Meg can't hear her, she\n\tbends down:\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          You gotta jab me, Mommy...\n\t\n\tMeg turns, looks back at the monitors.  What she sees is good\n\tnews --\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\tthe jacket has been removed from the bedroom camera.  Burnham\n\tand Raoul are gone, the only person there is HARRIS, who lies\n\tslumped on the far side of the bed.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tMeg looks quickly over at the monitor for the living room.\n\t\n\tON THAT MONITOR,\n\t\n\tshe sees Burnham and Raoul having an urgent conversation,\n\tBurnham sitting in a chair, Raoul pacing in front of him,\n\tranting.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tMeg's face lights up, she practically laughs, she's so\n\toverjoyed at this turn of events.\n\t\n\tShe turns, looks back at Sarah, who is starting to tremble\n\tagain.\n\t\n\tThat does it.  Meg leaps up, hits the button that controls\n\tthe steel door, and it starts to crank open, almost\n\timpossibly slowly.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg steps out of the panic room, into the master bedroom.\n\tShe looks at Harris, on the bed.  With his back to her she\n\tcan't even tell if he's alive or dead, but first things must\n\tbe first, so she turns and races out of the room.\n\t\n\tINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg flies up the stairs, bare feet on padded carpet.\n\t\n\tINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tIn the living room, Raoul looks up, hearing the pitter-pat of\n\ther feet on the stairs above.\n\t\n\tHe smiles and pulls his ski mask back on, to cover his face.\n\t\n\tComing around behind him, we see Burnham sitting in the\n\tchair.  Except it isn't Burnham at all, it's Harris,\n\tunconscious, wearing Burnham's shirt.\n\t\n\tAnd if Harris is the person in the chair, that means --\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\t-- the person on the bed in the bedroom is Burnham, wearing\n\tHarris's shirt.  His eyes pop open, he sits up, sees the wide\n\topen door to the panic room.\n\t\n\tINT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg races into Sarah's bedroom and tears open the door of a\n\tmini-fridge.  Inside are dozens of little bottles of insulin\n\tand something called Glucogen.\n\t\n\tShe grabs a bottle of Glucogen and a black leather pouch and\n\ttakes off.\n\t\n\tINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tAs Meg nears the bottom of the stairs, she sees a horrifying\n\tsight.  It's Raoul, ski mask over his face, standing in the\n\tdoorway of the master bedroom.\n\t\n\tShe SCREAMS, he SLAMS the door, she takes off down the hall,\n\treaches the end, throws the door open --\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\t-- and races into the master bedroom, where Raoul is\n\tmotoring, fast, headed for the panic room, where she can\n\talready see Burnham, standing in the middle of the open\n\tdoorway, in front of Sarah, wearing Harris's shirt and a grim\n\t\"tricked you\" expression.\n\t\n\tMeg hurls herself at Raoul, lands clinging to his back.  She\n\tclaws and wrestles with him, gets one hand on his ski mask,\n\ttears it from his head.  He reaches up to try to stop her\n\tfrom pulling it off --\n\t\n\t-- his gun slips from his fingers, falls to the floor --\n\t\n\t-- and caroms off his boot, spinning across the floor away\n\tfrom them.\n\t\n\tRaoul flips her off his back violently, she CRUNCHES to the\n\tfloor, clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his\n\tface.  He makes a move toward his gun, but she's faster,\n\tshe's already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood\n\ttoward it.\n\t\n\tRaoul measures the distance, knows he'll lose, and sprints\n\tfor the panic room instead.  Meg turns, looks down at the\n\tmedicine in her hands, then at the door to the panic room,\n\twhere Raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that\n\tcontrols the steel door.\n\t\n\tShe makes a fast decision and lunges, hurling the plastic\n\tbottle of Glucogen and the black leather pouch through the\n\tgap just before --\n\t\n\t-- the spring-loaded steel door SLAMS shut with tremendous\n\tferocity.\n\t\n\tAnd then it's silent.  Meg WAILS in agony, POUNDS on the\n\tdoor.\n\t\n\tShe stands back, chest heaving, sobbing.\n\t\n\tA looooong moment goes by.\n\t\n\tFinally, a VOICE comes over the house's intercom system.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL (O.S.)\n\t               (calmly)\n\t          If you leave the house, we'll kill\n\t          her.\n\t\n\tMeg sobs.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL (O.S.)\n\t          If I see a uniform in the house,\n\t          we'll kill her.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Oh... oh...\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL (O.S.)\n\t          You understand?\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\tMeg looks up at the camera in the master bedroom.  She nods,\n\tterrified.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tBurnham pushes past Raoul, at the speaker button, and leans\n\tforward.  He's approaching exhaustion.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t               (into speaker)\n\t          I just... I just need forty-five\n\t          minutes.\n\t\n\tRaoul stands behind him, muttering to himself.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          Saw my face, man.  Saw my face.\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\twe see Meg's face, agonized, as she lunges toward the camera,\n\tSCREAMING something up at it, the same thing, over and over.\n\tBut in here her voice is nearly muted, what bleeds through\n\tthe walls isn't enough to be heard.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tRaoul looks at her image on the monitor, irritated.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          Shut up.\n\t\n\tIN THE MASTER BEDROOM,\n\t\n\twe abruptly hear her voice, full-throated.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t               (shouting into the camera)\n\t          -- cine, she needs the MEDICINE!\n\t          GIVE HER THE --\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tSarah shivers in a corner, knees pulled up to her chest,\n\tstaring at the intruders, scared out of her wits, and looking\n\tvery, very sick.\n\t\n\tBurnham looks at her, musters the most reassuring face he can\n\tcome up with under the circumstances.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          It's gonna be cool, kid.  Be outta\n\t          here before you know it.\n\t\n\tNo response from Sarah.  Burnham cocks a head, really looking\n\tat her.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Are you okay?\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          Hurry up, for Christ's sake!\n\t\n\tBurnham turns, grabs his satchel, and drops to his knees in\n\tthe middle of the floor.  Over his shoulder, we can see the\n\tface of Meg on one of the monitors, shouting into the camera,\n\tbegging them to give Sarah her medicine.\n\t\n\tUsing his hand, Burnham measures six lengths in from the\n\twall, then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet,\n\tlooking for a seam.\n\t\n\tHe finds one, gets hold of it on one edge, and runs his other\n\thand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to\n\tturn a corner.  He stands, hovering over the carpet, and\n\tpulls back evenly with both hands.\n\t\n\tThe concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly, with the soft\n\tsound of tearing VELCRO.  Underneath the flap --\n\t\n\t-- is the smooth metal door of a floor safe.\n\t\n\tBurnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove.  It rolls\n\tout and opens up onto the floor, revealing a neat array of\n\tsafecracking tools.\n\t\n\tHe begins his delicate work, but is suddenly jarred by a\n\tPOUNDING on the metal door.  He turns, annoyed.  Meg is still\n\tSCREAMING outside the door.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          The hell does she want?\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          I don't know, she keeps screamin'\n\t          the same thing over and over.\n\t\n\tBurnham turns, looks at the monitors.\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\tMeg is staring up at the camera, miming the act of giving\n\therself an injection in the arm.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tRaoul laughs.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          Drugs.  She wants drugs.  What the\n\t          fuck?\n\t\n\tBut Burnham thinks.  His eyes fall on the bottle and the\n\tleather pouch she hurled through the door, then whip over to\n\tSarah, who sags over into a fetal position on the floor.  Her\n\tlips are moving.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Oh, man...\n\t\n\tHe crawls over to Sarah, puts his ear down next to Sarah's\n\tlips.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          What is it?\n\t\n\tSarah tries to summon enough strength to speak, but her\n\tbreath comes hard.\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          I need...\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Yeah?\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          ... 'jection...\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          An injection?\n\t\n\tSarah nods.  Burnham points to the pouch and the Glucogen, on\n\tthe floor nearby.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          That stuff?\n\t\n\tSarah nods again.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Can you do it yourself?\n\t\n\tSarah shakes her head no.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Well, I don't know how.\n\t\n\tSarah looks at him, eyes pleading.  Raoul stands behind\n\tBurnham.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          I don't fucking believe this.\n\t               (to Sarah)\n\t          You gotta wait.\n\t\n\tSarah just looks at Burnham.  Please.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a\n\t          little more, and your mom'll give it\n\t          to you.  You can wait a half hour,\n\t          can't you?\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's\n\t          just like, tired, she's gotta rest.\n\t          You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.\n\t\n\tSarah looks terrified, shaking her head no.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          Come on.\n\t\n\tHe starts to pull Burnham away, but Burnham shakes his hand\n\toff, violently.  He bends down very close to Sarah's lips.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Tell me the truth, okay?  What's\n\t          gonna happen if you don't get this?\n\t\n\tSarah swallows, licks her cracking lips.  When she speaks,\n\tit's breathy, almost inaudible.\n\t\n\tBut the words are clear.\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          Coma.  Die.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tSeen from overhead, Meg paces in the master bedroom, out of\n\ther mind with worry, no idea how to communicate to the people\n\tin the room the desperate situation.\n\t\n\tSuddenly, a VOICE comes over the intercom speaker.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM (O.S.)\n\t          I understand.  I'll give her the\n\t          shot.\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tA HAND comes down into frame and picks up the Glucogen and\n\tthe leather pouch.  Burnham stands, looking down at them.\n\tRaoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          You're wasting your fucking time,\n\t          man, you're wasting my time.  You\n\t          don't know how to do this, and the\n\t          longer we stay in here, the more\n\t          likely she's gonna lose it and call\n\t          the cops!\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Are you gonna open the safe?\n\t\n\tRaoul looks at him.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Then shut up and get out of my way.\n\t\n\tAs Burnham crosses the room, Raoul makes eye contact with\n\tSarah, who is staring at him.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          Don't look at me.\n\t\n\tACROSS THE ROOM,\n\t\n\tBurnham drops to his knees next to Sarah and unzips the\n\tpouch.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Okay, kid, all I know about this is\n\t          what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk\n\t          me through it.\n\t\n\tSarah tries to form words, but she's too weak.  Burnham\n\tswallows.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV\n\t          don't lie, right?\n\t\n\tHe reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad,\n\tand a length of rubber tubing.  He takes Sarah's arm,\n\tstretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          You seem like a good kid.  Your\n\t          mom... only saw her for a second,\n\t          but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?\n\t\n\tNo answer.  Burnham ties the rubber tubing around Sarah's\n\tarm, pulls it tight.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Hey, nod or something, show me\n\t          you're still alive, will ya?\n\t\n\tSarah nods.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Attagirl.  That too tight?\n\t\n\tSarah shakes her head no.  Burnham takes the syringe, starts\n\tto fill it from the Glucogen bottle.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          You guys are pretty rich, huh?\n\t\n\tSarah shrugs.  While Burnham goes through the process of\n\tfinding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he\n\tgoes on, as much to comfort Sarah as to comfort himself:\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Yeah, you don't think about that\n\t          stuff.  Good for you.\n\t\n\tHe looks at her, sees her looking at him.  Thinking about\n\thim.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          I know, I know.  I really screwed\n\t          the pooch this time.  I never did\n\t          anything like this before.  Break\n\t          into somebody's house?  Not even\n\t          close.  Bad cards, Kid.  I swear to\n\t          God, I been on the wrong end of\n\t          maybe six straight years of bad\n\t          cards.  House.  Car.

LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg is in the living room, with Harris, who is still slouched\n\tin the chair.  He's in awful shape, barely conscious.\n\t\n\tOut of the silence, a sudden, deafening sound.\n\t\n\tThe DOORBELL.\n\t\n\tHer eyes go wide.

She walks toward the door,\n\tstops, thinks some more.\n\t\n\tThe doorbell RINGS again.\n\t\n\tShe comes up with a plan.  She goes back to where Harris is\n\tin the chair, pulls the chair back a few feet, out of view of\n\tthe door.  She puts the gun in his lap, puts his hand over it\n\tto steady it.\n\t\n\tShe leans down, WHISPERS to him.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Don't.  Say.

LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tIn the living room, there is an audible CLICK as the speaker\n\tis activated.

The\n\tnoise is deafening.\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\tSarah sees her mother approaching the monitor in the bedroom,\n\tcarrying a jacket.  Meg tosses the jacket, this time she\n\tdoesn't want them to see what she's doing.\n\t\n\tThe monitor goes black.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tIn the master bedroom, Meg pulls on a pair of jeans that are\n\thanging over a chair.\n\t\n\tShe steps into a pair of boots.\n\t\n\tShe shoves the gun into her belt.\n\t\n\tHere in the bedroom, she can hear the drill.  From the house\n\tnext door, she hears POUNDING again, more MUFFLED CURSES.\n\tApparently the neighbor can hear the drill too.\n\t\n\tMeg looks from the walls of the bedroom to the walls of the\n\tpanic room.  Her eyes light up with an idea.\n\t\n\tShe goes to the front wall of the bedroom, stands with her\n\tback against the exterior wall (street side), with her left\n\tshoulder against the common wall that's shared with the\n\tneighbor's brownstone.\n\t\n\tShe begins to step off the distance, heel to toe, measuring\n\twith her feet until she reaches the metal door that is the\n\tentrance to the panic room.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          Fourteen.\n\t\n\tShe hurries out of the bedroom.  What's she doing?\n\t\n\tINT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg comes into a small room full of empty bookshelves, a\n\tlibrary.  There is a window that looks out over the sidewalk,\n\tone floor up, same level as the stoop.\n\t\n\tShe looks up, into the corners of the room.\n\t\n\t                     MEG\n\t          No camera, no camera, no camera...\n\t\n\tThey're bare, no video cameras.

Raoul is watching the monitors\n\tcarefully.\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\twe see Meg as she searches through the tools in the living\n\troom, finds a screwdriver, a sledgehammer.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tRaoul furrows his brow.  Now what?\n\t\n\tINT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tMeg is back in the library, hurriedly unscrewing the window.\n\tShe gets the last screw out, shoves the window up.\n\t\n\tThe wind BLASTS in, it's a hell of a spooky night out there.\n\t\n\tShe leans out the window.  We lean with her.  The sidewalk is\n\tempty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the\n\thouse).  She's one floor up.  To her right is the house's\n\tfront stoop.\n\t\n\tShe tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop.  Climbs up\n\tonto the window ledge, and slithers out herself.\n\t\n\tWe lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops\n\tdown onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror --\n\t\n\t-- at the video camera that covers the front stoop.\n\t\n\tON THE MONITORS,\n\t\n\twe see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly\n\tstanding on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was\n\tspecifically told not to go.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tSarah sees the image of her on the stoop.  Raoul happens to\n\tbe looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to\n\tturn around, to look at the monitors again --\n\t\n\t-- and Sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          Hey!\n\t\n\tHe turns, away from the monitors.\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          Sorry.

LIBRARY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tStill leaning out the window, we can see Meg from here as she\n\treaches the sidewalk and runs up the front steps of the\n\tneighbor's house, which is contiguous.\n\t\n\tStraining to see (yet stay in the house), we see Meg all the\n\tway at the right edge of the frame, as she shifts the gun to\n\tthe back of her pants and knocks on the neighbor's door,\n\tsledgehammer held slightly behind her leg.\n\t\n\tAfter a long moment, we hear the neighbor's front door open.\n\tThe conversation begins.  The wind is gusting right in our\n\tfaces, we can't make out the details, but the gist is clear --\n\tlet me into your house, and don't as me a lot of questions.\n\t\n\tThe NEIGHBOR -- and by the tone of the voice it sounds like\n\tan old woman -- is slow to respond, grumpy.\n\t\n\tLosing patience, Meg just pulls the Neighbor out of the way\n\tand shoves into the house.  The Neighbor stumbles out onto\n\ther front stoop, and we were right, it's an old lady in a\n\tnightgown, but she's no shrinking violet.  In fact, she's\n\troyally pissed off and not at all intimidated.\n\t\n\t                     NEIGHBOR\n\t          What the hell do you think you're\n\t          doing, young lady?!\n\t\n\tShe storms back into her house, following Meg.  As both of\n\tthem disappear from the frame, we move out of the library,\n\tinto the foyer, and move along the common wall, the one\n\tshared with the neighbor's brownstone.\n\t\n\tFrom the other side of the wall, we can hear muffled voices,\n\targuing, Meg and the Neighbor shouting at each other.\n\t\n\tWe drift up, up the stairs, and hear the THUNDERING of\n\tfootsteps on the stairs next door.  We keep pace with them,\n\tfrom inside this house.  We pass right through the floor --\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\t-- and rise up out of the floor in the master bedroom, and\n\tnow we can hear the conversation on the other side of the\n\twall in here, the Neighbor's fearful, angry tones, Meg's\n\tfirm, urgent declarations.\n\t\n\tWe move with Meg, even though we can't see her, we know what\n\tshe's doing, she's stepping off the paces on the other side\n\tof the wall.  We drift down that wall, fourteen steps, until\n\twe reach the metal door to the panic room, then we pass\n\tthrough that door --\n\t\n\tINT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\t-- and arrive inside the panic room, where Burnham is this\n\tclose to getting the safe open, when all of a sudden --\n\t\n\tWHOMP.\n\t\n\tCRUNCH.\n\t\n\tBurnham and Raoul freeze, alarmed.  It's coming from the long\n\twall, the shared wall.\n\t\n\tThey look at each other.\n\t\n\tWHOMP.\n\t\n\tCRUNCH.\n\t\n\tThey look at the wall.\n\t\n\tSomebody is on the other side, pounding like hell.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          The walls are steel, right?\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Not that one.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          NOT THAT ONE?!\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Hey man, it's the neighbor's house,\n\t          who breaks in through the neighbor's\n\t          house?!\n\t\n\tWHOMP!  CRUNCH!\n\t\n\tLouder.  Closer.  Burnham turns, SCREAMS at the wall.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE\n\t          NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          We've got the Kid!\n\t               (shouting at the wall)\n\t          WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!

The FUCK you had to\n\t          bring a gun for?!\n\t\n\tBurnham throws himself back on the floor, goes back to work\n\ton the safe.  Fires up the drill again, it SCREAMS into the\n\tmetal.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Almost there...\n\t\n\tThe POUNDING keeps up from next door.  We hear sheetrock torn\n\taway on the far side.  Bricks, SCRAPING out of place.\n\t\n\tSarah, in the corner, is energized, excited.  While Burnham\n\tand Raoul are distracted, she grabs the leather pouch, palms\n\tthe three syringes that are left in there.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          ALMOST THERE...\n\t\n\tFinally, the door to the safe CRUNCHES in on one side,\n\tyielding to the drilling --\n\t\n\t-- at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer CRASHES\n\tthrough the wall of the panic room.  Raoul grabs hold of\n\tSarah, Burnham maintains his focus, throwing open the safe,\n\trevealing --\n\t\n\t-- nothing.\n\t\n\tCRUNCH!\n\t\n\tThe sledgehammer head strikes again, opening up a hole about\n\ta foot across.  Light spills through from the other side, as\n\twell as the voice of the hysterical Neighbor.\n\t\n\tRaoul hurls Sarah against the far wall, leaps over to the\n\tside of the hole, and waits, poised above it.\n\t\n\tAt the safe, Burnham doesn't lose his cool, just opens a\n\tfalse bottom in the safe, revealing a manila envelope.\n\t\n\tHe snatches it up, RIPS it open, and his eyes dance as he\n\tholds up fourteen individual one million dollar U,S, Treasury\n\tBearer Bonds.  He fans them out, eyes drinking from his\n\tGrail.\n\t\n\tBANG!\n\t\n\tA gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds, setting it\n\taflame before it SLAMS into the far wall, sending up a little\n\tcloud of plaster dust.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          JESUS!\n\t\n\tHe whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall,\n\tgun extended.\n\t\n\tBut Raoul is standing just above the hole, and already has\n\this boot raised, over the hand.  He brings it down, a\n\tCRUNCHING blow that stomps right on Meg's wrist.\n\t\n\tMeg SCREAMS, loses her grip on the gun, and it CLATTERS into\n\tthe space between the houses.\n\t\n\tBETWEEN THE WALLS,\n\t\n\tthe gun falls into oblivion, the space between the walls,\n\twhere no one can get to it.\n\t\n\tIN THE PANIC ROOM,\n\t\n\tBurnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          I GOT THE MONEY, LET'S GO!!!\n\t\n\tRaoul grabs Sarah and turns, jabs the green button to open\n\tthe door.\n\t\n\tBehind them, Meg SCREAMS in anger and wriggles through the\n\topening.  Before she's even all the way through, she gets\n\thold of Raoul's leg and pulls herself into the panic room,\n\tscraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the too-small\n\thole.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          GO, LET'S GO, OUTTA HERE!!\n\t\n\tBut Raoul is deep in a violent rage.  Still holding Sarah\n\twith one hand, he bends down, grabs Meg by the hair, and\n\tdrags her toward the doorway.\n\t\n\t                     RAOUL\n\t          YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!\n\t\n\tHe bolts out of the room, through the metal door, which is\n\tjust finishing its slow crank open, its heavy spring coiling\n\tin the wall.\n\t\n\tRaoul drag Meg across the floor by the hair, right into the\n\ttrack of the open steel door.\n\t\n\tShe looks up, sees the infrared safety beam over her head,\n\tand  realizes with horror what his intention is.\n\t\n\tStill with one arm holding Sarah, who is kicking and\n\tstruggling viciously, Raoul holds Meg's head down on the\n\tfloor, below the safety beam that would prevent the door from\n\tclosing.  He reaches for the \"close\" button.\n\t\n\tSarah raises her arm, stuffed with three syringes, and jabs\n\tthem into Raoul's neck.  Raoul SCREAMS in pain.\n\t\n\tMeg manages to raise her head, breaking the beam.\n\t\n\tINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\t\n\tOn the stairwell, Burnham, stops, frozen, his face twitching\n\twith indecision.  He hears the murder taking place just above\n\thim.\n\t\n\tHe runs down three steps.\n\t\n\tStops again.\n\t\n\tRuns down the rest of the stairs.\n\t\n\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\t\n\tRaoul stretches to push the red \"close\" button for the door,\n\tbut he has to hold Meg's head down, out of the lower beam\n\twith one hand, all with Sarah savagely attacking him at the\n\tsame time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck.\n\t\n\tFinally, he gets Meg's head all the way down, onto the floor.\n\t\n\tLooking up, Meg sees the red beam become complete again.\n\t\n\tRaoul jabs the button --\n\t\n\t-- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one\n\tat shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is\n\tbroken, the door will not close.\n\t\n\tRaoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah\n\tflying across the room.\n\t\n\tMeg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the\n\tbeam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over\n\tagain, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then\n\tbreaks, never the button and the beam at the same time.\n\t\n\tBut it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it\n\tup, her head trembles --\n\t\n\t-- and collapses onto the floor.\n\t\n\tThe beam completes --\n\t\n\t-- Raoul SMACKS the red button --\n\t\n\t-- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He\n\treaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but\n\tRaoul loses his balance, falls forward --\n\t\n\t-- into the gap --\n\t\n\t-- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door\n\tthat SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back.\n\t\n\tMeg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on\n\ttight.\n\t\n\tThe door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly.\n\tRaoul's body slumps to the floor, dead.\n\t\n\tBurnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah.\n\t\n\tThey stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face\n\tcontact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket.\n\t\n\tShe just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here.\n\t\n\tHe zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.\n\t\n\tINT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT\n\t\n\tBurnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door,\n\tthrows it open --\n\t\n\t-- and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose.  He\n\tblinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that\n\tgun.\n\t\n\tIt's the Cop, the first Cop, the one who came to the door and\n\twas so suspicious of Meg.  The Cop looks down, sees blood\n\tsmeared all over Burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to\n\tknow his suspicions were correct.\n\t\n\t                     COP 1\n\t          Put your hands up.\n\t\n\tBurnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway.  Wind and leaves\n\tblow into the house, a real gale outside.\n\t\n\tFrom behind Cop 1, MORE COPS SHOUT, all at once, must be a\n\thalf dozen of 'em there, but Burnham can't see anything in\n\tthe stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the\n\tROARING wind.\n\t\n\tBurnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the\n\tCop's face.  The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but\n\tdoesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS\n\tCRACK through the door behind him.\n\t\n\tBrilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the\n\tdoor, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks\n\tof lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his\n\tchest, a triangle pattern.\n\t\n\tBurnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his\n\tjacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds.\n\t\n\tHe fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like\n\tplaying cards.\n\t\n\t                     BURNHAM\n\t          Monster hand.\n\t\n\tBehind him, the front door CRACKS open, half a dozen COPS\n\tappear and start SHOUTING, all at once.  Burnham tosses the\n\tbonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of\n\tpoker.\n\t\n\tHe GROANS and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds,\n\ttwisting as he goes down.  He SLAPS onto his back in the\n\tfoyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the\n\tbonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house,\n\tas if they were never meant to leave.\n\t\n\tBurnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the\n\tceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air,\n\tsuspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over\n\this head as he dies.\n\t\n\t                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\t\n\tEXT.  CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY\n\t\n\tThe swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the\n\tair over Central Park on a crisp fall day.  The leaves float\n\tdown, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we\n\tsaw in Meg's hallucination.\n\t\n\tBut on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people,\n\tthrowing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing\n\tnothing.\n\t\n\tThe leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched\n\tout on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open\n\tto the ads.\n\t\n\tMeg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up\n\tat the clouds.\n\t\n\tSarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.\n\t\n\t                     SARAH\n\t          I mean, uptown is close to Dad's\n\t          place, but somebody at school said\n\t          the Village is really cool, so... I\n\t          don't know, it's so great to be\n\t          close to the park and everything...\n\t          What do you think, I mean, give me a\n\t          clue, here, where are we gonna live?\n\t\n\tMeg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow.  She seems\n\tyears younger.  She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her\n\tdaughter's hair behind one ear.\n\t\n\tShe smiles.  She is calm.\n\t\n\tBehind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the\n\tclear autumn sky.\n\t\n\t                                                FADE OUT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPanic Room\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David Koepp\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:32:41.456118"}
