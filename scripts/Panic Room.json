There is a mirrored door that leads to the\n\tcloset, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look\n\tclosely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly\n\ttoward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which\n\tthe corner of the room appears much closer to the door than\n\tit is.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                     EVAN\n</b>\t          I was waiting to see if you'd\n\t          notice!

It makes a\n\tfaint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He\n\tpulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty\n\tdegrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the\n\tclosed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look\n\tclosely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMeg looks at him -- what in the world?

Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foot\n\tsection of the garden hose off the coil.\n\tHe stretches it out, across the room, to the white five\n\tgallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor\n\tup here.

HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tOn the stairwell, Burnham, stops, frozen, his face twitching\n\twith indecision.  He hears the murder taking place just above\n\thim.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe runs down three steps.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tStops again.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tRuns down the rest of the stairs.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tINT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tRaoul stretches to push the red \"close\" button for the door,\n\tbut he has to hold Meg's head down, out of the lower beam\n\twith one hand, all with Sarah savagely attacking him at the\n\tsame time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tFinally, he gets Meg's head all the way down, onto the floor.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tLooking up, Meg sees the red beam become complete again.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tRaoul jabs the button --\n<b>\t\n</b>\t-- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one\n\tat shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is\n\tbroken, the door will not close.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tRaoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah\n\tflying across the room.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMeg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the\n\tbeam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over\n\tagain, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then\n\tbreaks, never the button and the beam at the same time.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBut it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it\n\tup, her head trembles --\n<b>\t\n</b>\t-- and collapses onto the floor.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe beam completes --\n<b>\t\n</b>\t-- Raoul SMACKS the red button --\n<b>\t\n</b>\t-- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He\n\treaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but\n\tRaoul loses his balance, falls forward --\n<b>\t\n</b>\t-- into the gap --\n<b>\t\n</b>\t-- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door\n\tthat SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMeg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on\n\ttight.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly.\n\tRaoul's body slumps to the floor, dead.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBurnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThey stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face\n\tcontact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tShe just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tINT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tBurnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door,\n\tthrows it open --\n<b>\t\n</b>\t-- and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose.  He\n\tblinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that\n\tgun.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tIt's the Cop, the first Cop, the one who came to the door and\n\twas so suspicious of Meg.  The Cop looks down, sees blood\n\tsmeared all over Burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to\n\tknow his suspicions were correct.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                     COP 1\n</b>\t          Put your hands up.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBurnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway.  Wind and leaves\n\tblow into the house, a real gale outside.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tFrom behind Cop 1, MORE COPS SHOUT, all at once, must be a\n\thalf dozen of 'em there, but Burnham can't see anything in\n\tthe stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the\n\tROARING wind.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBurnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the\n\tCop's face.  The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but\n\tdoesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS\n\tCRACK through the door behind him.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBrilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the\n\tdoor, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks\n\tof lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his\n\tchest, a triangle pattern.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBurnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his\n\tjacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like\n\tplaying cards.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                     BURNHAM\n</b>\t          Monster hand.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBehind him, the front door CRACKS open, half a dozen COPS\n\tappear and start SHOUTING, all at once.  Burnham tosses the\n\tbonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of\n\tpoker.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tHe GROANS and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds,\n\ttwisting as he goes down.  He SLAPS onto his back in the\n\tfoyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the\n\tbonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house,\n\tas if they were never meant to leave.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBurnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the\n\tceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air,\n\tsuspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over\n\this head as he dies.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n</b><b>\t\n</b><b>\tEXT.  CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tThe swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the\n\tair over Central Park on a crisp fall day.  The leaves float\n\tdown, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we\n\tsaw in Meg's hallucination.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBut on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people,\n\tthrowing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing\n\tnothing.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched\n\tout on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open\n\tto the ads.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMeg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up\n\tat the clouds.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tSarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                     SARAH\n</b>\t          I mean, uptown is close to Dad's\n\t          place, but somebody at school said\n\t          the Village is really cool, so...

She seems\n\tyears younger.  She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her\n\tdaughter's hair behind one ear.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tShe smiles.  She is calm.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tBehind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the\n\tclear autumn sky.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                                                FADE OUT.\n</b>\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Panic Room</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=David Koepp\" title=\"Scripts by David Koepp\">David Koepp</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Panic Room Script.html#comments\" title=\"Panic Room comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:13:08.298176"}
