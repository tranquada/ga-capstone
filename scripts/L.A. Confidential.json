Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands.\n\n        Exley then accepts a handshake from Dudley.  The\n        policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm.\n        Dudley lifts the medal from his chest.\n\n<b>                                DUDLEY\n</b>                  Your father would've been proud.\n\n        Exley uses the noise to have aprivate chat with Dudley.\n\n<b>                                EXLEY\n</b>                  There are loose ends out there,\n                  Dudley.

Doesn't that sound crazy?\n\n        Dudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as\n        more bulbs flash.\n\n<b>                                DUDLEY\n</b>                  Breaking a big case sticks you in\n                  a whirlwind.

It is an appealing thing.\n\n        In the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat.  No one's\n        watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows\n        pretend smoke off the barrel.
