Bucky sees a newspaper on the\n     front porch railing. The evening edition of The Mirror.\n\n     \"Boxer Cops in Gun Battle. Four Crooks Dead.\"\n\n     Publicity boxing photos accompany a full-page article.

From the back of\n     the house Bucky hears the sound of A SHOWER RUNNING.\n\n     Bucky walks back to the bathroom, drawn there by the sound of\n     the drumming water. The bathroom door is open, an invitation.\n\n     He stops at the threshold of the bathroom. His POV:\n\n     Kay stands in the shower, curtain open for Bucky's benefit.\n     She faces him and he takes in the view of her nakedness.\n\n     Her attitude is not one of seduction, however, her expression\n     passive and fixed even when their eyes meet.

Daddy's having a\n               business soiree--\n\n<b>     INT. THE BATHROOM OF THE POLICE STATION - A FLASHBACK\n</b>\n     Bucky bursts in on Lee washing his bloody fists.\n\n<b>                          LEE\n</b>               --Penance for Junior Nash--\n\n<b>     BACK TO SCENE\n</b>\n     Bucky's leaning on the desk...\n\n<b>                          BUCKY\n</b>               And you knew it, Kay! You knew it all! He\n               took that hundred thousand and split to\n               Mexico and you let him go!\n\n     Kay fingers the edges of an exam. She looks him in the eye.\n\n<b>                          KAY\n</b>               You are so, so good at some things.\n\n     He absorbs the blow and waits for her to continue.\n\n<b>                          KAY\n</b>               He was going to leave no matter what. I\n               didn't know if I was ever going to see\n               him again, and I wanted him to be\n               comfortable if such a thing was possible.\n               Dwight, he knew I was in love with you,\n               and he wanted us to be together.\n\n<b>                          BUCKY\n</b>               He didn't leave, he ran. He ran from the\n               bank job, ran from the frame on DeWitt.\n               He knew who killed Elizabeth Short and\n               fucking ran away! This whole time. You\n               both knew everything--\n\n     Kay slams down a book.\n\n<b>                          KAY\n</b>               Goddammit, Dwight! That girl--that girl!\n               I don't give a damn about that girl. She\n               ruined our lives!\n\n     The room grinds to a halt.\n\n                          KAY (cont'd)\n               He loved us. Don't take that away from\n               him. And I love you. And if you hadn't\n               seen so much of yourself in her you'd\n               realize how much you loved me. (beat) So\n               if you're aware of something more\n               important than that...I'd like to hear\n               what it is.\n\n     Bucky looks like he's about to burst. He wants to go to her,\n     lock her in his arms and forgive. instead, he just backs up\n     three steps, slowly turns on his heels, and walks out.\n\n<b>     INT. A BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Bucky sits in the back of the bar, shrouded in smoke and loud\n     music. He drinks bourbon and watches Madeleine over at the\n     bar. She's got her hand on a soldier's knee.\n\n<b>     EXT. THE RED ARROW INN - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Madeleine Sprague and the soldier boy walk from the office\n     over to the now familiar Room 11. They enter, shutting the\n     door and flicking on the light to reveal\n\n<b>     BUCKY\n</b>\n     sitting on the back of a chair with his feet on the seat. He\n     trains his silenced pistol on them. Flashing his badge, he\n     points the soldier to the door:\n\n<b>                          BUCKY\n</b>                   (quoting Lee)\n               Adios yourself back to the Halls of\n               Tripoli, shitbird. I've got business\n               with the lady.\n\n     You don't have to tell the soldier twice. He backs out and\n     shuts the door.\n\n<b>                          BUCKY\n</b>               I've been pointing my gun at a lot of\n               people this week. But I haven't had much\n               of a chance to shoot anybody. Whattya\n               think?\n\n<b>                          MADELEINE\n</b>               I think you'd rather fuck me than kill\n               me. But you don't have the guts to do\n               either. You're a boxer. Not a puncher.\n\n     Bucky smiles.\n\n<b>                          BUCKY\n</b>                   (Scotchman's burr)\n               Aaaah, lassie. You wanna sell me short\n               to the very end, eh?\n\n     Now she's curious.\n\n                          BUCKY (cont'd)\n               It's not as good as yours, I'll admit.\n               But then again you've got an ear for\n               accents. Accents, dressing up in\n               costumes...\n\n     Maybe a trace of fear in her eyes...\n\n                          BUCKY (cont'd)\n               Do another one for me. Play someone else.\n               Rich little slut...Lez...Daddy's\n               girl...Dahlia...Play someone else. Do\n               another.\n\n<b>                          MADELEINE\n</b>               I don't know what you're talking about--\n\n     He cocks the gun.\n\n<b>                          BUCKY\n</b>               How 'bout the Mexican accent you used\n               when you hired the private dick to track\n               down Lee. Let's see the make-up job.\n               Let's see the fucking dress, mamacita,\n               that you wore when you chased after poor\n               daddy's money. Tell me something--you\n               shoot Lee yourself?\n\n     She steps back against the door as he advances.\n\n                          BUCKY (cont'd)\n               Did you at least have the guts to shoot\n               him yourself?\n\n     He puts the gun to her forehead.\n\n<b>                          MADELEINE\n</b>               You'll never do it. Never. Remember...I\n               look like her.\n\n     She grins wickedly.\n\n     He pulls the gun from her head and shoots her in the kneecap.\n\n<b>     EXT.

THE COURTHOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n     Madeleine led away amongst a flock of photographers. Her\n     family linked arm-and-arm in the background, crying, only\n     Martha looking like she might survive...\n\n                          VOICE OVER (cont'd)\n               Her story's enough to get her a psych tag\n               as a delusional schizophrenic and ten\n               years at Atascadero State Hospital.\n\n<b>     INT.
