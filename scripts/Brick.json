I hope\n                    everything I wrote in the note I dropped\n                    at Gary Trueman's office this morning is\n                    wrong. About your and Brad's involvement\n                    in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't\n                    steal the brick last night. In your\n                    purse.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              LAURA\n</b>                        (breathes)\n                    I didn't.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              BRENDAN\n</b>                    That's good. That means you didn't let\n                    me walk into a slaughterhouse. You\n                    didn't lead Tug and the Pin and their\n                    crews to the slaughter. And when Trueman\n                    reads the note, takes my cue and\n                    searches your locker, he won't find a\n                    damn thing.\n<b>          \n</b>          Something changes in Laura's eyes.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          EXT.

She looks as if she has been punched in\n          the face.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              LAURA\n</b>                        (murmurs)\n                    Brendan... don't...\n<b>          \n</b><b>                               BRENDAN\n</b>                        (gently)\n                    It's done.\n<b>          \n</b>          Her face does strange things, subtle contortions.\n          She watches his eyes.

Well. That's most of it. 9 out of\n                    10. I told Em to tell Tug it was his.\n                    Told her it would soften him up. She\n                    said she wished she could keep it, but\n                    she didn't love the father. I was going\n                    to drive her down the next day, we'd\n                    found a doctor. Most wouldn't. She was\n                    starting to show. 3 months.

Closer.\n          Right up against him.\n<b>          \n</b>          She brings her head to his, puts her lips to his ear,\n          breathes warm breath, and says two words.
