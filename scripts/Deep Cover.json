Another GUNSHOT, then:\n\n               His father comes out the door clutching money in one hand. \n               He strides toward the car with a reckless pride.

She looks up, bats her lashes at Hull.\n\n<b>                                     BLONDE WOMAN\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         You want my advice, I'd stay away \n                         from that bitch.\n\n               She opens the door to the room across the hall. A dump. Hull \n               walks in, drops his duffle: he'll take it. The Blonde lounges \n               in the doorway. He closes the door.\n\n<b>               INT. ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n               Hull empties his pockets on the dresser. Looks at his money, \n               room key, identification. Looks at himself in the mirror. He \n               touches his clothes, his face, tries on different expressions.\n\n               (NOTE: Throughout the film, Hull continually checks himself \n               out in mirrors, both to adjust his appearance to the \n               circumstances and as if in an attempt to recall who he \n               \"really\" is.)\n\n<b>               EXT. 79TH AND FIGUEROA - TWILIGHT\n</b>\n               On the seam between South-Central and USC.

ANOTHER, SIMILAR CORNER - DAY\n</b>\n               Dealers (most in mid-teens) meeting cars, making transactions. \n               All this casually observed. EDDIE comes up the street, \n               reciting his version of an old street toast.\n\n<b>                                     EDDIE\n</b>                         On the day of the King's castration, \n                         all the counts and no accounts were \n                         down on the deck with Georgia Tech \n                         taking turns in the back seat...\n\n               Those dealers not at car windows, gather around. He never \n               speaks to them, goes on declaiming as he exchanges drugs for \n               money.\n\n               Hull watches, talking to another street person. His appearance \n               continues to change: clothes, posture, walk, gestures subtly \n               conform to the environment, a bit like Zelig. Throughout the \n               film his appearance shifts, depending on who he's with. We \n               always recognize him, but each time he's different.\n\n               He walks up to a dealer, makes a quick buy and keeps going. \n               But he sees them and is seen.\n\n<b>               INT.

He \n               sees Hull, pretends to fire, laughs as Hull, too, ducks. \n               When Ivy's gone, he runs to where a CROWD has gathered \n               around...\n\n<b>               THE 13-YEAR-OLD\n</b>\n               lying in the street, a bullet hole in his head, eyes open. \n               He twitches and kicks, blood pulsing from the neat wound. \n               Then he's dead. The faces around him (young, old, many races) \n               watch with a variety of emotions.\n\n<b>                                     CROWD\n</b>                         Who is he?...

The sound \n               reverberates through the room.

Through a one-\n               way window they see:\n\n<b>               BETTY\n</b>\n               alone in the cell, unaware she's being watched.\n\n<b>                                     CARVER\n</b>                         Go back to work, she walks out of \n                         here. Otherwise, she's up on multiple \n                         counts, and I'll see to it the judge \n                         runs them consecutively.\n\n               Hull just looks at him. Carver shrugs apologetically.\n\n<b>               INT. ANOTHER ROOM\n</b>\n               Absolutely white. Not a window, not a stick of furniture. \n               The only deviation is Hull in prison blues.\n\n               The door opens, Betty comes in wearing prison yellows. She \n               sits on a nearly invisible chair. They know they're being \n               watched.\n\n<b>                                     MCCUTCHEON\n</b>                         They want me to testify against you. \n                         I said I wouldn't.\n\n<b>                                     HULL\n</b>                         You have to. It's all set up. That's \n                         how you're getting off.\n\n               She shakes her head in cynical understanding. How difficult \n               it is to get back to an honorable life.\n\n               He takes her hand.\n\n<b>                                     HULL\n</b>                              (continuing; with \n                              difficulty)\n                         My father didn't have a heart attack.\n\n               She looks at him.\n\n<b>                                     HULL\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         He was shot robbing a liquor store. \n                         Trying to rob it. I lied about that.\n\n<b>                                     MCCUTCHEON\n</b>                         Baby, why are you telling me this?\n\n<b>                                     HULL\n</b>                         I had to start somewhere... There're \n                         other things you don't know...\n\n<b>               AN IRIS SHOT - HULL AND BETTY\n</b>\n               Silent. Kissing. Beginning to make love. Hull extracts \n               himself, gives the finger to the POV and stuffs a bit of \n               tissue in the iris, blocking our view.\n\n<b>               EXT. ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n               Carver takes his eye from the now obscured peephole.\n\n<b>               EXT. A CEMETERY - DAY\n</b>\n               A funeral. Taft's wife and children (from the wallet photo) \n               leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party.\n\n               When everyone is gone, Hull approaches the grave. From his \n               pocket, he removes the four blood-soaked bills his father \n               gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that \n               already cover the plot.\n\n               He's silent a moment, then he gets up. He joins Carver who's \n               standing with Hull's children. The kids each take his hand, \n               they walk together.\n\n<b>                                     CARVER\n</b>                         Betty walked out of court free this \n                         morning.

He likes a good joke. Hull \n               punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees.\n\n<b>                                     HULL\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         The nigger's the one who'd even think \n                         about doing what you tell him.\n\n               He walks away. Still on his knees, doubled over, Carver \n               whispers after him:\n\n<b>                                     CARVER\n</b>                         Don't blow your cover.\n\n<b>               FADE OUT.\n</b>\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Deep-Cover.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Deep Cover</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Michael Tolkin\" title=\"Scripts by Michael Tolkin\">Michael Tolkin</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Henry Bean\" title=\"Scripts by Henry Bean\">Henry Bean</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Deep Cover Script.html#comments\" title=\"Deep Cover comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:03:31.363668"}
