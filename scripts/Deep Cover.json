CLEVELAND STREET - NIGHT (1970)\n\n               Rain. Christmas lights. A rusted out '56 Lincoln rattles \n               down the bleak boulevard. In it: JOE STEVENS, an angry, black \n               man in his late 20's, beside him his 10-year-old son, JOE \n               JR.\n\n               Joe Jr. stares out the window at passing: boarded buildings, \n               whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a \n               john, a black Santa, a knot of drinkers. Breaking the silence:\n\n                                     JOE STEVENS\n                         Your mother okay?\n\n                                     JOE JR.\n                         Yes, sir.\n\n               They stop at a light. Joe Stevens tries to furtively snort a \n               little something. He spots Joe Jr. watching.\n\n                                     JOE STEVENS\n                              (firm, without irony)\n                         Don't you do this shit, boy. Don't \n                         you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear \n                         me?\n\n               Joe Jr. stares, silent; Joe Jr.'s about to hit him.\n\n                                     JOE STEVENS\n                              (continuing)\n                         You hear me, goddam it?\n\n               The boy nods. Satisfied, Joe Sr. draws in the stuff. It makes \n               him feel good, strong, worried and determined all at once.\n\n                                     JOE STEVENS\n                              (continuing; charged \n                              up)\n                         What do you want for Christmas?\n\n                                     JOE JR.\n                         I don't know.\n\n                                     JOE STEVENS\n                              (light changes; he \n                              accelerates)\n                         You don't know?? You gotta know what \n                         you want, boy, if you ever expect to \n                         get it.\n\n               A sudden charm to his bravado. Joe Jr. smiles uncertainly. \n               Joe Sr. grins back, pulls up in front of a liquor store.\n\n                                     JOE STEVENS\n                              (continuing)\n                         Wait here. This won't take a minute.\n\n               Joe Jr. doesn't notice or doesn't remark that his father, \n               just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath \n               his coat.\n\n               The boy gazes dreamily at the street. The lunatic Black Santa \n               marches by, ranting to himself (\"Then the white man say...\"). \n               The RAIN HAMMERS on the roof and windshield. Joe Jr. breathes \n               on the glass, fogging the scene.\n\n               From the store: MUFFLED GUNFIRE.\n\n               Joe Jr. looks that way. Another GUNSHOT, then:\n\n               His father comes out the door clutching money in one hand. \n               He strides toward the car with a reckless pride. He doesn't \n               notice:\n\n               The liquor store door opens behind him.\n\n               A SHOTGUN BLAST. Joe Stevens' guts splatter onto the car \n               windshield. A look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his \n               knees.\n\n                                     JOE JR.\n                         Daddy!!\n\n               He jumps from the car, kneels by his father.\n\n               The STORE OWNER (47, Slavic) drags the gun toward them, \n               bleeding profusely.\n\n                                     STORE OWNER\n                              (enraged, almost to \n                              tears)\n                         Fuckin' niggers... fuckin' niggers...\n\n               JOE STEVENS\n\n               looks at the money in his hand: two 20's, two 5's.\n\n                                     JOE STEVENS\n                         Fifty bucks... fifty goddam bucks.\n                              (looks up at his son)\n                         I'm sorry...\n\n               He stuffs the blood-soaked bills in the boy's shirt pocket \n               and dies. Joe Jr. looks up at...\n\n               THE STORE OWNER\n\n               Bloody, nearly unconscious, he aims the shotgun at the boy \n               who is too frightened to move.\n\n                                     JOE JR.\n                         Please, Mister...\n\n               The man dies on his feet. As he falls backward, he pulls the \n               trigger, the BLAST shattering the car windows.\n\n               Cop cars SQUEAL up. Uniformed cops leap out, guns drawn, \n               survey the scene. Then one notices Joe Jr., staring motionless \n               at his father and the store owner, dead together. ON HIS \n               EYES:\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               THOSE SAME EYES\n\n               -- but older, harder, colder. They're concentrating on a \n               paper before him.\n\n               TITLE: 17 YEARS LATER\n\n               CLOSEUP - THE MINNESOTA MULTIPHASIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY\n\n               Hundreds of TRUE/FALSE questions...\n\n               1.)

(T/F)\n\n               3.) When I was young I occasionally stole things. (T/F)\n\n               Joe Stevens marks these TRUE, FALSE, FALSE then comes to:\n\n               4.) A person's station in life is at least partially \n               determined by his race. (T/F) We are:\n\n               INT. A ROOM - DAY\n\n               Thirty-seven Black Cleveland police officers (many in uniform, \n               including Joe) are taking the MMPI. Some roll their eyes at \n               the questions. Some try to copy answers. Others, like Joe, \n               work with rapid concentration.\n\n               But he gets stuck on #4. Marks it false. Erases it. Marks it \n               true. Erases that. Ponders. Goes on to: #5. At times I hear \n               so well it bothers me. (T/F) He marks that true.\n\n               INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY\n\n               GERALD CARVER, 36, an ambitious government lawyer with a \n               relaxed, vaguely hip manner, looks over the file of the \n               ingratiating BLACK OFFICER sitting across the desk from him.\n\n                                     CARVER\n                         Officer Leland? You know the \n                         difference between a black man and \n                         nigger?\n\n               Leland is startled, insulted, but doesn't want to blow the \n               interview. He smiles weakly, shakes his head no.\n\n                                     CARVER\n                              (continuing; pleasant \n                              smile)\n                         Yeah, most niggers don't.\n\n               Stung, Leland tries to laugh. Carver puts his file aside, \n               picks up another.\n\n                                     CARVER\n                              (continuing)\n                         Nice to meet you.\n\n               INT. SAME - ANOTHER INTERVIEW\n\n               A SECOND BLACK OFFICER is powerfully built, politically \n               conscious, takes no shit. Carver's leafing through his file.\n\n                                     CARVER\n                         So, Winston, what's the difference \n                         between a black man and a nigger?\n\n               Winston is out of his chair before the question is finished, \n               drags Carver by the shirt front halfway across the desk and \n               hisses into his face:\n\n                                     WINSTON\n                         Who the fuck do you think you're \n                         talking to?\n\n               Carver smiles cheerfully past Winston's cocked fist.\n\n                                     CARVER\n                         Thanks for coming in.\n\n               Nonplussed by this cool dismissal, Winston stalks out. Carver \n               picks up the next file, unfazed.\n\n               INT. SAME - ANOTHER INTERVIEW\n\n               Joe Stevens watches Carver reading his file and waiting for \n               an answer. When none is forthcoming, Carver glances up, finds \n               Stevens looking right back at him.\n\n                                     STEVENS\n                         The nigger's the one who falls for \n                         your bullshit.\n\n               He says it pleasantly, without belligerence. Carver smiles: \n               he's found his man. He offers his hand.\n\n                                     CARVER\n                         Gerald Carver, United States District \n                         Attorney. Call me Gerry.\n\n               INT. A DARKENED ROOM - DAY/NIGHT\n\n               ON A TV SCREEN: a grainy black-and-white tape, date and time \n               stamped at the bottom. A grungy street, palm trees. The light \n               from the monitor dimly illuminates Carver and Stevens.\n\n               On SCREEN the CAMERA finds: A MAN in jeans, sneakers and \n               sweatshirt on a street corner.\n\n                                     STEVENS\n                         He ought to be wearing a sign.\n\n                                     CARVER\n                         You can tell he's a cop?\n\n               Stevens laughs: it's obvious.\n\n               A real DRUG DEALER joins the cop. UNDERCOVER COP: \"You got \n               it?\" DEALER: \"In the motel, right over here...\" The Cop's \n               uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the CAMERA as they go.\n\n                                     STEVENS\n                         He keeps looking for his back-up. \n                         Now, the other guy knows it, too.\n\n                                     CARVER\n                         Then why's he taking him to the room?\n\n                                     STEVENS\n                              (why else?)\n                         To rip him off.\n\n               Carver studies Stevens in the darkness, impressed.\n\n               ON SCREEN: The figures disappear into the motel. We hear \n               their voices. DEALER: \"Here, try some of it.\" UNDERCOVER \n               COP: \"Uhh... No, I don't...\" DEALER: \"Why not, you \n               sonofabitch?\" Two bursts of SOUND DISTORTION.\n\n               A plainclothes cop, TAFT, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts \n               from behind the CAMERA, sprints toward the motel. The CAMERA \n               wobbles after him.\n\n                                     STEVENS\n                              (continuing)\n                         Too late.\n\n               ON SCREEN: The CAMERA (jerky, hand-held) nears the open motel \n               door. Taft is bent over the Undercover Cop's body.\n\n                                     TAFT\n                         Oh, Bobby...

Carver pushes the \n               pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of Taft's \n               face.\n\n                                     STEVENS\n                              (focussed on Taft)\n                         Who is he?\n\n                                     CARVER\n                         Charles Taft.

The jungle \n                         was mostly flats...\n\n               They pass an open door where a 6-year-old boy, JAMES, a \n               latchkey, sits on the stoop playing Gameboy; inside, his \n               mother, BELINDA, a broken down whore, is doing her nails and \n               drinking Pepsi. She looks up, bats her lashes at Hull.\n\n                                     BLONDE WOMAN\n                              (continuing)\n                         You want my advice, I'd stay away \n                         from that bitch.\n\n               She opens the door to the room across the hall. A dump. Hull \n               walks in, drops his duffle: he'll take it. The Blonde lounges \n               in the doorway. He closes the door.\n\n               INT. ROOM - DAY\n\n               Hull empties his pockets on the dresser. Looks at his money, \n               room key, identification. Looks at himself in the mirror. He \n               touches his clothes, his face, tries on different expressions.\n\n               (NOTE: Throughout the film, Hull continually checks himself \n               out in mirrors, both to adjust his appearance to the \n               circumstances and as if in an attempt to recall who he \n               \"really\" is.)\n\n               EXT. 79TH AND FIGUEROA - TWILIGHT\n\n               On the seam between South-Central and USC. Lots of people \n               out: children, students, dealers, whores. Hull with a new \n               haircut.\n\n               EXT. ANOTHER, SIMILAR CORNER - DAY\n\n               Dealers (most in mid-teens) meeting cars, making transactions. \n               All this casually observed. EDDIE comes up the street, \n               reciting his version of an old street toast.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         On the day of the King's castration, \n                         all the counts and no accounts were \n                         down on the deck with Georgia Tech \n                         taking turns in the back seat...\n\n               Those dealers not at car windows, gather around. He never \n               speaks to them, goes on declaiming as he exchanges drugs for \n               money.\n\n               Hull watches, talking to another street person. His appearance \n               continues to change: clothes, posture, walk, gestures subtly \n               conform to the environment, a bit like Zelig. Throughout the \n               film his appearance shifts, depending on who he's with. We \n               always recognize him, but each time he's different.\n\n               He walks up to a dealer, makes a quick buy and keeps going. \n               But he sees them and is seen.\n\n               INT. AN OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n               Hull drops eleven foil balls on a green blotter. Carver counts \n               out money for him.\n\n               INT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n               He sits at the window, eating a burrito, watching little \n               James play in the courtyard.\n\n               EXT. STREET - EVENING\n\n               Hull approaches another Dealer, the 13-year-old seen earlier \n               (angelic face). Like Hull, he's trying to act tough.\n\n                                     HULL\n                         Whatta you got?\n\n                                     13-YEAR-OLD DEALER\n                              (voice just changing)\n                         Nickel rock, dime rock. Excellent \n                         shit.\n\n               Hull exchanges a folded twenty for two foil balls. He walks \n               off. He has gone twenty feet when...\n\n               RED RANGE ROVER\n\n               SQUEALS to a stop opposite the Dealer.\n\n               A huge young black man, IVY (23, all in red with a red \n               headband), leans out the passenger window, shouting at the \n               13-year-old.\n\n                                     IVY\n                         What the fuck I tell you about being \n                         here?\n\n               Everyone turns to look, but Hull's view is blocked.\n\n                                     13-YEAR-OLD DEALER (O.S.)\n                         No, wait...\n\n                                     IVY (O.S.)\n                         Too fuckin' late.\n\n               POPPING noises. Ivy is waving an automatic weapon. Everyone \n               on the street but Hull has hit the ground.\n\n                                     IVY\n                              (enjoying it, shouting)\n                         Get down, motherfuckers!\n\n               Ivy laughs and fondles a girlfriend as the car ROARS off. He \n               sees Hull, pretends to fire, laughs as Hull, too, ducks. \n               When Ivy's gone, he runs to where a CROWD has gathered \n               around...\n\n               THE 13-YEAR-OLD\n\n               lying in the street, a bullet hole in his head, eyes open. \n               He twitches and kicks, blood pulsing from the neat wound. \n               Then he's dead. The faces around him (young, old, many races) \n               watch with a variety of emotions.\n\n                                     CROWD\n                         Who is he?... Why'd they shoot him?... \n                         Ivy did him, man... He's in the wrong \n                         fuckin' place... That poor boy... \n                         Get his beeper...\n\n               Cops push through to the body. As the crowd disperses, Hull \n               can't take his eyes off the boy. When he finally does, he \n               sees Eddie, drink in hand. Their eyes meet, and Eddie, a \n               rapper, raises his eyebrows in brief acknowledgment of sorrow.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                              (sadly)\n                         He done done, ain't he?\n\n               EXT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT\n\n               TITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER\n\n               A bar with a neon bird for a sign. Hull enters.\n\n               INT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT\n\n               A racial mix. Hull takes a seat at the bar. Stuffed birds \n               line the lintel above the bottles. A female BARTENDER (long \n               red nails) greets him familiarly.\n\n                                     BARTENDER\n                         How's it going, John?\n\n                                     HULL\n                         I'm in there.\n\n               Without being asked, she sets him up a Dry Sack with a long \n               red straw. (NOTE: He never touches the drink.) Hull's \n               appearance has continued to change. His clothes have become \n               flashier, he has an earring, the start of a goatee.\n\n               Eddie approaches the bar compulsively reciting one of his \n               toasts.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                              (to himself)\n                         \"Where's the Queen,\" said the King. \n                         \"She's in bed with laryngitis.\" \"Is \n                         that bastard still in town?...

He notices Hull, greets him as someone he \n               can't place but knows he's seen around.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                              (continuing)\n                         How you doin', Dudley...\n\n               Tries to remember name.\n\n                                     HULL\n                         John.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         John, man, right...\n\n               Clasp hands. Eddie takes his drinks, carries them to...\n\n               A TABLE\n\n               where he rejoins a white man, DAVID ELIAS (30s, slick, \n               powerful) and a well-dressed BLACK WOMAN (mid-20s, good-\n               looking). She gets the wine.\n\n               Elias rises to let her out. As the woman passes Hull on her \n               way to the restrooms, their eyes meet: an instant of perfect \n               chemistry. He's struck. Her features open, grow sensual for \n               a moment, but then, as if seeing something she doesn't like, \n               her eyes flick away, and she walks by as if he weren't there.\n\n               INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n               (NOTE: Hull invariably meets Carver in this anonymous room, \n               distinguished only by the green blotter and a view of the \n               city. This simple regularity suggest visits to a psychiatrist, \n               Carver probing, testing, teasing, trying to draw Hull out. \n               And they feel like therapy, at once a respite and a torment.)\n\n               More foil balls on the blotter beside boxes of 3x5 \n               photographs. Photos of Eddie and David Elias are up on a \n               corkboard, the beginning of a pyramid.\n\n                                     HULL\n                         Eddie something... a motormouth... \n                         he supplies the street dealers... \n                         buys from him...\n                              (reads name on back \n                              of photo)\n                         David Elias... who apparently buys \n                         from a guy named Barbolla or \n                         something.

CRACK HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Virtual darkness save splinters of light between the curtains. \n               Pipes burn here and there in the gloom. Ten or fifteen \n               crackheads huddle around a battery-operated TV on which Tom \n               Brokaw is narrating an NBC documentary on drugs. A 12-year-\n               old sits against a wall too stoned even for television.\n\n               Hull approaches Eddie, regally installed on an automobile \n               bench seat-cum-sofa, a lit pipe in one hand. We barely notice \n               the redhead kneeling between his legs, face buried in his \n               crotch. He greets Hull from wrecked bliss. They know each \n               other now.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         My man, Dudley, he's so fud-ley...\n\n               Hull greets Eddie, some of the others, drops familiarly onto \n               an adjacent auto seat.

Hull's carrying a satchel and wearing \n               a new leather jacket.\n\n               INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY\n\n               As they go in, Elias switches the OPEN sign to CLOSED and \n               turns the latch. The store is filled with Latin American \n               folk art, particularly masks which line the walls.\n\n               BETTY STONE, the woman Hull saw with Elias at the bar, comes \n               out from the back. She is 27, a bad girl trying to dress the \n               way she thinks a banker who went to Vassar dresses for \n               success. She's also a little strung out.\n\n               She and Hull recognize each other at once, (a brief reprise \n               of that moment of perfect chemistry) but she avoids his gaze.\n\n                                     ELIAS\n                         Betty, this is John, my new associate.\n\n                                     MCCUTCHEON\n                         Your new Eddie.

John's going to be a \n                         good customer. He does a lot of wash.\n\n               Hull puts the satchel on a display case. Betty still won't \n               look at him, opens the satchel, begins a quick count. She \n               does this with a speed and sureness that suggests high test \n               scores.\n\n                                     HULL\n                         So how's this place work?\n\n               Betty doesn't answer, so Elias covers the awkwardness.\n\n                                     ELIAS\n                         Betty wires the money to a store in \n                         Aruba in payment for things they \n                         never sent her.

That way it doesn't \n                         turn up as income for the IRS.

Despite the \n               seeming contradiction, she finds this even more attractive. \n               But because she feels herself to be bad, his goodness seems \n               only a judgment against her, and so she thinks she hates \n               him.\n\n                                     MCCUTCHEON\n                         Who is he, my mother?\n\n                                     HULL\n                              (smiles)\n                         Never have, never will.\n\n               Betty ignores him, does her lines.\n\n                                     MCCUTCHEON\n                              (taunting Hull)\n                         Oooh...

Elias double parks \n               by two prostitutes.\n\n               We STAY in the car with Hull who's silent, frightened, keeps \n               trying to warm his hands.\n\n               Outside, Elias is talking and laughing with the prostitutes. \n               We see them point. He gives them money, kisses. They laugh. \n               He gets back in the car.\n\n               EXT. A DANCE CLUB - NIGHT\n\n               The Range Rover parked in front. Elias's car stops. MUSIC \n               pounds from inside. Then one CONTINUOUS SHOT:\n\n               They pass the club, other store fronts... Turn at the \n               corner... Turn into an alley... Down the alley past the same \n               buildings... The rear door of the club... To the next \n               street... Turn... Turn... onto the original street, back to \n               the front of the club.

With an air of submitting \n               himself to fate, he gets out and walks into the club.\n\n               INT. CLUB - NIGHT\n\n               Crowded and BOOMING and strobe lit. Hull pays the cover and \n               climbs a staircase to a...\n\n               CIRCULAR BALCONY\n\n               that overlooks the dance floor. On stage: a RAP ACT with its \n               throbbing beat and below Hull a sea of dancers.\n\n               Hull circles the balcony. It isn't hard to pick out Ivy -- \n               he's all in red, dancing with the woman we saw him with in \n               the Range Rover the first time.\n\n               Hull reaches the steps again and starts down, keeping his \n               eye on Ivy. The number ends. In the pause before the next \n               one, Ivy can be seen excusing himself, heading toward the \n               rear of the club.\n\n               The next number begins. People dance. Hull pushes his way \n               through the dancers to...\n\n               INT. REAR OF CLUB - A SHORT HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               leading toward the rear door they saw from the alley.\n\n               MOVING DOWN THE HALL\n\n               A woman's room. A men's room. Hull goes into...\n\n               INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Ivy is pissing into a urinal. He's so huge he seems to take \n               up all the space in the tiny room. Hull stares at him, unable \n               to look away.\n\n               He notices Hull. All dialogue is UNDER the POUNDING MUSIC.\n\n                                     IVY\n                         What're you looking at?\n\n               Hull stares at Ivy's face.

Hull doesn't \n               move.\n\n                                     IVY\n                              (continuing; \n                              recognizing him)\n                         Oh, I know you.

Hull holds it \n               closed with his back.\n\n                                     IVY\n                              (continuing)\n                         I gotta take care of you, too, huh?\n\n               He reaches into his pants for the butt of a gun.\n\n               Hull is frozen.\n\n               Ivy starts to draw it out.\n\n               Hull steps forward, grabs Ivy's gun arm. With his other hand \n               he clumsily pulls a silenced .22 from inside his jacket, \n               puts it in the underside of Ivy's jaw and SHOOTS twice. Ivy's \n               brains spray upward onto the wall, and he slides straight to \n               the floor. Hull steps out into...\n\n               INT. SHORT HALL - NIGHT\n\n               An Hispanic busboy coming out of the kitchen sees him and \n               the gun in his hand, freezes.\n\n               Hull walks past him and out the back door. From inside we \n               see Hull go down three steps, stumble in the drive and fall \n               to his knees, the gun CLATTERING away from him.\n\n               A couple that had been making out, stops, looks.\n\n               It takes Hull a moment to gather himself. He picks up the \n               gun, gets into Elias's car. It drives away.\n\n               INT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Alone, he looks at his face in the mirror. As if he doesn't \n               know the person there.\n\n               With a knife, he draws out something hidden inside the wooden \n               backing of the mirror. A manila envelope. He empties it onto \n               the dresser:\n\n               Mementos among which we see, carefully preserved, the blood-\n               soaked bills his father gave him. Hull ignores them and picks \n               up...\n\n               PHOTO OF HIS CHILDREN\n\n               He smooths out the folds, stares at it as if trying to fix \n               this in his thoughts.\n\n               EXT.

It's torment. Finally \n               she's released by a KNOCK on the door. She goes out to...\n\n               THE FRONT OF THE STORE\n\n               Lets in Elias.

THAT ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Very different from the club. A comfortable room with a bar, \n               tables, filled with men much older than the dancers below. \n               Barbosa and Gopher at the bar with Elias and Hull.

Barbosa covers them with \n               his own. ON THE HANDS: Barbosa's broad, muscular with thick \n               gold rings and a Rolex; Elias's paler, slighter, a wedding \n               band and a slim watch.\n\n                                     BARBOSA\n                              (continuing)\n                         Slap my hands. Just slap them.\n\n               Elias looks Barbosa in the eye. He's trying to be a snake, \n               but he's more the mouse. He looks away and as he does tries \n               to...\n\n               Slap him with both hands but hits only...\n\n               Air. The room breathes. Barbosa turns his rings so the big \n               surfaces point down.\n\n                                     BARBOSA\n                              (continuing)\n                         Now it's my turn.\n\n                                     GOPHER\n                         It's Barbosa's turn.

First to four wins, like the \n                         World Series.\n\n               Elias covers Barbosa's palms with his own.\n\n                                     GOPHER\n                         Oh, God, I can't look.\n\n               ON THE HANDS: Barbosa tenses his hands. Elias yanks back. \n               Barbosa's hands haven't moved.\n\n                                     BARBOSA\n                         You remember the rules? If you flinch, \n                         I get to hit you.\n\n               He slaps Elias across the face. Hull starts forward. A knife \n               appears. He stops.\n\n                                     BARBOSA\n                              (continuing)\n                         Again, shmuck.\n\n               Elias covers Barbosa's hands. Barbosa tenses. Elias holds \n               firm, and Barbosa quickly slaps both hands, hard. Elias \n               doubles over, holding his hands in pain.\n\n                                     GOPHER\n                         One.\n\n                                     ELIAS\n                         That was two.\n\n                                     BARBOSA\n                         No, this is two.\n\n               He slaps him again, a stinging crack. Elias looks to Hull, \n               but they're across a canyon. Hull lowers his eyes.\n\n                                     GOPHER\n                         Oh, and it hurts. Mercy, it hurts.\n\n               ON THE HANDS. Barbosa moves his hands a millimeter, and Elias \n               flinches again. Barbosa smacks him across the face. The sound \n               reverberates through the room. Now even Gopher is silent. \n               Tears run from Elias's eyes, blood from his mouth, but he \n               doesn't move.\n\n                                     GOPHER\n                              (continuing)\n                         Three.\n\n                                     A VOICE\n                         Felix! No mas. Finito.\n\n               A MAN\n\n               steps forward out of the shadows. He is young, mid-30's, \n               handsome, European features, beautifully dressed, accompanied \n               by a guard we'll know as MOLTO.

Their eyes meet.\n\n                                     GOPHER\n                         The fight is over!

Barbosa resumes the stance, then \n               waits, waits, waits, and finally brings both hands down, \n               terribly hard, the sound of the slap is awful.\n\n                                     BARBOSA\n                         Four.\n\n                                     HULL\n                         Okay, that's it. Get away.\n\n               Hull leads Elias to the door right past Gallegos. Their gazes \n               meet again. As they go out they hear Gallegos BERATING Barbosa \n               in furious Spanish.\n\n               INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT\n\n               Trembling, Elias holds his bloody hands against his chest, \n               as Hull leads him in silence down the steps.\n\n                                     ELIAS\n                         Look at me. Look at me, damn it!\n\n               He barely whispers, but it's like a shout. Hull, who'd been \n               avoiding his gaze, forces himself to look. Elias's humiliation \n               is so profound it almost ennobles him. Finally:\n\n                                     HULL\n                         Why did you do it?\n\n                                     ELIAS\n                         I needed it. They taught me what I \n                         needed to know. That I'm not part of \n                         them, and I never will be. That they \n                         don't respect me. That I don't deserve \n                         respect. Because I'm a shmuck, John. \n                         I'm a shmuck...\n\n               He laughs a terrible laugh. The door behind them opens, and \n               Barbosa appears with Gopher. Everyone is ready for death, \n               but:\n\n                                     BARBOSA\n                         David, I'm sorry. It's a crazy time, \n                         and... you know... I'm doing a little \n                         too much coca... I'll buy your kid a \n                         pony... anything you want... Let's \n                         forget about it.\n\n               He comes down the stairs, offers his hand.

Hernandez slumps against the wheel. \n               The woman screams. Molto walks away.\n\n               EXT. AN APARTMENT COMPLEX/INT. BETTY'S APARTMENT - DAWN\n\n               Hull finds a door, pushes the buzzer. Betty looks through \n               the glass. She's afraid of him.\n\n                                     MCCUTCHEON\n                         Don't kill me. I'm not going to talk. \n                         I swear. Please.\n\n               Then she looks closer and sees not murder in his face, but \n               need. She opens the door. Without a word, he gathers her to \n               him. She can't resist him now. Her mouth is everywhere on \n               him.\n\n               INT. HER BEDROOM - DAWN\n\n               Betty gasping in the wake of pleasure, turning her face away \n               from him, she feels so exposed.\n\n                                     MCCUTCHEON\n                         Don't look...\n\n               She hides her face in his neck.\n\n               INT. SAME - LATER\n\n               They lie in each other's arms, relaxed together for the first \n               time. A wonderful, unprotected openness.\n\n                                     HULL\n                              (softly)\n                         Tell me about you.\n\n                                     MCCUTCHEON\n                              (half-kidding)\n                         Everything worth knowing you just \n                         found you.\n\n               He laughs. They begin to make love again. Suddenly: AN EXTRA \n               HAND stroking Betty's hair. She gasps. A gun in Hull's ear. \n               Another in her face. Guns all around.\n\n                                     HULL\n                         Don't hurt her.\n\n               Hands pull him out of bed, leave her there alone. We see \n               Molto, two or three others.\n\n               EXT. A CEMETERY - MORNING\n\n               RAMON GALLEGOS lays a bouquet of white lillies on a grave. \n               He kneels, whispers a prayer, crosses himself.\n\n               He rises and walks to where Molto and the other guards hold \n               Hull and Elias. Gallegos is in his thirties, more European \n               than Barbosa. He has a distinctly mild manner.\n\n                                     ELIAS\n                         Who's grave?\n\n               An impudent question, but Elias seems strangely bright-eyed \n               despite the guns held on him.\n\n                                     GALLEGOS\n                         My wife's. She died of leukemia three \n                         years ago.\n                              (looks around)\n                         I like to be among the dead.

He \n                         grew up. He made himself strong and \n                         rich, but getting there made him \n                         sick, and that killed him. So he \n                         lost everything for the same reason \n                         he'd gotten it in the first place. \n                         Now we'll see if you can do as well.\n\n               A PRIEST going by greets Gallegos who responds warmly. They \n               chat a minute in SPANISH.

Unembarrassed, he fingers it.\n\n                                     GALLEGOS\n                              (continuing)\n                         Cute... Can I have that?\n\n               Without waiting for an answer, he yanks it out of Hull's ear \n               and walks away, leaving Hull bleeding through his fingers \n               before a stone cross.\n\n               EXT. A GHETTO STREET - NIGHT\n\n               A club on the corner. THROUGH A WINDOW we see a RAP ACT on \n               the stage, their MUSIC pumping out onto the street. Hull \n               pulls up in a Jaguar. He and Elias go through a door adjacent \n               to the club.\n\n               INT. BUILDING HALL/INT. GOPHER'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The MUSIC is still audible here, though muffled. Elias and \n               Hull are pushing at door Gopher is trying to hold closed.\n\n                                     GOPHER\n                         I don't want you in here.

I don't \n                         want to have anything to do with \n                         you.\n\n               Elias kicks it open, and they enter Gopher's tiny, miserable \n               domain. He's wearing some sort of negligee and an immense \n               naked woman fills his bed. We still hear the MUFFLED MUSIC.\n\n                                     GOPHER\n                              (continuing; apoplectic)\n                         I'm a sixty-three-year-old man!

The lawyer is \n               up on his feet, but Hull shoves him around as Elias politely \n               explains to the clients that this will only take a moment.\n\n               TIGHT ON SATCHEL\n\n               Hull's hands thrust more money in.

I'd have to \n                         confirm everything, of course. Do \n                         you have a sample of the product?\n\n               Elias produces one. Guzman gestures to Molto. Molto samples \n               it. Molto's eyes widen.\n\n                                     MOLTO\n                         Buy it!\n\n                                     GUZMAN\n                         Where is our money?\n\n               Elias hands him a key, points to a different Winnebago. Molto \n               takes the key, unlocks the back: money. He signals okay to \n               Guzman.\n\n               Suddenly: SIRENS. Police cars wail into the garage. The THWACK-\n               THWACK and sweeping light of a helicopter descend toward the \n               roof (though we never see the copter).\n\n                                     GUZMAN\n                              (continuing; anger)\n                         You set this up.\n\n                                     HULL\n                         They're after us, not you.\n\n               Everybody scatters. The garage is a labyrinth of cement \n               stairwells, ramps, hundreds of RVs to hide between, under \n               and so forth... Lots of NOISE, lights, but mostly we see \n               Hull and Elias dodging here, avoiding the action.\n\n               INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARAGE - NIGHT\n\n               Molto caught between the lights. He draws his gun. GUNFIRE. \n               He's cut down.\n\n                                     TAFT\n                              (screaming)\n                         Where are the rest of them?\n\n               EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT\n\n               Cars with rotating dome lights, but not many cops.\n\n               Hull and Elias emerge from a shadowy doorway and make their \n               way at a casual pace beyond the perimeter of police cars, \n               quickly mingling with other spectators. They continue down...\n\n               EXT. A QUIET SIDE STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Strolling now. Elias elated, uncontained joy.\n\n                                     ELIAS\n                         We did it. Twenty million. Twenty \n                         fucking million.

Police!\n\n               In one motion, Elias draws his gun, turns and FIRES.\n\n               The figure goes down. Elias can't believe he hit him.\n\n               Hull starts toward the figure.\n\n                                     ELIAS\n                              (heading the other \n                              way)\n                         John, where are you going?\n\n               Taft -- on the ground.\n\n                                     HULL\n                         Oh, Jesus, no...\n\n               He drops to his knees.

The posture duplicates \n               Hull with his dying father. He feels for a pulse. For breath.\n\n                                     HULL\n                              (distraught)\n                         He's dying.\n\n                                     ELIAS\n                         Let him die. Let him die twice. Come \n                         one.\n\n               He pulls at Hull who won't go.

How difficult \n               it is to get back to an honorable life.\n\n               He takes her hand.\n\n                                     HULL\n                              (continuing; with \n                              difficulty)\n                         My father didn't have a heart attack.\n\n               She looks at him.\n\n                                     HULL\n                              (continuing)\n                         He was shot robbing a liquor store. \n                         Trying to rob it. I lied about that.\n\n                                     MCCUTCHEON\n                         Baby, why are you telling me this?\n\n                                     HULL\n                         I had to start somewhere...

Hull extracts \n               himself, gives the finger to the POV and stuffs a bit of \n               tissue in the iris, blocking our view.\n\n               EXT. ROOM - DAY\n\n               Carver takes his eye from the now obscured peephole.\n\n               EXT. A CEMETERY - DAY\n\n               A funeral. Taft's wife and children (from the wallet photo) \n               leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party.\n\n               When everyone is gone, Hull approaches the grave. From his \n               pocket, he removes the four blood-soaked bills his father \n               gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that \n               already cover the plot.\n\n               He's silent a moment, then he gets up. He joins Carver who's \n               standing with Hull's children. The kids each take his hand, \n               they walk together.\n\n                                     CARVER\n                         Betty walked out of court free this \n                         morning. That's my side of the deal.\n\n                                     HULL\n                              (to the children)\n                         You two run on ahead.\n\n               They do. Hull watches them go.\n\n                                     CARVER\n                         Her probation gets revoked the minute \n                         you fuck up. I want you to stay away \n                         from her altogether.\n\n                                     HULL\n                         You know the difference between a \n                         black man and a nigger?\n\n               Carver smiles, shakes his head. He likes a good joke. Hull \n               punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees.\n\n                                     HULL\n                              (continuing)\n                         The nigger's the one who'd even think \n                         about doing what you tell him.\n\n               He walks away. Still on his knees, doubled over, Carver \n               whispers after him:\n\n                                     CARVER\n                         Don't blow your cover.\n\n               FADE OUT.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Cover\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Michael Tolkin\u00a0\u00a0Henry Bean\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:23:49.225925"}
