(\"If only\" the tape \n               had been attached up and down instead of around the door, \n               Wills wouldn't have spotted it and alerted the police; \"if \n               only\" the first police car called had gone to investigate, \n               Baldwin, watching from the Howard Johnson Motor Inn, would \n               have seen their uniforms and radioed Hunt and Liddy in time \n               for them to have gotten to the five burglars and then safely \n               away.)\n\n               The break-in ends when Leeper arrests the five men. He thought \n               he only had one guy, so when ten hands were raised he was \n               surprised. The hands are all encased in Playtex rubber \n               surgical gloves.

But \n               basically what we see is WOODWARD plugging away on the goddamn \n               phone and you'd think his finger would fall off from all the \n               dialing and you know his voice is tiring as this montage \n               goes on, you can hear it grow raspy. But a lot of what a \n               reporter does he does on the phone, and that's what we're \n               compressing here. The dialing never stops, the voices are \n               continuous.\n\n                                     WOODWARD\n                         Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing \n                         Post and...\n                              (beat)\n                         Mullen and Company Public Relations? \n                         Could you tell me when you expect \n                         Mr. Hunt?\n                              (surprised)\n                         He is?\n\n                                     HUNT (V.O.)\n                         Howard Hunt here.\n\n                                     WOODWARD\n                         Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--\n\n                                     HUNT (V.O.)\n                              (impatient)\n                         --yes, yes, what is it?\n\n                                     WOODWARD\n                         I was just kind of wondering why \n                         your name and phone number were in \n                         the address books of two of the men \n                         arrested at Watergate?\n\n                                     HUNT (V.O.)\n                              (blind panic)\n                         Good God!\n\n               And he bangs the phone down sharply--\n\n               --more dialing SOUNDS.

He takes a stick with a red flag, jams it \n               into the flower pot.

WOODWARD is working at his desk until he glances up at \n               a wall clock. It's almost one on the button and as he rises--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               WOODWARD racing down the stairway of the Post; as he hits \n               the lobby, he turns and we\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               OUTSIDE THE POST - NIGHT\n\n               WOODWARD appears in the side exit, walks off.

But his fingers are drumming, drumming and--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE SECOND CAB stopping, as WOODWARD gets out, pays. The cab \n               starts off, but slowly. WOODWARD waits. The cab doesn't turn \n               as the first one did. WOODWARD still waits. Finally the cab \n               turns and the second it does, WOODWARD starts to run again \n               and--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               WOODWARD turning a corner, running on and--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               ANOTHER CORNER as WOODWARD turns it, finally stops and catches \n               his breath as we--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A GIGANTIC UNDERGROUND TYPE GARAGE\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               WOODWARD ENTERING THE GARAGE.

Sometimes I wonder \n                         if reporters understand how much \n                         pain they can inflict in just one \n                         sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. \n                         But my wife, my parents, it's been \n                         very rough on them.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               BERNSTEIN and WOODWARD looking very uncomfortable as SLOAN \n               goes on.\n\n                                     SLOAN\n                         I wish I could put down on paper \n                         what it's like--you come to Washington \n                         because you believe in something, \n                         and then you get inside and you see \n                         how things actually work and you \n                         watch your ideals disintegrate.\n                              (beat)\n                         The people inside, the people in the \n                         White House, they start to believe \n                         they can suspend the rules because \n                         they're fulfilling a mission. That \n                         becomes the only important thing--\n                         the mission. It's so easy to lose \n                         perspective. We want to get out before \n                         we lose ours altogether.\n\n               SLOAN opens the front door.

The SOUND is incredible. Now--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A TELETYPE MACHINE\n\n               clacking away like crazy. We can read the words, \"The Senator \n               finished by saying that although he was...\" and from there--\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               A SENATOR and while the words \"although he was\" are still \n               very fresh in our minds--\n\n                                     SENATOR\n                         Although I am a Republican, I would \n                         like to state in a pure bipartisan \n                         spirit that I feel only sadness that \n                         a once fine journal of record like \n                         the Post would have become merely \n                         the hysterical spokesman for the \n                         equally hysterical left wing of the \n                         Democratic Party--\n\n               The SOUND of the teletype doesn't stop in this little part \n               and we see three people and it's very important that their \n               voices are immediately recognizable and distinct. One, the \n               SENATOR is from the West and will have that twang. The next \n               two whom we are about to meet are PUBLIC RELATIONS PEOPLE \n               from CREEP and the WHITE HOUSE. The CREEP voice is very \n               southern, the WHITE HOUSE GUY sounds like an NBC announcer. \n               The WESTERN SENATOR will be seen in a corridor of the Senate \n               office building, talking to reporters, the CREEP P.R. \n               SOUTHERNER will be talking to reporters in front of the CREEP \n               office doors and so identified. The WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN \n               will be standing on a platform with a flag visible off to \n               one side. As the teletype goes on--\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE SOUTHERN CREEP P.R.

(5) Finally, all this can show in reality \n               is that they are desperate, and I would rather let the actors \n               give that to us. I feel that it would be a genuine error at \n               this time in the flick to go into the convolutions of how \n               it's bad manners for a reporter to burn a source, if we've \n               got anything going by this point, I can't conceive of much \n               an audience will be less interested in than the reporters \n               misbehaving.\n\n               However, if the scene is requested next time through, I shall \n               be only too happy to oblige.\n\n               What I would like to do is cut from the FBI saying \"fuck you \n               fuck you fuck you\" and locking his door to the following:\n\n               WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN walking in the rain.
