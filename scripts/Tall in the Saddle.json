GARDEN CITY STATION - DAY\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- station signboard. It reads:\n\n                                      \"GARDEN CITY\"\n\n               CAMERA PANS to show the dusty platform of a typical small \n               Arizona town of the late nineties.\n\n               CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures, \n               consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans \n               and a mongrel dog.\n\n               CAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the \n               office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair \n               with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The \n               clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens \n               his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his \n               feet sleepily.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               line of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. The sound of a \n               distant train whistle is heard o.s. The dog, which up to now \n               might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera.\n\n               LONG SHOT\n\n               railway track with the three-car train approaching.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               line of sleeping figures. The dog jumps up barking furiously \n               and runs out of shot past camera. The sleeping figures come \n               to life and look toward camera. At the same time, the door \n               of the ticket office opens and the agent appears.\n\n               FULL SHOT\n\n               railway track. The train is now almost at the station.\n\n               EXT. PLATFORM - DAY\n\n               FULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge \n               of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly \n               in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man \n               of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots \n               and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of \n               day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind \n               Rocklin a conductor.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               baggage car. The baggageman is standing at the open door of \n               the car with two sacks of mail. He drops them to the platform \n               and waves to the conductor o.s. and begins to close the doors \n               of the baggage car.\n\n               MED. CLOSE SHOT\n\n               on Station Agent and conductors. The latter signals the \n               engineer. The train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow \n               of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's \n               face.\n\n               TRUCKING SHOT\n\n               As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in \n               one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the \n               other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits \n               from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His \n               expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of \n               the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. \n               At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around \n               uncertainly.\n\n                                     STATION AGENT\n                              (at office door)\n                         Expectin' someone?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (after a second's \n                              pause)\n                         I guess not. Where's the stagecoach \n                         office?\n\n                                     STATION AGENT\n                              (pointing)\n                         Back of the depot.\n\n               EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY\n\n               The stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a \n               sign --\n\n                                      RED ROCK STAGE\n\n                                  J. Harolday Proprietor\n\n               Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the \n               depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, \n               the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead \n               horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees \n               Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances \n               around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's \n               lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is \n               knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. \n               Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds \n               amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- \n               beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and \n               exhibits his utter disgust generally.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                              (to horse)\n                         Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that -- \n                         jus' lookit what you done --\n                              (some more pantomime)\n                         I'm tellin' you, Blossom that --\n                              (indicating broken \n                              bottle)\n                         -- makes you the most aggravatin' \n                         female as ever I had a despise fer -- \n                         I've got a good notion to pizen you -- \n                         an' what's more --\n\n               He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by \n               chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has \n               forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his \n               bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks \n               it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the \n               bottle.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                              (to Blossom)\n                         Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? --\n                              (chuckles)\n                         Fooled myself, too.\n\n               ON ROCKLIN\n\n               who has been watching Dave's performance. He smiles his \n               amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office.\n\n               INT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY\n\n               PAN SHOT. Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind \n               which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble-\n               lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up \n               the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks \n               on the counter and leaves.\n\n                                     STAGE AGENT\n                              (to Rocklin)\n                         Howdy.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (indicating stage)\n                         That the stage for Santa Inez?\n\n                                     STAGE AGENT\n                              (nods)\n                         Leaving any minute.\n\n               Rocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad \n               of bills, drops them on the counter. The Stage Agent counts \n               out the fare.\n\n                                     STAGE AGENT\n                         Santa Inez -- seventeen-fifty --\n                              (returning the balance)\n                         Name?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Rocklin.\n\n               The Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket. Rocklin takes \n               some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances \n               outside.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Mind if I ride alongside the driver?\n\n                                     STAGE AGENT\n                              (over his specs)\n                         It's all right with me -- if it's \n                         all right with Dave -- He's mad -- \n                         His last trip -- Had a row with \n                         Harolday, the boss -- Old-timer, \n                         Dave -- an' a grumpy old cuss.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (soberly)\n                         I like grumpy old cusses -- Hope to \n                         live long enough to be one.\n\n                                     STAGE AGENT\n                              (puzzled)\n                         Yeah?\n\n               He shakes his head and hands Rocklin the ticket, and moves \n               over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand.\n\n               EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY\n\n               The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from \n               the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of \n               climbing up to the driver's seat.\n\n                                     STAGE AGENT\n                         Here's your mail, Dave --\n\n               Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the \n               ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (as he steps up to \n                              the seat)\n                         -- and a passenger.\n\n               Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is \n               about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down \n               at him and asks rather wistfully --\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Mind if I ride up here?\n\n               Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step \n               carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does \n               things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin \n               is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And \n               now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his \n               pent-up wrath.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Where's them wimmen?\n\n                                     STAGE AGENT\n                         Up at the hotel.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                              (yanking mail sack \n                              from Agent)\n                         Why ain't they here? -- This is the \n                         stage depot, ain't it -- ?\n                              (heaves sack into \n                              boot)\n                         Ain't it?\n\n                                     STAGE AGENT\n                         You can pick 'em up there -- it's \n                         only up the street --\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         On'y up the street -- an' they cain't \n                         walk it -- What's the matter -- don't \n                         Easterners have laigs like other \n                         folks?\n\n               Dave stalks around the rear of the coach. The Agent meantime \n               stretches himself up toward Rocklin.\n\n                                     STAGE AGENT\n                              (so Dave won't hear)\n                         Hold tight when you git in the \n                         mountains, mister -- When he gits \n                         riled you can hear the passengers \n                         prayin' for miles.\n\n               Dave has climbed to his seat, and now the coach lurches away, \n               leaving the Agent shaking his head dubiously.\n\n               EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY\n\n               From the porch of the hotel. We see the stage approaching as \n               the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from \n               the hotel to the street.

The women \n               are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste \n               of the period. Miss Martin is a domineering woman, approaching \n               middle age.

SUN-UP BAR - NIGHT\n\n               MED. SHOT -- poker table, including Cap, who is watching. \n               Pap Fossler is dealing. There is an atmosphere of tension \n               around the table, and it is obvious that Clint has been \n               losing. As he picks up his cards, he is unable to restrain a \n               smile of triumph. Rocklin makes a bet.

Rocklin takes out a \n               wallet, from which he removes a bill and sees the raise.\n\n                                     GARVEY\n                              (folding)\n                         No place for me.\n\n                                     PAP\n                         Cards?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         One.\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (eagerly)\n                         One for me.\n\n               He reaches for it almost before it is dealt and as a result \n               the card, a Queen, falls face up. Clint looks at it gleefully, \n               snatches it up and puts it in his hand. Rocklin watches him \n               impassively.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Don't you know that Queen is dead?\n\n                                     CLINT\n                         I can take it if I want it.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Sure -- if you want -- but you'll \n                         have to beat my hand with four cards.\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (hotly)\n                         I'm playing these, mister!\n\n               Rocklin glances inquiringly at the other players.

Clint, almost hysterical, \n               jumps up, draws his gun and thrusts it almost into Rocklin's \n               face.

SUN-UP SALOON - DAY\n\n               The place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of \n               expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons. A \n               group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office. \n               At the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging \n               doors. The bar supports other customers engaged in various \n               private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of \n               George Clews who, with his brother, Bob, stands at the bar's \n               center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of \n               him. He is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the \n               others, but regards them all with disdain. He downs his drink, \n               and speaks his thought to Bob.\n\n                                     GEORGE CLEWS\n                         I'm gonna get his ears.\n\n               Suddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and \n               halts with the swinging doors half open.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                              (loudly)\n                         Hi you, George Clews --\n\n               George Clews turns.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Rocklin says if you don't come out, \n                         he'll come in here after you, an' \n                         tear you apart.\n\n               George Clews frowns. His eye catches sight of a king-size \n               glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis, \n               standing alongside him. That quick, Clews beats Shorty to \n               the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out. Cap, \n               anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from \n               under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty.\n\n                                     SHORTY\n                              (taps Clews)\n                         That was my beer, you know.\n\n                                     GEORGE CLEWS\n                              (nastily)\n                         If he comes in again -- I'll throw \n                         you.\n\n               Before Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the \n               little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that \n               sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him \n               struggling to get his hat off. The crowd resents this, but \n               doesn't dare do anything, except Cap, who holds his shotgun \n               in sight.\n\n                                     CAP\n                              (to the Clews)\n                         That does it, boys -- you know where \n                         the door is.\n\n                                     GEORGE CLEWS\n                              (to Bob)\n                         Com-mon -- I'll get his ears.\n\n                                     CAP\n                         Not until I get my money --\n\n               George and Bob Clews are now a few steps from the bar.

Rocklin \n               enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it \n               crashing down alongside George's head. The barrel strikes \n               though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole-\n               axed steer.\n\n               INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY\n\n               MED.

Dave pushes his way through the \n               crowd and thumps Rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm. At \n               the same time, the sound of a horse cantering is heard, and \n               Jackson comes into shot.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                              (to Rocklin)\n                         Hey, you!

He turns and glares, but without effect. He gives a \n               final shout to Rocklin.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Don't say you ain't been warned.\n\n               Pulling his horse around, he sets off in a lope up the street.\n\n               MED.

Come, Clara!\n\n               She takes Clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the \n               hotel. Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and \n               then up at Arly, who has been listening intently. She returns \n               his look steadily for a second. Then, with a mocking smile, \n               she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by \n               Juan. He looks after her for a second; then with the same \n               grim look, enters Harolday's office.\n\n               INT.

TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is \n               discovered sweeping the front porch. Behind him we see Clint \n               open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch \n               to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for \n               someone.\n\n               Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with \n               his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over \n               his shoulder.\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (turning to Shelley)\n                         Have you seen Arly?\n\n                                     SHELLEY\n                         No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly \n                         today, but Ah seed her las' night, \n                         and she shore was mad.\n\n               To emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a \n               whistle.\n\n                                     SHELLEY\n                         Plenty mad!\n\n               Clint's face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for \n               him. Over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of \n               a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune \n               of the period. Clint's strained features relax in a can-that-\n               be-Arly expression, while Shelley stops dead in the middle \n               of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o.s.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               From their ANGLE we first see only the corner of the house, \n               while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side. \n               Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and \n               Shelley watching her. She seems more attractive, in a feminine \n               way, this morning. It may be the skirt and blouse she is \n               wearing. Then again it may be the flower she is, even now, \n               adjusting in her hair. The presence of the two men suddenly \n               startles her. The song ends abruptly, while her hands fall \n               quickly away from the flower.\n\n               ARLY\n\n               As Arly moves toward the porch, Shelley snaps back to life \n               and resumes sweeping -- but furiously. Clint regards the \n               girl in the vague manner of the puzzled gent he is.\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (not too definitely)\n                         'Mornin', Arly --\n\n               Arly is coming toward Clint.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (pleasantly)\n                         'Mornin', Clint.\n\n               She steps close to Clint, and he slowly backs up a step, for \n               he does not know she came up to him merely to pick up her \n               jacket lying on the ground near the step.\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (as Arly leans down \n                              to pick up the jacket)\n                         You must be feeling pretty good.\n\n               Arly straightens up with the jacket in her hand, and the \n               corner of her mouth curls in a faint smile. She turns now \n               and starts along the walk, and takes only a few steps when \n               Clint comes to her side.\n\n               ARLY AND CLINT WALKING\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (as he joins Arly)\n                         Say, Arly -- about that poker game, \n                         night before last, I ---\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (tossing it off)\n                         Forget it.\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (did he hear correctly)\n                         Forget it?\n\n               Arly pays no attention to Clint.

OF CABIN - MOONLIGHT - AFTER THE STORM\n\n               Rocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the \n               door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness.\n\n               Water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl \n               hoots in a near-by tree.\n\n               The sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the \n               corral. Both men re-act.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         My team.\n\n               Almost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time \n               from another direction entirely -- and from a distance.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         That's not your team.\n\n               He moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by Dave.\n\n               HORSE IS STOMPING NERVOUSLY\n\n               and now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at \n               the edge of the clearing. Only the lower part of the animal \n               is seen, along with the legs of the rider.\n\n               ROCKLIN AND DAVE HEAR THE SOUND OF RETREATING HOOF BEATS\n\n               And they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent \n               toward the deep blackness of the trees.\n\n               Rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing -- \n               Dave close behind.\n\n               Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires.\n\n               The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night.\n\n               Dave starts after him again. Looking back, he sees Rocklin \n               has not moved.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Come on --\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         No use -- he's gone.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Mebbe we winged him.\n\n               He starts through the wet grass alone. Rocklin turns back \n               toward the cabin.\n\n               DAVE - PLOUGHING THROUGH THE GRASS\n\n               He has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight \n               embankment leads to the level of the trees. He is just \n               starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something \n               on the embankment, shining in the moonlight. It proves to be \n               a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver. \n               It is dry, so has evidently just been dropped. Dave pockets \n               it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail.\n\n               ROCLKLIN - WHO HAS JUST ABOUT REACHED THE CABIN\n\n               He looks back in Dave's direction, and then looking toward \n               the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses.\n\n               THE CABIN DOOR IS PARTLY OPEN\n\n               and through it Rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form \n               moving in the faint glow of the dying fire.\n\n               ROCKLIN DRAWS HIS GUN AND MOVES STEALTHILY TOWARDS THE CABIN \n               DOOR\n\n               INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               Rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches \n               the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the \n               fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk. He sees \n               the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in \n               the light of the fire. He sees him suddenly stop and pick up \n               something hidden from his view.\n\n               At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut.\n\n               The intruder whirls around.\n\n               It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant.\n\n               The two regard each other like vicious animals in the same \n               cage. Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it.\n\n               And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly -- \n               but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving his.\n\n               When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from behind \n               her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously \n               Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to \n               open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength to \n               prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand. \n               But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without \n               any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses \n               it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly relaxes \n               her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, and \n               tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her \n               feet.\n\n               He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the \n               floor.\n\n               Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. And \n               Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. He picks up his hat \n               and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through the \n               bullet holes.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (smiling wryly)\n                         Not bad shootin'.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (right back at him)\n                         You think I did that?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Sure -- to draw us away from here.\n                              (looks at his hat)\n                         You know, you cut it mighty close -- \n                         Good thing I ain't got brains enough \n                         to fill it.\n\n               Rocklin puts his hat on.

It passes too close to Arly for comfort and, \n               Rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back -- \n               that close to his ear he feels the breeze. He looks at it, \n               quivering in the door. Then, moving to Arly in what could be \n               construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his arms \n               and kisses her. Arly is caught completely unaware. Rocklin's \n               action disarms her. But it is, after all, what she really \n               wants, so before the kiss ends, Arly's arms slowly entwine \n               themselves around Rocklin's neck.

Almost immediately the door opens \n               and Clara stands there -- flushed and embarrassed.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Oh, Mr. Rocklin --\n\n               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY\n\n               This is the room in which Clara has arranged to meet Rocklin, \n               who later takes it as his own.\n\n               SHOT at door as Rocklin steps into the room.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         I'm so glad I've found you -- I was \n                         on my way to the Santee and learned \n                         you were in town.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (putting his saddle, \n                              etc., aside)\n                         Just got in.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         I feel perfectly awful, running after \n                         you like this, but --\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         You got trouble, eh?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         My aunt found out I wrote you and \n                         made a terrible scene --\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         You haven't signed everything over \n                         to that Garvey, have you?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         No -- and because I refused, Auntie \n                         said she would sign an affidavit \n                         that I'm still underage, and then, \n                         as my guardian she can do what she \n                         likes.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Got anything to prove you're not \n                         underage?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                              (after a slight pause)\n                         No -- but Mr. Garvey has a letter \n                         that would prove it.

GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- a letter written in a bold feminine hand. It \n               reads:\n\n               DEAR MR. GARVEY:\n\n               In answer to your letter of the 25th, kindly be advised that \n               my niece, Clara Caldwell, became of age January 11th of this \n               year. And, although I am no longer her legal guardian, it \n               behooves me, as her nearest kin, to show continued interest \n               in her affairs --\n\n               The CAMERA HOLDS LONG ENOUGH for the letter to be read. And \n               now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the CAMERA \n               PULLS BACK showing the burning letter in Judge Garvey's hand. \n               He is standing over the potbellied stove in his office, and \n               Miss Martin is close to him watching the letter burn. Garvey \n               finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the \n               stove. He lifts the lid, lets the remains fall inside, and \n               smiles to Miss Martin.\n\n                                     GARVEY\n                         That takes care of that --\n                              (crosses to his desk)\n                         Now, I'll draw up an affidavit right \n                         away and everything will be taken \n                         care of as we want it.\n\n                                     MISS MARTIN\n                              (not too enthusiastic)\n                         I certainly hope so -- it's not myself \n                         I'm concerned about --\n\n                                     GARVEY\n                              (getting out the papers)\n                         -- Of course not.\n\n                                     MISS MARTIN\n                         I can't say I'm very happy about \n                         doing this -- I only hope it works \n                         out for the best.\n\n                                     GARVEY\n                         It's the better choice of two evils -- \n                         now let's see --\n                              (begins to write)\n                         I, Elizabeth --\n                              (looks at Miss Martin)\n                         It is Elizabeth, isn't it?\n\n                                     MISS MARTIN\n                         Yes --\n\n                                     GARVEY\n                         -- Elizabeth Martin, of Danvers, \n                         Massachusetts, do hereby --\n\n               The door opens and Rocklin enters. Miss Martin, who has been \n               pacing nervously, stops in her tracks. Garvey, taken \n               completely by surprise, feigns an affected casualness. Rocklin \n               eyes them both suspiciously as he slowly closes the door.\n\n                                     GARVEY\n                              (leaning back in his \n                              chair)\n                         Well, Mr. Rocklin, this is indeed a \n                         surprise. Didn't expect to see you \n                         so soon.

HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               SHOT -- door to Garvey's office. Miss Martin has her ear \n               glued to the panels.

Garvey turns him by touching his arm.\n\n                                     GARVEY\n                              (has had almost enough)\n                         Now, you look here --\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (soberly)\n                         You're the one who better start \n                         lookin' -- lookin' for a way out for \n                         killin' Red Caldwell.\n\n                                     GARVEY\n                              (blanches)\n                         Caldwell --\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (takes up one of the \n                              decks of cards)\n                         He found out about these -- and you \n                         went and killed him.\n\n                                     GARVEY\n                              (with an affected \n                              smile and unnatural \n                              calmness)\n                         And you believe a story like that?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         I will until I hear a better one.\n                              (puts deck he holds, \n                              in his pocket)\n                         I'll just take this along -- the \n                         district judge at Garden City should \n                         be mighty interested.\n\n               He starts around the desk toward the door. From the corner \n               of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle \n               drawer. Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a \n               blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove.\n\n               Rocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being \n               struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury. The \n               chair crashes against a window.\n\n               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               The sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers-\n               by, as well as Miss Martin seated in her surrey with Sammy, \n               the K.C. China-boy.\n\n               INT.

Rocklin has Garvey just about \n               done in. He gives him one final Sunday punch and Garvey goes \n               down and stays down. At that moment, Dave and Pap Fossler \n               enter followed by other curious natives.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Say -- looks like you two been \n                         disagreein' 'bout somethin' --\n                              (to Fossler, who has \n                              gone over to Garvey)\n                         He ain't daid, is he?\n\n                                     PAP FOSSLER\n                         Not permanently, I don't reckon. -- \n                         What happened, anyways?\n\n                                     DAVE\n                              (to Rocklin)\n                         You musta found out somethin'.\n\n                                     PAP FOSSLER\n                              (with a wink to Dave)\n                         I reckon the Judge did, too.\n\n               They exit, and almost immediately Miss Martin enters, and \n               after gaping in horror at the appearance of the place, sees \n               the Judge, who, having regained consciousness, bestirs himself \n               on the floor.\n\n                                     MISS MARTIN\n                         Oh, dear -- dear -- are you hurt?\n\n                                     GARVEY\n                              (getting up painfully)\n                         Get out of my way --\n\n               Garvey, on his feet now, makes for the door leading to his \n               living quarters at the back of the office. Miss Martin follows \n               him.\n\n                                     MISS MARTIN\n                              (haughtily)\n                         Now don't you use that tone of voice \n                         to me --\n                              (going through doorway)\n                         I'll have you understand I --\n\n               She sees the bed and shrieks upon realizing where she is, \n               and backs out quickly, almost catching the door which Garvey \n               slams in her face.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY\n\n               Rocklin and Dave as they walk from Garvey's office. Dave has \n               a time hopping along against Rocklin's strides.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         -- Find out who owns that tobaccy \n                         pouch yet?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (staring straight \n                              ahead)\n                         No -- but get hold of Clint Harolday.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Clint -- Is he in on it?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Can't say for sure -- Bring him to \n                         the Sun-Up, and don't take no for an \n                         answer.\n\n               Dave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage \n               office. Rocklin goes off toward the Sun-Up.\n\n               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY\n\n               PANNING SHOT. Juan is lounging against the corner of the \n               building, soberly watching Rocklin's approach. As Rocklin \n               comes into the scene he spots Juan, and stops a moment as \n               though deciding whether or not to question him. During this, \n               Juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his \n               pocket and begins to roll a cigarette.\n\n               The CAMERA PANS Rocklin to the side of the building and up \n               the outer stairs.\n\n               INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY\n\n               Rocklin comes through the door and down the hall. He reaches \n               his room, and is about to open the door when he hears a \n               familiar voice inside. He listens.\n\n                                     ARLY'S VOICE\n                         -- So now you know the truth.

ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY\n\n               Rocklin steps into the room, holding the door partly open as \n               he focuses his attention on Arly. Clara, who has been sitting \n               in the rocker near the window, gets up and is the first to \n               speak.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                              (anxiously)\n                         Did you get it?\n\n               Rocklin closes the door.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         No -- but I don't think it's gonna \n                         matter much -- you go on back to the \n                         K.C. and I'll be out in the mornin' \n                         and take you with me to Garden City \n                         to see the district judge.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         But I hate putting you to that \n                         trouble.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         No trouble at all -- I'm going anyway.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (casually)\n                         You look like you've been fighting.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (soberly)\n                         What are you doin' here?\n\n                                     ARLY\n                         I was just telling Miss Caldwell \n                         about -- well -- you and me.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (his eyes narrowing)\n                         What about, you an' me?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                              (sensing the static \n                              in the atmosphere)\n                         I think I'd better be going...\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (turning quickly from \n                              Arly)\n                         Just a minute --\n                              (glances at Arly)\n                         What all has she been tellin' you?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                              (embarrassed)\n                         Oh -- oh, really I'd rather not --\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (interrupting)\n                         Go ahead, tell him --\n                              (looks at Rocklin and \n                              goes on defiantly)\n                         -- and I dare him to deny it.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Deny what?\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         That she was with you last night at \n                         the cabin in the mountains.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Well -- why should I deny it?...\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (quickly)\n                         And didn't you make love to me?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (this is getting a \n                              bit thick for him)\n                         Make love to you --\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (forcing her point)\n                         You didn't kiss me -- I suppose?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Did you expect me to deny that, too?\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (smiles at Clara)\n                         You see?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (to Clara)\n                         Now, maybe you ought to hear what \n                         I've got to say --\n\n               Clara is terribly hurt, but struggles to be grown-up about \n               it.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         Please -- you needn't explain. After \n                         all, it really isn't any of my \n                         business, is it?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (in the pause he looks \n                              at Arly)\n                         You little --\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (quickly)\n                         That's it -- start swearin'--\n                              (to Clara)\n                         Just like a man.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         If there wasn't a lady here, I'd do \n                         more to you than swear.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         I don't know how I can ever thank \n                         you for trying to help me.

So she turns away \n               quickly and hurries out the door. Rocklin does a slow burn \n               as he glares at Arly.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (sincerely -- after a \n                              pause)\n                         She's lovely, isn't she? -- So sweet -- \n                         honest, and helpless.\n\n               Rocklin makes no reply.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                         Pity you didn't fall in love with \n                         her, instead of me.\n\n               Arly is being ridiculous now. He ignores her remarks and \n               concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he may \n               have sprained it slightly in the fight.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         You might's well know right now that \n                         you or no woman is ever goin' to get \n                         me.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                         Don't be so sure -- I don't think \n                         I'm doin' so badly.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Don't you?\n\n                                     ARLY\n                         Don't you know?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         I know there ain't a dirty trick you \n                         wouldn't play to get what you want.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (smiling)\n                         I always get what I want.\n\n               She takes a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and drops \n               it on the dresser as Rocklin watches her.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                         -- See?\n                              (opens the door)\n                         -- 'Bye now --\n\n               The door closes. Rocklin stands a moment. Now curiosity brings \n               him to the dresser where he takes up the paper and unfolds \n               it.\n\n               CLARA'S LETTER. The torn pieces have all been sorted and \n               pasted together on a sheet of paper\n\n               BACK TO SCENE. Rocklin holds the letter. He is mad. He shakes \n               his head -- What a gal --- Now he is almost smiling -- almost. \n               He folds the letter -- puts it in his pocket. Takes off his \n               gun-belt and hangs it over the rocker near the window, and \n               stretches out on the bed, as we\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n               FADE IN\n\n               EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               ON Clara hurrying toward the front door in a suppressed state \n               of excitement. She has presumably just arrived at the ranch \n               in advance of Miss Martin. She enters the house after a glance \n               toward the gate.\n\n               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Clara enters hastily and beats a path to the door of her \n               room.\n\n               INT. CLARA'S ROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The door flies open. Clara bursts in, closing the door in \n               the same movement. Her eyes swing to someone o.s. and she \n               freezes to the spot.\n\n               ON\n\n               Miss Martin, standing by the window, cold and threatening. \n               She has not taken the time to remove her hat. After a moment's \n               pause, she moves slowly toward Clara.\n\n               The CAMERA PANS WITH her into a TWO SHOT. Clara, her back \n               pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more \n               terrified at the other's approach. Miss Martin appraises the \n               girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across \n               the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even \n               stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt.\n\n                                     MISS MARTIN\n                              (quietly but viciously)\n                         Whatever is to become of you?\n\n               Clara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell.\n\n                                     MISS MARTIN\n                         Have you no sense of pride, or \n                         decency? Throwing yourself at that -- \n                         that wretch, like any shameless hussy.\n\n               Clara hasn't moved.\n\n                                     MISS MARTIN\n                         I thought we'd done with him -- but \n                         no -- you have to run to him and \n                         tell him all our business --\n\n               Clara merely gasps for a breath of air, but Miss Martin, \n               thinking her about to speak, goes on, more forcefully now.\n\n                                     MISS MARTIN\n                         Don't you dare deny it -- you know \n                         very well you told him about that \n                         letter I wrote Mr. Garvey.\n\n               Clara remains silent.\n\n                                     MISS MARTIN\n                         Didn't you? --\n\n               Clara, now utterly broken, moves away.

GARVEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The office has been more or less cleaned up since the fight. \n               Garvey is discovered near the window. He has cleaned himself \n               up but bears some evidence of the fight. He is reading a \n               letter as Sammy, the K.C. China-boy, stands waiting near the \n               door.\n\n               LETTER. The message is written in the same bold hand of Miss \n               Martin already seen in the previous letter:\n\n               Mr. Garvey,\n\n               I have just learned that despicable Rocklin person intends \n               to take Clara to Garden City in the morning -- evidently to \n               have you investigated.

ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               On Rocklin, stretched across the bed, examining the cards in \n               the light of a lamp.\n\n               EXT. REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT\n\n               Garvey comes from around the building's corner and peers \n               furtively through the darkness toward the lighted windows of \n               Rocklin's room.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT\n\n               The area in front of the Sun-Up. Dave's wagon pulls up to \n               the hitching rail in front of the saloon. Clint, stripped of \n               his gun, is driving with Dave, alertly watching him. They \n               get down from the wagon and Dave prods Clint toward the corner \n               of the building.\n\n               EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT\n\n               Garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's \n               window. We now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the \n               building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the Sun-\n               Up's second floor. He starts up the steps and stops almost \n               immediately and stares o.s.\n\n               ANGEL\n\n               From Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around \n               in front of the building toward the stairway.\n\n               CAMERA HOLDS\n\n               Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position \n               around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the \n               stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward \n               the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala \n               come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact \n               position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a \n               moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, \n               and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of \n               the scene.\n\n               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT\n\n               PANNING SHOT on Rocklin asleep. He is fully dressed, as we \n               last saw him, with the exception of his boots. He is stretched \n               full length on top of the covers. His gun-belt still hangs \n               over the rocker, close to the open window. A knock on the \n               door brings him to a sitting position.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Come in --\n\n               CAMERA PANS TO door as Clint enters reluctantly, followed by \n               the triumphant Dave.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                         Here he is, Rock. Caught him jist in \n                         time near the Santee.

Then Rocklin puts on \n               his boots.\n\n                                     DAVE\n                              (delighted)\n                         Well, now -- that's right thoughtful -- \n                         Holler if you need me.\n\n               Dave exits.\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (belligerently, as he \n                              stands near the window)\n                         What's this all about?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (calmly, as he stands \n                              up)\n                         It ain't gonna do you any good to \n                         get all het up and tough, kid --\n\n               Rocklin begins rolling a cigarette as he moves toward Clint.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         I just want to ask you a few questions -- \n                         that's all.\n\n               EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT\n\n               An unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness \n               toward the outer stairway. As it nears the stairway, the \n               CAMERA MOVES IN so that as the mysterious figure begins \n               stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the \n               rungs.\n\n               The CAMERA THEN PANS QUICKLY AND ZOOMS INTO A CLOSE SHOT of \n               Juan, across the alley. And now through Juan's eyes we watch \n               the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of \n               vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across \n               the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear \n               portion of the verandah.\n\n               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT\n\n               Rocklin finishes rolling his cigarette and lights it.\n\n                                     CLINT\n                         I told you once, I don't know who \n                         owns that pouch-- and I don't know \n                         who shot you.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (calmly)\n                         Forget it -- that's not what I want \n                         to talk to you about, anyway.\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (harshly)\n                         Well, what do you want to talk about? \n                         Come on, get it over with.\n\n               EXT. VERANDAH - REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT\n\n               The mysterious form has moved past the darkened windows along \n               the verandah and is nearing Rocklin's lighted room -- stops \n               close to the open window.\n\n               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT\n\n               SHOT -- Rocklin and Clint.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Clint -- I want you to tell me why \n                         Garvey murdered Red Caldwell --\n\n               Clint tenses -- stares -- finds breathing difficult.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         You know -- don't you?\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (shaking)\n                         Me?

Suddenly he sees something out of the shot over \n               Rocklin's shoulder and his expression changes. Rocklin looks \n               quickly in the same direction.\n\n               MED. SHOT\n\n               window. A gloved hand has come out of the dark and is reaching \n               through the window for Rocklin's gun in the belt which is \n               hanging over the chair.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT\n\n               Clint and Rocklin. The latter is still looking toward the \n               window. With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug \n               from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head. As \n               Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a \n               triumphant smile. Suddenly his expression changes.\n\n                                     CLINT\n                              (in a hoarse scream)\n                         No! No, don't!\n\n               There is a shot from o.s. and Clint's hands go to his stomach. \n               With a gasp of pain he doubles up and collapses on the floor.\n\n               SHOT\n\n               window. The hand of the killer pitches the gun toward Rocklin \n               and disappears.\n\n               INT. BAR - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT\n\n               Lined up at the bar are Dave, Pap Fossler, Shorty Davis and \n               a few others. Cap is in his usual place. At the poker table \n               are Doc Riding, Sam Haynes, Ab Jenkins and one or two others.\n\n               The shot has evidently been heard, for everything seems to \n               have stopped, and Dave and Pap Fussier are looking up toward \n               the ceiling, as are others. Now Dave snaps back to life -- \n               gulps down his drink, and hurries toward the stairs. As he \n               starts up, the others move slowly in the same direction.\n\n               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT\n\n               Rocklin is on the floor, groggy. He shakes his head, and as \n               his senses return, he picks up the gun and just gets to his \n               feet as Dave rushes in.\n\n               Dave sees Clint's body on the floor -- notices the gun in \n               Rocklin's hand. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes \n               out. All he can do is stare and grimace. The sound of hurrying \n               feet comes from the hall, and presently the mob closes in, \n               crowding the room and the hall.\n\n               Pap Fossler, who has been one of the first to enter, kneels \n               over Clint.\n\n               During this, there are general ad libs from the crowd.\n\n                                     AD LIBS\n                         What happened?

He finally looks at Garvey in \n               desperation. Perspiration runs down Garvey's forehead. \n               Suddenly Harolday makes a mad dash for the door. Rocklin \n               shoots, but Arly pushes his arm and sends the shot wild. \n               Rocklin looks at her in amazement. Julio hurries out.\n\n               EXT.

For a moment nothing \n               happens; now Harolday's horse bolts out, riderless, and \n               gallops away. Now Julio comes slowly into view.

In a moment Rocklin \n               comes into view in the b.g. He spots Arly, who has her back \n               to him, and walks over. His approach frightens the woodchuck \n               away, and turns Arly's head toward him. Neither has anything \n               to say. Now Rocklin sits beside Arly, but faces the other \n               way.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (after a pause)\n                         Thanks.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                         For what?\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Everything.\n\n               There is another stilted pause.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (her eyes sweeping \n                              the morning)\n                         Beautiful day.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                              (reflecting)\n                         It didn't start out so beautiful.\n\n                                     ARLY\n                         That's true of lots of things.\n\n                                     ROCKLIN\n                         Fer instance?\n\n                                     ARLY\n                              (hesitantly)\n                         Well -- you and -- me.\n\n               There is another pause. But worlds are being said in the \n               language of eyes. Their heads move closer and now Rocklin's \n               arms sweep around the girl and they kiss.\n\n               GROUNDS NEAR ARLY AND ROCKLIN DAVE AND JULIO HURRYING THROUGH \n               THE GRASS\n\n                                     DAVE\n                              (shouting)\n                         Hey, Rock -- Rock -- get out your \n                         pencil and paper --\n\n               The two stop abruptly and look o.s.\n\n               ON ROCKLIN AND ARLY KISSING ON DAVE AND JULIO\n\n                                     DAVE\n                              (grimacing)\n                         Doggone it -- here Garvey is back in \n                         this world -- an' they're out of it.\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTall in the Saddle\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Michael Hogan\u00a0\u00a0Paul P Fix\u00a0\u00a0Gordon Ray Young\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Western\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:57.118936"}
