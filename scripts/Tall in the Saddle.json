Inside the \n               office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair \n               with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The \n               clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens \n               his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his \n               feet sleepily.\n\n<b>               MED.

Train steams slowly \n               in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man \n               of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots \n               and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of \n               day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands.

The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His \n               expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of \n               the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. \n               At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around \n               uncertainly.\n\n<b>                                     STATION AGENT\n</b>                              (at office door)\n                         Expectin' someone?\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                              (after a second's \n                              pause)\n                         I guess not.

Harolday Proprietor\n\n               Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the \n               depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, \n               the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead \n               horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees \n               Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances \n               around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's \n               lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is \n               knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. \n               Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds \n               amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- \n               beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and \n               exhibits his utter disgust generally.\n\n<b>                                     DAVE\n</b>                              (to horse)\n                         Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that -- \n                         jus' lookit what you done --\n                              (some more pantomime)\n                         I'm tellin' you, Blossom that --\n                              (indicating broken \n                              bottle)\n                         -- makes you the most aggravatin' \n                         female as ever I had a despise fer -- \n                         I've got a good notion to pizen you -- \n                         an' what's more --\n\n               He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by \n               chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has \n               forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his \n               bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks \n               it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the \n               bottle.\n\n<b>                                     DAVE\n</b>                              (to Blossom)\n                         Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? --\n                              (chuckles)\n                         Fooled myself, too.\n\n<b>               ON ROCKLIN\n</b>\n               who has been watching Dave's performance.

Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind \n               which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble-\n               lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up \n               the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks \n               on the counter and leaves.\n\n<b>                                     STAGE AGENT\n</b>                              (to Rocklin)\n                         Howdy.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                              (indicating stage)\n                         That the stage for Santa Inez?\n\n<b>                                     STAGE AGENT\n</b>                              (nods)\n                         Leaving any minute.\n\n               Rocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad \n               of bills, drops them on the counter.

GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY\n</b>\n               The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from \n               the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of \n               climbing up to the driver's seat.\n\n<b>                                     STAGE AGENT\n</b>                         Here's your mail, Dave --\n\n               Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the \n               ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                              (as he steps up to \n                              the seat)\n                         -- and a passenger.\n\n               Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is \n               about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down \n               at him and asks rather wistfully --\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         Mind if I ride up here?\n\n               Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step \n               carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does \n               things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin \n               is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough.

Care to sit In? \n                         I'm warnin' you, though -- our young \n                         friend here has been holding \n                         phenomenal cards.\n\n               Rocklin smiles and begins to shake his head.\n\n<b>                                     CLINT\n</b>                              (with a cocky grin)\n                         Have a heart, Judge. This ain't no \n                         two-bit saddle-tramp's game. This is \n                         for real money.\n\n               Rocklin turns very slowly and stares at Clint. The others \n               watch curiously. Without taking his eyes off Clint, he comes \n               forward slowly and stands looking down at him. Then, \n               unbuttoning the flap of his pocket, he takes out the wad of \n               bills and drops it on the table, at the same time sinking \n               into the chair vacated by Sammy. The tension amongst the \n               onlookers relaxes and Clint grins at Garvey and winks \n               significantly.\n\n<b>                                     GARVEY\n</b>                         Fine!

SUN-UP BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               MED. SHOT -- poker table, including Cap, who is watching. \n               Pap Fossler is dealing. There is an atmosphere of tension \n               around the table, and it is obvious that Clint has been \n               losing. As he picks up his cards, he is unable to restrain a \n               smile of triumph. Rocklin makes a bet. Pap Fossler and the \n               man next to him fold immediately.\n\n<b>                                     CLINT\n</b>                         Raise you twenty.\n\n               This is more than Rocklin has in front of him.\n\n<b>                                     PAP\n</b>                              (quietly)\n                         Table stakes, Clint.\n\n<b>                                     CLINT\n</b>                         Not if he wants to dig.\n\n               He stares challengingly at Rocklin. Rocklin takes out a \n               wallet, from which he removes a bill and sees the raise.\n\n<b>                                     GARVEY\n</b>                              (folding)\n                         No place for me.\n\n<b>                                     PAP\n</b>                         Cards?\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         One.\n\n<b>                                     CLINT\n</b>                              (eagerly)\n                         One for me.\n\n               He reaches for it almost before it is dealt and as a result \n               the card, a Queen, falls face up. Clint looks at it gleefully, \n               snatches it up and puts it in his hand. Rocklin watches him \n               impassively.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         Don't you know that Queen is dead?\n\n<b>                                     CLINT\n</b>                         I can take it if I want it.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         Sure -- if you want -- but you'll \n                         have to beat my hand with four cards.\n\n<b>                                     CLINT\n</b>                              (hotly)\n                         I'm playing these, mister!\n\n               Rocklin glances inquiringly at the other players. All are \n               dead-panned, unwilling to interfere. Rocklin looks toward \n               Cap, who stands near him.\n\n<b>                                     CAP\n</b>                              (shaking his head)\n                         I'm not settin' in.\n\n<b>                                     GARVEY\n</b>                              (smoothly)\n                         Why don't you split the pot?\n\n<b>                                     CLINT\n</b>                         I'm not splitting -- I'm betting!\n\n               He shoves all the money in front of him into the pot.\n\n<b>                                     CLINT\n</b>                         Are you calling?\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                              (calmly)\n                         No.\n\n               Clint excitedly starts to rake in the pot.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         I'm raising.\n\n               He shoves in the money in front of him, which is more than \n               Clint's and in addition takes from his wallet more bills.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         Dig.\n\n               Clint, very excited, empties his pockets, which is not enough.\n\n<b>                                     CLINT\n</b>                              (to other players)\n                         Let me have some money\n\n<b>                                     PAP\n</b>                              (speaking for all)\n                         You're in deep enough, Clint.\n\n<b>                                     CLINT\n</b>                              (disgusted, to Rocklin)\n                         I've called for all I've got.\n                              (spreads out his cards)\n                         Full house.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         No good.\n                              (spreads his hand)\n                         Kings up.

Clint, almost hysterical, \n               jumps up, draws his gun and thrusts it almost into Rocklin's \n               face.

He downs his drink, \n               and speaks his thought to Bob.\n\n<b>                                     GEORGE CLEWS\n</b>                         I'm gonna get his ears.\n\n               Suddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and \n               halts with the swinging doors half open.\n\n<b>                                     DAVE\n</b>                              (loudly)\n                         Hi you, George Clews --\n\n               George Clews turns.\n\n<b>                                     DAVE\n</b>                         Rocklin says if you don't come out, \n                         he'll come in here after you, an' \n                         tear you apart.\n\n               George Clews frowns. His eye catches sight of a king-size \n               glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis, \n               standing alongside him. That quick, Clews beats Shorty to \n               the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out. Cap, \n               anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from \n               under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty.\n\n<b>                                     SHORTY\n</b>                              (taps Clews)\n                         That was my beer, you know.\n\n<b>                                     GEORGE CLEWS\n</b>                              (nastily)\n                         If he comes in again -- I'll throw \n                         you.\n\n               Before Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the \n               little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that \n               sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him \n               struggling to get his hat off.

Behind him we see Clint \n               open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch \n               to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for \n               someone.\n\n               Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with \n               his sweeping.

Over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of \n               a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune \n               of the period. Clint's strained features relax in a can-that-\n               be-Arly expression, while Shelley stops dead in the middle \n               of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o.s.\n\n<b>               ANGLE\n</b>\n               From their ANGLE we first see only the corner of the house, \n               while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side. \n               Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and \n               Shelley watching her. She seems more attractive, in a feminine \n               way, this morning. It may be the skirt and blouse she is \n               wearing. Then again it may be the flower she is, even now, \n               adjusting in her hair. The presence of the two men suddenly \n               startles her.

Only the lower part of the animal \n               is seen, along with the legs of the rider.\n\n<b>               ROCKLIN AND DAVE HEAR THE SOUND OF RETREATING HOOF BEATS\n</b>\n               And they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent \n               toward the deep blackness of the trees.\n\n               Rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing -- \n               Dave close behind.\n\n               Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires.\n\n               The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night.\n\n               Dave starts after him again. Looking back, he sees Rocklin \n               has not moved.\n\n<b>                                     DAVE\n</b>                         Come on --\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         No use -- he's gone.\n\n<b>                                     DAVE\n</b>                         Mebbe we winged him.\n\n               He starts through the wet grass alone. Rocklin turns back \n               toward the cabin.\n\n<b>               DAVE - PLOUGHING THROUGH THE GRASS\n</b>\n               He has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight \n               embankment leads to the level of the trees. He is just \n               starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something \n               on the embankment, shining in the moonlight. It proves to be \n               a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver. \n               It is dry, so has evidently just been dropped. Dave pockets \n               it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail.\n\n<b>               ROCLKLIN - WHO HAS JUST ABOUT REACHED THE CABIN\n</b>\n               He looks back in Dave's direction, and then looking toward \n               the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses.\n\n<b>               THE CABIN DOOR IS PARTLY OPEN\n</b>\n               and through it Rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form \n               moving in the faint glow of the dying fire.\n\n<b>               ROCKLIN DRAWS HIS GUN AND MOVES STEALTHILY TOWARDS THE CABIN \n</b><b>               DOOR\n</b>\n<b>               INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches \n               the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the \n               fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk. He sees \n               the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in \n               the light of the fire. He sees him suddenly stop and pick up \n               something hidden from his view.\n\n               At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut.\n\n               The intruder whirls around.\n\n               It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant.\n\n               The two regard each other like vicious animals in the same \n               cage. Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it.\n\n               And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly -- \n               but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving his.\n\n               When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from behind \n               her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously \n               Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to \n               open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength to \n               prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand. \n               But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without \n               any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses \n               it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly relaxes \n               her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, and \n               tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her \n               feet.\n\n               He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the \n               floor.\n\n               Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. And \n               Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. He picks up his hat \n               and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through the \n               bullet holes.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                              (smiling wryly)\n                         Not bad shootin'.\n\n<b>                                     ARLY\n</b>                              (right back at him)\n                         You think I did that?\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         Sure -- to draw us away from here.\n                              (looks at his hat)\n                         You know, you cut it mighty close -- \n                         Good thing I ain't got brains enough \n                         to fill it.\n\n               Rocklin puts his hat on.

Garvey, checked for a second, looks up at Rocklin.\n\n<b>                                     GARVEY\n</b>                         What's the idea?\n\n               Rocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         These cards --\n\n<b>                                     GARVEY\n</b>                              (attempting to bluff \n                              it out)\n                         Anything wrong in a man having cards \n                         in his possession?\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         Depends on what kind they are -- \n                         'specially when they're under lock \n                         and key.\n\n               The two regard each other silently a moment. Now Rocklin \n               casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket.\n\n<b>                                     GARVEY\n</b>                              (too politely)\n                         You're taking those, I presume.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         That's right.\n\n               He takes a step away.

From the corner \n               of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle \n               drawer. Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a \n               blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove.\n\n               Rocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being \n               struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury. The \n               chair crashes against a window.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Miss Martin appraises the \n               girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across \n               the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even \n               stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt.\n\n<b>                                     MISS MARTIN\n</b>                              (quietly but viciously)\n                         Whatever is to become of you?\n\n               Clara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell.\n\n<b>                                     MISS MARTIN\n</b>                         Have you no sense of pride, or \n                         decency?

He starts up the steps and stops almost \n               immediately and stares o.s.\n\n<b>               ANGEL\n</b>\n               From Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around \n               in front of the building toward the stairway.\n\n<b>               CAMERA HOLDS\n</b>\n               Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position \n               around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the \n               stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward \n               the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala \n               come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact \n               position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a \n               moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, \n               and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of \n               the scene.\n\n<b>               INT.

The first rays \n               of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as \n               she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck \n               cavorting on the ground close to her. In a moment Rocklin \n               comes into view in the b.g. He spots Arly, who has her back \n               to him, and walks over. His approach frightens the woodchuck \n               away, and turns Arly's head toward him. Neither has anything \n               to say. Now Rocklin sits beside Arly, but faces the other \n               way.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                              (after a pause)\n                         Thanks.\n\n<b>                                     ARLY\n</b>                         For what?\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         Everything.\n\n               There is another stilted pause.\n\n<b>                                     ARLY\n</b>                              (her eyes sweeping \n                              the morning)\n                         Beautiful day.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                              (reflecting)\n                         It didn't start out so beautiful.\n\n<b>                                     ARLY\n</b>                         That's true of lots of things.\n\n<b>                                     ROCKLIN\n</b>                         Fer instance?\n\n<b>                                     ARLY\n</b>                              (hesitantly)\n                         Well -- you and -- me.\n\n               There is another pause.
