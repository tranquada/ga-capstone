The doors\r\n           open from both sides.\r\n          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the\r\n          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract\r\n          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both\r\n          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends\r\n          of the facility.\r\n          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and\r\n          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy\r\n          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS\r\n          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The\r\n          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then\r\n          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.\r\n          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of\r\n          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars\r\n          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding\r\n          everyone.\r\n          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the\r\n          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally\r\n          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.\r\n          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is\r\n          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.\r\n          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile\r\n          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and\r\n          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.\r\n\r\n<b>                          NICK FURY\r\n</b>           Sir, please put down the spear!\r\n          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury\r\n          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT\r\n          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss\r\n          Loki's fired shot.\r\n          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the\r\n          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the\r\n          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.\r\n          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his\r\n          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to\r\n          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost\r\n          gone to shit.\r\n          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton\r\n          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.\r\n\r\n<b>                          LOKI\r\n</b>           You have heart.\r\n          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's\r\n          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind\r\n          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands\r\n          straight.\r\n          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of\r\n          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,\r\n          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...\r\n\r\n<b>                          LOKI\r\n</b>           Please don't.
