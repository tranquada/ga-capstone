HUNGARY - BUDAPEST - 1973 - DAY                          1\r\n\r\n    Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building.\r\n    From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we\r\n    begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in\r\n    volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters,\r\n    cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG\r\n    BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n2   EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY                                    2\r\n\r\n    LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets\r\n    scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man\r\n    who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX.\r\n\r\n    ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who\r\n    we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The\r\n    girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket?\r\n\r\n    A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame.\r\n    Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into\r\n    a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't\r\n    Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks\r\n    over, shakes hands.\r\n\r\n    Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked\r\n    shirt, neither paying any attention to each other.\r\n\r\n    Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the\r\n    two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the\r\n    road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and\r\n    sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness\r\n    and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of\r\n    contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the\r\n    corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...\r\n\r\n\r\n3   EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - DAY                                        3\r\n\r\n    Shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing GALERIA\r\n    building on the corner ahead. Prideaux and the Magyar walk\r\n    up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and\r\n    head towards...\r\n\r\n\r\n4   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                                 4\r\n\r\n    A formerly grand arcade. Many of the shops are now closed,\r\n    the one's that are open don't have much to sell. A CAFE\r\n    occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A\r\n    JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused\r\n    shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the\r\n    glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking\r\n    coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter. The\r\n    ordinary world.\r\n                                                               2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the\r\ntables.\r\n\r\n                    MAGYAR\r\n              (Hungarian, subtitled)\r\n          And porkolts. You know porkolts?\r\n\r\n                    JIM PRIDEAUX\r\n              (Hungarian, subtitled)\r\n          Yes, I've had it.\r\n\r\n                    MAGYAR\r\n          It's very good. Better than\r\n          goulash. But you won't get it in\r\n          Budapest now.\r\n\r\n                    JIM PRIDEAUX\r\n          Why's that?\r\n\r\n                    MAGYAR\r\n          All the pigs have gone to Moscow.\r\n\r\nHe gives a sly laugh. Prideaux smiles, draws   on his\r\ncigarette, nonchalantly examining the people   at the tables\r\naround them. A WAITER arrives, belly bulging   out of his\r\ngrubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He   puts two\r\nwizened-looking sandwiches in front of them.\r\n\r\nPRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the\r\nWaiter's face, drips onto the table top.\r\n\r\nThe Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a\r\nwry smile - \"nice service.\" Jim smiles back but a bell has\r\nbegun to ring inside him.\r\n\r\n                    JIM PRIDEAUX\r\n          When do I get to meet your\r\n          friend?\r\n\r\nThe Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is\r\nignoring his.\r\n\r\n                    MAGYAR\r\n          I'll take you to him. Not eating?\r\n\r\nPrideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner\r\nstill easy, but his eyes flick after the Waiter, who stands\r\nat the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another\r\nman. He looks around the Galeria again, looking low -\r\nchecking the feet of the other customers? Then raising his\r\ngaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which\r\nlook down into the arcade.\r\n\r\nPRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - An OLD WOMAN stands in the shadows by a\r\nwindow above. She is watching him. Catching his gaze she\r\nshrinks back into the darkness and disappears.\r\n                                                                3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee\r\ncup down and casually stands. The Magyar looks up in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n                    JIM PRIDEAUX\r\n          Would you excuse me a moment?\r\n\r\nHe starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria. Behind\r\nhim his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back\r\nand lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to\r\nthe domed ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic\r\nflashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of\r\nhis belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing\r\nin the cavernous space.\r\n\r\nThe shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and\r\nPrideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run,\r\nas behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal\r\nNIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing,\r\nlike actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some\r\ndrawing guns. We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in\r\nRussian.\r\n\r\n                       KGB MAN\r\n          No firing!\r\n\r\nAhead of Prideaux   more figures appear, blocking the exit.\r\nHe looks over his   shoulder just as another SHOT rings out -\r\nthis one catching   him above the shoulder blade and sending\r\nhim flying out of   frame.\r\n\r\nFrom around a corner a tall, over-coated man - KGB -\r\nstrides towards the scene, still bellowing in Russian.\r\n\r\n                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Who told you to fire? Who told\r\n          you to fucking fire?\r\n\r\nTHE JAZZ BAND have stopped playing and are staring at the\r\nground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything.\r\n\r\nIn the TOP WINDOW - the OLD WOMAN slips back into sight.\r\n\r\nHER P.O.V. - Prideaux lies face down in the arcade below.\r\nAs we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of\r\nblood. Then he's still.\r\n\r\nBELOW - The KGB Man has grabbed the Waiter and started to\r\nbeat him.\r\n\r\n                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Fucking Hungarian amateur! We\r\n          wanted him alive!\r\n                                                                       4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Behind him we can see the breast-feeding MOTHER. She's\r\n     dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the\r\n     ricochet. The baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed.\r\n\r\n     Through the cafe window we can see a MAN, partly obscured\r\n     by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. He\r\n     lights a cigarette.\r\n\r\n     CLOSE ON THE LIGHTER as he replaces it. We can make out an\r\n     inscription: \"To George, from Ann. All my love.\"\r\n\r\n     In the Galeria the KGB Man continues to bellow at the\r\n     Waiter. The baby begins to WAIL.\r\n\r\n                                               FADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n                                                       FADE IN:\r\n\r\n\r\n4A   EXT. HQ OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE - \"THE CIRCUS\" - DAY         4A\r\n\r\n     A bird's eye view of the Circus.\r\n\r\n\r\n4B   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR -   - \"MOTHERS\" OFFICE - DAY       4B\r\n\r\n     A woman, CONNIE SACHS, a face that's seen it all, leans\r\n     against a wall, smoking. A middle-aged woman, one of the\r\n     secretaries or \"MOTHERS\" walks past, pushing a trolley of\r\n     documents. She nods at Connie mournfully. Connie looks\r\n     stricken. The Mother walks on into...\r\n\r\n\r\n5    INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                           5\r\n\r\n     A long conference table. We are looking at an ELDERLY MAN\r\n     at the head of the table. He's sitting on a rather ornate\r\n     carving chair - a little like a throne - and he looks ill.\r\n     He is signing documents, his signature a simple \"C,\"\r\n     scrawled in GREEN INK, aware all eyes are on him. A\r\n     cigarette burns away in an already loaded ashtray.\r\n\r\n     This is the head of the Circus - known as CONTROL.\r\n\r\n     Around him are four lieutenants - the inner circle of the\r\n     intelligence service - PERCY ALLELINE, TOBY ESTERHASE, ROY\r\n     BLAND and BILL HAYDON.\r\n\r\n     Beside him, his right-hand man - GEORGE SMILEY.\r\n\r\n     From the thick and embarrassed atmosphere we might guess we\r\n     are at the end of a coup, the final ousting of a King. All\r\n     we hear is the ticking of a loud clock and the scratch of\r\n     the pen.\r\n\r\n     Smiley looks up to find Alleline's gaze fixed on him.\r\n     Alleline quickly looks down at his hands.\r\n                                                                      5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    CLOSE ON SMILEY - as he examines the others, gauging the\r\n    SHIFT OF POWER occurring in the room.\r\n\r\n    - Bill Haydon - handsome, urbane, frowning with tension,\r\n    pulls on his cigarette.\r\n\r\n     - Roy Bland - heavy set and moustached, flicking a guilty\r\n    look up at Smiley and away.\r\n\r\n     - Toby Esterhase - immaculate hair and suit, eyes on\r\n    Alleline, watching for a cue, like a dog told to `stay'.\r\n\r\n    No-one will look at him.\r\n\r\n    ON SMILEY - realising there is no hope.\r\n\r\n    Control finishes, puts the pen back in his pocket. He hands\r\n    the file to the MOTHER who, red-eyed, walks with it out of\r\n    the room.\r\n\r\n                        PERCY ALLELINE\r\n                  (Scottish accent)\r\n              I wish I could have done more,\r\n              Control.\r\n\r\n                        CONTROL\r\n                  (Coolly)\r\n              You did all you could, Percy.\r\n              (Beat) Well, a man should know\r\n              when to leave the party.\r\n\r\n    Beat. The clock suddenly gives a discordant chime as it\r\n    sounds the hour. A hint of bitter amusement on Control's\r\n    face, as though he's been waiting for this wrong little\r\n    note to make his move. He grinds his cigarette out.\r\n\r\n    Toby can't wait any longer.\r\n\r\n                        TOBY ESTERHASE\r\n              What about Smiley?\r\n\r\n    Control looks at Smiley. His gaze impersonal...\r\n\r\n    ON SMILEY - the faintest flicker in his eyes as he tries to\r\n    prepare himself for the shock of dismissal.\r\n\r\n                        CONTROL\r\n              Smiley is leaving with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n6   OMITTED                                                       6\r\n\r\n\r\n7   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - DAY                               7\r\n\r\n    PUSHING Control and Smiley as they walk down the corridor.\r\n                                                                       6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Alleline and the Lieutenants are waiting for them. A\r\n     horribly awkward moment. Toby pulls open the cage lift\r\n     doors for them, as if to hasten the eviction. Haydon looks\r\n     at him with contempt.\r\n\r\n                         BILL HAYDON\r\n               You little prick Esterhase.\r\n\r\n     Control sweeps past them and the lift, determined to walk\r\n     every step of the way. Smiley follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n8    INT. CIRCUS - STAIRCASE - DAY                                 8\r\n\r\n     Control and Smiley, begin their descent through the rigid\r\n     hierarchy of the Circus. As we TRACK with them, we see that\r\n     each floor is its own WORLD. The two men walk past the\r\n     fourth floor REGISTRY - the vast archive of intelligence,\r\n     staffed by RESEARCHERS.\r\n\r\n     Smiley and Control pass down another flight and along the\r\n     third floor - INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS - heads poking out of\r\n     offices, amongst them JERRY WESTERBY.\r\n\r\n     Down to the second floor - SCALPHUNTERS - the muscle of the\r\n     Circus. The boredom of an air-port lounge, a sunken sofa\r\n     and pool-table. The Scalphunters watching them go in\r\n     respectful silence.\r\n\r\n     On down to the first floor TYPING POOL - staffed by pretty\r\n     young society girls - the DEBS - who watch open-mouthed, as\r\n     their Chief passes them for the last time. And finally\r\n     down to...\r\n\r\n\r\n9    INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                        9\r\n\r\n     An ancient doorman - BRYANT - feeling the moment must be\r\n     marked in some way - leaves his sentry box and opens the\r\n     main door for Control. Control acknowledges the salute with\r\n     a flick of his eyes and we push through the doors...\r\n\r\n\r\n10   EXT. CIRCUS - ROOF OF THE CIRCUS - DAY                       10\r\n\r\n     Alleline and Bland stand smoking, watching Control and\r\n     Smiley emerge onto the pavement.\r\n\r\n\r\n11   EXT. CIRCUS - DAY                                            11\r\n\r\n     CONTROL and SMILEY stand on the street. They stare at each\r\n     other for a moment. This is goodbye. They shake hands.\r\n     Perhaps there's a little reserve in Control's manner, a\r\n     lack of warmth. From the expression on Smiley's face we see\r\n     that he is pained by this.\r\n                                                                       7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Control puts his collar up and walks away. Smiley stands\r\n     forlornly as Control disappears into the crowd.\r\n\r\n     TITLES OVER A MONTAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n12   EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - AUTUMN DAY                             12\r\n\r\n     THE WATER OF THE POND - still, glassy.\r\n\r\n     A MAN'S head breaks the surface - Smiley swimming through\r\n     his retirement.\r\n\r\n     He takes a breath and submerges again. Beyond him we see a\r\n     straggled diagonal line of elderly heads, bobbing through\r\n     the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n13   EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - DAY                                    13\r\n\r\n     Smiley dries himself under the trees, pink and raw in the\r\n     cold fresh air. He smooths his hair down, feeling a little\r\n     less ridiculous. He looks over to where a VERY ELDERLY\r\n     SWIMMER is being helped into the water - little more than\r\n     trembling bones.\r\n\r\n     Is this his world now?\r\n\r\n\r\n14   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - DAY                              14\r\n\r\n     A MOTHER unloads a stack of files from a LIFT shaft and\r\n     places them into her wheeled safe. A piece of CHRISTMAS\r\n     TINSEL is wound along the trolley. We track with her\r\n     through the HIVE-LIKE atmosphere of the fifth floor, behind\r\n     her the conference room - a glimpse of Alleline in\r\n     Control's chair, surrounded by his lieutenants - smoke and\r\n     whiskey - engaged in the business of the world.\r\n\r\n     She pushes on into Alleline's OFFICE - loads the new files\r\n     into the LARGE SAFE there, locks and spins the combination.\r\n\r\n\r\n15   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - WINTER DAY                             15\r\n\r\n     Smiley stands frying an egg in his small kitchen.\r\n\r\n\r\n16   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    16\r\n\r\n     Smiley sits eating his solitary lunch, reading a volume of\r\n     Grimmelshausen. He turns a page, examines the illustration\r\n     of a knight and a dragon - holds it at arms length, trying\r\n     to focus on it.\r\n                                                                        8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                      16A\r\n\r\n      Smiley lies in the double bed, a conspicuous empty space next\r\n      to him. He leans over and turns the light out.\r\n\r\n\r\n17    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - ALLELINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT        17\r\n\r\n      A HAND removes files from the LARGE SAFE.\r\n\r\n      ON A BRIEFCASE - as the files - marked TOP SECRET - are\r\n      slipped inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n18    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - EVENING                          18\r\n\r\n      P.O.V. MYSTERY MAN\r\n\r\n      ... TRACKING through the near-empty offices. All the\r\n      drawers of the desks are OPEN. BINS on the tables. A few\r\n      mothers working late, illuminated by their desk lamps. One\r\n      of them is applying lipstick, prior to leaving. She doesn't\r\n      react as we track by.\r\n\r\n\r\n19    EXT. OPTICIANS - SPRING DAY                                  19\r\n\r\n      We are looking at large blurred LETTERS. A lens is slotted\r\n      into our frame and the letters leap into BOLD.\r\n\r\n      Smiley is in a chair, being fitted for spectacles.\r\n\r\n\r\n20    INT. OPTICIANS - DAY                                         20\r\n\r\n      Smiley is selecting frames from a display. He tries on a\r\n      pair, watched by a bored shop assistant, used to the\r\n      pedantic ways of the retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n21    INT.

LONDON UNDERGROUND - EVENING                            22\r\n\r\n      A packed train - Businessmen in bowler hats, long-haired\r\n      seventies youth - the old and the new bumping underneath\r\n      the city. We track low level until we find our MYSTERY MAN,\r\n      the BRIEFCASE clutched in his hand.\r\n                                                                      9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n23   EXT.

Through\r\n     the window she catches a glimpse of the Mystery Man's legs\r\n     passing, the briefcase in his hand as he walks up the steps\r\n     towards the front door. Calmly she dries her hands as the\r\n     doorbell rings and her DOG begins to bark furiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n25   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      25\r\n\r\n     Mrs McCraig opens the door and the figure passes her and\r\n     the barking dog without a word and begins to walk up the\r\n     stairs...\r\n\r\n\r\n26   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                    26\r\n\r\n     Smiley adds a LETTER to a pile on the mantelpiece. We see\r\n     the letters are all addressed to ANN SMILEY.\r\n\r\n     He straightens up, finds himself staring at a PAINTING on\r\n     the wall - a muddy abstract.\r\n\r\n\r\n27   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                      27\r\n\r\n     The room is almost bare - two chairs at a small table on\r\n     which stands two desk lamps and a CAMERA. The Mystery Man\r\n     has crossed to the wall by the window and opens the GRILL\r\n     on an AIR DUCT.\r\n\r\n\r\n28   EXT.

He walks towards the house...\r\n\r\n\r\n29   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                      29\r\n\r\n     The Mystery man settles at the table, sorting through the\r\n     contents of the briefcase as, from down below, we hear the\r\n     sound of the door bell, the dog barking and footsteps on\r\n     the stairs. Polyakov walks into the room and joins the\r\n     Mystery Man at the small table. He picks up the camera with\r\n     a smile.\r\n\r\n                         POLYAKOV\r\n                   (In Russian)\r\n               Shall we begin?\r\n                                                                        10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      END OF TITLES\r\n\r\n\r\n30    EXT.

This\r\n      is the unlikely home of Oliver Lacon, Permanent under-\r\n      secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n30A   INT./EXT. LACON'S HOUSE - MORNING                           30A\r\n\r\n      As we watch a young girl - JACKIE LACON - appears at the\r\n      living room window in her night-dress, playing with a toy. As\r\n      we watch her we hear stealthy footsteps approach. Then a MAN\r\n      steps into frame, his back to us, watching the girl through\r\n      the window. He taps on the glass with one hand. Jackie looks\r\n      up, surprised.\r\n\r\n      As we pull back a little we see the man has his other hand\r\n      behind his back.\r\n\r\n      And in it is a long, bone-handled KNIFE.\r\n\r\n      Behind Jackie we see a string bean of a man, OLIVER LACON,\r\n      tying his silk dressing gown as he cautiously approaches the\r\n      window. On the other side, the intruder stands, smoking.\r\n\r\n                              LACON\r\n                        (through glass)\r\n                   This is private property. Who are\r\n                   you?\r\n\r\n      He takes in the man before him - filthy and bearded, you\r\n      could mistake him for a tramp. But beneath the grime he's\r\n      tanned and his eyes have a dangerous, feral edge. This is\r\n      RICKI TARR.\r\n\r\n                             RICKI TARR\r\n                   Minister Lacon.\r\n\r\n      He smiles.\r\n\r\n                             LACON\r\n                   What do you want?\r\n\r\n                             RICKI TARR\r\n                   I want to talk to Control.

It's Haydon, one foot\r\n      up on his pedal, scootering along the corridor. Guillam\r\n      waits for him. He likes this man.\r\n\r\n                          PETER GUILLAM\r\n                    (of the bike)\r\n                Has that been cleared?\r\n\r\n                          BILL HAYDON\r\n                I'm not bloody chaining it\r\n                outside.

Inside is a\r\n      very pretty GIRL, a new DEB, being shown the ropes by an\r\n      older woman.\r\n\r\n                          HAYDON\r\n                Thought I'd get a glimpse of the\r\n                new girl. Before Bland gets to\r\n                her. He seen her yet?\r\n\r\n                          GUILLAM\r\n                Oh yes. Down first thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n      GIRL'S P.O.V. -\r\n\r\n      ... as Haydon and Guillam pass, staring in at her, cropped\r\n      above the waist. Haydon appears to be gliding\r\n      supernaturally by. He gives a little wave.\r\n\r\n\r\n      BACK ON HAYDON:\r\n\r\n                          HAYDON\r\n                You may fuck me, Belinda, but you\r\n                still have to call me sir in the\r\n                morning.\r\n\r\n      Guillam grins. Haydon glides off, hand raised in farewell\r\n      as Guillam turns into the Scalphunters arena.\r\n                                                                        12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n34    INT.

A pool ball thwacks the window, cracking it. At the\r\n      same moment the PHONE begins to ring. Guillam jerks\r\n      upright, looks over at the pool players, too bored to be\r\n      angry.\r\n\r\n                          POOL PLAYER (O.S.)\r\n                Sorry Peter.\r\n\r\n      Guillam answers the phone.\r\n\r\n                          PETER GUILLAM\r\n                Peter Guillam...\r\n\r\n      He listens to the voice on the other end. After a moment he\r\n      turns away from his colleagues, his former drowsiness\r\n      abruptly gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n35    EXT.

He glances at\r\n      a painting on the wall - a muddy ABSTRACT. He crosses to\r\n      examine it and then notices the bundle of Ann's unopened\r\n      letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n39    INT.

It dawns on him that he really has invaded Smiley's\r\n      privacy.\r\n\r\n      Smiley appears in a coat behind him, taking in Guillam's\r\n      awkwardness. He gives a thin smile.\r\n\r\n                          SMILEY\r\n                Are we going far?\r\n\r\n\r\n39A   INT.

A tall, well built young man -\r\n     FAWN - stands on guard. Lacon gestures to him and Fawn opens\r\n     the french windows and he and Guillam walk out onto the\r\n     terrace beyond.\r\n                                                                       15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     Behind them, unnoticed, young JACKIE creeps back into the\r\n     room and slips behind the sofa.\r\n\r\n                         LACON\r\n               Your wife, the lovely Ann?

In\r\n               Penang. Good with women. Likes to\r\n               talk. What did he say to you?\r\n\r\n                         LACON\r\n               He said he had some intelligence\r\n               for Control. Had no idea he was\r\n               dead. The news obviously hadn't\r\n               reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he\r\n               said he would only tell it to\r\n               someone outside the Circus. If he\r\n               couldn't have a Minister, he would\r\n               settle for the Under-secretary.\r\n               Lucky me.\r\n\r\n     Lacon lights a cigarette, smokes a moment, building up to\r\n     something. Smiley waits him out. The room has become very\r\n     still.\r\n\r\n                         LACON (CONT'D)\r\n               He said there's a mole.

A dapper little man in a club tie - FAWLEY - sits\r\n     behind his desk, idly tapping a desk toy - a Newton's\r\n     Cradle. He too checks his watch. Lunch time. Gets up and\r\n     walks out of his office.\r\n\r\n     Guillam counts to ten under his breath and then abruptly,\r\n     walks out of the men's room, across the corridor and\r\n     into...\r\n\r\n\r\n58   INT.

After\r\n      a moment, a man, his lover - RICHARD - a decade or so\r\n      older - walks behind him, stroking his hair tenderly, and\r\n      joins him at the table. Guillam automatically checks the\r\n      window - the flat opposite, a lit window - could someone\r\n      see them? He gets up and closes the curtains, settles back\r\n      at the table, passing Richard a section of the paper. The\r\n      two sit in domestic contentment, reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n62A   EXT.

Smiley sits at the window listening to the MUSIC.\r\n\r\n      Guillam dictates from a photograph of the documents he took\r\n      at the circus.\r\n\r\n      Smiley becomes aware that the others are watching him. He\r\n      turns away, tunes the radio into a DIFFERENT STATION,\r\n      cutting the Charlie Rich tune.\r\n\r\n                          PETER GUILLAM\r\n                Jerry Westerby, dismissed\r\n                December 4th.

He\r\n      writes Connie's name on a slip of paper, pastes it to a\r\n      chess piece.\r\n\r\n      There is a knock at the door. Mendel lets LACON into the\r\n      room excluding a very excited MRS. POPE GRAHAM.

The string\r\n      orchestra practice - rows of twelve-year old boys sawing\r\n      away at their instruments.

As we watch an old blue Alvis, towing a\r\n     battered, second hand CARAVAN, appears - reflected in the\r\n     window - driving past.\r\n\r\n     Roach watches, thrilled to realise he is the sole witness\r\n     of this MYSTERIOUS NEW ARRIVAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n66   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY             66\r\n\r\n     We're looking down into the dip, at the DRIVER of the blue\r\n     Alvis, setting up his caravan on bricks, in the gloom and\r\n     rain. He's wearing a waterproof cape and hood, obscuring\r\n     his face, giving him something of an air of mystery and\r\n     menace. There's something odd about the way he moves,\r\n     something about his back, as if it's been knocked out of\r\n     true...\r\n\r\n     The Driver rocks the caravan from side to side, loading\r\n     bricks underneath, trying to get the thing level.\r\n\r\n     He senses something and turns to find Roach behind him.\r\n     Roach instinctively takes a step back from the hooded\r\n     figure. Then, gathering his courage, he holds out his hand.\r\n\r\n     In his palm, a MARBLE.\r\n\r\n     LATER:\r\n\r\n     Roach stands in the caravan, watching the MARBLE as it\r\n     rolls backwards and forwards on the windowsill - an\r\n     improvised spirit level. THE MARBLE comes to rest at the\r\n     centre of the sill, a temporary equilibrium.\r\n\r\n     Roach turns excitedly to the camera, about to call to the\r\n     Driver, but sees something that stops him in his tracks...\r\n\r\n     The Driver has stopped, his back to us, breathing hard,\r\n     perhaps from the exercise or perhaps fighting down some\r\n     pain. The wind catches at his cape and it flutters to one\r\n     side, revealing the sweat-soaked shirt beneath. As we watch\r\n     a DARK STAIN appears at his shoulder blade and begins to\r\n     spread. It's BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n67   EXT.

Control throws him a\r\n     FILE.\r\n\r\n                         CONTROL\r\n                   (To Smiley)\r\n               Sit down and take a look at this\r\n               nonsense.\r\n\r\n     Smiley sits down and begins to read.\r\n\r\n                         CONTROL (CONT'D)\r\n               Report by Soviet High Command on\r\n               their recent naval exercises in\r\n               the Black Sea. Just what the\r\n               Admiralty have been begging us\r\n               for some information on.\r\n\r\n                         SMILEY\r\n                   (Engrossed)\r\n               Where did you get it?\r\n\r\n                         CONTROL\r\n               I didn't. Percy and his little\r\n               cabal walked in with it.\r\n\r\n                          TOBY ESTERHASE\r\n                   (Protesting \"cabal\")\r\n               Control...\r\n\r\n                         CONTROL\r\n               Shut up, Esterhase.\r\n\r\n     Control waves him down. Smiley considers the report\r\n     dispassionately.\r\n\r\n                         SMILEY\r\n               If it's genuine it's gold-dust.\r\n               (Beat) But its topicality makes\r\n               it suspect.\r\n                                                             38.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nControl turns to Alleline, with a mocking smile.\r\n\r\n                    CONTROL\r\n          Smiley is suspicious, Percy.\r\n          Smells a fake.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n          Where does it come from? What's\r\n          the access?\r\n\r\n                    CONTROL\r\n          Percy doesn't feel like telling.\r\n\r\nPercy packs his pipe, enjoys the moment - the young lion\r\nchallenging the old.\r\n\r\n                    PERCY ALLELINE\r\n          A new secret source of mine.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n          But how could he possibly have\r\n          access to...?\r\n\r\n                    PERCY ALLELINE\r\n          He has access to the most\r\n          sensitive levels of policy\r\n          making.\r\n\r\nSmiley stares at him, staggered. If it's true, this is the\r\njackpot. Alleline enjoys his amazement, he leans over -\r\npoints with bureaucratic pride to the FLAMES on the LETTER\r\nHEAD.\r\n\r\n                    PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D)\r\n          We have named the operation\r\n          \"Witchcraft.\"\r\n\r\n                      SMILEY\r\n                (Faintly)\r\n          We?\r\n\r\n                    CONTROL\r\n          Percy and his pals have bypassed\r\n          us, Smiley. Gone straight to the\r\n          Minister. Everyone's very\r\n          excited. Percy's to be allowed to\r\n          keep the identity of his new\r\n          friend top secret.\r\n\r\n                    PERCY ALLELINE\r\n          The Minister agrees with me that\r\n          too many secrets are blown around\r\n          here. Too much failure, too many\r\n          scandals, too little solid\r\n          intelligence!\r\n\r\nControl is still smiling but only now do we realise he is\r\nalmost shaking with fury.\r\n                                                             39.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CONTROL\r\n          Luckily Percy's cabal has come to\r\n          save us.\r\n\r\n                    PERCY ALLELINE\r\n              (Bulldozing on)\r\n          It's all office politics here.\r\n\r\n                    ROY BLAND\r\n          Percy does have a point, Control.\r\n          We should be fighting communism,\r\n          not each other.\r\n\r\n                    PERCY ALLELINE\r\n          Meanwhile we're losing our\r\n          reputation, our partners...\r\n\r\n                    CONTROL\r\n          Your bloody Yanks!\r\n\r\n                    PERCY ALLELINE\r\n              (Shouting)\r\n          And we've had enough! There's\r\n          going to be changes, Smiley!\r\n          Changes.\r\n\r\nToby Esterhase finds his moment.\r\n\r\n                    TOBY ESTERHASE\r\n          We need to decide if we're part\r\n          of the past, or part of the\r\n          future.\r\n\r\n                     CONTROL\r\n              (Contemptuous)\r\n          I should have left you where I\r\n          found you.\r\n\r\n                    ROY BLAND\r\n          Control, if we could all just...\r\n\r\n                    CONTROL\r\n          OUT! ALL OF YOU!\r\n\r\nAlleline, Bland and Esterhase leave. For a moment it looks\r\nas if Haydon will stay, but then he stands up, shaking his\r\nhead and saunters out.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n              (Cautiously)\r\n          If Witchcraft is genuine...\r\n\r\nNow the others have left, Control seems to sag under the\r\nweight of some unnamed fear. He turns a haggard face to\r\nSmiley.\r\n\r\n                    CONTROL\r\n          I don't trust miracles.\r\n                                                                       40.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     We hear a KNOCKING and find ourselves back in...\r\n\r\n\r\n82   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY - PRESENT             82\r\n\r\n     Mendel holds two mugs of tea in one hand, gives the agreed\r\n     knock at Smiley's door again. After a moment a bleary\r\n     Smiley opens the door and lets him in.\r\n\r\n\r\n83   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY                       83\r\n\r\n     Mendel passes him the tea, takes in the desk piled high\r\n     with papers.\r\n\r\n                          MENDEL\r\n                   (Of the tea)\r\n               Courtesy of Mrs P.

THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PLAYING FIELDS - DAY                 84\r\n\r\n     Prideaux is running around the track, pounding along with his\r\n     odd, loping stride. A group of BOYS watch him pass. One -\r\n     SPIKELEY - mimics the run to the amusement of the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n85   INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      85\r\n\r\n     A fire burns in the little grate.\r\n\r\n     ROACH sits near the back of the class. The BOY behind slaps\r\n     the back of his neck with a ruler. Roach flinches but\r\n     doesn't say anything. The Boy does it again.\r\n\r\n     Prideaux drops a pile of books onto the desk of a boy -\r\n     SPIKELY.\r\n\r\n                         PRIDEAUX\r\n               Hand those out.\r\n\r\n     He crosses to the board begins to write on it - JE\r\n     M'APPELLE MONSIEUR ELL...\r\n\r\n     Behind him Spikely hands out the books, continuing to walk\r\n     like a HUNCHBACK.\r\n\r\n     The class snigger. Prideaux hears but doesn't turn,\r\n     continues writing.\r\n\r\n     Then from the CHIMNEY comes an unnerving SCRABBLING sound.\r\n     A little soot falls...\r\n\r\n     The sniggering fades out as all eyes turn nervously to the\r\n     fire... what is that noise?\r\n\r\n     Then, with a terrifying SCREECH, an OWL drops down into the\r\n     grate, thrashes in the flames before flapping out into the\r\n     class, its wings now ON FIRE, shrieking hideously, headed\r\n     straight for Spikely who stands frozen in shock as the bird\r\n     swoops towards his face.\r\n\r\n     Then...\r\n\r\n     ... somehow, Prideaux is THERE and grabs the burning bird\r\n     from the air and in a second has it folded in on itself,\r\n     NECK SNAPPED, and strides out of the room with it.\r\n\r\n     The boys stare after their new teacher in SHOCKED SILENCE.\r\n                                                                       42.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n86   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY             86\r\n\r\n     Roach is hiding, spying down on the caravan below, where\r\n     Prideaux sits in the doorway, massaging his raised\r\n     shoulder, and drinking something from a green beaker.\r\n\r\n                         PRIDEAUX\r\n                   (After a moment)\r\n               Come down here.\r\n\r\n     Frightened, Roach obeys, sliding down the dip to him.\r\n     Prideaux examines him fiercely. Finally his face relaxes a\r\n     little.\r\n\r\n                         PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)\r\n                   (Identifying him)\r\n               Boy with the marble.\r\n\r\n                          ROACH\r\n               Yes sir.\r\n\r\n                         PRIDEAUX\r\n               Gave me a turn up there, parked\r\n               on the horizon. Thought you were\r\n               a Juju man. What's your name?\r\n\r\n                         BILL ROACH\r\n               Sir, Roach, sir. Bill. I'm a new\r\n               boy.\r\n\r\n                         PRIDEAUX\r\n               New arrival, eh? Middle of year?\r\n               What's the story?\r\n\r\n     Roach hesitates.\r\n\r\n                         BILL ROACH\r\n                   (Blushing)\r\n               My mother and father... my\r\n               father's left, so...\r\n\r\n     He doesn't know how to explain his misery any further.\r\n     Prideaux pretends not to notice.\r\n\r\n                         PRIDEAUX\r\n               Bill? The unpaid Bill.

They've all\r\n               been good `uns. What you good at?\r\n\r\n     Roach tries desperately to think of something.\r\n                                                                       43.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BILL ROACH\r\n               Nothing sir.\r\n\r\n     The boy's eyes start to MIST UP. Prideaux looks down,\r\n     busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt.\r\n\r\n                         PRIDEAUX\r\n               You're a good watcher though eh?\r\n               Us loners always are. No one else\r\n               spotted me when I turned up here.\r\n               Best watcher in the unit,\r\n               Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as\r\n               he's got his specs on. Right?\r\n\r\n                         BILL ROACH\r\n                   (Gratefully)\r\n               Yes sir.\r\n\r\n     Prideaux finishes his drink, nods to Roach.\r\n\r\n                         PRIDEAUX\r\n               Free period, isn't it? Don't\r\n               waste it down here.\r\n\r\n     Roach sets off up the dip. He looks back and sees Prideaux\r\n     has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to\r\n     him, rubbing his aching shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n87   EXT.

A car pulls up\r\n      across the road TUFTY THESINGER - a boiled-looking British\r\n      spy, not over-bright, signals to him.

She walks on past and into the bedroom. The Maid\r\n     jumps out of the bed, grabs her clothes and flees. Boris\r\n     lies, unconcerned, reaches for his cigarettes.\r\n\r\n     Irina walks past him and we track with her as she enters a\r\n     BATHROOM. The glass window here is two-thirds frosted and\r\n     we lose her as she bends over a basin.\r\n\r\n     Something about her has caught Tarr's attention and he\r\n     leaves the binoculars, walking closer to the window.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly IRINA straightens up, her head above the frosted\r\n     glass and stares straight at us...\r\n\r\n\r\n93   EXT.

Then a car sweeps past on the\r\n     road below and there's a flash of light behind Ricki's head\r\n     - the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible\r\n     BINOCULARS. Irina absorbs this. Above everything else,\r\n     anger at her humiliation being observed.\r\n                                                                        47.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n94    EXT.

He stubs out his\r\n      cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed. As we watch he\r\n      draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring\r\n      our view. Seconds later the curtains billow as Irina is\r\n      thrown against them. We watch as her shape is rolled along\r\n      the window by the force of Boris' blows. Finally the\r\n      billowing fabric settles. Moments later Boris opens the\r\n      curtains again and starts to dress. Irina lies on the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n94A   EXT.

He's been tortured,\r\n      one eye gouged out. The other manages to convey a rather\r\n      touching amazement at the violence worked on him. His throat\r\n      has been slit wide open.

He's been tortured, the\r\n      shower curtain used to catch the pooling blood.\r\n\r\n      She BACKS AWAY across the room to the door, leaving a trail\r\n      of bloody footprints on the pale carpet.\r\n\r\n      She turns to the door, looks out of the SPY HOLE.\r\n\r\n      Her P.O.V. - two men, TINY DISTORTED FIGURES walking down\r\n      the corridor towards her.\r\n\r\n      The phone starts to RING.

Yellow one for the bag\r\n          sir.\r\n\r\nBryant stamps a PINK chit and hands it to Guillam, pulling\r\nopen the lift cage. He gives him a yellow slip for the bag.\r\n\r\nGuillam climbs inside and begins to ascend, rattlingly\r\nslowly. As Bryant's head disappears...\r\n\r\n                    PETER GUILLAM\r\n          Time you oiled this thing, isn't\r\n          it?\r\n\r\n                    BRYANT (O.S.)\r\n          We keep asking...\r\n\r\nGuillam examines the chit. He wipes his hands. For the\r\nfirst time we realize how NERVOUS he is.\r\n\r\nPolished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the\r\nuniform trousers of a short man. A self-important JANITOR.\r\n\r\nGuillam steps out and the Janitor checks Guillam's pink and\r\nyellow chit and motions him through a turnstile. Then he\r\nstops him short. He gestures for Guillam to raise his arms.\r\n\r\n                    PETER GUILLAM\r\n          You're kidding?\r\n\r\n                       JANITOR PETE\r\n          New rules.\r\n\r\nGuillam is briskly frisked.\r\n\r\n                    PETER GUILLAM\r\n          Mind the jewels.\r\n\r\n                    JANITOR PETE\r\n          Pen and watch sir.\r\n\r\nHe holds up a box and Guillam hands him his fountain pen\r\nand watch.\r\n\r\nThe search over Guillam sets off down the corridor,\r\nunnerved by the task ahead - betraying his own kind.\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON (O.S.)\r\n          What the hell are you doing up\r\n          here?\r\n\r\nGuillam freezes. Then he turns. It's Bill Haydon standing\r\nin a doorway, frowning at him over his spectacles. A\r\nmoment.\r\n                                                                       61.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PETER GUILLAM\r\n                You don't look pleased to see me,\r\n                Bill?\r\n\r\n                          BILL HAYDON\r\n                Why would I be?

Stick to sitting\r\n                on my arse.\r\n\r\n      They've reached the end of the corridor. Haydon peels away,\r\n      a hand raised in farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n134   INT.

Another janitor is removing\r\n      files from it.\r\n\r\n      Radiating out from the lift cage are the shelves of files\r\n      that make up the reading room.\r\n                                                                        63.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      We find Guillam moving along the shelves reading the\r\n      fluorescent number cards. He takes a file out, leaving his\r\n      green slip in the brackets provided by each file. Guillam\r\n      looks across at his real objective...\r\n\r\n      A row of anonymous looking files on the next aisle - the\r\n      archived DUTY OFFICER'S LOG-BOOKS, spines bearing the year\r\n      and month they cover.\r\n\r\n      And in his way - a GIRL perched on a ladder, a MAN mending\r\n      a radiator. The Man turns round and stares straight at\r\n      Guillam. Suddenly he POINTS STRAIGHT AT HIM. For a moment\r\n      Guillam freezes, unnerved. Then he glances over his\r\n      shoulder and realises the Man is communicating with another\r\n      WORKMAN behind him.\r\n\r\n      Abruptly, Guillam walks over to the file and swaps it,\r\n      keeping the title close to his chest. He goes back to his\r\n      desk, a light film of sweat on his forehead.\r\n\r\n      He sits, a pencil clamped between his teeth, waiting...\r\n      From somewhere nearby comes the sound of a PHONE RINGING,\r\n      then being answered.

He was on his way back\r\n          to Russia, and we were pretty\r\n          sure he was going to be executed.\r\n          Plane had a twenty-four lay over\r\n          at Delhi, and that's how long I\r\n          had to convince him to come over\r\n          to us instead of going home to\r\n          die.\r\n\r\nSmiley stares at the room around, projecting his memory of\r\nthe Delhi cell onto their present surroundings.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Little room...I'm sitting\r\n          here...he's sitting there...\r\n\r\nHe points to an EMPTY CHAIR in front of him.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n          The Americans have had him\r\n          tortured.\r\n\r\nHe holds up his right hand.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n          No fingernails. It's incredibly\r\n          hot. I'm very tired and all I\r\n          want to do is get this over with\r\n          and get back home. Things weren't\r\n          going well with Ann.\r\n\r\nGuillam flinches a little, but Smiley doesn't notice, lost\r\nnow in the past.\r\n\r\n                     SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n          I give him the usual pitch...\r\n          Come to the West and we can give\r\n          you a comfortable life. After\r\n          questioning. Or you can catch\r\n          your plane and fly home and be\r\n          shot, like Bykov, Shur,\r\n          Muranov...\r\n\r\nHe stares at the CHAIR as if expecting an answer, and\r\nslightly drunkenly Guillam finds himself turning to the\r\nCHAIR for a response.\r\n                                                             73.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PETER GUILLAM\r\n              (Beat)\r\n          What did he say?\r\n\r\nSmiley doesn't answer - STARES AT THE CHAIR - the silence\r\nstretching - it's all becoming a little surreal.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n              (To the chair)\r\n          Think of your wife. You have a\r\n          wife, don't you? I brought you\r\n          some cigarettes, by the way.\r\n\r\nHe mimes placing cigarettes on an invisible table, between\r\nhim and the chair.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Use my lighter.\r\n\r\nHe mimes placing the lighter beside the cigarettes.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n          \"We could arrange for her to join\r\n          you, we have a lot of stock to\r\n          trade.

Not one word.\r\n                Next morning he got back on his\r\n                plane, gave the pack of\r\n                cigarettes back to me, untouched -\r\n                this was a chain-smoker, mind -\r\n                and flew off to what he presumed\r\n                would be his death. He kept my\r\n                lighter. It was a gift - \"To\r\n                George, from Ann.

Because he's a\r\n                fanatic. And the fanatic is\r\n                always concealing a secret doubt.\r\n\r\n                          PETER GUILLAM\r\n                What did he look like?\r\n\r\n                          SMILEY\r\n                That's the thing.

A bike up on the wall,\r\n      a pair of muddy climbing boots on a newspaper, waiting to\r\n      be cleaned. Haydon walks past a shelf - photographs and\r\n      books. He stops, picks up an unframed black and white snap\r\n      from the shelf. It's a picture of HIMSELF.\r\n                                                                        81.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Haydon stands with his back to us, possibly crying.

SMILEY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - PAST            167A\r\n\r\n       The phone on the nightstand starts to ring. A woman's hand\r\n       reaches into frame and picks it up.\r\n\r\n                            WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n                 Hello?\r\n                     (beat)\r\n                 Oh hello Jerry.

LONDON STREETS - NIGHT                                 168\r\n\r\n       A black Cab pulls up at the lights. Another black cab pulls\r\n       alongside it. The two drivers acknowledge each other,\r\n       chatting as the lights change to RED, but in no hurry to\r\n       move.\r\n\r\n       An impatient woman passenger flicks a look at the passenger\r\n       in the opposite cab, wanting to share this moment of\r\n       passenger outrage.\r\n\r\n       We see ALLELINE'S profile staring stonily ahead.\r\n\r\n       We follow his cab as it peels off into a FAMILIAR street,\r\n       driving towards the house where we met Polyakov.\r\n\r\n\r\n169    EXT.

Smiley's head breaks the\r\n       surface, dips in, breaks the surface...\r\n\r\n\r\n170    EXT.

A MAN'S HEAD\r\n       appears, swimming up to the platform through the reeds. An\r\n       old QUEEN, his face almost purple with the cold. He clings\r\n       to the edge of the platform for a moment.\r\n\r\n                           OLD MAN\r\n                 Just in case it's of interest,\r\n                 dear. We are observed.

Not very subtle\r\n                 but there you are...\r\n                                                                        83.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      He swims away. The wind lifts up a little, rustling the\r\n      trees and bushes around the pond. We stay on Smiley,\r\n      watched and alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n171   OMITTED                                                     171\r\n\r\n\r\n172   OMITTED                                                     172\r\n\r\n\r\n173   OMITTED                                                     173\r\n\r\n\r\n174   INT.

He crosses to the drawing room, still looking at\r\n      the mail.\r\n\r\n      The door is a little ajar and through the opening we catch\r\n      a FLASH of movement in the room beyond - a COUPLE in a\r\n      passionate embrace, glimpsed for a moment before they\r\n      disappear out of sight. We can hear what may be their love-\r\n      making. And a RECORD IS PLAYING. The same CHARLIE RICH\r\n      track Smiley reacted to in the Islay Hotel.\r\n\r\n      Smiley stares at the mail in his hand as if unwilling to\r\n      look up.\r\n\r\n      He pushes open the door and moves into...\r\n\r\n\r\n175   INT.

He pauses for a moment, drawing a Hungarian\r\n      newspaper from his pocket. As he does so he glances at the\r\n      other passengers walking past him. TWO WOMEN and a MAN, all\r\n      apparently travelling alone, the SHOES they're wearing -\r\n      BROWN SUEDE BOOTS, FUR LINED BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS and the\r\n      man - a pair of BLACK GALOSHES.\r\n\r\n      Prideaux walks on, tapping the paper against his leg.\r\n\r\n\r\n184   INT.

The Waiter puts\r\n      down Prideaux's plate, a drop of sweat from his forehead\r\n      hitting the table. He looks at the droplet, fakes a smile\r\n      for the Magyar, looks after the Waiter, scans the floor\r\n      around him...\r\n\r\n      HIS P.O.V. - There it is - one of the women is wearing the\r\n      BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS. Her coat is different and she's\r\n      wearing a fur hat now - but the shoes are the one thing the\r\n      surveillance agents don't have time to change.\r\n\r\n      Prideaux glances up at the apartment windows above, sees\r\n      the old woman, starts to rise... as we CUT TO:\r\n\r\n      The SHOT -\r\n\r\n      ... punching into his back, Prideaux falling forward... as\r\n      we CUT TO:\r\n\r\n\r\n      PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V.\r\n\r\n      Those shoes again, stepping in the water and blood on the\r\n      floor, passing us at eye-level. Grouping and regrouping as\r\n      the operation comes to an end. The noise in the background\r\n      comes to us muted and very faint. Faintly, a baby is\r\n      crying, an ambulance siren is wailing.\r\n\r\n      Hands appear and we are rolled onto a stretcher and lifted\r\n      up to chest level where we seem to FLOAT past the faces of\r\n      the MAGYAR and the other Officers, smoking cigarettes by\r\n      the doors, and out towards the open doors of a waiting\r\n      ambulance.\r\n                                                                        89.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n185   INT.

The cell he is in has filthy,\r\n      heavily padded walls, like a straitjacket. From a speaker\r\n      in the ceiling comes a maddening jagged drone.

It's\r\n          taken Alleline - and, if I may\r\n          say so, myself - this long to get\r\n          us back into the race.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n          I'm glad you take some of the\r\n          credit.\r\n\r\nLacon glances sharply at Smiley - there's something\r\ndifferent about him, his tone...\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n          The man Alleline and the others\r\n          meet is called Polyakov. You\r\n          believe his role is to bring\r\n          information from Witchcraft to\r\n          you. His real role is to receive\r\n          information from the Mole to take\r\n          back to Karla.\r\n\r\nHe has the Minister's full attention now.

I'm sure you'll be able to\r\n          take full credit for that.\r\n\r\n                    MINISTER\r\n              (Appalled)\r\n          Witchcraft's intelligence is\r\n          genuine!

Control didn't\r\n          believe in miracles and he didn't\r\n          believe in Witchcraft. But you\r\n          were lazy and you were greedy and\r\n          so you hounded him out of the\r\n          Circus and you let Karla in.\r\n\r\nHis voice is still calm, but it's clear what's different\r\nnow. There's a quiet fury in him.

Then the star of\r\n      light spilling into the darkness from the air vent.\r\n\r\n\r\n236   INT. SAFE HOUSE - LISTENING ROOM - NIGHT                    236\r\n\r\n      Smiley, calm and contained, hears the sound of a CAB\r\n      drawing up outside.\r\n\r\n      A pair of footsteps on the path.\r\n\r\n      Scrape of a key in the door.\r\n\r\n      A pale rim of light appears around the kitchen door.\r\n\r\n      And outside the sound of a second cab drawing up.\r\n\r\n      Someone else enters the house. Movement in the kitchen. Two\r\n      men's voices start to speak in Russian.\r\n\r\n      Smiley gets up, GUN in one hand, and guided by the line,\r\n      makes his way through the darkness to the door of the\r\n      kitchen, groping, rather like a blind man walking towards\r\n      the light.\r\n                                                                      108.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          POLYAKOV (O.S.)\r\n                    (In Russian)\r\n                What is your cover story in case\r\n                we are disturbed?\r\n\r\n      The sound of ANOTHER voice answering in Russian from\r\n      further back in the room.\r\n\r\n      ON Smiley inching across the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n237   INT.

Tarr can be\r\n                found and liquidated.\r\n\r\n\r\n238   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - TOW PATH - NIGHT                        238\r\n\r\n      Guillam waits. He turns, his nerves taut, searching the\r\n      shadows for movement. For a moment he's certain he's being\r\n      WATCHED.\r\n\r\n      Then, from the house, the signal he's been waiting for.\r\n      Three long flashes. Guillam starts to run.\r\n\r\n\r\n239   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - TOW PATH - NIGHT                        239\r\n\r\n      A nervous Lacon is waiting on a corner, Guillam runs past.\r\n\r\n                             PETER GUILLAM\r\n                He's here.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVER LACON\r\n                I won't have bloodshed. I want\r\n                absolute calm!\r\n\r\n      A cab appears and Mendel jumps out. Mendel and Lacon hurry\r\n      towards the house, Guillam sprinting ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n240   INT.

SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                     242\r\n\r\n      An oddly formal scene. POLYAKOV stands pipe in hand.\r\n\r\n      Smiley sits in a chair, GUN in hand. Absurdly, still in his\r\n      STOCKING FEET.\r\n\r\n      And opposite him sits BILL HAYDON.\r\n\r\n      They all turn to look at Guillam who stands panting in the\r\n      doorway.\r\n\r\n\r\n      ON GUILLAM\r\n\r\n      ... as his nerves and excitement and any hope he might have\r\n      had of a sense of victory DRAINS AWAY, leaving him with\r\n      just an odd sense of embarrassment and shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n243   EXT. SARRATT - DAY                                         243\r\n\r\n      Nissan huts surround a cricket field. Two cadets run laps.\r\n\r\n      Smiley walks towards one of the huts, stops as Alleline\r\n      walks out. Alleline, a broken man, can barely look at him.\r\n      With a nod he walks on.\r\n\r\n\r\n244   EXT. SARRATT - NISSAN HUT - DAY                            244\r\n\r\n      An unshaven, exhausted Haydon stands outside the Sarratt\r\n      building in a small fenced enclosure. We see Smiley walking\r\n      towards him. He's brought a box of cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n245   INT. SARRATT - DAY                                         245\r\n\r\n      Haydon is weeping quietly but without emotion. Smiley\r\n      offers Haydon the box of Cigarettes.\r\n\r\n                             SMILEY\r\n                   I was assured there would be no\r\n                   coercion.\r\n\r\n      Haydon waves it away. Smiley hands him a clean handkerchief.\r\n                                                           110.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON\r\n          It's almost funny George. I know\r\n          the Inquisitors little bag of\r\n          tricks. I taught most of them.\r\n          Don't mind the tears. Just a\r\n          reaction. An over-reaction, if you\r\n          like. Craddox says I'll be off in a\r\n          few days. I keep thinking how I'm\r\n          going to miss the cricket in\r\n          Moscow.\r\n\r\nHe weeps again.\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)\r\n          I rather hoped you would do a\r\n          little light house-keeping for me.\r\n\r\n                       SMILEY\r\n          If I can.\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON\r\n          There's a girl...Would you give her\r\n          some money for me? Give her a good\r\n          cover story. If it helps tell her I\r\n          love her. It's all here.\r\n\r\n                       SMILEY\r\n          Of course.\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON\r\n          There's a boy too. Bung him a few\r\n          quid to shut him up. Take it out of\r\n          the reptile fund.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n          I did have one or two questions.\r\n          About Prideaux.\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON\r\n          Damn it! I got him back, didn't\r\n          I?\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n          Yes, yes you did. That was good\r\n          of you. (Beat) I'm surprised\r\n          Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you\r\n          think he held back out of\r\n          delicacy towards you?\r\n\r\nNo response. Smiley looks carefully at Haydon's profile.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Did Prideaux come and see you\r\n          before he left on his Hungarian\r\n          mission?\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON\r\n          Yes, as a matter of fact he did.\r\n                                                               111.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n          To say what?\r\n\r\nHaydon stares at him. For the first time the tears seem\r\nreal. Guilt and grief. He looks down. A long pause.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n              (almost to himself)\r\n          To warn you. Because he knew,\r\n          deep down, it was you all along.\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON\r\n          So did you.\r\n\r\nHaydon stares out, lost in thought.\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)\r\n          I had to pick a side George. It was\r\n          an aesthetic choice as much as a\r\n          moral one. The West has grown so\r\n          very ugly, don't you think?\r\n\r\nSmiley doesn't answer. A moment of silence.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n          Did Karla ever consider having you\r\n          take over the Circus?\r\n\r\nFor a moment Haydon looks rattled.\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON\r\n          I'm not his bloody office boy.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n          What are you then?\r\n\r\nHaydon turns to Smiley, a flash of hauteur.\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON\r\n          I'm someone who made his mark.\r\n\r\nSmiley watches him, feeling him shrink in stature before his\r\neyes. Haydon lights a cigarette.\r\n\r\n                    SMILEY\r\n              (Quietly)\r\n          Is there anything you want me to\r\n          pass on to Ann?\r\n\r\nFor a moment Haydon looks genuinely puzzled.\r\n\r\n                    BILL HAYDON\r\n          Oh, that was nothing personal,\r\n          George, I hope you understand that?\r\n          Karla said you were good, the one\r\n          we had to worry about. But you do\r\n          have a blind spot.\r\n                    (MORE)\r\n                                                                        112.\r\n\r\n                          BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)\r\n                He reckoned if I was known to be\r\n                Ann's lover you wouldn't be able\r\n                to see me straight. And he was\r\n                right, up to a point.\r\n\r\n                          SMILEY\r\n                Up to a point.\r\n\r\n\r\n246   INT.

We\r\n      see the piece bears the name HAYDON.\r\n\r\n                          SMILEY\r\n                    (Quietly)\r\n                \"Tailor.\"\r\n\r\n      He walks away.\r\n\r\n\r\n247   EXT.

SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   248\r\n\r\n      He stops still inside his doorway. The little figure on the\r\n      console table is in the wrong position. Smiley puts his\r\n      hand on it, but doesn't right it, listening to something\r\n      from somewhere inside the house. A faint movement.\r\n\r\n      Through the HALF OPEN KITCHEN DOOR we catch a glimpse of a\r\n      WOMAN beyond. ANN is back.\r\n\r\n      Smiley stands with his back to us, still in his coat,\r\n      staring through the door at his wife beyond. Something of a\r\n      Vermeer in the image.\r\n\r\n      He's absorbing the different atmosphere - home. Deciding\r\n      whether to go in. Or not.\r\n\r\n      Suddenly we hear MUSIC - JULIO IGLESIAS, singing a disco\r\n      version of LA MER - very seventies.\r\n\r\n      CUT TO:\r\n\r\n\r\n249   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - NIGHT - PAST              249\r\n\r\n      The same lively Christmas PARTY at the Circus we saw\r\n      earlier. BILL HAYDON, a little drunk and happy, works his\r\n      way through the packed room, dancing to the Iglesias'\r\n      track, a drink in each hand, a little tongue-in-cheek,\r\n      singing along.\r\n                                                                      113.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      HAYDON'S P.O.V.\r\n\r\n      ... other members of the Circus glimpsed as we pass them -\r\n      CONNIE SACHS, WESTERBY, BLAND, drunk, grinning at us.

Alleline looking\r\n      fretful and hoping no-one is noticing the scene she is\r\n      making...\r\n\r\n      Haydon grins at all his comrades, feeling fond of everyone,\r\n      but heads on to his destination...\r\n\r\n      PRIDEAUX sits watching him come with a drink towards him,\r\n      shakes his head, but can't help but smile fondly at the idiot\r\n      Haydon is prepared to make of himself...\r\n\r\n\r\n250   OMITTED                                                  250\r\n\r\n\r\n251   OMITTED                                                  251\r\n\r\n\r\n252   OMITTED                                                  252\r\n\r\n\r\n253   OMITTED                                                  253\r\n\r\n\r\n254   EXT. SARRATT - EVENING - PRESENT                         254\r\n\r\n      The music continues as we see two cadets are running on the\r\n      circuit, their white t-shirts only just visible in the\r\n      dark.\r\n\r\n      Haydon sits on his bench, smoking, watching them flit by.\r\n      He smiles to himself, remembering. He senses something,\r\n      turns and looks back. Prideaux stands in the shadows behind\r\n      him, some fifteen foot away. The two men stare at each\r\n      other, then Haydon turns back to watch the runners.\r\n\r\n      We HOLD CLOSE on his face as Prideaux approaches, the only\r\n      sound the soft wind and his hushed footsteps growing loser.\r\n\r\n      Finally...\r\n\r\n                             BILL HAYDON\r\n                       (Of the runners)\r\n                   Just like us Jim.

We find a CADET staring down at the\r\n        corpse of Haydon leaning against the back of the bench,\r\n        outlined in silver frost.\r\n\r\n        The music ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n256     INT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY                               256\r\n\r\n        Prideaux sits on his bed. From outside - the sound of a\r\n        football game. Someone taps on the door. Low. Taps again.\r\n        Prideaux, coiled with grief and anger, suddenly gets up.\r\n\r\n\r\n257     EXT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY                               257\r\n\r\n        Roach stands in the doorway, carrying a gift - a boot-\r\n        scrape made in woodwork.\r\n\r\n                            ROACH\r\n                  I made you something.\r\n\r\n        Prideaux stares at the boot scrape.\r\n\r\n                            PRIDEAUX\r\n                  I don't want you hanging around\r\n                  here. Keep away from me from now\r\n                  on. Go and join the others.\r\n\r\n        Roach stands frozen.\r\n\r\n                            PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)\r\n                  Just bloody join in. Go and play\r\n                  damn you.\r\n\r\n        He watches Roach walk to the edge of the field and stand\r\n        mutely at the side. A ball rolls towards him. Roach goes to\r\n        kick it. Misses. He tries again, RUNNING OUT OF SHOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n257aA   EXT. PARIS DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING                     257aA\r\n\r\n        Tarr is walking through a busy street. He stops to light a\r\n        cigarette. A woman in a YELLOW dress appears, reflected in\r\n        the glass. She's holding the hands of two children. For a\r\n        moment it looks like Irina.\r\n                                                                         115.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Tarr spins round, but the woman has disappeared. He stares\r\n       after her, hoping to catch a glimpse of her again.\r\n\r\n\r\n257A   EXT./INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                257A\r\n\r\n       Smiley walks back into the lobby, hesitates for a moment,\r\n       then pushes on through the turnstile.\r\n\r\n\r\n258    INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                         258\r\n\r\n       George takes his place at the baronial chair. He examines\r\n       the CHESS PIECE in his hand. We see it is labelled KARLA.\r\n       He toys with it for a moment, then places it on the table\r\n       in front of him, clears his throat.\r\n\r\n                           SMILEY\r\n                 Shall we begin?\r\n\r\n       Through the open door Smiley's new inner circle begin to\r\n       enter and take their place at the table around him.\r\n\n\n\n\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Bridget O'Connor\u00a0\u00a0Peter Straughan\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:37:21.628492"}
