HUNGARY - BUDAPEST - 1973 - DAY                          1\r\n</b>\r\n    Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building.\r\n    From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we\r\n    begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in\r\n    volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters,\r\n    cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG\r\n    BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>2   EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY                                    2\r\n</b>\r\n    LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets\r\n    scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man\r\n    who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX.\r\n\r\n    ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who\r\n    we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The\r\n    girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket?\r\n\r\n    A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame.\r\n    Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into\r\n    a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't\r\n    Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks\r\n    over, shakes hands.\r\n\r\n    Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked\r\n    shirt, neither paying any attention to each other.\r\n\r\n    Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the\r\n    two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the\r\n    road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and\r\n    sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness\r\n    and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of\r\n    contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the\r\n    corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>3   EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - DAY                                        3\r\n</b>\r\n    Shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing GALERIA\r\n    building on the corner ahead. Prideaux and the Magyar walk\r\n    up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and\r\n    head towards...\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>4   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                                 4\r\n</b>\r\n    A formerly grand arcade. Many of the shops are now closed,\r\n    the one's that are open don't have much to sell. A CAFE\r\n    occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A\r\n    JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused\r\n    shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the\r\n    glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking\r\n    coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter. The\r\n    ordinary world.\r\n<b>                                                               2.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the\r\ntables.\r\n\r\n<b>                    MAGYAR\r\n</b>              (Hungarian, subtitled)\r\n          And porkolts. You know porkolts?\r\n\r\n<b>                    JIM PRIDEAUX\r\n</b>              (Hungarian, subtitled)\r\n          Yes, I've had it.\r\n\r\n<b>                    MAGYAR\r\n</b>          It's very good. Better than\r\n          goulash.

Prideaux smiles, draws   on his\r\ncigarette, nonchalantly examining the people   at the tables\r\naround them. A WAITER arrives, belly bulging   out of his\r\ngrubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He   puts two\r\nwizened-looking sandwiches in front of them.\r\n\r\nPRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the\r\nWaiter's face, drips onto the table top.\r\n\r\nThe Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a\r\nwry smile - \"nice service.\" Jim smiles back but a bell has\r\nbegun to ring inside him.\r\n\r\n<b>                    JIM PRIDEAUX\r\n</b>          When do I get to meet your\r\n          friend?\r\n\r\nThe Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is\r\nignoring his.\r\n\r\n<b>                    MAGYAR\r\n</b>          I'll take you to him. Not eating?\r\n\r\nPrideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner\r\nstill easy, but his eyes flick after the Waiter, who stands\r\nat the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another\r\nman. He looks around the Galeria again, looking low -\r\nchecking the feet of the other customers? Then raising his\r\ngaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which\r\nlook down into the arcade.\r\n\r\nPRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - An OLD WOMAN stands in the shadows by a\r\nwindow above. She is watching him. Catching his gaze she\r\nshrinks back into the darkness and disappears.\r\n<b>                                                                3.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\nPrideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee\r\ncup down and casually stands. The Magyar looks up in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n<b>                    JIM PRIDEAUX\r\n</b>          Would you excuse me a moment?\r\n\r\nHe starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria. Behind\r\nhim his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back\r\nand lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to\r\nthe domed ceiling.\r\n\r\nThe WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic\r\nflashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of\r\nhis belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing\r\nin the cavernous space.\r\n\r\nThe shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and\r\nPrideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run,\r\nas behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal\r\nNIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing,\r\nlike actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some\r\ndrawing guns. We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in\r\nRussian.\r\n\r\n<b>                       KGB MAN\r\n</b>          No firing!\r\n\r\nAhead of Prideaux   more figures appear, blocking the exit.\r\nHe looks over his   shoulder just as another SHOT rings out -\r\nthis one catching   him above the shoulder blade and sending\r\nhim flying out of   frame.\r\n\r\nFrom around a corner a tall, over-coated man - KGB -\r\nstrides towards the scene, still bellowing in Russian.\r\n\r\n<b>                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Who told you to fire? Who told\r\n          you to fucking fire?\r\n\r\nTHE JAZZ BAND have stopped playing and are staring at the\r\nground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything.\r\n\r\nIn the TOP WINDOW - the OLD WOMAN slips back into sight.\r\n\r\nHER P.O.V. - Prideaux lies face down in the arcade below.\r\nAs we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of\r\nblood. Then he's still.\r\n\r\nBELOW - The KGB Man has grabbed the Waiter and started to\r\nbeat him.\r\n\r\n<b>                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Fucking Hungarian amateur! We\r\n          wanted him alive!\r\n<b>                                                                       4.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n     Behind him we can see the breast-feeding MOTHER. She's\r\n     dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the\r\n     ricochet. The baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed.\r\n\r\n     Through the cafe window we can see a MAN, partly obscured\r\n     by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. He\r\n     lights a cigarette.\r\n\r\n     CLOSE ON THE LIGHTER as he replaces it. We can make out an\r\n     inscription: \"To George, from Ann. All my love.\"\r\n\r\n     In the Galeria the KGB Man continues to bellow at the\r\n     Waiter. The baby begins to WAIL.\r\n\r\n<b>                                               FADE TO BLACK.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                                                       FADE IN:\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>4A   EXT. HQ OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE - \"THE CIRCUS\" - DAY         4A\r\n</b>\r\n     A bird's eye view of the Circus.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>4B   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR -   - \"MOTHERS\" OFFICE - DAY       4B\r\n</b>\r\n     A woman, CONNIE SACHS, a face that's seen it all, leans\r\n     against a wall, smoking. A middle-aged woman, one of the\r\n     secretaries or \"MOTHERS\" walks past, pushing a trolley of\r\n     documents. She nods at Connie mournfully. Connie looks\r\n     stricken. The Mother walks on into...\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>5    INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                           5\r\n</b>\r\n     A long conference table. We are looking at an ELDERLY MAN\r\n     at the head of the table. He's sitting on a rather ornate\r\n     carving chair - a little like a throne - and he looks ill.\r\n     He is signing documents, his signature a simple \"C,\"\r\n     scrawled in GREEN INK, aware all eyes are on him. A\r\n     cigarette burns away in an already loaded ashtray.\r\n\r\n     This is the head of the Circus - known as CONTROL.\r\n\r\n     Around him are four lieutenants - the inner circle of the\r\n     intelligence service - PERCY ALLELINE, TOBY ESTERHASE, ROY\r\n     BLAND and BILL HAYDON.\r\n\r\n     Beside him, his right-hand man - GEORGE SMILEY.\r\n\r\n     From the thick and embarrassed atmosphere we might guess we\r\n     are at the end of a coup, the final ousting of a King. All\r\n     we hear is the ticking of a loud clock and the scratch of\r\n     the pen.\r\n\r\n     Smiley looks up to find Alleline's gaze fixed on him.\r\n     Alleline quickly looks down at his hands.\r\n<b>                                                                      5.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n    CLOSE ON SMILEY - as he examines the others, gauging the\r\n    SHIFT OF POWER occurring in the room.\r\n\r\n    - Bill Haydon - handsome, urbane, frowning with tension,\r\n    pulls on his cigarette.\r\n\r\n     - Roy Bland - heavy set and moustached, flicking a guilty\r\n    look up at Smiley and away.\r\n\r\n     - Toby Esterhase - immaculate hair and suit, eyes on\r\n    Alleline, watching for a cue, like a dog told to `stay'.\r\n\r\n    No-one will look at him.\r\n\r\n    ON SMILEY - realising there is no hope.\r\n\r\n    Control finishes, puts the pen back in his pocket. He hands\r\n    the file to the MOTHER who, red-eyed, walks with it out of\r\n    the room.\r\n\r\n<b>                        PERCY ALLELINE\r\n</b>                  (Scottish accent)\r\n              I wish I could have done more,\r\n              Control.\r\n\r\n<b>                        CONTROL\r\n</b>                  (Coolly)\r\n              You did all you could, Percy.\r\n              (Beat) Well, a man should know\r\n              when to leave the party.\r\n\r\n    Beat. The clock suddenly gives a discordant chime as it\r\n    sounds the hour. A hint of bitter amusement on Control's\r\n    face, as though he's been waiting for this wrong little\r\n    note to make his move. He grinds his cigarette out.\r\n\r\n    Toby can't wait any longer.\r\n\r\n<b>                        TOBY ESTERHASE\r\n</b>              What about Smiley?\r\n\r\n    Control looks at Smiley. His gaze impersonal...\r\n\r\n    ON SMILEY - the faintest flicker in his eyes as he tries to\r\n    prepare himself for the shock of dismissal.\r\n\r\n<b>                        CONTROL\r\n</b>              Smiley is leaving with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>6   OMITTED                                                       6\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>7   INT.

A\r\n     horribly awkward moment. Toby pulls open the cage lift\r\n     doors for them, as if to hasten the eviction. Haydon looks\r\n     at him with contempt.\r\n\r\n<b>                         BILL HAYDON\r\n</b>               You little prick Esterhase.\r\n\r\n     Control sweeps past them and the lift, determined to walk\r\n     every step of the way. Smiley follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>8    INT. CIRCUS - STAIRCASE - DAY                                 8\r\n</b>\r\n     Control and Smiley, begin their descent through the rigid\r\n     hierarchy of the Circus. As we TRACK with them, we see that\r\n     each floor is its own WORLD. The two men walk past the\r\n     fourth floor REGISTRY - the vast archive of intelligence,\r\n     staffed by RESEARCHERS.\r\n\r\n     Smiley and Control pass down another flight and along the\r\n     third floor - INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS - heads poking out of\r\n     offices, amongst them JERRY WESTERBY.\r\n\r\n     Down to the second floor - SCALPHUNTERS - the muscle of the\r\n     Circus. The boredom of an air-port lounge, a sunken sofa\r\n     and pool-table. The Scalphunters watching them go in\r\n     respectful silence.\r\n\r\n     On down to the first floor TYPING POOL - staffed by pretty\r\n     young society girls - the DEBS - who watch open-mouthed, as\r\n     their Chief passes them for the last time. And finally\r\n     down to...\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>9    INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                        9\r\n</b>\r\n     An ancient doorman - BRYANT - feeling the moment must be\r\n     marked in some way - leaves his sentry box and opens the\r\n     main door for Control. Control acknowledges the salute with\r\n     a flick of his eyes and we push through the doors...\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>10   EXT.

They shake hands.\r\n     Perhaps there's a little reserve in Control's manner, a\r\n     lack of warmth. From the expression on Smiley's face we see\r\n     that he is pained by this.\r\n<b>                                                                       7.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n     Control puts his collar up and walks away.

Beyond him we see a\r\n     straggled diagonal line of elderly heads, bobbing through\r\n     the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>13   EXT.

He smooths his hair down, feeling a little\r\n     less ridiculous. He looks over to where a VERY ELDERLY\r\n     SWIMMER is being helped into the water - little more than\r\n     trembling bones.\r\n\r\n     Is this his world now?\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>14   INT.

A piece of CHRISTMAS\r\n     TINSEL is wound along the trolley. We track with her\r\n     through the HIVE-LIKE atmosphere of the fifth floor, behind\r\n     her the conference room - a glimpse of Alleline in\r\n     Control's chair, surrounded by his lieutenants - smoke and\r\n     whiskey - engaged in the business of the world.\r\n\r\n     She pushes on into Alleline's OFFICE - loads the new files\r\n     into the LARGE SAFE there, locks and spins the combination.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>15   INT.

I know\r\n          the Inquisitors little bag of\r\n          tricks. I taught most of them.\r\n          Don't mind the tears. Just a\r\n          reaction. An over-reaction, if you\r\n          like. Craddox says I'll be off in a\r\n          few days. I keep thinking how I'm\r\n          going to miss the cricket in\r\n          Moscow.\r\n\r\nHe weeps again.\r\n\r\n<b>                    BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          I rather hoped you would do a\r\n          little light house-keeping for me.\r\n\r\n<b>                       SMILEY\r\n</b>          If I can.\r\n\r\n<b>                    BILL HAYDON\r\n</b>          There's a girl...Would you give her\r\n          some money for me? Give her a good\r\n          cover story. If it helps tell her I\r\n          love her. It's all here.\r\n\r\n<b>                       SMILEY\r\n</b>          Of course.\r\n\r\n<b>                    BILL HAYDON\r\n</b>          There's a boy too. Bung him a few\r\n          quid to shut him up. Take it out of\r\n          the reptile fund.\r\n\r\n<b>                    SMILEY\r\n</b>          I did have one or two questions.\r\n          About Prideaux.\r\n\r\n<b>                    BILL HAYDON\r\n</b>          Damn it!

(Beat) I'm surprised\r\n          Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you\r\n          think he held back out of\r\n          delicacy towards you?\r\n\r\nNo response. Smiley looks carefully at Haydon's profile.\r\n\r\n<b>                    SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Did Prideaux come and see you\r\n          before he left on his Hungarian\r\n          mission?\r\n\r\n<b>                    BILL HAYDON\r\n</b>          Yes, as a matter of fact he did.\r\n<b>                                                               111.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                    SMILEY\r\n</b>          To say what?\r\n\r\nHaydon stares at him. For the first time the tears seem\r\nreal. Guilt and grief. He looks down. A long pause.\r\n\r\n<b>                    SMILEY (CONT'D)\r\n</b>              (almost to himself)\r\n          To warn you.

It was\r\n          an aesthetic choice as much as a\r\n          moral one. The West has grown so\r\n          very ugly, don't you think?\r\n\r\nSmiley doesn't answer. A moment of silence.\r\n\r\n<b>                    SMILEY\r\n</b>          Did Karla ever consider having you\r\n          take over the Circus?\r\n\r\nFor a moment Haydon looks rattled.\r\n\r\n<b>                    BILL HAYDON\r\n</b>          I'm not his bloody office boy.\r\n\r\n<b>                    SMILEY\r\n</b>          What are you then?\r\n\r\nHaydon turns to Smiley, a flash of hauteur.\r\n\r\n<b>                    BILL HAYDON\r\n</b>          I'm someone who made his mark.\r\n\r\nSmiley watches him, feeling him shrink in stature before his\r\neyes. Haydon lights a cigarette.\r\n\r\n<b>                    SMILEY\r\n</b>              (Quietly)\r\n          Is there anything you want me to\r\n          pass on to Ann?\r\n\r\nFor a moment Haydon looks genuinely puzzled.\r\n\r\n<b>                    BILL HAYDON\r\n</b>          Oh, that was nothing personal,\r\n          George, I hope you understand that?\r\n          Karla said you were good, the one\r\n          we had to worry about.

And he was\r\n                right, up to a point.\r\n\r\n<b>                          SMILEY\r\n</b>                Up to a point.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>246   INT.

We\r\n      see the piece bears the name HAYDON.\r\n\r\n<b>                          SMILEY\r\n</b>                    (Quietly)\r\n                \"Tailor.\"\r\n\r\n      He walks away.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>247   EXT.

Smiley puts his\r\n      hand on it, but doesn't right it, listening to something\r\n      from somewhere inside the house. A faint movement.\r\n\r\n      Through the HALF OPEN KITCHEN DOOR we catch a glimpse of a\r\n      WOMAN beyond. ANN is back.\r\n\r\n      Smiley stands with his back to us, still in his coat,\r\n      staring through the door at his wife beyond. Something of a\r\n      Vermeer in the image.\r\n\r\n      He's absorbing the different atmosphere - home. Deciding\r\n      whether to go in. Or not.\r\n\r\n      Suddenly we hear MUSIC - JULIO IGLESIAS, singing a disco\r\n      version of LA MER - very seventies.\r\n\r\n<b>      CUT TO:\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>249   INT.

BILL HAYDON, a little drunk and happy, works his\r\n      way through the packed room, dancing to the Iglesias'\r\n      track, a drink in each hand, a little tongue-in-cheek,\r\n      singing along.\r\n<b>                                                                      113.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>      HAYDON'S P.O.V.\r\n</b>\r\n      ... other members of the Circus glimpsed as we pass them -\r\n      CONNIE SACHS, WESTERBY, BLAND, drunk, grinning at us.

He senses something,\r\n      turns and looks back. Prideaux stands in the shadows behind\r\n      him, some fifteen foot away. The two men stare at each\r\n      other, then Haydon turns back to watch the runners.\r\n\r\n      We HOLD CLOSE on his face as Prideaux approaches, the only\r\n      sound the soft wind and his hushed footsteps growing loser.\r\n\r\n      Finally...\r\n\r\n<b>                             BILL HAYDON\r\n</b>                       (Of the runners)\r\n                   Just like us Jim.

Taps again.\r\n        Prideaux, coiled with grief and anger, suddenly gets up.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>257     EXT.
