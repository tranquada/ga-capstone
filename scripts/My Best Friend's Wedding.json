BOULEY RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - NIGHT\n\n\tDim lighting, crowd buzz, a long line of the rich, the celebrated,\n\tthe congenitally impatient.  Everyone in this queue holds a\n\treservation at least an hour overdue.  Tourists can't even make the\n\tline.  PAN ahead to...\n\n\t... the burnished dining room, the tables of power, the elegant\n\tservice.  Covertly, many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving\n\tby far the most lavish service of all.  Captains hover, presenting\n\tdelicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose\n\tperson they screen from our view.  We can see, however...\n\n\t... the honored guest's companion.  Ignored, bemused, across the\n\ttable.  This is DIGGER DOWNES, 36, darkly attractive.  Kind eyes,\n\tan intellectual's mouth, Saville Row's most unobtrusive and\n\tconservative chalk-stripe suit.  He is gay, but you wouldn't guess\n\tit.  Loyal and wise and generous, and you might.  He watches with a\n\tquiet twinkle, as the Captains now step back, revealing to us...\n\n\t... their most unlikely icon.  JULIANNE POTTER, almost 28, wears\n\ther favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled\n\ttogether in fifteen seconds.  She is unkempt, quick, volatile,\n\tscattered, and beneath it all, perhaps because of it all, an\n\toriginal beauty.  Dark liquid eyes, a cynical mouth, slender\n\texpressive fingers, which point to...\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\t    A variation on our squid ink\n\t\t    risotto.  Trace of Moselle, to\n\t\t    sweeten the stock.\n\n\tShe doesn't like that idea at all.  Shoots him a sharp look of\n\tdoubt that makes him smile.  Murmur...\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\t    Don't kill us on this one, it's\n\t\t    a long shot.\n\n\tPlaces the moist lump of black rice before her.  She takes a\n\tsurprisingly small amount, rolls it over her tongue.  Makes dead\n\tflat eye contact with Digger.  And nods, it's actually quite nice.\n\tThe Captain breathes with relief.  She turns her dark eyes to him.\n\tThe tone says they're pals...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'm writing it up as inventive and\n\t\t    confident.  Which it is.  Off the\n\t\t    record, I'll need an extra boat of\n\t\t    the ink.  Or a salt shaker.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\t\t    I'll toss a coin.\n\n\tAs the Captain splits, Digger looks around at the other tables,\n\twhich makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Is it ever embarrassing, having\n\t\t    your bum kissed in public?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    If your ass isn't chapped, you\n\t\t    are not a good-writer of note.\n\n\tShe glances at her two remaining waiters, who shamelessly fawn\n\tnearby.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Is it sad to be an editor, and bask\n\t\t    only in reflected insincerity?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.\n\n\tShe leans forward, as if sharing something conspiratorial.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    See the pull of a book like\n\t\t    Twenty Chefs, is not who I\n\t\t    put in.  It's who I leave out.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Which is everyone you couldn't\n\t\t    get in.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Plus some guys whose food I don't\n\t\t    like.\n\n\tPushes the risotte across to him.  He lifts a fork.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    This fellow from Newsday ever\n\t\t    call?\n\n\tShe shrugs.  Pulls a cellular out of a large, jumbled bag.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'll buzz my machine.  Inventive\n\t\t    and confident, yeh?\n\n\tShe dials.  He tastes.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Needs salt.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Is Newsday a real interview, or\n\t\t    just some cute guy you're setting\n\t\t    me up w...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    ... I don't send you men, anymore.\n\t\t    You don't know what to do with them.\n\n\tShe's punching in her code.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    ... weeks.\n\n\tOver the phone, we hear her answering machine...\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN'S VOICE (V.O., soft)\n\t\t    Hey.  It's Michael.\n\n\tAnd her face changes.  Warms.  Just to hear the guileless voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    God, it must be, what, months, huh?\n\t\t    I can't wait to talk to you.  I'm\n\t\t    in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton...\n\n\tShe looks impressed and surprised.  Fancy place for this guy.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    Call me four in the morning,\n\t\t    whatever, we gotta talk.\n\n\tAs she hangs up.  She still has that look in her eye.  Digger has\n\tnever seen that, and he likes it very much.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Who called? The man of the\n\t\t    moment?\n\n\tShe smiles.  A sweet, natural smile that makes us like her, too.\n\tThe Bohemian sophisticate has vanished.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    No, no, the opposite.  That's\n\t\t    my best friend, Michael O'Neal.\n\t\t    He sounds desperate to talk.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    The wandering sportswriter.\n\n\tHe pushes the risotto back her way.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    I didn't know you two had a\n\t\t    past.\n\n\tHer gaze sharpens.  Hmmn?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    The look in your eye.\n\n\tShe blushes.  Shakes her head, no way.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Sophomore year at Yale we had\n\t\t    this one hot month.  And, you\n\t\t    know me, I got restless...\n\n\tHe knows her.  She got restless.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    So I get up the nerve to break\n\t\t    his heart.  I tell him there's\n\t\t    this dreamy exchange student\n\t\t    from Pakistan who wants to,\n\t\t    you know...\n\n\tHe knows.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    And he gets this... look.  He\n\t\t    says, \"I knew I couldn't hold\n\t\t    your interest\", which, of course,\n\t\t    makes me feel like the shallow\n\t\t    bitch I've always been...\n\n\tHe nods, yeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Then he says, \"But what makes\n\t\t    me want to cry.  Is I'm losing\n\t\t    the best friend I ever had.\"\n\n\tHears the feeling.  In her voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    And when he said it, I knew.\n\t\t    I felt the same.\n\n\tSilence now.  She covers with a smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    So I cried.  For maybe the third\n\t\t    time in my life.  And I kissed\n\t\t    him.  And we've been best friends\n\t\t    ever since.\n\n\tEver since.  Fingers turning her wine glass...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Nine years, we've seen each other\n\t\t    through everything.  Losing jobs,\n\t\t    losing parents, losing lovers...\n\t\t    travelled all over, we've had the\n\t\t    best times.  The best times of my\n\t\t    life, maybe.  Just drinking and\n\t\t    talking.  Even over a phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Kindred spirits.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    No, he's nothing like me.  He's\n\t\t    like you.  Only straight.\n\n\tNo offense taken.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    He's the salt of the earth.  Kind\n\t\t    and loyal and generous.  The one\n\t\t    constant thing in my life, is he'll\n\t\t    always be there.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    He's still in love with you.\n\n\tThat stops her.  She has to say...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Maybe.  But it never gets in\n\t\t    the way.\n\n\tSomething she probably hasn't confessed out loud before.  Digger\n\tunderstands.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Well, he has a true friend in\n\t\t    you.\n\n\tHe wants her to know he sees that.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Whenever George tells someone\n\t\t    how steadfast I am, he always\n\t\t    makes me sound boring.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Solid and genuine is not boring.\n\t\t    Michael can be completely insane...\n\n\tA young waiter arrives.  Sets a boat of black squid ink beside her\n\tplate.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    There was this one night in\n\t\t    Tucson, like six years ago...\n\t\t    we got amazingly drunk, I mean,\n\t\t    Keith Richards time...\n\n\tThe kid tops off her glass of meursault.  Looking at her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    God, I haven't thought of this\n\t\t    in so long...\n\n\tThe waiter hanging now.  Openly listening.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I can even believe we did\n\t\t    this...\n\n\tDigger sees the guy listening, gestures to her with his eyes.  So\n\tshe looks up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Could you give us a minute?\n\n\tThe kid stunned, speechless.  People lose jobs for a lot less.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You won't miss much, I promise\n\t\t    there was no sex.\n\n\tHe reddens and disappears.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    I've lost interest.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    He takes a razor from his dinky\n\t\t    little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip,\n\t\t    takes my hand, does the same to me...\n\n\tShe places the tips of her index fingers together.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Blood oath.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    He says, \"Swear.  When we're both\n\t\t    28, if we've never been married...\n\t\t    we marry each other!\"\n\n\tAnd laughs again.  Can you believe that?  But Digger isn't smiling.\n\tShe wonders why.  Begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    See, he figured that would be a\n\t\t    sign from God, or someone of\n\t\t    comparable authority, that we'd\n\t\t    misunderstood our destinies.\n\n\tHe still has this real serious look.  She's still spooning ink.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    We never talked about it again.  I\n\t\t    don't know what made me think of...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER (quietly)\n\t\t    I do.\n\n\tAnd everything.  Stops.  She lifts her spoon, mesmerized by the\n\tgravity of his tone.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    You'll be 28 in three weeks.\n\t\t    How old is he?\n\n\tHoly.  Fucking.  Shit.  It hits her like a ton of lead bricks.  She\n\tshovels some swampy risotto into her mouth, without looking.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You think...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Desperate.  To talk.\n\n\tShe shovels in more drippy black goop.  It is really disgusting.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    He's not proposing marriage,\n\t\t    there's no way I'm buying one\n\t\t    word of th...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Then why are you compulsively\n\t\t    eating? If you're not hysterical?\n\n\tMore goes in.  Her lips and mouth completely black.  Like a circus\n\tclown.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    He can't do that to me!\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    We're about to find out.\n\n\tInk is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down\n\ther face.  She absently dabs a napkin, keeping some of it from\n\treaching her sweater.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    When I turn him down...\n\n\tShe realizes the full weight of the truth.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    We'll never be the same.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    I have a suggestion...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'll have to kill myself before I\n\t\t    call him.\n\n\tStaring in each other's eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER (sadly)\n\t\t    That was it.\n\n\tINT. JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\n\tJulianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush.\n\tGray foam pours from her mouth, spattering the oversized basketball\n\tjersey she wears as a nightshirt.  In the mirror, her troubled eyes\n\tdwell on Michael, flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on\n\tthe closed toilet lid.\n\n\tShe spits, sticks her tongue way out.  Incredibly black.  Great.\n\tDepressed, terrified, and disfigured for life.  She snatches up the\n\thated phone, and wanders aimlessly into...\n\n\t... her bedroom.  West Village view.  Defiantly jumbled, aggres-\n\tsively eclectic.  Traces of wonderful taste mixed with I-like-it-\n\tyou-got-a-problem-with-that? She stumbles around, rehearsing...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    This is awkward timing, Michael,\n\t\t    I just joined this convent, and\n\t\t    they never give your deposit ba...\n\n\tStops.  Full-length mirror.  She straightens her hair, to look her\n\tbest.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Michael, I'm married.\n\n\tNot enough.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... and I have two weeks to live.\n\n\tChanges tone...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Michael, I'm trying to be gay,\n\t\t    don't confuse me.\n\n\tShe turns to continue pacing, and walks straight INTO a dresser.\n\tStuns her, momentarily.  Enough, already! She punches up the\n\tnumber, primping absently in the mirror.  When it connects...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I was calling Michael O'Neal,\n\t\t    but seeing it's so late, I could\n\t\t    just leave a mes...\n\n\tNo such luck.  Cut off.  Waits.  And then...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (soft)\n\t\t    Good evening, sir.  You've been\n\t\t    enrolled in the Obscene Call Of\n\t\t    The Month Club, and th...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    Hey! God, it's so good to hear\n\t\t    your voice.\n\n\tShe forgets herself.  Because it's good to hear his, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    I've been calling for days!\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Yeh, well my old machine kept\n\t\t    eating messages.  I tried\n\t\t    constructively ignoring it in\n\t\t    hopes of improvement, but finally...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O., urgent)\n\t\t    Look, I have to ask you something.\n\n\tShe swallows.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    Something so incredibly important,\n\t\t    that if you turn me down, I don't\n\t\t    know what I'll d...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (bright)\n\t\t    I just have to tell you this one\n\t\t    thing first, okay? I mean this\n\t\t    will hand you the biggest laugh\n\t\t    of your adult life...\n\n\tSilence.  Come on girl, suck it up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I was thinking about you, and I\n\t\t    remembered this unbelievably insane\n\t\t    night we spent together in Tucson,\n\t\t    like a thousand years ago?\n\n\tMore silence.  Really quiet.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I mean, there's no way you could\n\t\t    possibly remember the...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O., soft)\n\t\t    Are you kidding?\n\n\tStops her.  Like a brick wall.  The sweetness in his voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    I think about that night all\n\t\t    the time.\n\n\tShe's going to have a heart attack.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    But it's not why I called.\n\n\tShe blinks.  It's not.  And just as a tsunami of relief begins to\n\tsweep away...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    I called because I met someone.\n\n\tAnd her smiles breaks off.  Like a spine snapping.  Because there is\n\tsomething in his voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Well, that's great.  You haven't\n\t\t    really had anybody since Dingbat\n\t\t    Jennylee...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    You don't understand.  I've never\n\t\t    felt this way about anybody!\n\n\tNever.  She sits down, hard.  Right on the floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    And she's all wrong for me!\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Well, somet...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    I mean she's a junior at Chicago\n\t\t    University, she's twenty years\n\t\t    old! Like when I first met you.\n\n\tLike when.  Julianne's mouth is suddenly dry.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    And her dad is like this billionaire\n\t\t    who owns the White Sox and some cable\n\t\t    empire, and you know how I've always\n\t\t    been miserably awkward around those\n\t\t    kinda stuffed suits...\n\n\tShe's finally making her mouth work...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Well, sure.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    But they're so down to earth, such\n\t\t    wonderful people...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You've met her parents.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O., quiet)\n\t\t    Well.  Sure.\n\n\tWow.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    See.  We're getting married.\n\t\t    This Sunday.\n\n\tThere's a knife in her heart.  She can scarcely breathe.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Michael, it's Wednesday night,\n\t\t    you can't possibly be getting\n\t\t    married on Su...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    Actually, it all starts tomorrow.\n\t\t    It's one of those four-day weddings,\n\t\t    with all the traditional events, and\n\t\t    ten million people flying in from\n\t\t    Madagascar such.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (incredibly lame)\n\t\t    Aren't you... working this weekend?\n\t\t    I mean, is that responsible?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's\n\t\t    letting me do a profile on the Big\n\t\t    Hurt.  That's Frank...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (barely audible)\n\t\t    ... Thomas, yeh.\n\n\tShe's staring at herself in the mirror.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    Jules.  I'm scared.\n\n\tA straw to lunge at.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Well, maybe we should talk ab...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    I need you.\n\n\tSo heartfelt.  A lifetime of emotion welling in her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    If you can't come.  And hold my\n\t\t    hand.  I'll never get through this.\n\n\tOh.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    Please come, please.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    W...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (V.O.)\n\t\t    I can't wait for you to meet her!\n\n\tHOLD ON Julianne.  Staring in the mirror.  Like watching the end of\n\ther life.\n\n\tINT.  BEDROOM - LATER\n\n\tThe closet, the armoire, all the drawers are wide open.  Two huge\n\tsuitcases open on the bed, into which Julianne is flinging clothes,\n\tas she fumbles to smoke and dial at the same time.  Over the phone,\n\tnow...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER (V.O., machine)\n\t\t    You've reached Digger and George.\n\t\t    Brevity will be appreciated.\n\n\tBEEP.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (in a rage)\n\t\t    IT'S ME AGAIN, WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS\n\t\t    UP HAVING SAFE SEX??\n\n\tSNATCHES up a tiny, clingy, sexy dress.  Pouts at it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, WHY AREN'T\n\t\t    YOU INTERRUPTING IT TO ANSWER\n\t\t    THE PHONE??\n\n\tShe holds the dress against her body.  It's hot.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    YOU, YOU, YOU! IT'S ALL ABOUT\n\t\t    YOU, ISN'T IT??\n\n\tShe clicks OFF.  Checks the dress in the mirror.

So her voice softens.  Which shows the hurt.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    And don't go feeling sorry for\n\t\t    me, you don't know me that well.\n\t\t    We're only friends.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER (softly)\n\t\t    I stand corrected.\n\n\tTears now.  Stand in her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'm making a big mistake, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER (shrugs)\n\t\t    Maybe you'll learn something.\n\n\tHe wraps his hand over hers.  She looks down at it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'm gonna bring him back, man.\n\t\t    Against all odds, y'know.  Cos\n\t\t    if I don't...\n\n\tShe wraps her fingers around his.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... I gotta live with it forever.\n\n\tLooks in his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    And at my wedding.  I'll be the\n\t\t    only bride with her own best man.\n\n\tAnd she kisses his cheek.\n\n\tJumps out of his car.  Before she cries.  Yanks her bags from the\n\tback.  Brave smile.\n\n\tThey trade small salutes.  And then she's gone.\n\n\tINT.  O'HARA AIRPORT, CHICAGO - MORNING\n\n\tThe jetway disgorging passengers into the swarming ant colony\n\tcalled O'Hare.  Julianne lugging multiple carry-ons, trying to pull\n\tfly-away strands of hair into place, nervous as a schoolgirl,\n\tlooking all around, and...\n\n\t... there he is.  MICHAEL is tall and square-shouldered, a boyish\n\tgrin, an unruly shock of hair.  He looks gorgeous, sweet, and just\n\tdangerous enough to be irresistible.  Worthwhile stakes.  His face\n\tlights to see her, and she...\n\n\t... RUNS to his arms, shedding bags along the way, slamming off\n\theedless civilians, to be...\n\n\t... SWEPT OFF the earth in strong arms, spun around, laughing like\n\tcrazy, their cheeks tight together.  When he sets her down...\n\n\t... he kisses her nose.  His arms are still around her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (murmurs)\n\t\t    Can you believe it? Can you believe\n\t\t    I'm actually gonna do this?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (lost in his eyes)\n\t\t    Not hardly.\n\n\tHe beams.  Turns.  She follows his gaze, and...\n\n\t... there she is.  KIMBERLY WALLACE is 20, small and slender, but it\n\tis a body to die for.  The face is striking, not at all perky and\n\tvapid, but lovely and interesting.  Worst of all, intelligent.\n\n\tShe walks toward them purposefully, her eyes locked to the woman in\n\ther fiancee's arms.  At the last moment, Michael releases Julianne\n\tand Kimmy...\n\n\t... THROWS her arms around the startled visitor.  HOLDS her tight,\n\twith such genuine warmth that Julianne can only, slowly, hug back.\n\tAs Michael beams.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    This just makes everything so\n\t\t    perfect.\n\n\tHer arms stay around the slightly dazed Julianne.  The younger\n\tgirl leans close, confides...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    All I've heard, from the day I\n\t\t    met Michael, is Julianne this,\n\t\t    and Julianne that...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Well, we're...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    I think the best part of marrying\n\t\t    this guy is finding you.\n\n\tPale gray eyes.

KIMMY'S CONVERTIBLE - DAY\n\n\tKimmy TEARING down the throughway in her Mercedes 500 SL, a\n\tdashing, confident driver.  Julianne riding shotgun, hair flying, a\n\ttotal wreck, in the open convertible.  Michael is happily crouched\n\ton the little platform behind their seats, hugging his knees.  The\n\troar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    My heart's in my throat, here.\n\t\t    Right off, I have to ask this\n\t\t    monstrous favor...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You need a few dollars.\n\n\tKim glances over.  At eighty miles an hour.  A bittersweet look.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    Dry.  Just like he said.\n\n\tHer eyes at once admiring and regretful.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Excuse me?\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    I can be quick.  I can even\n\t\t    be funny.\n\n\tShakes her head.  An endearing youngster.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    But I can't be dry.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Can you watch the road?\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.\n\n\tShe looks back to the highway.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    This is a very presumptuous\n\t\t    and burdensome fav...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... you want a menage on your\n\t\t    wedding night.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY (straight back)\n\t\t    No, that wouldn't be burdensome.\n\n\tJulianne studying the delicate, angular profile.  Hard not to like\n\tthis kid.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    My classmate Angelique shattered\n\t\t    her pelvis line dancing in\n\t\t    Abeline on Spring Break.\n\n\tLooks over.

How about promoting a\n\t\t    bridesmaid?  Someone you know\n\t\t    for at least forty-five minutes.\n\n\tWe CUT OFF a huge SEMI who BLASTS his horn.  Kimmy fearless,\n\toblivious, and analytical...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    The bridesmaids are my only two\n\t\t    female relatives under forty.\n\t\t    Identical twin debutantes from\n\t\t    Nashville, who are basically\n\t\t    vengeful sluts.  With amazing\n\t\t    bodies!\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Which was the disqualifying\n\t\t    factor?\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    The twin part.  I like to remain\n\t\t    impartial in my contempt.\n\n\tSees the off-ramp, and SLICES across FOUR LANES of speeding bullets\n\tin a heart-stopping nanosecond.  This kid could drive for Penske.\n\tJulianne has to pound her chest to get her heart started.  Looks\n\tback to see if Michael fell out...\n\n\t... he is absurdly wind-blown.  Gives her a beautiful grinning\n\tthumbs-up.  Loves this stuff.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    This means I have four days\n\t\t    to make you my new best friend...\n\n\tBrings Julianne's eyes back...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    And since I already know everything\n\t\t    about you.  Including intimate\n\t\t    facts I'm mortified to have heard,\n\t\t    but too envious to forget.  It's\n\t\t    time for you to learn about me...\n\n\tEasing off the freeway.  She meets Julianne's glance...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    Force yourself.  To get personal.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (smiles)\n\t\t    Sounds like a plan.\n\n\tINT.  DRESS SHOP, NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE - MORNING\n\n\tThe place is stunning.  High-ceiling, soft light, large rococo\n\tmirrors, Louis Quatorze sofas and chairs.  Michael wanders rest-\n\tlessly, fish out of water among designer displays and stylish\n\tfemale patrons.\n\n\tTakes a look at his watch.\n\n\tINT.  DRESSING ROOM - MORNING\n\n\tA period sitting room, ringed with mirrors along its tapestried\n\twalls.  Kimmy sits on a Louis Treize loveseat next to a stack of\n\tcostly gowns.  Watching with an expertise beyond her years, as...\n\n\t... Julianne stands on a platform.  A seamstress fitting her into a\n\tsleek pale daffodil-colored gown.  There are pins everywhere, as\n\tthe seamstress struggles toward a perfect fit.  Continuously\n\tlooking to Kim for approval.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    If you'd rather the lilac...\n\n\tJulianne shakes her head.  This one is beautiful.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I thought bridesmaids had to wear\n\t\t    the same dress.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    Not you.  You won't be comfortable\n\t\t    unless you're distinctive.\n\n\tJulianne glances over.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    What else did he tell you...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    ... you hate weddings, you never go.\n\n\tOh.  Well, yeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    You're not up for anything\n\t\t    conventional, or popularly\n\t\t    assumed to be female priorities.\n\t\t    Including marriage.  Or romance.\n\t\t    Or even...\n\n\tAnd she stops.  Not wanting to offend.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (quietly)\n\t\t    ... not even love.\n\n\tThe look holds.  The seamstress keeps working, as if she's deaf.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    That's why Michael and I were\n\t\t    the wrong fit.  Right from the\n\t\t    start.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    He said that, too.\n\n\tShe stands up.  Walks to the platform.  Smooths her hand over the\n\tfabric down Julianne's back, along her hips.  Communicating to the\n\tseamstress with her irritated expression.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    Well, I thought I was like you.\n\t\t    And proud to be.  Until I met\n\t\t    rumpled, smelly old Michael...\n\n\tPins start to come out.  Kimmy points, these, too!\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    And then I found I was just a\n\t\t    sentimental schmuck.  Like all\n\t\t    those flighty nitwits I'd always\n\t\t    pitied.\n\n\tShe leans forward.  So they can look at each other.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    Funny world, huh?\n\n\tJulianne swallows.  It is that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I need a smoke.\n\n\tAnd before anyone can breathe, she steps OFF the platform RIPPING\n\tthe living shit out of the gown, right down the side.  The seam-\n\tstress' eyes FLASH OPEN in abject horror.  Julianne, a deer in\n\theadlights, looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw-up in\n\tsix different mirrors.\n\n\tKimberly just steps to her, fingers the tear...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    It's mostly the seam.  Let's\n\t\t    get this to Carlos.\n\n\tAnd UNZIPS Julianne down the back.  In her rush to step out,\n\tJulianne STUMBLES,  but her arms are pinned by the pulled-down dress\n\tand she just...\n\n\t... TOPPLES like a felled oak, THUDDING on her face, the gown\n\tRIPPING some more, the seamstress SCREAMING like an idiot.\n\n\tThen.  Silence.  Julianne looking up helplessly, a trussed hog,\n\tbound in her dress.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY (firm)\n\t\t     Just.  Don't.  Move.\n\n\tLike you talk to a three-year-old.  Deftly, Kimmy pulls the\n\tdress free, leaving Julianne in her underwear.  Signals to the\n\tseamstress, let's go.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Don't you have to be somewh...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    ... just my bridal shower.

Gone.\n\n\tINT.  DRESSING ROOM - LATER\n\n\tJulianne sits on the loveseat in her bra and panties, lighting one\n\tcigarette from the butt of another.  Suddenly, she hears...\n\n\t... an ARGUMENT outside the door.  Strains to listen.  It does sound\n\tlike Michael and Kim.  We can't make out the words.  She jumps up,\n\tdashes for the door, STUBBING her toe on the platform, SHIT!, falls\n\theavily AGAINST the door with a THUD that makes her wince, and...\n\n\t... the argument stops.  Damn.  She opens the door a crack.  Sees\n\tnothing.  Opens it wider to reveal...\n\n\t... a teenaged BOY looking right at her.  He sends a true shit-\n\teating grin and she SLAMS the door hard enough to RATTLE walls.\n\n\tShe PACES furiously, helplessly, arms around her half-naked self,\n\tuntil...\n\n\t... soft knock.  The door opens a crack, and her daffodil gown\n\tcomes through it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Come in, and shut the...\n\n\tStops.  Because it's Michael who has entered.  With the dress.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... door.\n\n\tSo he does.  She flushes and SNATCHES up her own clothes, which\n\twere characteristically tangled in a heap, and tries desperately to\n\tuntangle them enough to cover herself.  He is amazed and amused by\n\ther embarrassment.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (laughing)\n\t\t    Should I turn around, or someth...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Michael, I'm in my underwear!\n\n\tShe's TEARING at her clothes, only making more of a mess.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    We've seen each other a lot\n\t\t    more naked than this.\n\n\tShe seems ready to rip her clothes apart, so he gently takes them\n\tfrom her hands.  She tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily\n\tuntangles them.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I mean, we were skinny-dipping\n\t\t    in Greece, just as pals, less\n\t\t    than two years ago.\n\n\tShe GRABS the clothes and covers the front of herself.  Looking at\n\thim with a mix of emotions she couldn't begin to sort out.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Things are different now.\n\n\tHe looks in her eyes.  And nods, a little sadly.  Guess they are.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (softly)\n\t\t    Well.  I leave with two thoughts\n\t\t    in my mind.\n\n\tHe walks to the door.  Puts his hand on the latch.  Looks back...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (even softer)\n\t\t    You're still a very pretty\n\t\t    girl.\n\n\tThe look holds.  And holds.  There is such feeling on both sides,\n\tshe doesn't know what to make of it.  She swallows.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    What's the sec...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Mirrors.\n\n\tAnd he's gone.

What have\n\t\t    you done with my best friend?\n\n\tAs he takes away the remaining beers...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    And how was the hot dog?\n\n\tHot dog? His eyes fix on her left breast.

LUXURY BOX ROOF - DAY\n\n\tMichael and Julianne sit with their beers on the edge of the luxury\n\tbox roof.  The game, the stadium, spread out beneath them.  Yet\n\tthey are alone in the world.

One of those places you'd swear everybody's\n\tplayed, from Robert Johnson to Bessie Smith and back again.

I don't\n\t\t    even know.\n\n\tThey've reached the stairs to the El.  A rickety train RATTLES\n\tabove them.  As they start up, she slips her arm around his\n\twaist...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (murmurs)\n\t\t    Forgive me, okay? I was talkin'\n\t\t    crazy.\n\n\tHe slides his arm around her shoulder.  Pals.

Green powder\n\tpouring in, a hand SWIRLING it around, until...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (O.S.)\n\t\t    It's Albanian, I think.  Or Mongolian.\n\t\t    Or Canadian.  One of those.  I bought\n\t\t    it downstairs...\n\n\t... it becomes truly disgusting lumpy green mud.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (O.S.)\n\t\t    I figure, what the hell.  Can it\n\t\t    make me look worse?\n\n\tFollow the hand up as it SLATHERS the shit across her face in great\n\tgreen dripping gobs.  She's juggling the wall phone, trying to keep\n\tit mudless, as she assures Digger...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Dig, of course.  Of course, of\n\t\t    course, of course, of course I\n\t\t    have a plan.  Certainment!\n\n\tMore green slime.  The Julianne we know disappears.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    How?

Fastidiousness a short suit.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Ricky wouldn't let her in\n\t\t    the show.\n\n\tReaches for her toothbrush, absently.

She stops.  We don't know why, because she's\n\tstill never looked at the brush.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Question.  What happens if you\n\t\t    brush your teeth with shampoo?\n\n\tTurns on the tap.  Tries to scrub the toothbrush clean, and DROPS\n\tthe phone into the green swamp, which SPATTERS all over her front.\n\tEuucch.  She's stymied, agitated, circling the sink, leaning down\n\tto it...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    HOLD ON.  I'M COMING IN FOR YOU!\n\n\tShe sets the toothbrush down in her toiletries kit.  Decides to\n\tYANK on the phone's cord, and the receiver SPRINGS out, BOPPING\n\ther in the face.  She's so filthy at this point, she just wipes it\n\tclean on her nightshirt.  Tells Digger...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You okay? This is one of those\n\t\t    problem phones.\n\n\tLifts the toothbrush and tube of paste from her kit.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Right.  Your role.  You know guys\n\t\t    from Sports Illustrated, yes? I\n\t\t    mean, you can walk right in there...\n\n\tSqueezes on the paste, lifts the brush to her mouth...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You could get access to letterhead,\n\t\t    for example.\n\n\tJAMS it in her mouth, brushing as...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (mouthful)\n\t\t    ... or even, maybe, their fax.\n\n\tStops.

So does Kim.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    It's an homage thing.\n\n\tHmm?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Awkward girls grow up on Audrey\n\t\t    Hepburn movies.

Way ahead of her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Why would he trade that for\n\t\t    running, say, a big piece of\n\t\t    the PR at a powerful, complex,\n\t\t    challenging conglomerate like\n\t\t    your dad's?\n\n\tKim stares back.  A strange look.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    That's just the sort of thing\n\t\t    my father and I discussed.\n\n\tJulianne just blinks.  Amazed.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'm not stupid.

Her yearing achingly apparent.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    On the other hand, he's proud.\n\t\t    Last thing a man wants to admit,\n\t\t    is being trapped in a dispiriting\n\t\t    dead-end job that can never\n\t\t    support a family.\n\n\tA very sweet smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Throw a man a life preserver.\n\t\t    He'll say, \"Thanks, anyway,\n\t\t    I'd rather drown.\"\n\n\tKim nods again.

FASHION RESTAURANT - LUNCH HOUR\n\n\tJulianne enters with a really nervous Kimberly in tow.  Approaches\n\tthe maitre d'.  We CLOSE to hear...\n\n\t\t\t\tMAITRE D'\n\t\t    Oh, Mr. Wallace and his guests\n\t\t    have retired to the humidor.\n\n\tPoints to an escalator, leading to the mezzanine.  Behind a glass\n\twall, what looks like a British men's club.  Thirty guys and a\n\tbillion cigars.  As Julianne starts toward it...\n\n\t\t\t\tMAITRE D'\n\t\t    Oh.  Mademoiselle.\n\n\tShe turns back.  Loves this shit.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAITRE D'\n\t\t    It's unofficial, of course.  But,\n\t\t    traditionally, the humidor is for\n\t\t    gentlemen, only...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Great.  I've got this girlfriend\n\t\t    at the Justice Department?  With\n\t\t    all this time on her hands?\n\n\tHer look is every bit as hard as his.  He gestures to the\n\tescalator.  She takes Kimmy's hand, and up they go.  We can see\n\tWalter in a big leather chair, enjoying a major stogie.  Kimmy\n\tlicks her lips.\n\n\tThey enter.  Every head turns.  A nice range of reactions, from\n\toffended to attracted and points in between.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (murmurs)\n\t\t    Piece of cake.  I'll hang, and\n\t\t    think happy thoughts...\n\n\tKimmy nods.  Heads over toward her father.  Julianne walks,\n\tconfidently, even provocatively, to the wall lined with bins of\n\tcigars.  Every eye in the place is on her butt.\n\n\tShe runs her fingers over a few contenders.  Plucks one out,\n\texamines it, puts it back.  Walks a little farther.  Selects\n\tanother, big and black.  Rolls it expertly in her fingers.  Sniffs\n\talong its length.\n\n\tA guy comes over.  Could be 40, successful, a broker's pin-stripe.\n\tNearly as attractive as he thinks he is.\n\n\t\t\t\tGUY\n\t\t    Know what you're looking for,\n\t\t    little lady?\n\n\tLittle lady, huh? She glances at his coven of buddies, who pretend\n\tnot to notice.  Then, straight to the guy's blue eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Yeah.  Do you?\n\n\t\t\t\tGUY\n\t\t    I asked first.\n\n\tAh.

Till you run your tongue\n\t\t    over it.\n\n\tAnd she does.  Moistening the full length of the cigar.  The boys\n\tare laughing openly.  She STRIKES the match.  As she lights up...\n\n\t\t\t\tGUY\n\t\t    I meant.  What you're looking for\n\t\t    in a man.\n\n\tShe glances at his wedding ring.  Then, straight into his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Actually, I'm partial to married\n\t\t    gentlemen.\n\n\tThe way she says that.  The guy swallows.  We can see some of the\n\tair has been sucked from the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tGUY\n\t\t    Why is that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    It's so much time.  When I phone\n\t\t    the wives.\n\n\tExplosive LAUGHTER from the peanut gallery.  As she jams the big\n\tClemente Churchill into her mouth, she sees Kimmy waving her over\n\tfrom across the room.  Without even looking at the guy she's just\n\tput away...\n\n\t... she crosses the room, Walter stands politely, looking very\n\tdapper, very powerful, and focusing on her with considerable\n\tinterest.  He waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather\n\thassock.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t\t    (simply)\n\t\t    Your idea?\n\n\tShe can't read this guy.  Maybe that's how he built an empire.  She\n\tnods, yeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    You're a woman of insight.\n\n\tHe sits on the arm of his chair.  Close enough to speak quietly.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    My wife and I love this marriage,\n\t\t    and deplore its circumstances.\n\n\tHe puffs his cigar.  Julianne puffs her.  Kimmy looks on, a kid\n\twatching the grown-ups...\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    As you guessed, my daughter is\n\t\t    unhappy about giving up her life.\n\t\t    And, in my opinion, cowardly in\n\t\t    avoiding the necessary confrontation.\n\n\tThen he stops.  As if reading Julianne's eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    Mike has a world of ability.\n\t\t    I'd do anything to have him in\n\t\t    my company.\n\n\tOne more puff.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    Except ask him.\n\n\tJulianne is a little stunned.  Kimmy looks helpless.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    He'd resent it.  And me.  And,\n\t\t    most important, Kim.\n\n\tNo smile on his lips.  Straight talk.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    He's a great kid, but he's still\n\t\t    a kid.  Instead of recognizing\n\t\t    that his resistance comes from\n\t\t    insecurity, he'd turn it to anger.\n\t\t    To protect himself...\n\n\tSpreads his hands...\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    ... from realizing that he's\n\t\t    ignoring my daughter's needs,\n\t\t    despite how very much he loves her.\n\n\tHe looks to his daughter now.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    They both have some growing up\n\t\t    to do.  But they're good people,\n\t\t    they're starting with love.\n\t\t    They've got time.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (softly)\n\t\t    I think you're making a mistake,\n\t\t    sir.\n\n\tHis eyes come back to her.  A little sharply.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    And that interests me.  How\n\t\t    someone who knows him so well\n\t\t    could be so wrong.\n\n\tA formidable guy.  She meets his gaze.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    See, I love him, too, as much\n\t\t    as anyone here.

He's eating his popcorn.\n\tShe carries a cardboard container with nachos, a gooey fudge waffle\n\tcone, and a large drink.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    You're not eating.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I never eat when I'm serene.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    You never eat when you're\n\t\t    despondent.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I switched that around when you\n\t\t    weren't looking.\n\n\tShe swirls a single nacho chip in cheese.  But her heart isn't in it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Last zoo we were in was...\n\t\t    Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos\n\t\t    were fucking.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Boy, those were the days.\n\n\tAnd when she looks over.  His eyes are waiting.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (softly)\n\t\t    Yeah, they were.\n\n\tThey're passing the hippo pen.  But they don't notice.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    That was nice.  The way you\n\t\t    said that.\n\n\tSo was that.  He's feeling restless, something.  Doesn't know quite\n\twhat to say.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    It's weird being the groom.  All\n\t\t    these things Kimmy has to take\n\t\t    care of...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You need a baby-sitter.  That's\n\t\t    what I'm here for.\n\n\tHe holds her eyes.  Then looks down.  Awkward.  And the way he's\n\tdoing it begins to excite her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Say it.\n\n\tHe looks up, neither one of them noticing that as they walk, she is\n\tabout to...\n\n\t... CRASH into a chest-high metal stand that displays animal facts.\n\tWe have followed him as she is WIPED from frame.  His face from\n\tshock... to amusement.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Now, there's my girl.\n\n\t... to tenderness.  PAN back to see her wearing everything from her\n\tcardboard container.  Nachos, fudge sauce, Diet Coke, the works.\n\tIt is really awful.  Kids, bystanders, laughing cruelly.  Her eyes\n\tfill with tears, and she tries bravely to smile against it...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    See, I can only do it with\n\t\t    beer.\n\n\tHe takes out his handkerchief.  And with that and his hands, gently\n\tscoops the worst of the mess off her.  The fact that he's touching\n\ther breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice.\n\tShe laughs softly, and a few tears fall, even though she doesn't\n\tknow why.  Such an odd, raw, confusing moment.  To the world\n\tlooking on, they are lovers.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (murmurs)\n\t\t    See, better already.\n\n\tAnd he kisses her face.  Not quite her lips.  But only an inch away.\n\tWe can feel her heart pounding.  He strips off his shirt, only a tank\n\ttop underneath.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    We'll go back to the bathroom,\n\t\t    you'll put this on...\n\n\tOkay? She sniffles, okay.  Swallows.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Bet you're glad I'm here to\n\t\t    take care of you.\n\n\tHe puts his arm around her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Bet I am.\n\n\tHolds her close, as they start toward the restroom...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Hope that crazy person's not\n\t\t    still there.\n\n\tWe're on their backs...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (O.S.)\n\t\t    She doesn't scare me.\n\n\tEXT.  BEACH CLUB, LAKE MICHIGAN - SUNSET\n\n\tJulianne in T-shirt and shorts, rushes onto the deck of a sprawling\n\tbeach club.  Clutching her bag, she quickly surveys the scene...\n\n\t... the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party.\n\tYoung folks, old folks, little kids, maybe 200 people.  We SCAN\n\twith her to find a crowd around...\n\n\t... a three-on-three volleyball game.  Kimmy and two groomsmen on\n\tone side, facing Michael and the Tennessee debs.  The twins wear\n\tspectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic, as well as\n\tpredictably uninhabited.  As the next point begins, Kimmy serves...\n\n\t... Sammy in back makes a nice dig, lobbing to Mandy who sets for\n\tMichael's vicious SPIKE straight THROUGH his best man's hapless\n\tdefense.  The crowd cheers Michael, and as he turns, Mandy gives\n\thim a savage...\n\n\t... CHEST BUMP of congratulation, that any NFL linebacker would be\n\tproud of.  It puts the surprised Michael straight on his butt.\n\tLaughter, applause.  The twins pull him up and Sammy gives him a\n\thot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react.  Kim plays good\n\tsport.  Julianne watches Michael's body for a beat, then...\n\n\t... dashes off.  Down the beach, several barbecue grills have been\n\tset up.  Manned by beach club staff and family alike.  Michael's\n\tpop, Joe, is dispensing beers from a keg.  Kim's mom, Isabelle, is\n\tcoordinating the beans, potato salad and corn-on-the-cob table.\n\tJulianne races across the sand to...\n\n\t... a huge smoky grill where Walter is basting baby back ribs,\n\tclearly enjoying himself.  Julianne runs up to him, says something\n\tinto his ear.  He looks at her.  Then turns his station over to a\n\tclub steward, and follows Julianne down toward the lakeside.\n\n\tCLOSE now.  As they stroll together, she's a little breathless.\n\tHe's watching her profile, curious, silent.  At the water's edge...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (whispers)\n\t\t    Is anybody watching?\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    I hope so.  This is all too\n\t\t    mysterious to waste on just me.\n\n\tShe reaches into her big bag.  Pulls out a single folded sheet of\n\tpaper.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I picked up Michael's messages\n\t\t    for him, at our hotel.  I stole\n\t\t    one...\n\n\tHis face darkens.  The easy smile fades.  He holds up his palms...\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    Julianne, reading my son-in-law's\n\t\t    mail, is not something...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Sir, this is important! Haven't\n\t\t    you ever in your life cut one\n\t\t    corner, to make something important\n\t\t    turn out right?\n\n\tHis smile returns.  Just a little.\n\n\t\t\t\t WALTER\n\t\t    Matter of fact, that's how I got\n\t\t    married.\n\n\tThe look holds.  She thrusts the paper out.  He still doesn't take\n\tit.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    It's a fax from Sports Illustrated\n\t\t    from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t\t    (quickly)\n\t\t    I know Ben.\n\n\tShe opens the paper.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    \"Mike.  We still have no answer to\n\t\t    our E-mail of Wednesday.  Which\n\t\t    option do you select?

Look, this is why\n\t\t    I came up with the idea of you\n\t\t    offering him a job.\n\n\tHe looks up.  He's listening.  Closely.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    And why I couldn't say anything\n\t\t    before in front of Kim.\n\n\tShe bites her lip.  Seems so earnest.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I just think of how... desperate\n\t\t    he must be feeling.  He's marrying\n\t\t    a rich man's daughter, and he's\n\t\t    about to become destitute.  You\n\t\t    know the kind of job market he'll\n\t\t    be facing?\n\n\tHe does.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    And you think he's kept this to\n\t\t    himself.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    He's too proud to beg for help.\n\t\t    And if you wait till this comes out,\n\t\t    your offer will be like charity.\n\t\t    Completely humiliating.\n\n\tHe's staring at her.  But his mind is working behind his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    If you do it now, it's like he's\n\t\t    helping you.  He can accept with\n\t\t    dignity.\n\n\tHe taps the paper with the back of his knuckles.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    This fax could mean... any number\n\t\t    of things...\n\n\tShe nods.  She knows that.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t\t    (softly)\n\t\t    Maybe.  I should call Ben.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Then it could all come out, sooner\n\t\t    or later.  Nobody should be in on\n\t\t    this.  Just you and me.  Or, more\n\t\t    correctly, I.\n\n\tShe takes the paper back.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    What if, what if I could find\n\t\t    that E-mail?\n\n\tThe long straight look.  Maybe he's hooked.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I never noticed.  Kimmy has your\n\t\t    eyes.\n\n\tINT.  LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - TWILIGHT\n\n\tTall, gangly, young DESK CLERK.

MICHAEL'S ROOM - TWILIGHT\n\n\tJulianne alone in his room, looking around frantically.

The corner of his LAPTOP sticking out from beneath a\n\tdiscarded bedspread.  She SNATCHES it up, OPENS it, sets it on the\n\tcluttered desk, and...\n\n\t... stops.  There are wallet-sized SNAPSHOTS of Kimmy.  Some alone.\n\tSome as a little girl.  Some with Michael.  And next to them...\n\n\t... the plastic fold-out wallet inset.  That he has not yet quite\n\trearranged.  So she picks it up.  Leafs through, until she finds\n\twhat she was praying would be there...\n\n\t... Julianne grinning.  Michael's arm around her.  On the deck of a\n\tboat.  They have drinks in their hands.  Happiness in their eyes.\n\n\tAnd she stares at it.  Jesus, God, how long has he carried this\n\taround?  She flips through further, all the rest have her in them.\n\tMaybe half a dozen.  Her heart is throbbing.  Her eyes are damp.\n\n\tBack to the one on the boat.  She slips it from the plastic window.\n\tHolds it.  Then, gently...\n\n\t... puts it back where it belongs.  PUNCHES up the goddamn laptop.\n\tThis is it, girl!

We PULL BACK to see...\n\n\t... a small clubby room.  Books, leather, polished woods.  Only\n\ttwo people here.  Walter, looking on stony-faced, as a determined\n\tJulianne grimly \"struggles\" to \"find\" what she's looking for in\n\tMichael's laptop.  And then...\n\n\t... she stops typing.  Looks at the text on the screen.  Her eyes\n\tsharpen as she \"reads\" what Walter can't see.  It's an Oscar\n\tperformance for our desperate girl.

Her hair is bound up with silver pins.  As she moves\n\tthrough the room toward us, we can see that, for once, her make-up\n\tis flawless, understated.  When she arrives at the table...\n\n\t...

Into the deepest, most heartfelt\n\tKISS.  And as she clings to him, people begins to APPLAUD, and\n\twhistle, and laugh.\n\n\tJulianne.  In her pretty dress.  Closes her eyes.\n\n\tINT.JULIANNE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tJulianne in her nightshirt, her back to us, sobbing into her\n\tcellular as she paces the room...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... see that's what I never\n\t\t    counted on! I never heard of\n\t\t    a brilliant moron before!\n\n\tWe CLOSE as she WHIPS around, startling us with her grotesque day-\n\tglo PURPLE face mask.

JULIANNE'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\n\tREAR VIEW of Julianne asleep on the floor, sunlight streaming in.\n\tA soft knocking on a door, somewhere nearby.  She barely stirs.\n\tThe knock becomes a strong RAPPING, and she fights for conscious-\n\tness.  Her back still to us, she...\n\n\t... rises, STUMBLES to the door, which is now pulsing with an\n\tinsistent POUNDING, and THROWS it OPEN, as we SNAP to...\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE... CLOSE on Julianne's face, still encased in a now-\n\tdecomposing PURPLE MASK, her eyes SPRINGING wide, she SCREAMS in\n\tshock, and we SNAP BACK to...\n\n\tORIGINAL ANGLE... Digger, watching impassively at the high-strung\n\tSHRIEK.  In the silence that follows...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    You stole my line.\n\n\tHe touches his face, and she realizes!\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Oh, shit!\n\n\tStarts CLAWING at the overripe mask, but he grabs her wrists.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Chill.

BATHROOM - MORNING\n\n\tJulianne seated at the sink, staring into the mirror, as Digger\n\tgently applies soup, cloth and water to easing away the mask.  A\n\tpaleontologist restoring a Bronze Age artifact.  By the side of the\n\thalf-filled sink, rests her plugged-in curling iron.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    What I mean, when I say annoyingly\n\t\t    perfect, is that there is nothing\n\t\t    annoying about her perfection.\n\t\t    It is vulnerable and endearing.\n\t\t    And that is annoying as shit.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    You like her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    If I didn't have to hate her, I'd\n\t\t    adore her.\n\n\tShe looks up at him and WINCES, as the movement makes him scrape\n\ther face.  He's sorry.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Last night, she was crying, these\n\t\t    big, real tears, when she thought\n\t\t    she'd lost him.

Forgiveness.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... every time I think of him,\n\t\t    forever, which could be a lot.\n\n\tShe almost choked on that last part.  So she composes herself.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You watch a guy caress his\n\t\t    girlfriend's butt.  You see an\n\t\t    Old Spice commercial.  Sentimental\n\t\t    moments are everywhere, when\n\t\t    you're in the right frame of mind.\n\n\tShe swallows hard.

No way she gets off\n\tthis hook.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    He was in love with me every day\n\t\t    for nine years.

The first word is\n\t\t    \"Preparation.\" Then comes a\n\t\t    letter of the alphabet,\n\t\t    perilously close to G.\n\n\tShe reaches to test her curling iron, BURNS her finger, SHIT!\n\tKNOCKING the appliance into the half-filled sink.  She LUNGES for\n\tit, and a terrified Digger GRASPS her arm...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Considering the circumstances,\n\t\t    I'm not wholly against suicide...\n\n\tHuh?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Just not by electrocution in\n\t\t    front of me!\n\n\tOh.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    I've got this noon flight.\n\n\tHe reaches to pull the plug from the wall, and now she LUNGES to\n\tgrab his arm, slipping, her face falling forward, stopping an inch\n\tabove the sink.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    How do you know you can touch\n\t\t    that plug? Are you a licensed\n\t\t    contractor?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    What do you suggest?\n\n\tShe looks from the plug down the cord, to the submerged curling\n\tiron.

Looking at her.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Let's go meet Michael.  I'll\n\t\t    wait downstairs.\n\n\tINT.  ARMANI - MORNING\n\n\tJulianne has cleaned up pretty good.  She sits with Digger on a\n\tfashion-fabric sofa.  They are side-by-side, studying something\n\twith equal concentration.  And slight concern.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    I suppose it's too late to\n\t\t    start over.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    It's too late to start over.\n\n\tPULL BACK to reveal Michael in his wedding tux, submitting to a\n\tfinal fitting from a stylish fitter.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    You guys are heartless, my\n\t\t    bride picked this out.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Like I said, dazzling.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    Is she going to dress you\n\t\t    every day?\n\n\tMichael smiles over.

Digger rises, goes to Michael,\n\tthe fitter steps back as Digger shows him...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    The cut here, here... this\n\t\t    line...\n\n\tFingers lightly traveling over the lapel, the side-stitching, the\n\tcloth straight down the spine...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    ... trouser width, this is all\n\t\t    classic.  Which means safe,\n\t\t    something I'd wear.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I should look different.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    You should look like you\n\t\t    dressed yourself.\n\n\tYes? Michael's grin is back.  Playful and friendly.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    And I'm supposed to respect\n\t\t    your fashion tips, because\n\t\t    you're what, a New Yorker?\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t\t    (quiet smile)\n\t\t    Something like that.\n\n\tJulianne loves that the boy are getting on.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (means this)\n\t\t    Long trip.

HAIR SALON - MORNING\n\n\tCutting edge salon.  Loud, PULSING MUSIC.  Digger and Michael in\n\tadjacent chairs, heads back, each smoking impressive cigars as\n\ttheir hair is styled.  Digger's stylist is a hot trashy female.\n\tMichael's is a tall, flamboyant male in a day-glo vest.\n\n\tEach man has one hand soaking, the other being worked on by a\n\tmanicurist, so Julianne goes from one to the other, removing their\n\tcigars so they can exhale.  A seraglio feel to the way she does\n\tthis.\n\n\tNow she's arguing with Michael's stork-like stylist.  We can't hear\n\tover the music, but she keeps tugging on Michael's hair, pretty\n\tpassionate about her point of view.  Suddenly, she GRABS the\n\tscissors to do it herself, and Michael...\n\n\t... BOLTS out of the chair.  WHOA!\n\n\tEXT.  O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY\n\n\tSkycaps, guests of impatient travelers, a bus offloading forty\n\tJapanese tourists.  A taxi cuts off a van to reach the curb.  Out\n\tjumps...\n\n\tMichael.  Opening the door for Digger and Julianne.  Digger says\n\tsomething, Michael gives him a strong HUG.  Julianne raises one\n\tfinger to Michael, back in a second.  Leads Digger off by the hand.\n\n\tCLOSE on them now.  Alone in the throng.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Bye, handsome.\n\n\tDigger just stares at her.

His voice low, beneath the crowd...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    He'll choose Kim.  You'll stand\n\t\t    by her at her wedding.  You'll\n\t\t    kiss him good-bye.  And you'll\n\t\t    go home.\n\n\tHe holds up one finger.  Almost touching her nose.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t    This is what you've come to do.\n\t\t    Now do it.\n\n\tWow.  She looks frightened and moved, all at the same time.  She\n\tkisses him on the lips.\n\n\tAnd walks away.  He watches her go through the crowd.  Take\n\tMichael's hand.  Lead him back toward the taxi.\n\n\tEXT.  SKYLINE CRUISE BOAT - DAY\n\n\tThe skyline of Chicago moves past us.  Slowly.  The NBC Tower,\n\tCityfront Center...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    Big weddings are so strange.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (O.S.)\n\t\t    You keep saying that.\n\n\tUp ahead, the Wrigley Building draws closer...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    Kim has all this stuff to do,\n\t\t    I hardly see her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (O.S.)\n\t\t    Well, you've got the rest of\n\t\t    your lives.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE... they lean on the rail of a cruise boat, easing down\n\tthe Chicago River.  Wind-blown.  Close together.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Getting your bed made.  Every\n\t\t    day.\n\n\tThey smile at each other.  Seem so comfortable together.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You miss her, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    No.  I've got you.\n\n\tShe nods.  That you have.  Staring in her eyes...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Don't you throw up on boat?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    If you like.\n\n\tAnd she LURCHES over the railing, emitting a BARRAGE of incredibly\n\tdisgusting sounds, her feet FLAILING in mid-air.  He laughs, as he\n\tpulls her back down to the deck.  Of course, it was all a joke.  He\n\tbrushes back her hair.  Sighs.  Stares.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I've been thinking a lot the\n\t\t    last couple days.  About us,\n\t\t    actually.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (casual)\n\t\t    Have you.\n\n\tHe has.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Well.  There's a lot of memories\n\t\t    to choose from...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    It's more than that.\n\n\tThat tightens her throat pretty good.  When she tries to speak, out\n\tcomes a dry CROAK that makes him laugh again.  Softer, this time.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I mean, it's embarrassing to\n\t\t    say it this way, but...\n\n\tHe stops.  Her eyes WIDEN in a burlesque of anticipation.  So he\n\tsmiles.  She knows how to put him at ease.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    You've sort of been... y'know,\n\t\t    the woman in my life.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (straight back)\n\t\t    You've been the man in mine.\n\n\tPassing under the Michigan Avenue Bridge.  No one knows quite what\n\tto say.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    And I was thinking this could be\n\t\t    our last time.  Alone.  Together.\n\t\t    You know?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Except for the hot affairs we'll\n\t\t    have twice a year.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Except for that.\n\n\tShe's smiling so easily.  Who would guess her stomach is double-\n\tknotted.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I can hardly wait for your\n\t\t    wedding.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Me either.\n\n\tShe watches his surprise.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Boy, I never thought I'd hear you\n\t\t    say that.  Can I come?\n\n\tShe holds herself together.  Real soft with...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I couldn't have it without you.\n\n\tHe's glad to hear that.  And then...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    It's normal to have... second\n\t\t    thoughts, huh? To be scared.\n\n\tIs this a change of direction? Or is it the direction she's been\n\tpraying for.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I wouldn't know.  I never had\n\t\t    that many first thoughts.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I mean, you commit to a wedding.\n\t\t    And then it seems like... this...\n\t\t    momentum, you know?  You forget\n\t\t    you... chose it.\n\n\tShe nods.  Understands.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    You and I.  I mean, in all our\n\t\t    relationships with other people...\n\t\t    We didn't use the word \"love\"\n\t\t    a lot, did we?\n\n\tWe didn't.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Kimmy says.  When you love someone.\n\t\t    You say it, you say it out loud.\n\t\t    Right now.  Or the moment...\n\n\tLong beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    ... passes you by, yeah.  She's a\n\t\t    smart girl.\n\n\tOff in distance, the Centennial Fountain SHOOTS an eight-foot JET\n\tof water across the river.  For Michael and Julianne it goes\n\tunnoticed.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    We don't have a song.\n\n\tHmm?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Kimmy and I.  We don't have a song.\n\t\t    Is that a bad sign?\n\n\tAll Julianne can do is shrug.  Then...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (sings, softly)\n\t\t    Someday, when I'm awfully low...\n\t\t      And the world is cold...\n\n\tShe doesn't want to cry.  So she puts all the strength she has into\n\tfighting it back.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (sings)\n\t\t    I will feel a glow just Thinking of you...\n\t\t      And the way you look.  Tonight.\n\n\tHe stops.  Smiles that sweet, boyish smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Dance card filled?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'll check.  I have it on\n\t\t    powerbook, these days.\n\n\tHe holds up his arms.  And she moves into them.  He begins to dance\n\twith her, turning so slowly.  And, yes, people are watching.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    \t    (sings in her ear)\n\t\t    With each word, your tenderness grows,\n\t\t      Tearing my fears apart...\n\n\tShe holds him closer.  Bites her lip.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (sings)\n\t\t    And that laugh\n\t\t      That wrinkles your nose,\n\t\t    Touches my foolish heart.\n\n\tHe stops.  He looks at her.  She's still in his arms.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Where did we first hear th...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t  \t    (straight back)\n\t\t    The night we met.\n\n\tRight to his eyes...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    The night we fell in love.\n\n\tHe doesn't know what to do with that.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    So we heard it... like, right\n\t\t    that... that first...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    We danced to it.  Just like this.\n\n\tJust like this.  A long beat.  And he has to say...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I won't lose you, will I?\n\n\tHer eyes close.  Then open.  Utterly lost in his.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    No.  Because I won't let you.\n\n\tINT.  WALLACE ENTERPRISES - DAY\n\n\tJulianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress\n\tshirt.  Her coat slung over her shoulder, she wanders through\n\tthe Saturday-deserted office space.  Desks, cubicles, monitors,\n\tsilent.  A row of executive offices standing empty, waiting for\n\tthe custodian.  Turning a corner, we hear...\n\n\t... life, at the end of the hallway.  A grand conference room with a\n\tglass wall.  Walter, in shirtsleeves, running a strategy meeting\n\tfor five.  DEIDRE, his personal secretary, clicking every word into\n\ther laptop at warp speed.  Walter sees Julianne through the glass.\n\tA comic take of pleased surprise.  He comes out to greet her...\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    I thought Michael was picking\n\t\t    me up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I told him, get the important\n\t\t    stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect\n\t\t    the inconsequentials.\n\n\tMeaning, you.  They smile at each other.  Then...\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    Kim said, when he turned down\n\t\t    the job, there was no friction.\n\n\tJulianne thinks back.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Friction.  No.\n\n\tHe smiles at her line reading.  But his mind is always probing.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t    I haven't caused... a problem,\n\t\t    have I?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Nobody has.

WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n\tJulianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city.\n\tCloses the door, quietly, behind her.  So anxious, she is\n\tpractically hyperventilating.  She goes, slowly to the vacant\n\tcherrywood desk.  Its computer and monitor standing silent.  She\n\tis stalking it, like a deadly animal.  And then.  She is there.\n\n\tTalking to herself, her own desperate support network...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (softly)\n\t\t    You can do this.\n\n\tSacred, filled with doubt and conflict.  Her hands clutch at each\n\tother.  Then, one flicks out.  And the computer goes ON.  The\n\tscreen GLOWS.  Waits for her.  Her mouth is sand, her stomach\n\twater.  She pulls the paper from her pocket...\n\n\t... looks at it.  Looks to the monitor.  And begins.  To type...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (mumbling to herself)\n\t\t    E-mail address.  To Ben Isaacson,\n\t\t    Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated,\n\t\t    from... Walter Wallace.\n\n\tAnd stops.  Her heart is thumping.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    See, you can do it.  It's easy.\n\n\tDoesn't look easy.  Licks her lips.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You do it fast, it's over.  Like\n\t\t    it never happened.\n\n\tShe sits.

The computer asks HOLD FOR LATER? And she types YES.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Just till tonight when I bring\n\t\t    him back.  To look for...\n\n\tShe glances to her huge bag.  Rummages through, pulling out a manila\n\tfolder.  Lays it by the blank computer.  Fans out a few pages in a\n\tnatural, disorderly way.  Takes a step back...\n\n\tAnd stares.  Struck to her gut.  But when she has done.\n\n\tINT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\n\tWalter alone with Deidre now, signing a stack of documents, as she\n\tefficiently places one after another before him.  When he glances up,\n\the sees Julianne wandering the halls.  Stands, tells his secretary...\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t\t    (going through stack)\n\t\t    Off to rehearsal.

CHAPEL, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - DAY\n\n\tJulianne and Walter enter the rear of a striking Gothic CHAPEL,\n\tpastel light slanting in through stained glass windows.  We now\n\tsee the full effect of her outfit, a man's-style chalk stripe SUIT,\n\ttailored to fit her body, set off by a bold silk tie.  Solid\n\tdynamite.  She hangs back, while Walter proceeds down the vaulted\n\tnave toward...\n\n\t... Michael, Kimmy, Isabelle and Joe, who stand casually joking by\n\tthe altar.  Scattered around are assorted groomsmen, ushers, an\n\tobvious flowergirl.  Coming toward us, up the aisle...\n\n\t... the MINISTER, early 40s, lean and quite attractive.  Mandy is\n\tHANGING on his arm, pressing her body against him as they walk,\n\tmurmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear.  He's a really good\n\tsport, and really uncomfortable.  Sammy is walking backwards,\n\tright in front of them, DROPS her bag, and BENDS to retrieve it, as\n\tif oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display.\n\n\tJulianne is so lost in her own anxiety, she doesn't even notice,\n\tuntil...\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY\n\t\t    Reverend Dyer, this is\n\t\t    Kimberly's somewhat butch\n\t\t    maid of honor...\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMMY\n\t\t    ... Mr. Julianne Potter,\n\t\t    prominent New York drag queen.\n\n\tToday, the girls' voices are charmingly musically Southern, with\n\tnone of the extreme accents we heard at the shower.  The minister\n\textends his hand...\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER\n\t\t    Billy Dyer, Julianne.  And I\n\t\t    love the suit.\n\n\tShe shakes his hand, smiles graciously, but her eyes flick to\n\tMichael, now approaching up the aisle.  The girls lead the minister\n\taway.  Michael arrives.  Looks her up and down.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (softly)\n\t\t    Takes me back.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Well.\n\n\tShe smiles.  One that glows a little.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You sang the song.  Least I\n\t\t    could do was wear the outfit.\n\n\tHe nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Except now you're better-\n\t\t    looking.\n\n\tOh, yeah?  Yes, ma'am.  As she loses herself in his eyes...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I got the ring.\n\n\tHe pulls the box from his pocket.  Somewhere, an ORGAN sounds.  And\n\tas he is about to hand her the box...\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY/SAMMY\n\t\t\t    (sing)\n\t\t    Swi-i-ng low-ow-ow...\n\t\t       Wee-ee-eet Char-i-ot...\n\n\tSuch exquisite two-part harmony, Michael stops to watch.\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY/SAMMY\n\t\t\t    (sing)\n\t\t    Comin', to car-ryyy\n\t\t       Me ho-o-o-me...\n\n\tIt is amazing.  Soulful vengeful sluts.  He is enthralled.  Julianne\n\tsimply impatient.  She wants his attention.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    No accents today.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Yeah, Kim told me they were\n\t\t    giving you their Dueling\n\t\t    Scarlet's act.  Actually,\n\t\t    they're sophomores at Juilliard.\n\n\tShe takes the box from his hand.  Opens it, as the singing CONTINUES\n\tthroughout.  The ring is delicate hammered gold.  One of a kind.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Will she like it?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (whisper)\n\t\t    Yes.\n\n\tShe's staring at the ring.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY (O.S.)\n\t\t    My groom-person!  Your family\n\t\t    needs you!\n\n\tHis master's voice.  He gives Julianne a smile.  And goes.  She's\n\tleft with the box.\n\n\tGazes at the ring.  Lifts it out.\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY/SAMMY\n\t\t\t    (O.S., singing)\n\t\t    Well, I look over yon-der,\n\t\t       And what did I see-ee-ee?\n\n\tSlips it on her left hand.

So many emotions.\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY/SAMMY\n\t\t\t    (O.S., singing)\n\t\t    It was a hand.  Of a-a-angels.\n\t\t       Coming' for me-e-ee...\n\n\tTries to pull it off.\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY/SAMMY\n\t\t\t    (O.S., singing)\n\t\t    Comin' for to carry me home.\n\n\tIt won't come.  Not even close.\n\n\tINT.  CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n\tCLOSE on a bowl filled with squares of butter.  HEAR the butt of\n\tconversation from a rowdy, friendly joint.  Julianne's right hand\n\tREACHES to the bowl, fingers trace the rim innocently, then...\n\n\t... SLIDE the bowl into Julianne's lap beneath the table.  Her right\n\thand MASSAGES all the butter into a gooey revolving mess.  We can\n\tpick out familiar voices now, family in distance, the twins closer.\n\tAs, hidden from view, Julianne brings...\n\n\t... her left hand from her pocket.  Yep.  The ring is still there.\n\tThe finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it\n\toff.  And as APPLAUSE surrounds us, Julianne...\n\n\tPLUNGES her ring finger into the morass of grease, frantically\n\tTEARING at the ring, butter SPLURGING on her pants, everywhere, as\n\twe PULL BACK to see...\n\n\t... the long table covered with butcher paper, the family at the far\n\tend, the twins down here with us, a mug of beer for each place, as\n\tteam of waiters with heaping platters of CRABS, which they...\n\n\t... FLING across the butcher paper, as APPLAUSE continues from\n\teveryone but Julianne, who still struggles secretly.  As the waiters\n\tset huge wooden MALLETS in front of each guest, Joe O'Neal rises,\n\tPOUNDS the table with his mallet for attention.\n\n\t\t\t\tJOE\n\t\t    Like to welcome ever'body to\n\t\t    our little rehearsal supper...\n\n\tHe COUGHS, unaccustomed to public speaking.  Walter and Isabelle\n\tclap and call out support.  So Joe lifts his mallet...\n\n\t\t\t\tJOE\n\t\t    Okay, everyone stand up!\n\n\tAnd everyone does.  With one exception.  Trapped.  She JAMS her\n\tleft hand in her coat pocket, SMEARS her right palm sort of clean\n\ton the underside of the table, GRABS her mallet and JUMPS UP.\n\n\t\t\t\tJOE\n\t\t    To the bride, uh, goes the\n\t\t    honor... of cracking the first\n\t\t    crab!\n\n\tEveryone applauses by banging their mallets.  Joe RAISES his high.\n\tEverybody imitates.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    But first, a toast!\n\n\tAnd everybody SNATCHES up their beers with their left hands, as\n\tJulianne DROPS her mallet with a HORRIFIC CRASH, grabbing her beer,\n\tlooking up to...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (on the spot)\n\t\t    I'm right-handed.\n\n\tA hugely embarrassing half-second.  Bailed out by...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    To our host, my cuddly Papa\n\t\t    Joe.\n\n\tAll turns.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    Who taught me to play \"Blue\n\t\t    Hawaii.\" On my nose.\n\n\tWith a look at Julianne, Kim sets down her mallet gently, and\n\tperforms a nasal HUM of the tropical standard, strikingly her nostril\n\trepeatedly for vibrato.  It is charming, and everybody watches.\n\n\tINT.  HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER\n\n\tCLOSE on an actual, living, if geriatric, LION.  He blinks from his\n\tcage, bored as hell.  HEAR the surrounding noise, chatter, LOUD\n\tSinatra music, of a very large party.  PULL BACK to see...\n\n\t... and overdecorated BALLROOM, in dim and dramatic lighting,\n\tdripping with the trappings of ANCIENT ROME.  The mingling guests\n\tare the neatly one hundred females of the wedding party, most of\n\tthem older women.  They are served by wandering well-built ATHLETES\n\tin Roman togas or gladiator costumes.  PAN TO...\n\n\t...  Julianne, still in her suit, hiding by a table piled with a\n\tcarload of grapes.  Her left hand still buried in her pocket.  The\n\teyes of a hunted animal.  From nowhere...\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY/SAMMY (O.S.)\n\t\t    Boo!!!\n\n\tShe JUMPS a foot, both hands FLYING UP, left one awkwardly slamming\n\tback into its pocket.  The girls have snuck up behind her.

Their expressions are deliciously, identically\n\texpectant.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Oh.  I left this really important\n\t\t    file in Walter's office.  I have\n\t\t    to send my editor some...\n\n\tSome...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... figures.

Ring...?\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY\n\t\t    The one you better get the fuck\n\t\t    off your third finger left hand.\n\n\tAh.  That ring.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Well.  See.

HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n\tHuge gleaming chaotic kitchen.  Cooks, waiters, working at top\n\tspeed.  The three women RACE in, look around frantically, half the\n\tguys stop to ogle the twins.  CUT TO...\n\n\tANGLES... and industrial-sized jar of peanut butter.  Julianne's hand\n\tPLUNGES in, halfway to the rolled-up sleeve at her elbow.  SMOOCHES\n\tit around, real good.  PULL BACK to reveal...\n\n\t... she is surrounded by the twins and six guys, all SHOUTING\n\tconflicting instructions.  Julianne FLINGS off the excess SLOP.\n\tTugs for all she's worth...\n\n\t\t\t\tEIGHT PEOPLE\n\t\t    TWIST IT!  TWIST IT!\n\n\tNada.  It won't budge.  A sous chef WIPES her hand with a towel, a\n\tjanitor CRASHES a tool kit onto the counter.  THROWS it open, pulls\n\tout...\n\n\t... a spray can of WD-40.  Instantly, her hand is BLACK.  The guy TUGS.\n\tNo movement.  He can't believe it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJANITOR\n\t\t    It's mental, lady, you ain't\n\t\t    trying!\n\n\tSammy is rummaging through her handbag, pulling out...\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMMY\n\t\t    There is nothing so tight, this\n\t\t    can't help it...\n\n\t... a tube of jelly.

The little girl in the doorway.  Southern accent...\n\n\t\t\t\tFLOWER GIRL\n\t\t    Mr.  Michael's here.\n\n\tEverything gets real quiet.  Mandy takes charge.  She rolls down\n\tJulianne's left sleeve, RIPS the hem out of the cuff, so that it\n\tflaps down over her hand, covering the ring.  Sammy wipes the black\n\tstuff from Julianne's fingers.\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY\n\t\t    Don't worry, baby.  You could\n\t\t    pick your nose with that finger\n\t\t    and Michael would never notice.\n\t\t    He's a man.\n\n\tThe twins lead her off.  We're on their backs for...\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY (O.S.)\n\t\t    Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's\n\t\t    marrying the wrong girl.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMMY (O.S.)\n\t\t    You're much more his type.\n\n\tEXT.

Almost breaks her foot.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I can't believe this!\n\n\tPULL BACK farther to see Michael still trying keys from a large key\n\tring in the heavy lock.  Sign over the door says WALLACE ENTERPRISES.\n\tTraffic hustles by, oblivious to her suffering.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    It's no big deal, she just gave\n\t\t    you the wrong keys that's s...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ISN'T THERE A GUARD?

FIND ME A\n\t\t    GODDAMN BRICK!!\n\n\tShe looks around wildly, hysterical.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    What is the big deal about\n\t\t    getting this file tonight?\n\n\tA good question.  She needs a good answer.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I promised Digger I'd E-mail him\n\t\t    those figures.\n\n\tFrom his face, that wasn't it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    They are very important figures.\n\n\tApparently.  He's just staring at her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'm up against a deadline.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Me, too.

Nobody's doing\n\t\t    business.  Crack of dawn, Monday,\n\t\t    Walter'll take you up there...\n\n\tHer eyes fill with tears.  He is mystified.  Smiles tenderly.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (softly)\n\t\t    Give it up, kid.\n\n\tTouches her hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    You can't win 'em all.\n\n\tAnd slowly, he takes her hand.  Leads her way.  She takes one\n\tbackward glance at the locked door.  Her last dream dies.\n\n\tINT.  LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON - NIGHT\n\n\tMichael and a disconsolate Julianne board the elevator.  He presses\n\t15, she pushes 11.  Michael carries a handful of messages slips and\n\tan envelope.  As the car starts up, she folds her arms across her\n\tchest, at the edge of tears.  He doesn't know what to do.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (gently)\n\t\t    Listen up, huh? Even if you blow\n\t\t    this deal, how big could it be?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (voice nearly cracking)\n\t\t    You're right.  Easy come, easy go.\n\n\tHe's really concerned, can't bear to see her so upset.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (softly)\n\t\t    Jules?\n\n\tShe won't look at him.  She wants to die.  The bell RINGS, the doors\n\topen to her floor.  She just walks out.\n\n\tAnd he follows.  They stand now, she with her arms crossed, lip\n\ttrembling.  She can't believe how close she is to losing it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    This thing means that much to\n\t\t    y...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    It means a lot.\n\n\tHe nods.  Okay.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I'll call the house, Walter's\n\t\t    probably not even asleep...\n\n\tHer mouth drops.  She can't believe this.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I'll drive you out there, we'll\n\t\t    get the key, we'll go back to\n\t\t    the office...\n\n\tShe THROWS her arms around his, HUGGING him so hard, so close.  He\n\tlaughs, she is so weird.  She pulls back, beaming, glowing.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Come on, we'll call from your\n\t\t    room.\n\n\tShe claps his hand.  As they head down the hall...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    If I fall asleep on the altar\n\t\t    tomorrow...\n\n\tHe's trying to flip through the message slips in his free hand...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    ... you better be there to...\n\t\t    funny, these are all from Ben.\n\n\tShe's at her door, turning the key.  He looks at the envelope.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    The fax is from Ben, too.  Man,\n\t\t    it's my wedding, and my boss can't\n\t\t    leave me alone...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (entering her room)\n\t\t    ... maybe it's congratulations.\n\n\tHe follows her in, opening the envelope.  Stops.  Reads.  And his face\n\tsuddenly... freezes.  To stone.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (turning to him)\n\t\t    Michael? What ha...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (reading)\n\t\t    Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing\n\t\t    this to you on the night before\n\t\t    your wedding.  But I think you\n\t\t    need and deserve to know...\n\n\tAnd he looks up to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    ... what you're marrying into.\n\n\tHe hands it toward her.  She takes it, hesitantly, and he walks past.\n\tToward the phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (reading)\n\t\t    I received the following E-mail\n\t\t    this afternoon... \"Ben, I need a\n\t\t    favor.  My daughter's every\n\t\t    happiness...  \"\n\n\tHer eyes BUG OUT of her head.  Holy shit! We can hear him DIALING the\n\tphone.  She keeps reading, it's all there.  How did this happen?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    Isabelle?  I need to talk to\n\t\t    Kim...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (reading)\n\t\t    \"Mike, the funny thing is, he's\n\t\t    offering you a gig you'd be\n\t\t    stupid to turn down...\"\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    I'm just tired.  Please put her\n\t\t    on?  Thanks.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (reading)\n\t\t    \"Maybe you should take the job.\n\t\t    And dump the girl.\"\n\n\tAnd when she turns...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Jules.  Could you give me a\n\t\t    minute?\n\n\tHe looks more sick than angry.  As if the heart has just been cut\n\tout of him.  She doesn't know what to say or do, so she just stands,\n\tstaring dumbly.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Please?\n\n\tShe nods, stumbles out of her room, closing the door behind her.\n\tNow she's in the empty corridor, clutching her big jumbled bag,\n\tsinking down to sit on the carpet, her back against the door.\n\n\tShe doesn't look elated.  She seems frightened, distraught, and\n\tmost of all, confused.  Because she can't understand why.  She digs\n\tabsently through her bag.  Cigarettes.  Box of matches.\n\n\tShe lights up.  Draws deeply.  Somehow, she seems near tears, and\n\tlaughs bitterly at that.  Shakes her head at how fucked-up she finds\n\therself.  Squeaking wheels approach, but she is too lost to hear them.\n\n\t\t\t\tBELLMAN\n\t\t    Miss, are you locked out,\n\t\t    or something?\n\n\tShe looks up.  A small, wiry man of nearly 60, in a slightly faded\n\tbut neatly-kept uniform.  On his cart, a ton of bags.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    No, I just stepped out, because...\n\t\t    it's a non-smoking room.\n\n\tAnd inhales deeply.  Leans back against the door, to look up at him\n\tmore comfortably.\n\n\t\t\t\tBELLMAN\n\t\t\t    (politely)\n\t\t    Well, it's non-smoking floor,\n\t\t    too.  Maybe you could go to the...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (seriously)\n\t\t    Why don't you have me arrested?\n\n\tThat wasn't sarcastic.  He doesn't know what to say.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I mean that.  Arrested, convicted,\n\t\t    put in solitary.\n\n\tAnother puff.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    See, I'm a dangerous, criminal\n\t\t    person.  I do bad things to\n\t\t    honest people.  This, see, this\n\t\t    smoking?  Tip of the iceberg.\n\n\tWaves her hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Make a citizen's arrest, I won't\n\t\t    struggle.  It'll be like getting\n\t\t    Al Capone on tax evasion.\n\n\tNow she seems angry.  But not at him.  Her eyes fill with tears.\n\n\t\t\t\tBELLMAN\n\t\t    Can I... Can I help you, miss?\n\n\tShe squints at his nameplate.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Do you smoke, Richard?\n\n\t\t\t\tBELLMAN\n\t\t    Yes, ma'am, I do, but it's...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... a non-smoking floor, yeah.\n\t\t    Well, you know what?\n\n\tAnd she takes the cigarette from her lips.  Turns it around, holds\n\tit out to him.  Go ahead.  He doesn't move.  Please! And so...\n\n\t... he reaches down, takes the cigarette from her hand.  Staring in\n\ther eyes, he takes a deep drag.  Savors an expert nostril-inhale of\n\this exhaled smoke.  Hands the cigarette back to her...\n\n\t\t\t\tBELLMAN\n\t\t    My grandmother always said,\n\t\t    \"This, too, shall pass.\"\n\n\tShe swallows.  Wipes at her eyes.  Finds a smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Thanks, Richard.  If you weren't\n\t\t    on duty, I'd buy you a drink.\n\n\tHe just nods.  She waves.  He waves back, pushes his cart down the\n\thall.  As she watches him go, the door behind her suddenly OPENS,\n\tand she...\n\n\t... FALLS through it, flat on her back at Michael's feet.  Staring up\n\tat him, seeing that he looks as bad as she feels, she takes raw, deep\n\tdrag.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    What happened?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (softly)\n\t\t    It's over.\n\n\tAnd crouches down.  Close beside her.  The cigarette drops from her\n\thand, unnoticed on the carpet.  So he lifts it, crushes it on the\n\theel of his shoe.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I want you to quit this shit,\n\t\t    it'll kill you.\n\n\tShe just nods, obediently.  Okay, I will.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    She denied it.  Said I was crazy\n\t\t    and paranoid.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    A bad combination.\n\n\tHe tries to smile.  It's really hard.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    There's this big brunch tomorrow\n\t\t    morning?  At her place.\n\n\tHe lets the air out.  Slow.  So he won't cry.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    She said \"How can I call everything\n\t\t    off, what do I tell everybody?\"\n\n\tShakes his head.  Can you imagine that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Michael...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    No, it's for the best, it really\n\t\t    is.  We were so wrong for each\n\t\t    other.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    The job thing would have broken\n\t\t    us up, eventually, anyway.  She\n\t\t    couldn't have lived with it.  I\n\t\t    know that now.\n\n\tJulianne nods.  Maybe that part is right.  Maybe it would have\n\tended anyway.  Maybe she can pretend she's not a monster.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t     And she's right, I'm crazy to\n\t\t     fall for someone.  I hardly\n\t\t     knew.\n\n\tLooks deep in her eyes.  He's so glad she's there.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Hey.  You still got that ring?\n\n\tShe holds up her left hand, the flapping sleeve falls away.  The\n\tring is on a finger that is swollen and raw.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I tried it on.  But it won't\n\t\t    come off.\n\n\tHe smiles at that.  A sad smile of friendship.  Then takes her\n\tfinger gently...\n\n\t... into his mouth.  It is something like a kiss.  And when he\n\tremoves her moistened finger...\n\n\t... he pulls the ring OFF.  Nothing to it.  She blinks.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    It's mental, you know.\n\n\tHe doesn't understand that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Should we take a walk?  Or\n\t\t    maybe some food sent up, or\n\t\t    something...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I just want to be alone.  Is\n\t\t    that okay?\n\n\tShe nods, sure.  He kisses her cheek.  Stands up.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Maybe I'll go back to New York.\n\t\t    Hang with you for awhile, huh?\n\t\t    Ben'll understand.\n\n\tShe nods again.  Whatever you say.  He steps into the open doorway...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Or we'll go somewhere.  If you\n\t\t    have the time.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    If San Antonio sweeps\n\t\t    Sacramento...\n\n\tThey smiles at each other.  For real.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I've never been to Texas.\n\n\tImagine that.  The look holds.  Just above a whisper...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Thanks for coming to my wedding.\n\n\tAnd then he's gone.\n\n\tIN.JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\n\tJulianne brushing out her hair in the bathroom mirror, eyeing her\n\timage with evident dissatisfaction, as she listens to the receiver\n\tRINGING.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER (V.O.

I got it\n\t\t    down.\n\n\tCradling the phone against her shoulder, she carefully tears the top\n\tof the pack completely open.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    And forty years and nine grand-\n\t\t    children later, when I sit with\n\t\t    Michael on some rustic porch,\n\t\t    slogging through our sweet swamp\n\t\t    of nostalgic memories...\n\n\tReaches the pack toward the toilet.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    No one is going to sweet the\n\t\t    details...\n\n\tTurns it upside down, emptying a dozen cigarettes into the john.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Of one weekend in Chicago.\n\n\tDrops the lid with a CLATTER.  Hits the FLUSH.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Talk about celebration...\n\n\tShe lifts a tube from her toiletries kit.  Stares at it, real\n\tclose.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'm gonna brush my teeth with\n\t\t    actual toothpaste.\n\n\tTurns it over, reads all the writing.  Yep.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I guess I'm too exhausted to\n\t\t    feel the elation I so richly\n\t\t    undeserve...\n\n\tSqueezes some paste onto her brush.  Carefully.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    So I'm gonna hold calls at the\n\t\t    desk... while I get my...\n\n\tStart brushing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (around, her mouthful)\n\t\t    God, it is toothpaste, they\n\t\t    should sell this stuff\n\t\t    commercially! Anyway, a girl\n\t\t    does need her...\n\n\tSquints at her image.  Laughs, spewing a little foam.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... well, we're a bit past\n\t\t    worrying about beauty sleep.\n\t\t    Let's just settle for not\n\t\t    frightening small animals.\n\n\tShe SPITS.  Tells Digger's machine...\n\n\t\t\t \tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Anyway, I couldn't have done\n\t\t    it without you.  Even though I\n\t\t    did, if you follow that.\n\n\tWipes her mouth.  Stares off.  The eyes a little dreamy.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Three words:  Happily.  Ever.\n\t\t    Well, you know.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t     SMASH CUT TO:\n\n\tINT.  BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n\tJulianne sprawled all over the bed, mouth open like a carp,\n\tsleeping mask against the daylight.  A sudden RAPPING at the\n\tdoor, and she...\n\n\t... sits BOLT UPRIGHT.  Utterly disoriented, until she pulls off\n\tthe mask.  Stumbles out of bed, walking toward the firm KNOCKING,\n\twhen...\n\n\t... it stops.  A message slip SLIDES beneath her door.  She lifts\n\tit, barely conscious.  This wakes her up.  In one.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (to the slip)\n\t\t    You're going where?\n\n\tEXT.  WALLACE ESTATE - DAY\n\n\tJulianne climbs from her taxi.  Only slightly in awe, she sets off\n\tpast the reflecting pool, which fronts a mansion of graceful stone\n\tand timber.  It's a hike today, because the circular drives is\n\tclogged deep with Bentleys, Mercedes, and waiting limos, vying for\n\tspace with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds, maintenance\n\ttrucks, catering and florist and food vans.\n\n\tINT.  GREAT ROOM - DAY\n\n\tJulianne escorted into an enormous room, where brunch is in\n\tprogress for more than a hundred.  She looks from the vaulted\n\tceilings, to the frescoed walls, the inlaid floors, the massive\n\tpipe organ above the stone staircase, the oil portraits of Scottish\n\tancestors and their favorite dogs.\n\n\tIsabelle has risen from the main table, and comes to her.  All\n\tsmiles.  Julianne is in the Twilight Zone.  What are these people\n\tlaughing about?  Do they still think there's a wedding?\n\n\t\t\t\tISABELLE\n\t\t    Jules.  We're so glad you\n\t\t    slept in.\n\n\tTakes her arm graciously.  This woman would make Anne Bancroft look\n\tcoarse.  As they walk...\n\n\t\t\t\tISABELLE\n\t\t    Now, you have a choice.  The idea\n\t\t    is bride and groom shouldn't see\n\t\t    each other on the magic day...\n\n\tJulianne looking all around.  Magic day it seems to be.  Where the\n\tbell is a bride or a groom?\n\n\t\t\t\tISABELLE\n\t\t    So Michael stays put in the garden.\n\t\t    Kimmy stays in here...\n\n\tPointing.  THERE she is, obscured by a cluster of the appropriately\n\tfawning.  She has the same hunted eyes and false, slightly manic\n\tsmile Julianne wore yesterday.  This, at least, makes sense.\n\n\t\t\t\tISABELLE (O.S.)\n\t\t    ... and the guests go back and\n\t\t    forth.  Where will you start?\n\n\tCLOSE on Julianne.  Watching the brave, frightened bride.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    She looks tense.\n\n\t\t\t\tISABELLE\n\t\t\t    (O.S., calmly)\n\t\t    Nerves.  I would never have\n\t\t    guessed.\n\n\tEXT.  ROSE GARDEN - DAAY\n\n\tA steward leads Julianne to the edge of an expansive rose garden,\n\taltogether elegant and comfortable with its long white picnic\n\ttables, where nearly a hundred guests casually dine, served by\n\trolling carts.\n\n\tThere, at the head table, Michael staring at us.  He looks like a\n\tpoor attempt to cover a hard night.  She locks onto his eyes.  What\n\tthe hell is going on? He looks helpless, miserable.  She gestures\n\twith her head, follow me.  Stalks off.\n\n\tEXT.  SCULPTURE GARDEN - DAY\n\n\tBronze abstract pieces, some quite large, face a huge set of\n\tchildren's swings, regulation playground size.  Julianne sits in\n\tone, moving slightly back and forth.  Trying to hold on to her\n\ttemper and her sanity.\n\n\tIn the distance, trucks are winding their way to and from the pond,\n\twhere crews are setting up tents, lights, heaters for tonight.  The\n\tcircus has come to town.  When she looks back...\n\n\tMichael approaches.  Before he can draw a breath...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I had the craziest dream last\n\t\t    night?  Walter and Kimmy had\n\t\t    asked your boss to...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Look, I came down here to face\n\t\t    everybody.  I didn't want to\n\t\t    slink away like some coward...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    But the Scotch salmon was so\n\t\t    fucking good, you decided to\n\t\t    stay for brunch!\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    She hasn't told anybody, what\n\t\t    am I supposed to do?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Get married, apparently.\n\n\tShe comes OFF the swing, PUSHES him back two feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    What the hell are you thinking\n\t\t    of, the goddamn wedding is SIX\n\t\t    O'CLOCK!!\n\n\tHe swallows hard.  Trapped.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    This is her family and her\n\t\t    fault.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    And your point?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (ten years old)\n\t\t    Well.  How come she didn't...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS\n\t\t    YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR\n\t\t    EACH OTHER.\n\n\tHe just blinks.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Hey.  This is a serious matter.\n\n\tThank you.  She POKES his chest, punctuating...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'll be right back.\n\n\tINT.  KITCHEN - DAY\n\n\tA modern take on the Medieval castle kitchen, towering ceilings,\n\tdark wood, copper pots hanging, a series of walk-in coolers and\n\tfreezers.  The place is a madhouse of activity, as prep cooks\n\tslice, chop, sort, every kind of food imaginable, and delivery\n\tteams bring more.\n\n\tThe girls walk through.  Alone together in the eye of the\n\thurricane.  Kim choked with excess sentiment...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    Look at all this beautiful food,\n\t\t    so lovingly prepared...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    They'll eat it anyway, you ever\n\t\t    been to a walk?\n\n\tKimmy's lip trembles.  This is not how she thought of her wedding.\n\tThe din is so horrific, Kimmy leads them into a walk-in meat\n\tlocker.  Even here, two BUTCHERS are dressing Eastern-fresh corn-\n\tfed carcasses.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You guys want to give us a\n\t\t    minute?\n\n\tThe men blink at each other.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    We'd like to be alone with\n\t\t    our pork.\n\n\tOn that basis.  They leave.  Kimmy sits on a stack of packaged\n\tfrozen fowl parts.  Stares up with big, sweet, wet eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    How's he doing?\n\n\tJulianne cannot believe this.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Who?  The jerk who's running\n\t\t    your life?\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    This must be... very, very,\n\t\t    hard on him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    What with the psychosis and\n\t\t    all, yeah.\n\n\tLeans in.  Listen...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    When are you gonna come clean\n\t\t    with your folks?\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    Don't you see...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    If you're waiting for \"Do you\n\t\t    take this man?\", that's\n\t\t    considered poor form.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    ... that this is all my fault?\n\n\tStops Julianne cold.  Your fault.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    Whatever delusions I drove him to,\n\t\t    there is truth at the heart of it.\n\t\t    I want him to work for my father.\n\t\t    I want to stay in school.  I want\n\t\t    a life of my own!\n\n\tHarder and harder for Julianne to push.  Her mouth is dry.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Yeah, well, lots of couples are\n\t\t    imcompat...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    I love him.\n\n\tFragile and strong at once.

TENNIS COURT - DAY\n\n\tThe court has become a giant holding pen for tonight's BALLOONS.\n\tThere are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all\n\tdirections, under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread\n\tacross the top of the court's chain-link fence.\n\n\tMichael stands outside the court, clutching the chain link like a\n\tprisoner, as Julianne comes through the gate.  From somewhere, we\n\thear high, squeaky, alien voice-like SOUNDS.  Incongruous\n\tagainst...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    How is she?\n\n\tJulianne absorbs this.  As the bizarre SOUNDS continue, she WHIRLS\n\taround...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    KNOCK IT OFF!!!\n\n\tWe now see three STONER COLLEGE GUYS, who have been filling the\n\tendless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court.\n\tClearly, they've been inhaling their working materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t  STONER KID\n\t\t\t    (Minnie Mouse)\n\t\t    YES, SIR!\n\n\tA Nazi salute.  When she turns back...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I asked you...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    She admits it's her fault.\n\n\tHe absorbs that.  And then...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Do you think she still loves\n\t\t    me?\n\n\tWe watch the struggle inside her.  Her voice drops...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Sure, she does.  She's crazy\n\t\t    about you.\n\n\tNow tears stand in both their eyes.  The stoners are doing their\n\tAlvin and the Chipmuks impersonation festival in the B.G., singing\n\tin castrato harmony.  But our two don't notice.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I keep asking, how can I explain\n\t\t    what happened? And I keep\n\t\t    getting that same answer all\n\t\t    night long.\n\n\tWhich is...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I can't.  And it doesn't matter.\n\t\t    I drove her to it, because I\n\t\t    want things my way.  And even\n\t\t    if she did something tricky and\n\t\t    unfair... she was blinded by\n\t\t    love, okay?\n\n\tJulianne swallows.  For obvious reasons.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Does that make it right...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Love doesn't have to be right.\n\t\t    It just has to be love.\n\n\tThe stoner are now helium-crooning \"Bridge Over Troubled Waters.\"\n\tActually, they're getting better.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    She's giving up half her life\n\t\t    for me, and I'm bitching because\n\t\t    it hurts her.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTONERS\n\t\t\t    (singing)\n\t\t    Sail on silver girl\n\t\t       Sail on by...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    She's a saint!

I'll marry her at six\n\t\t    o'clock, if she'll still have me.\n\n\tThe stoners blend on the high note.  It's pretty moving.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'll be right back.\n\n\tINT.  ORGAN LOFT - DAY\n\n\tPAN along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents.  Nearly\n\ttwelve feet high, the pile curves along the balcony, high above the\n\tdiners in the Great Room, extending al the way to...\n\n\t... an organ loft.  Alone, above the noise of the party, Julianne\n\tand Kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase.  Trapped\n\tbetween ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth\n\torgan.  Dwarfed by their surroundings, Kimmy draws the hardest\n\tbreath of her life...\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t\t    (whispers)\n\t\t    So.  What did he say?\n\n\tJulianne's eyes move over the young girl's face.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    He said.  Marry me.\n\n\tKimmy YELPS in her ecstasy, FLINGING herself against Julianne, and\n\tthey go DOWN full length across the organ's pedals, BLASTING the\n\troom with a MONSTER CHORD of china-rattling volume and horrifying\n\tdisharmony.\n\n\tAs grown men and women SCREAM in spontaneous terror below, Kimmy\n\tbegins to...\n\n\t... LAUGH.  And KISS and hug her new sister.  And holds her tight.\n\n\tEXT.  WILLOW POND - DAY\n\n\tJulianne and Michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking\n\tPOND, ringed with WILLOWS that dig heavy branches to the water's\n\tsurface.  He is relieved, reflective.  Head down, he never notices\n\tthat she is...\n\n\t... dangerously freaked.  Too petrified even to hyperventilate,\n\twe're lucky she's breathing at all.  We watch her life unraveling\n\tbefore her glassy eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (never looks up)\n\t\t    Thank God you were here.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (mumbles to herself)\n\t\t    Oh, yeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I was so confused, so conflicted,\n\t\t    so... unstable.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Well, it happens.\n\n\tThey pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking\n\tarea.  Family vehicles, delivery trucks, service vans.  Everything\n\tthat couldn't fit on the circular front driveway.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I might have thrown away...\n\n\tSearching for the right words.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... your one chance for true\n\t\t    happiness?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    ... yeah, that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You never want to do that, see,\n\t\t    that's always a... costly\n\t\t    turnover.  As they say in the\n\t\t    sport biz.\n\n\tThere's a vague Stepford Wife quality to her voice.  He hears that\n\tnow, and looks at her.  Maybe he can't tell she's frightened.  But\n\the can tell she's something.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (softly)\n\t\t    Are you okay?\n\n\tShe stops walking.  She can't look at him, so she looks around.\n\tAcross the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly-\n\tcolored tents, unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and\n\tchairs, raising the poles between which all those balloons will be\n\tstrung.  At the center of it all...\n\n\t.... a huge topiary White Sox batter, just completing a murderous\n\tswing.  He's maybe fifteen feet tall.  She points to it...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    The Big Hurt, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the\n\t\t    past.  And he likes the little\n\t\t    guys.\n\n\tSo Julianne nods.  Because she does too.  Squints up at Michael.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Got a minute?\n\n\tHe nods, you bet.  Worried for her.  What is this? She looks in\n\tanother direction, and we now see that we have nearly reached...\n\n\t... a stage that's been set up for the band.  Chairs, music stands,\n\tsound equipment.  A gleaming dance floor, already in place over the\n\tlawn.  Next to it, a shimmering white GAZEBO.  Like the centerpiece\n\tof a wedding cake.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Why is the dance floor by the\n\t\t    gazebo?\n\n\tShe takes his hand.  They walk toward it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Kimmy's idea.  She thought it\n\t\t    would be such a romantic place.\n\t\t    For our wedding dance.\n\n\tLooking down at her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    What's up?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Shhh.\n\n\tUp the white steps now.  Together.  The gazebo floor has been\n\tcovered with hardwood.  The perfect place.  For a wedding dance.\n\tAnd Julianne...\n\n\t... turns, suddenly.  He almost runs into her.  She is staring up\n\tat him, so strangely, their bodies only inches apart.  He is caught,\n\ttransfixed by the intensity in her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I have to say this quick, okay,\n\t\t    or I'll have this massive\n\t\t    coronary and you'll never have\n\t\t    to hear it.  Which you need to.\n\t\t    Does that make any sense at all?\n\n\tThe coronary part does.  We can feel her heart beating from here.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Jules, what's wrong...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    This is the dumbest thing I will\n\t\t    ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that\n\t\t    I can't.  I don't think.\n\n\tAnd then, she does.  She puts her hands flat on his chest.  Looks\n\tin his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Michael, I love you.\n\n\tA heartbeat passes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I've loved you for nine years,\n\t\t    but I was too arrogant and\n\t\t    scared to realize it.  Now I'm\n\t\t    just scared.\n\n\tHe stares at her, dumbstruck.  She moves even closer.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I know this comes at an\n\t\t    inopportune time, but I have to\n\t\t    ask this one really gigantic\n\t\t    favor, okay?\n\n\tHolds her breath.  And...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Choose me.  Marry me.  Let me\n\t\t    make you happy.\n\n\tAnd in a half beat of excruciating silence...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I know.  It sounds like three\n\t\t    favors.\n\n\tHis eyes are loving.  They care for her.  She swallows, lost in\n\tthem.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    But when you think about it...\n\n\tSlides her arms around his neck, and raises her mouth...\n\n\t... to his.  The most beautiful kiss she will ever offer.  All of\n\ther heart is in this, and as his hands touch her body...\n\n\t... a SCREAM rips the world to pieces.  They whirl to see...\n\n\t... KIMMY, halfway up the path.  Her hands across her mouth, as if\n\tto stem the horror that pours forth as she SHRIEKS from her soul,\n\tand...\n\n\t... runs.  Back Down the path.  Michael BOLTING after her, SHOUTING\n\ther name.  A frozen moment, and...\n\n\t... Julianne TAKES OFF after him.  All three running, SCREAMING\n\ttheir various emotions at the top of their lungs, as workmen stop\n\tto watch from neighboring countries.\n\n\tKimmy, staring from halfway there, has an insurmountable lead.\n\tLEAPS into her convertible and PEELS OUT, just TEARING up the\n\tgravel as she ROCKETS out of sight.  No way to catch her.  Still...\n\n\t... Michael is racing for the cars.  Julianne, sprinting her guts\n\tout, losing ground with every stride.  Michael JUMPS into a\n\tCherokee...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    MICHAEL, DON'T, YOU'LL NEVER\n\t\t    CATCH HER!!\n\n\tHe GRINDS the gears.  She keeps RUNNING.  His engine FIRES.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    SHE HAS TOO BIG A LEAD AND SHE\n\t\t    DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL!!!\n\n\tHe BLASTS OFF.  She keeps going.  Gasping for air, clutching her side,\n\tshe's dying here.  Slams into a florist's truck, looks inside, shit!\n\tNext, a butcher's van, looks inside, Jesus!\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (to the world at large)\n\t\t    DOESN'T ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS\n\t\t    ANYMORE?  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO\n\t\t    TRUST??\n\n\tUp ahead, Michael has STALLED the Cherokee.  She still has a chance,\n\tDASHES to the next van.  BORNSTEIN EXTERMINATION, a handsome\n\trendering of a rat above the TOXIC MATERIALS warning FLINGS the\n\tdoor open.  Stumbles in.  Keys!\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE (O.S.)\n\t\t    THANK GOD, A SAMARITAN!!\n\n\tMichael SPEEDS away.  She KICKS the ratmobile in gear.\n\n\tLURCHES off.\n\n\tINT.

Uh... how\n\t\t    do I pay this?\n\n\tWITH Julianne now, RACING through the lot, Michael vanishes INTO\n\tthe Station, she PLUNGES in after him, BOUNCING off bystanders,\n\tapologizing, lunging on, gasping for breath, past exhaustion,\n\tthreatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk,\n\tcatching a lucky glimpse as he heads...\n\n\t... DOWN a staircase to the TRACKS.  My God, what's he doing?  A\n\tsecond wind, fueled by panic, and she BOLTS after him, DANCING down\n\tthe steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the\n\tconcourse to see him, running for...\n\n\t... Track 29, a train already RUMBLING, ready to pull out, she\n\tSPRINTS after him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    MICHAEL!!\n\n\tHe DISAPPEARS behind the train, she FALLS, skids, springs up,\n\tpushes through gaping onlookers, almost there, the train PULLS\n\tAWAY...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    NNNOOOO!!!\n\n\tBut he's just standing there.  His back to us.  Watching it go.\n\n\tHer body nearly collapses with relief.  She pushes herself on, but\n\ther legs aren't working right in their maxed-out fatigue, and she\n\tlopes and staggers until she comes up behind him.  He's still lost\n\tin thought, staring after the train.\n\n\tShe tries to speak, but there's no breath.  So she puts her hands\n\ton her knees and just GASPS for air like a dog.  Wheezing, panting,\n\ttrying once more to speak, but she can't yet, and then he casually\n\tturns and...\n\n\t... JUMPS out of his skin!  A heart attack seeing her.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t\t    (croaks)\n\t\t    Don't speak!\n\n\tHe just blinks at this sweaty, ripped-up, maniacal figure.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Uh.  I saw that moving...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    DON'T SPEAK!\n\n\tFLINGING both her hands across his mouth.  A frozen beat.  He nods,\n\tokay.  Cautiously, she takes her hands away.  At least she has made\n\thim smile, in spite of everything.  At least she's done that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I have to make a confession.\n\t\t    Another confession.  Besides\n\t\t    that I love you.  This is even\n\t\t    worse.\n\n\tThis.  He's waiting to hear.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    The E-mail?  You thought Walter\n\t\t    sent your boss?

I mean...\n\t\t    how could you do that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I didn't know it would get\n\t\t    sent.  I just wanted you to...\n\t\t    get mad at Kimmy... and...\n\n\tAnd watching.  As this begins to sink in.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I've done nothing but slimy,\n\t\t    underhanded, despicable, not\n\t\t    even terribly imaginative,\n\t\t    things.  Ever since I got\n\t\t    here.  Trying to...\n\n\tStaring in his eyes.  Eyes she can't read at this point.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    ... to win you.  To win you\n\t\t    back.\n\n\tTears in her own eyes now.  Big ones.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    And I was blinded by love.\n\t\t    Like you said.\n\n\tShaking her head...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    But that doesn't excuse any\n\t\t    part of it.  I am pond scum.\n\n\tNo...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus\n\t\t    that feeds on pond scum.

The trace of a smile...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (softly)\n\t\t    On the other hand, thank you.\n\n\tShe blinks at that.  Which squeezes out a tear.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    For loving me that much, that\n\t\t    way.\n\n\tHe shrugs.  Just above a whisper...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHEL\n\t\t    It's pretty flattering.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Except it makes me fungus.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Well, that part I knew.\n\n\tShe's never loved him more.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    So you have to marry Kim.\n\t\t    Because she will actually make\n\t\t    you happy.  I, in contrast, am\n\t\t    a shallow, neurotic psychopath,\n\t\t    with relatively little to offer.\n\n\tOkay?\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Kim.  Nod your head.  Do as\n\t\t    you're told.\n\n\tHe nods his head, still smiling.  Her tears are running now.  Maybe\n\tshe doesn't notice.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Just promise you'll never tell\n\t\t    me who you would have chosen.\n\t\t    If I hadn't confessed.\n\n\tShe chokes back a sob.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    Cos if you would have chosen me.\n\t\t    Then I threw away a perfectly\n\t\t    good life.  Just to be a decent\n\t\t    person.  Which is a questionable\n\t\t    trade-off.  Right?\n\n\tHe nods, slowly.  Because he's supposed to.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    And if you would have chosen\n\t\t    some 20-year-old punk over me.\n\t\t    I'd have to kill myself.\n\n\tAh.  His smile keeps getting smaller.  More loving.  More wonderful.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (whispers)\n\t\t    I'll take it to my grave.\n\n\tGood.  She looks around.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'm so glad you didn't jump on\n\t\t    that train, before...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I came here, looking for her.\n\n\tFor her.

She needs to hear this.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I had to cover a game in\n\t\t    Milwaukee.  She saw me off.\n\t\t    And when the train started to\n\t\t    leave...

Has to admit...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    ... without a thought in my head.\n\t\t    I shouted, \"Marry me.\"\n\n\tI did.  Now her eyes tear up again.  And she doesn't know why.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    And she gasped, and covered her\n\t\t    mouth, and the train was pulling\n\t\t    out, and suddenly she screamed\n\t\t    YES!  Just once.  And blew me a\n\t\t    kiss.\n\n\tWhat a girl.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I never forgot that.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    It's two weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Almost three.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    That is so romantic.\n\n\tWhich makes him reach and touch her hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    I just wonder if you know why.\n\n\tDo you?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    It's because romance isn't\n\t\t    mystery, and tricks, and doubts,\n\t\t    and halting, unspoken longings.\n\t\t    That's not the real romance.\n\n\tTears in his eyes now.  First time.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    The real romance is saying yes.\n\n\tDoes she know that now?

Kimmy's eyes alerted, like a small\n\tanimal bearing a predator approach her thicket.  Suddenly, the\n\tCHORD.  The Wedding March from Wagner's Lohengrin.  Here.  Comes.\n\tThe bride.  And we SNAP TO...\n\n\tFULL ANGLE... Kim and Walter.  This is it.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t\t    (whispers)\n\t\t    Left foot.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE... Kim's POV, the chapel, every pew packed, every neck\n\tcraning this way, the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to\n\twhere...\n\n\tMichael waits.  Also in a zone of pseudo-consciousness.  From which\n\the attempts a smile.  Not comforting.  Kim's POV WHIP PAN the\n\tgroomsmen, the twins, LOCKING FOCUS on Julianne, standing strong\n\tand beautiful, a glow of her own in the daffodil dress.  She sends\n\ther little sister a WINK across the trackless miles of aisle.  You\n\tcan do this, kid.  So...\n\n\t... Kimmy does.  On her father's arm, she walks the gauntlet of the\n\tworld's intrusive admiration.  One step at a time.  The most beautiful\n\tshe will ever be.  She is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw\n\tup at the same time.\n\n\tAnd she's there.  At his side.  She glances back to her maid of\n\thonor, just to make sure she's not working without a net.  So\n\tJulianne...\n\n\t... CROSSES her eyes.  Which lets the kid smile and finally take a\n\tbreath.  Have a little fun, huh? Kim nods, got it, turns to...\n\n\tThe Minister.  Who stands before them with a calming presence.\n\tThank God someone has done this before.  The crowd has hushed.\n\tThe Minister's eyes are only for two.  His words are for all...\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER\n\t\t    Michael and Kimmy wrote these\n\t\t    words.  She asked me to confide,\n\t\t    mostly Michael.\n\n\tA ripple of laughter.  Gentle and fine.  They are setting in.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER\n\t\t    So he gets to say them.\n\n\tA surprise.  A pleasant one.  The crowd adjust in its seats.  As\n\tMichael begins...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Why do people get married\n\t\t    anymore?\n\n\tAnd on these words.  We SNAP to Julianne.  Share her interest in\n\tthe bluntness, the simplicity, the unorthodoxy of this beginning.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    Why not live together amicably,\n\t\t    with no sense of obligation\n\t\t    beyond the moment?\n\n\tHer eyes.  She's listening.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    As long as the sex is good.  As\n\t\t    long as no one more interesting\n\t\t    has wandered into view.  As long\n\t\t    as the thousand conflicts of two\n\t\t    individual wills remain\n\t\t    comfortably compromised.\n\n\tPANNING now.  Other faces.  Isabelle.  Proud to the bone.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    And when one feels the urge to\n\t\t    move on, to explore the new.\n\t\t    No guilt, no disgrace, no\n\t\t    promise broken.\n\n\tWalter.  His eyes damp.  Against our expectation.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    No agony of having dishonored\n\t\t    a time.  When our hearts.  And\n\t\t    the world were different.\n\n\tJoe nods, as he hears...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    Marriage is a lot to put up\n\t\t    with.\n\n\tJulianne once more.  No breath.  Rapt.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    The answer must be.  That there\n\t\t    is some need basic to the human\n\t\t    heart.  That embracing... the obligation\n\t\t    of commitment... fulfills.\n\n\tHer eyes have clouded.  As if Michael is talking to her.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    Some need to belong to one another\n\t\t    in a way which rages against the\n\t\t    notion... that all is impermanent.\n\t\t    Against the notion of mortality.\n\n\tAnd suddenly, ALL the feeling rises in her throat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL (O.S.)\n\t\t    Our love is bigger.  And longer.\n\t\t    Than life itself.\n\n\tAnd the tears come.  They come freely, unhidden, unnoticed.  As if\n\tthey were needed.\n\n\tMichael now.  Looking at his bride.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    That's what we want.  And marriage.\n\t\t    Is what we do about it.\n\n\tKimmy smiles at him.  With love bigger than life itself.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    We are fools in this.  Thank\n\t\t    God Almighty.\n\n\tHe is done.  There is a silence.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER\n\t\t    Boy, that was good!\n\n\tPeople LAUGH.  The Minister holds up a sheet of paper.  For the\n\tcrowd to see.  Mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER\n\t\t    Michael and Kim also edited what\n\t\t    they want me to say...\n\n\tMore laughter.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER\n\t\t    The idea was, we're only marrying\n\t\t    once.  We have to remember it\n\t\t    forever.  Let's keep to the good\n\t\t    stuff.\n\t\t\t    (squints at the sheet)\n\t\t    You may kiss the bride.\n\n\tBigger LAUGHTER.  The Minister waves this off, his little joke.\n\tTurns to the best man, pantomimes the ring.  As the hammered gold\n\tcircle is handed to Michael, Julianne absently scratches her still-\n\tswollen finger.  Mandy taps Julianne on the arm, and produces...\n\n\t... a matching ring.  Take it! Gives it to her.  So Julianne steps\n\tforward.  Places the second ring into Kimmy's waiting hand.  Their\n\teyes meet, and hold throughout...\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER (O.S.)\n\t\t    If anyone here can show just cause\n\t\t    why this man and woman should not\n\t\t    be married, speak now.  Or forever\n\t\t    hold your peace.\n\n\tJulianne CLEARS her throat.  Kimmy's heart flutters.  In the\n\tsilence... Julianne's wonderful smile.  Just kidding.\n\n\tMichael reaches for Kim's hand, turns her gently to him.  Places\n\this ring on her finger.  Holds her hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Kimberly.  I promise to love.\n\t\t    And respect and comfort you.\n\t\t    To hear your voice and your\n\t\t    heart.  Until we are parted\n\t\t    by death.\n\n\tShe swallows.  Smiles a fleeting, beautiful smile.  Fumbles\n\tslightly, putting the ring on his finger.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t    Michael.  I promise to love and\n\t\t    respect and comfort you.  To\n\t\t    hear your voice and your heart.\n\t\t    Until we are parted by death.\n\n\tStaring in each other's eyes.  A moment so fragile, the Minister\n\twaits an extra beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER\n\t\t    For the record, you each agree\n\t\t    to marry the other?\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\t\t    (quickly)\n\t\t    I do!\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t\t    (smiling)\n\t\t    I do.\n\n\tThe Minister joins their right hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER\n\t\t    We haven't said much about God\n\t\t    this evening, I know.  But He\n\t\t    is here.  And He is happy.  To\n\t\t    bless His wonderful children.\n\n\tCLOSE now on Julianne.  For the inevitable moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER (O.S.)\n\t\t    In that Michael and Kimberly have\n\t\t    given themselves to each other by\n\t\t    solemn vows, and the exchanging\n\t\t    of rings...\n\n\tUnnoticed by the world.  Her eyes are close.\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER (O.S.)\n\t\t    I pronounce them husband and wife.\n\t\t    Those whom God has joined together,\n\t\t    let no one put asunder.\n\n\tThe eyes open.  Wet, brave, ready for...\n\n\t\t\t\tMINISTER (O.S.)\n\t\t    Now.  Kiss the bride.\n\n\tJulianne watching.  As Michael does.\n\n\tEXT.  WALLACE POND - NIGHT\n\n\tThis is what all the preparation was for.  Tables, lights, balloons,\n\tthe guests dancing on the hardwood floor, at the base of the gazebo.\n\tThe bride and groom among them, relaxed and happy.  Two who are one.\n\tPAN TO...\n\n\t... the stage, the band playing.  Julianne conferring with the twins\n\tand the band leader, clear that she's giving the instructions.\n\tThen, she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone...\n\n\t... KLUNKS it, for silence.  The band stops.  The dancers follow.\n\tAll eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor.  She looks to\n\tthe couple.  Just below her.  Then, to the crowd...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'm a writer, too, not as\n\t\t    good as Michael.  But I do\n\t\t    steal from quality.\n\n\tShe raises her glass.  Everyone at the table does the same.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    This is to my best friend.  On\n\t\t    the occasion of his wedding.\n\n\tShouts of support, a few whistles.  Silence.  She tells Michael...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    If I have truly come to know\n\t\t    your bride as my new sister.\n\t\t    This is in her heart...\n\n\tShe has to stop.  Swallows.  Because she will not let herself cry.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    \"Understand.  I'll slip quietly\n\t\t    away from the noisy crowd when\n\t\t    I see the pale stars rising,\n\t\t    blooming, over the oaks.\"\n\n\tDeep breath.  Looks in his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    \"I'll pursue solitary pathways\n\t\t    through the pale twilit meadows,\n\t\t    with only this one dream: You\n\t\t    come too.\"\n\n\tA hush.  SHARP applause.  From four hundred hands.  But not from\n\this.  He is too moved.  Too understanding of what he has heard.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I don't have a wedding gift.\n\t\t    But this is on loan.  Until\n\t\t    you two find your song...\n\n\tAnd with that the band begins.  The opening phrases of a song we\n\thave come to know.  Michael seems overwhelmed.  Julianne nods\n\ttoward the gazebo...\n\n\t... Michael takes his bride's hand, leads her up the stairs, into\n\this arms, as the twins step to the microphone, and guests begin to\n\tapplaud an unscheduled wedding dance...\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY/SAMMY\n\t\t\t    (singing)\n\t\t    Someday, when I'm awfully low,\n\t\t       And the world is cold,\n\t\t    I will feel a glow just thinking of you,\n\t\t       And the way you look tonight.\n\n\tSoft two-part harmony.  As perfect as the words.\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY/SAMMY\n\t\t\t    (singing)\n\t\t    You're lovely.  With your smile so warm,\n\t\t       And your cheeks so soft,\n\t\t    There is nothing for me but to love you,\n\t\t       Just the way you look tonight.\n\n\tJulianne can cry now.  Because she's tied with half the place.\n\n\t\t\t\tMANDY/SAMMY\n\t\t\t    (singing)\n\t\t    With each word, your tenderness grows,\n\t\t       Tearing my fears apart...\n\t\t    And the laugh that wrinkles your nose,\n\t\t       Touches my foolish heart.\n\n\tJulianne begins to sing.  Unheard.  Unseen.  Even by the man she's\n\tsinging to...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE/MANDY/SAMMY\n\t\t\t    (singing)\n\t\t    You're lovely, please don't ever change,\n\t\t       Keep that breathless charm,\n\t\t    Darling, please arrange it, cos I love you...\n\t\t       Just the way you look tonight.\n\n\tThe band keeps playing.  The dance goes on.  Two people lost in each\n\tother.  The way it's supposed to be.\n\n\tINT.  GREAT ROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\n\tBedlam.  Julianne caught in the middle of the throng.  A young\n\tcouple, dressed for travel, appear at the top of the staircase.\n\tThe SHOUT are deafening.  The bride has her bouquet...\n\n\t... she spots Julianne far below.  THROWS it her way, Julianne\n\treflexively GOES FOR IT...\n\n\t... not a fucking chance.  The twins nearly TRAMPLE her in the\n\tstampede, Mandy WRESTING the prize from Sammy's grasp.  Everyone\n\tCHEERS, and then the couple is...\n\n\t... FLYING down the stairs, RACING through the crowd with a\n\tprotective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards, heading for the door,\n\tfor freedom...\n\n\t... Julianne, trapped in the crush, loses sight of the couple,\n\tstruggles against the flow, suddenly panicked by the certainty\n\tthat she will never see him before...\n\n\tAnd then, he's THERE.  He has Julianne in his arms.  Holding her\n\tso tight.  An embrace so wonderful, so terrible, she could go mad\n\tfrom the confusion alone.  Against the din, he murmurs in her\n\tear...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t    Wherever I go.  However far...\n\n\tShe sobs.  Holds him.\n\n\tDeep, deep breath.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You win a few, you lose a few.\n\t\t    Some get rained out.\n\n\tAnd to her surprise...\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t\t     (V.O., very softly)\n\t\t    You have a good time?\n\n\tTo her greater surprise.  There are a few tears left, after all.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I did what I came to do.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER\n\t\t\t    (V.O., even softer)\n\t\t    Good girl.\n\n\tShe just can't speak now.  So she doesn't.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER (V.O.)\n\t\t    I was thinking.  Maybe you might\n\t\t    visit us for awhile.  We've got\n\t\t    the room made up.\n\n\tThis fucking guy.  God, she loves him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    I'll think about it.  I'm okay.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER (V.O.)\n\t\t    Oh, you're more than okay.\n\n\tJust above a whisper...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    You, too.\n\n\tAnd with the last of her strength...\n\n\t\t\t\tJULIANNE\n\t\t    If the sun comes up, I'll see\n\t\t    you tomorrow, huh?\n\n\tA chuckle.  At the other end.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIGGER (V.O.)\n\t\t     I'll play those odds.  You have\n\t\t     sweet dreams.\n\n\tWe hear the CLICK.  She turns her back on the stars.  Shoulders\n\tstraight.  Chin up.\n\n\tShe walks from frame.\n\n\tFADE TO BLACK.  HOLD END CREDITS.\n\n\t--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nMy Best Friend's Wedding\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Ronald Bass\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:31:53.495148"}
