PRAGUE - NIGHT\n\n               On a hill above the city is an old CATHEDRAL. The night is \n               spooky, with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones \n               and medieval walls.\n\n               A NERVOUS YOUNG HACKER makes his way down an alley.\n\n               There is a DOOR at the end of the alley. MUSIC can be faintly \n               heard from inside.\n\n               EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT\n\n               High above the street an INTRUDER DRESSED ALL IN BLACK spies \n               from the roof. He's watching with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES.\n\n               He pulls out a CROSSBOW and FIRES.\n\n               A BOLT flies, trailing CABLE.\n\n               THUNK! It sticks into the alley wall below.\n\n               EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT\n\n               As he passes by the ominous Cathedral, the Hacker spins, \n               sure he's heard something.\n\n               But there's nothing there. He continues on.\n\n               Then the Intruder comes sliding down the ZIP-LINE from above.\n\n               WHAM! He kicks the Hacker into the wall, knocking him out.\n\n               The Intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled \n               features of a dashing BRITISH SECRET AGENT. His name is \n               STERLING.\n\n                                     STERLING\n                         I hate to drop in unexpectedly.\n\n               Sterling searches the Hacker and pulls a SMALL BLACK CASE \n               from his coat. Inside the case is a DATA CHIP. Sterling tucks \n               it away.\n\n               Sterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp TUXEDO \n               underneath. He pulls out CAR KEYS. In a quick insert we see \n               the \"ASTON-MARTIN\" LOGO.\n\n               As he strolls back out the alley, he HEARS something and \n               flattens against the wall.\n\n               A BLACKED OUT SUV screeches to a stop, blocking his exit.\n\n               The SUV's HEADLIGHTS illuminate the slumped Hacker.\n\n               BAD GUYS get out to investigate, pulling out weapons.\n\n               Cornered, Sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in \n               the shadows. He gets to that DOOR the Hacker was heading \n               towards.\n\n               As he PICKS THE LOCK Sterling can hear MUSIC from inside. He \n               smooths his hair and prepares to \"blend in\" with the crowd.\n\n               INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Sterling comes through the door and his face falls. He's \n               stepped into a loud METAL CONCERT.\n\n               We see a GO-GO DANCER in LATEX. Onstage is RAMMSTEIN, a \n               bizarre German industrial-metal band.\n\n               The tattooed YOUNG CROWD slam dances and swings glo-stix \n               over their heads. Some wear rubber BRAIN SKULLCAPS outfitted \n               with fiber optic lights. It's a sea of SPIKED HAIR and BONDAGE \n               OUTFITS.\n\n               Sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd. \n               With his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken \n               coop.\n\n               ON THE BALCONY ABOVE THE CROWD stands a wild haired young \n               GANGSTER with PIERCED BROWS. With him is a STREET-TOUGH GIRL \n               with multi-colored hair. They look like a post-Apocalyptic \n               Bonnie & Clyde. They are YORGI and PETRA.\n\n               Yorgi checks his watch. His delivery is late. Then his CELL \n               PHONE rings. He's getting the news from outside.\n\n               He looks down, spots Sterling amidst the moshing crowd. With \n               that look, that tux, there's no mistaking what he is.\n\n               They make EYE CONTACT and Sterling gives a little nod.\n\n               Yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone.\n\n               Immediately VIKTOR starts moving in Sterling's direction.\n\n               Viktor is huge, with a MOHAWK and a six-inch GOATEE.\n\n               Sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit, pushing \n               through the freaky crowd.\n\n               EXT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Sterling's ASTON-MARTIN VANTAGE screeches away from the curb.\n\n               INT. ASTON-MARTIN - MOVING - NIGHT\n\n               Sterling is at the wheel of his spy car. He plugs the DATA \n               CHIP into the dash and punches buttons. A computer screen \n               says \"DATA DOWNLOADING\".\n\n               He sees a BLACKED-OUT SUV racing up behind him.\n\n               He accelerates and hits a SWITCH.\n\n               ARMORED PLATING slides up over the rear window.\n\n               EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT\n\n               The SUV is right behind him. Viktor rolls down the passenger \n               window, readies his PISTOL.\n\n               The rear bumper of the spy car opens. SMOKE BOMBS drop out.\n\n               They explode in MASSIVE CLOUDS, obscuring the narrow, street.\n\n               Sterling skids around a corner.\n\n               The blinded bad guys drive straight into a STOREFRONT. Glass \n               and merchandise flies as the SUV gets stuck.\n\n               The Aston-Martin rounds another corner and slides to a stop.\n\n               Blocking the road ahead are two more SUV's.\n\n               A MOTORCYCLE slides to a stop in front of them. The rider is \n               ANDERS, a leather clad biker who looks half Viking.\n\n               Anders pulls out a SILENCED SUB-MACHINE GUN and starts \n               BLASTING.\n\n               BULLETS SLAM into the Aston-Martin, cracking the bullet-proof \n               glass, shattering headlights, and BLOWING OUT THE FRONT TIRES!\n\n               Sterling jams it into reverse and backs around the corner on \n               the RIMS.\n\n               INT. ASTON-MARTIN - IDLING - NIGHT\n\n               Sterling notices an ERROR MESSAGE now flashing on his computer \n               screen: \"TRANSMISSION ERROR: - DATA PARTIALLY SENT\".\n\n               Sterling looks around desperately. Somehow he's got to get \n               this data out of here.\n\n               Straight ahead is the RIVER. Chugging up the river: a PARTY \n               BARGE.\n\n               PARTYGOERS in formal attire dance to an orchestra. A SWIMMING \n               POOL is in the middle of the deck for a perfect water landing.\n\n                                     STERLING\n                         Time for a slow boat to China.\n\n               He hits a BUTTON.\n\n               EXT. COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT\n\n               The rear license plate folds down, revealing a ROCKET ENGINE.\n\n               Flames spew as he jams down the accelerator.\n\n               Sterling is pushed back into his seat by the G-forces.\n\n               SPARKS fly from the rims as he skips across the pavement at \n               ever increasing speed.\n\n               Anders FIRES with his gun, but Sterling is getting away!\n\n               But then KIRILL steps around the corner. He's academic \n               looking, a CHAIN SMOKING intellectual with COKE-BOTTLE \n               GLASSES. He's also a highly proficient and cold-blooded \n               SNIPER.\n\n               Kirill puts his lit cigarette behind his ear and unslings a \n               SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE LAUNCHER from his shoulder.\n\n               The Aston-Martin reaches the riverbank and goes AIRBORNE. It \n               ROCKETS through the air towards the party barge.\n\n               We see the car REFLECTED in Kirill's glasses as he AIMS.\n\n               On a little SCREEN we see the missile launcher HOME IN on \n               the HEAT SOURCE of the jet engine.\n\n               The missile locks-in and FIRES...\n\n               HEATSEEKER P.O.V. - we see a GREEN CAR with all its hot spots \n               GLOWING RED. Camera ROARS towards the flying car.\n\n               INT. ASTON-MARTIN - FLYING - NIGHT\n\n               Sterling sees the missile streaking at him.\n\n                                     STERLING\n                         Oh bloody hell!\n\n               EXT. THE RIVER - NIGKT\n\n               WHOOMPH! The Aston-Martin EXPLODES in mid-air.\n\n               Partygoers shriek as the AXLE and FLAMING RIMS rain down on \n               the deck.\n\n               Kirill takes the cigarette from his ear, PUFFS IT.\n\n               Finally, Sterling's flaming BOW TIE flutters down and lands \n               on a LEAPING SALMON ICE-SCULPTURE above a tantalizing SEAFOOD \n               BUFFET.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. WASHINGTON D.C.\n\n               A STRAFING SHOT over the city. We make a sudden left turn \n               and SPEED OUT OF TOWN.\n\n               We shoot over to the BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS of VIRGINIA. In \n               the middle of NOWHERE we dive towards a COMPLEX OF BLACK \n               BUILDINGS.\n\n               INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Inside it's modern, cold and high tech. An elevator COUNTS \n               DOWN to a deep basement level.\n\n               The doors open and a TALL MAN man with a PROSTHETIC LEG \n               strides down the empty hall. AGENT GIBBONS is African-\n               American, a battle-scarred WARRIOR. Even with a limp he looks \n               sturdy, confident, deadly.\n\n               At the end of the hall is a METAL DOOR.\n\n               INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Gibbons walks into the INFORMATION ROOM of the NATIONAL \n               SECURITY AGENCY (NSA). There are WORLD MAPS, SATELLITE IMAGES \n               on COMPUTER SCREENS, TECHIES monitoring everything.\n\n               If a nuclear war broke out, you could run the country from \n               down here.\n\n               Gibbons takes an elevator up.\n\n               INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n               The office is expensive yet devoid of personality, reflecting \n               the shadowy nature of it's owner. One wall is GLASS, looking \n               down on the information room. SAM TANNICK, grizzled NSA chief, \n               looks down at the activity below.\n\n                                     SAM TANNICK\n                         Come.\n\n               Gibbons enters, stands by the desk.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         Evening, Sam.\n\n               Sam remains in shadow.\n\n                                     SAM TANNICK\n                         What do you have?\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         Not a whole helluva lot. His final \n                         transmission was mangled. About \n                         something or someone called \"Ahab\". \n                         Whatever it is, it cost him his life.\n\n                                     SAM TANNICK\n                         He was the best there was. That makes \n                         three agents lost.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         They're ruthless and they have a lot \n                         of firepower. It's only a matter of \n                         time before they figure out how to \n                         deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna \n                         have a catastrophe on our hands.\n\n                                     SAM TANNICK\n                         Silent Night in the hands of a bunch \n                         of impertinent cowboys\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         We're gonna have to step in, Sam. \n                         Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown \n                         in a field of cactus. Let me take \n                         care of it.\n\n                                     SAM TANNICK\n                         How will you fix it?\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         I'll go in with a team. But first \n                         I'm going to need some intel. I'll \n                         have to put someone inside, someone \n                         new, someone they won't see coming. \n                         One of their own.\n\n                                     SAM TANNICK\n                         So you'll dredge the bottom again. \n                         You've done that before. The results \n                         were... uneven.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         You wanna find out about rats, ask a \n                         rat. I've had my people put together \n                         a talent pool. I downloaded it to \n                         your desktop.\n\n               Gibbons snaps on the giant FLATSCREEN on Sam's desk. He starts \n               cycling through PHOTO AFTER PHOTO of TOUGH LOOKING MEN.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         The usual prospects. Convicts, \n                         contract killers, murde...\n\n                                     SAM TANNICK\n                         The scum of the Earth.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         But programmable.

SKYSCRAPER - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT\n\n               The huge ARCO TOWER rises up towards a moonlit sky.\n\n               We see ACCOMPLICE #1 (TRAVIS PASTRANA) sneak up and take \n               position behind a FOUNTAIN.\n\n               ACCOMPLICE #2 (CAREY HART) sneaks across a roof and takes \n               position overlooking the fountain position of #1.\n\n               ACCOMPLICE #3 (DAVE MIRRA) takes up position in the second \n               story window of a FLOPHOUSE HOTEL down the street.\n\n               A MESSENGER (BOB BURNQUIST) skates up to the front of the \n               skyscraper with a PACKAGE. He gets the attention of the \n               SECURITY GUARD inside. The Security Guard unlocks the door \n               and lets him in.\n\n               Just then a VAN pulls up and ACCOMPLICES #4 (SHAUN PALMER) \n               and #5 (MAT HOFFMAN) hop out. They open up the back and a \n               BICYCLE is rolled out of the back by a MAN IN A HOODED JACKET.\n\n               Jacket Man rolls the bike to the skyscraper and enters the \n               lobby.\n\n               INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - NIGHT\n\n               The Security Guard is checking his computer.\n\n                                     SECURITY GUARD\n                         Crump... I'm sorry, no one by that \n                         name.\n\n               K The Guard glances up as Jacket Man gets into an ELEVATOR.\n\n                                     SECURITY GUARD\n                         Hey! You can't go up there!\n\n               The Security Guard rushes to intercept him. The Messenger \n               kicks his skateboard out, TRIPPING UP the Security Guard.\n\n               The Messenger hauls ass out the door. The Security Guard \n               pulls out his WALKIE-TALKIE.\n\n                                     SECURITY GUARD\n                         We've got an intruder in the express \n                         elevator!\n\n               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n\n               The button for \"91 - ROOF ACCESS\" is lit up. Jacket Man waits \n               patiently.\n\n               INT. 91ST FLOOR - NIGHT\n\n               This fancy office is empty for the night. The STAIRWELL DOOR \n               opens and a PLATOON of SECURITY GUARDS rushes in. They take \n               Up position in front of the elevator doors armed with BILLY \n               CLUBS and TASERS.\n\n               DING! The elevator arrives and the door swings open. But \n               there's NOBODY INSIDE.\n\n               One Guard steps forward and suddenly a bicycle SWINGS DOWN \n               from the ceiling, TAGGING HIM IN THE FACE. He falls back, \n               TASERING another Guard.\n\n               Jacket Man drops down onto his bike and pedals through the \n               chaos before the Guards know what hit them. There's a CURVY \n               PIECE OF ART in the room, some kind of modern art statue.\n\n               Jacket Man rides up the artwork like a ramp and does a \n               TABLETOP AERIAL over a DIVIDER. He hits the ground pedalling, \n               the Guards hot after him.\n\n               Jacket Man enters a HUGE OPEN ROOM with a FIELD OF CUBICLES \n               in the middle. He bunny hops onto a desk and SLIDES TO A \n               STOP. He tosses back his hood and we get a good look at him \n               for the first time.\n\n               He is XANDER CAGE. He's got a shaved head, bizarre TATTOOS \n               all over his body and multiple PIERCINGS. He's lean and \n               heavily cut, even dangerous looking.\n\n               The Guards charge at him and he HOPS up onto the top of the \n               CUBICLE WALL. This thing is maybe FOUR INCHES WIDE and FIVE \n               FEET TALL.\n\n               He pedals across the top of the cubicle wall, the Guards \n               scrambling after him.\n\n               Xander bunny hops over one guy's head onto the next set of \n               cubicles and pedals hard. The Guards fall all over themselves \n               trying to catch him.\n\n               At the other end Xander catches air and lands on a CONFERENCE \n               TABLE. He does a WHEELIE across it's length with Guards \n               closing in.\n\n               Xander springs up and does a TAIL WHIP, knocking them back \n               with his rear wheel. He lands and pedals to the stairwell \n               untouched.\n\n               EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT\n\n               Xander bursts out of the stairwell to the top of the TALLEST \n               BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN LA. He climbs on a RAISED PLATFORM.\n\n               From here he can drop down onto another level that is strewn \n               with SATELLITE DISHES and MICROWAVE RELAYS.\n\n               Guards rush onto the roof and try to corral him.\n\n               Xander tears off his jacket, revealing a BACKPACK on his \n               back and VIDEO CAMERA on his chest. He pulls out a ROAD FLARE \n               and SPARKS IT. We see there are SOAKED RAGS tied to his \n               SPOKES.\n\n               He LIGHTS THEM with the flare. Then he TOSSES THE FLARE off \n               the building.\n\n               EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT\n\n               The Accomplices see the flare drop. #'s 1, 2 & 3 pull CAMERAS \n               OUT and start filming.\n\n               EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT\n\n               Xander races around the roof like a trapped animal. He evades \n               Security Guards, picking up speed.\n\n               With Guards right behind, he drops off the TOP PLATFORM and \n               lands on a massive SATELLITE DISH.\n\n               Using the dish as a ramp, Xander LAUNCHES himself OFF THE \n               TOP OF THE BUILDING. We're talking 90 some stories here.\n\n               He spins through the air, his bike on fire. He's doing end \n               over end backflips. One... Two... Three... Four...\n\n               He's looping through space on his bike, a crazy man on a \n               flaming bike against a backdrop of sleek skyscrapers and \n               night lights.\n\n               The stunt is covered by the various Accomplices and Xander's \n               own chest camera, in SUPER 8 and DIGITAL VIDEO, from four \n               different angles.\n\n               Xander ditches the bike, kicking it away from him and plummets \n               towards the ground.\n\n               At the last moment he throws out a \"bucket\" and his PARACHUTE \n               OPENS.\n\n               EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT\n\n               The bicycle comes flying down and SMASHES into the pavement.\n\n               It bounces a full TWO STORIES back up before coming to rest.\n\n               Xander glides down and makes his landing. Accomplices #4 and \n               #5 rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the \n               van. SIRENS APPROACH as the van makes it's escape.\n\n               As COP CARS screech up to the skyscraper, one of them RUNS \n               OVER the smoking wreckage of the bike.\n\n                                                                   SLAM TO:\n\n               TITLE SEQUENCE - HARDCORE MUSIC plays as we see a flowing \n               TAPESTRY OF FLORID TATTOOS. SILHOUETTED against this backdrop \n               we see the OUTLINES of NUDE WOMEN riding BMX BIKES in a HALF-\n               PIPE, BLADING ever obstacles, SKY SURFING and doing street \n               SKATE TRICKS. It's a collision of outlandish imagery that \n               tells you one thing: This ain't your daddy's spy movie.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT\n\n               Xander, now on a MOTORCYCLE, zips through traffic. He's \n               smiling, leaning it way over on the turns. He's got another \n               BACKPACK on his back.\n\n               EXT. LOFT DISTRICT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT\n\n               Xander drives his motorcycle into the garage of his building.\n\n               INT. XANDER'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               A FREIGHT ELEVATOR rises up, bringing Xander and his \n               motorcycle into the loft.\n\n               There are EXTREME SPORTS ACTION POSTERS on the walls, \n               MOTORCYCLE PARTS and BARBELLS on the floor, and everywhere \n               there's EXTREME SPORTS EQUIPMENT of every description.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Sky, you there?

Xander straightens it as he goes by.\n\n               He hears her in the sectioned off \"bedroom\" and heads back \n               there.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Did I promise you a fat vacation or \n                         what?

What's the charges \n                         this time?\n\n               The Stormtrooper pulls out a DART GUN and SHOOTS Xander. He \n               pulls a CHROME DART from his chest, examines it.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                              (groggy)\n                         You... pussies...\n\n               Xander slides to the floor.\n\n               FADE TO BLACK.\n\n               INT. PAN'S DINER - DAY\n\n               A SIDEWAYS IMAGE: an out of focus COFFEE CREAMER.\n\n               Xander wakes up with his head on the counter of a DINER. He \n               shakes out the cobwebs.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         What the hell?\n\n               WHIP PAN as a WAITRESS walks by. Xander blinks.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Hey. Where am I? How did I get here?\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n                         I don't know, you wandered in ten \n                         minutes ago and put your head down. \n                         I told you we were closing.\n\n               Xander looks around, sees a TRUCKER chewing with his mouth \n               open. A SALESMAN buried in his NEWSPAPER.\n\n               Xander gets up. Where the hell is he? He takes a step towards \n               the door.\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n                         Want some coffee?\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Huh?\n\n               The Waitress pours him coffee. QUICK PUSH TO: her hands are \n               shaking.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You alright?\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n                              (smiles)\n                         Fine, just fine.

When he swigs his coffee, he notices something \n               written on his napkin in shaky ballpoint: \"S.O.S.\"\n\n               What the hell? He looks at the Trucker. The Trucker's staring \n               at the waitress. QUICK PUSH TO: The Trucker has a BULGE \n               underneath his vest... then PUSH TO: The Salesman's eyes \n               darting about suspiciously, newspaper pulled up to his nose. \n               Something is going down...\n\n               He hears a SLOWED DOWN VOICE and glances back at the Trucker, \n               who's now fixing him with a DEATH STARE. Xander snaps from \n               his reverie.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         What?\n\n                                     TRUCKER\n                         I said, you got a problem, boy?\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Problem? No, no problem. You go right \n                         ahead.\n\n                                     TRUCKER\n                         With what? I said, go right on ahead \n                         with what?\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Whatever, dude.\n\n               The Trucker and the Salesman look at each other. Suddenly \n               they jump up.\n\n               The Trucker pulls a PISTOL from his vest, the Salesman \n               brandishes the SHOTGUN he had behind the paper. The Waitress \n               cringes.\n\n                                     TRUCKER\n                         Alright, nobody make a move!\n                              (to Xander)\n                         Shoulda walked away when you had the \n                         chance, dumb shit.\n\n                                     SALESMAN\n                         Forget him, Buck, let's just do it.\n\n                                     TRUCKER\n                         Shut up!\n                              (in Xander's face)\n                         You keep still or I'm gonna make \n                         damn sure you stop breathing today. \n                         Got that?\n\n               Xander stays strangely calm, his senses now fully focused.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                              (shrugs)\n                         Alright, \"Buck\", whatever you say.\n\n               The Waitress let's out a whimper.\n\n                                     TRUCKER\n                         Keep your gotdam mouth shut and empty \n                         that register! Couldn't just let him \n                         leave, could ya! You know what I'm \n                         gonna do to ya for that? Huh? Do \n                         ya?!\n\n               She goes to open the register and knocks a tray of glasses \n               on the floor. Xander springs into action.\n\n               He CHOPS down on the Trucker's arm and ELBOWS him in the \n               face.\n\n               Xander twists the gun out of his hand and kicks his legs out \n               from under him.\n\n               The Salesman pumps on his shotgun, but it seems to be jammed.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Better shoot me quick.\n\n               The Salesman fights with his gun but can't get it to work. \n               Xander advances on him.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Too late!\n\n               He unleashes with a series of rapid front kicks to the jaw.\n\n               The Salesman goes crashing through the kitchen doors.\n\n               Xander turns to the terrified Waitress.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Alright, bitch, what's going on?\n\n               She stares at him, unable to speak. He raises the gun.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Talk! What's the game? Who are you \n                         people?\n\n               The front door bell JINGLES. A guy with an impeccably tailored \n               suit and a cane hobbles in. It's Gibbons. There a problem, \n               Mr. Cage?\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Who the hell are you?\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         The name's Gibbons. You were saying?\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         What is this place?\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         Looks like a diner.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the \n                         problem is. I wake up drugged to \n                         find what? You've got a \"salesman\" \n                         over here reading a three week old \n                         newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a \n                         \"trucker\", who happens to be packing \n                         a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped \n                         that something is going down when \n                         she passes me a note. How's that for \n                         twisted logic? How did she know there \n                         was trouble unless they pulled the \n                         guns before I \"walked\" in? And if \n                         that's true, why'd they stop and \n                         wait until I woke up to gaffle the \n                         money? Then I notice how beefy they \n                         both are. Hell, even the waitress is \n                         cut. All three of them look like \n                         they went through the same training \n                         program. Ergo they ain't strangers \n                         and this isn't what it seems. That's \n                         how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round \n                         off even if I gave him all day. Why?\n\n               He aims at the Waitress and FIRES! She's startled, but unhurt.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Cuz there's nothing but blanks in \n                         these guns. And no offense, but their \n                         performances were terrible.\n\n               Xander tosses the gun on the counter. Gibbons gives a sly \n               smile.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         Not bad. Not bad at all. Have a seat.\n\n               Gibbons sits in a booth. Xander sits across from him. In the \n               background the Waitress helps the Trucker and Salesman up.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         Most guys we ran through this either \n                         took off or helped them rob the place. \n                         I expected you to do the same.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         That shows me already that you don't \n                         have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         Whether you thought this was for \n                         real or not, you jumped in and helped \n                         the waitress on instinct. That tells \n                         me something about your character.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Good for you. Now why don't you stop \n                         wasting my time and tell me what you \n                         want. You didn't go through all this \n                         for my benefit.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         It's your lucky day. You just might \n                         get the chance to pay back our \n                         wonderful country for all the freedom \n                         you enjoy.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else \n                         would have this kind of budget? Now \n                         you're gonna hit me with the sales \n                         pitch.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         Alright, Cage, you've got me.

Sometimes they \n                         give me answers you wouldn't admit \n                         to in a million years.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Are we done now?

Xander blinks at him.\n\n               He pulls another CHROME DART from his gut and examines it.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You bastards love to see me sleep.\n\n               WHACK!

He's shocked to find \n               that he's...\n\n               INT. AIRPLANE - TWILIGHT\n\n               Xander's on the floor of a military aircraft. TWO OTHER TOUGH \n               GUYS are waking up next to him. One's a greaser named VIRG, \n               the other is T.J., ex-Navy.\n\n               Xander notices as they each pull out CHROME DARTS. They sit \n               up, looking at each other. Xander chuckles.\n\n                                     VIRG\n                         What's so damn funny?\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Been to any good diners lately?\n\n               The three laugh, realizing they're all in the same boat.\n\n                                     T.J.\n                         We must be the final \"candidates\".\n\n               They quiet down as they notice for the first time, THEY ARE \n               NOT ALONE.\n\n               Sitting silently on benches facing them are SOLDIERS DRESSED \n               IN BLACK. They wear BLACK MASKS over their faces. They are a \n               nasty looking BLACK OPS TEAM.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Nobody told me this was a costume \n                         party.\n\n               The Black Ops Team, just stares.\n\n                                     T.J.\n                         I've worked with guys like this \n                         before. Black Ops. Serious government \n                         spooks.\n\n               Virg notices something STRAPPED TO HIS BODY. They all have \n               them.\n\n                                     VIRG\n                         Heads up, man.

This does not argue \n                         well.\n\n               Then the red light switches to GREEN.\n\n               One of the Soldiers opens the JUMP DOOR. The rest of the \n               team advances on Xander, Virg and T.J.\n\n                                     VIRG\n                         This is bullshit! Hey!\n\n               They drag Virg to the door and THROW HIM OUT. T.J. goes next, \n               kicking and fighting.\n\n               Then they turn on Xander.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         I get the picture.\n\n               Xander jumps out on his own.\n\n               We see him tumbling away from the airplane. Far below his \n               chute BLOSSOMS OPEN.\n\n               EXT. A FIELD - TWILIGHT\n\n               We see three chutes coming down. The first two HIT HARD.\n\n               We ROCKET IN on the last chute as Xander lands like a pro.\n\n               The other guys run up to him. Then they hear SHOUTING in \n               SPANISH.\n\n                                     VIRG\n                         Jee-zus, man!

It's every \n                         man for himself.\n\n               They wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as \n               they TAKE OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.\n\n               Xander runs low down a culvert. There's SHOUTING all around.\n\n               He flattens down and crawls up over the rise. What he sees \n               stuns him.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You gotta be kidding me.\n\n               We crane up to reveal A FIELD OF POT PLANTS. There's a COCAINE \n               PROCESSING PLANT along the field's edge. The whole place \n               looks exactly like a Central American DRUG FARM.\n\n               NARCO TERRORISTS run around with AK-47's.\n\n               Xander sneaks past EQUIPMENT covered in CAMOUFLAGE NETTING.\n\n               A squad of Narcos runs by and Xander makes his move.\n\n               He rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the \n               HEADLIGHTS of a truck.\n\n               Narcos hop out and charge forward.\n\n               Xander raises his hands.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You boys are too good for me. Guess \n                         I failed this one, huh?\n\n               They grab him and haul him away.\n\n               INT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               We see a RUSTY MEAT HOOK. A CHAIN is wrapped around it.\n\n               Attached to the chain, his arms over his head, is Xander.\n\n               He's in the middle of a bleak looking room. There are \n               BLOODSTAINS on the wooden walls, the floor strewn with filthy \n               HAY.\n\n               Behind him against the wall Xander sees T.J. and Virg both \n               HOG-TIED.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         So much for \"every man for himself\". \n                         Nice to see you again, fellas.\n\n                                     T.J.\n                         They really went all out on this \n                         one.

Some weather we're havin'.\n\n               Narco Guards bring in one of their PARACHUTES and toss it on \n               the floor. They exit, closing the door behind them.\n\n               Jefe goes to the table throws back the towel. Beneath it are \n               HIDEOUS, BLOOD ENCRUSTED TORTURE DEVICES: a HACK SAW, a BOLT \n               CUTTERS, KNIVES, CHISELS, a BLOW TORCH.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         What's on the menu tonight?

You got 'em?\n\n               Jefe nods, choking, and reaches into his pocket.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Hand 'em to me.\n\n               Instead Jefe hurls them out the window.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         I hope you're getting paid extra for \n                         this.\n\n               Xander jerks the chain, slamming Jefe head first into the \n               wall. Jefe drops, knocked out.\n\n               Outside it sounds like a full scale FIREFIGHT. Xander gets \n               the machete and CUTS the ropes holding T.J. and Virg.\n\n               Then a HAIL OF BULLETS sprays through the room.\n\n               All three guys hit the deck but T.J. gets shot. He clutches \n               his side, BLOOD all over his hands.\n\n                                     T.J.\n                         I'm hit!

DRUG FARM - NIGHT\n\n               Narcos are shouting, running to and fro.\n\n               TRACER ROUNDS cut through the air. They are trying to repel \n               an UNSEEN ASSAULT FORCE.\n\n               Overhead SIX MILITARY HELICOPTERS buzz the compound like \n               Apocalypse Now, their NIGHT SUNS lighting up the place.\n\n               Xander comes out of the torture building holding T.J. in a \n               fireman's carry. His hands are still CUFFED, the length of \n               chain dragging.\n\n               Xander crouches behind some equipment, putting T.J. on the \n               ground.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You alright?\n\n                                     T.J.\n                         I used to be a SEAL, it's not the \n                         first time I've been shot.

I'm gonna steal us some wheels.\n\n               Xander moves on, finds cover under the camouflage netting.\n\n               He can see Narcos shooting into the trees at the UNSEEN ENEMY.\n\n               Looking the other way, he spots Virg running back his way.\n\n               He's been corralled by one of the Helicopters.\n\n               He's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's Night \n               Sun.\n\n               Xander darts out and GRABS him, pulling him under the \n               camouflage netting.\n\n                                     VIRG\n                         They're all over the place!

His cuffed hands \n               and the dangling chain make it difficult.\n\n               He's heading straight into the FIELD OF POT PLANTS.\n\n               Suddenly the massive SPOTLIGHT picks him out.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Shit!\n\n               The CHOPPER swoops down after him.\n\n               Its big GATLING GUNS turn, aiming right at him.\n\n               BRAAAAAAAAPPP! The guns cut loose, tearing up the ground \n               right behind him.\n\n               Xander sprints, the chopper after him like Cary Grant in \n               \"North By Northwest\", except instead of corn fields, Xander's \n               running through a field of HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS.\n\n               Xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him.\n\n               Xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the \n               plants.\n\n               All around him it's a chaos of Helicopters and GUNFIRE.\n\n               Two choppers attack the factory building, BLASTING it with \n               their guns. Narcos run terrified.\n\n               Xander notices a FAT PURPLE BUD on the plant right in front \n               of him. He SNAPS IT OFF.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         I'm gonna need to hit the trees after \n                         a night like this.\n\n               He tucks it-into his shirt and takes off through the POT \n               FOREST.\n\n               Xander finally spots a vehicle. It's a TRUCK LADEN WITH BAILS \n               OF COCAINE. He heads for it.\n\n               Then the SPOTLIGHT finds him again and the Chopper swings \n               around. The gatling guns RIP the plants to pieces all around \n               him.\n\n               Xander hauls ass, heading for the truck.\n\n               Bullets chew up the dirt all around him.\n\n               As the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns RAKE THE TRUCK.\n\n               There is a FLASH as the GAS TANK goes up.\n\n               WHOOOOPPHH! A SUPERNOVA OF FIRE AND HIGH-GRADE COKE erupts \n               into the night air.\n\n               Xander dives into a DRAINAGE DITCH. He tumbles down into \n               FILTHY WATER.\n\n               A powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white.\n\n               Near him is a big DRAINPIPE leeching sewage. Xander crawls \n               inside.\n\n               The Chopper makes another pass overhead.\n\n               The big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on.\n\n               Xander gives a sigh of relief. He crawls out of the drainpipe.\n\n               JEEPS race by on the road right above him as MILITARY MEN \n               flood the compound. There's no going back.\n\n               Xander turns and makes his way along the tree line.\n\n               The chopper and gunfire are in the distance now. Things are \n               quieter here and he starts to relax. Bad idea.\n\n               As he goes by, one of the TREES moves.\n\n               He takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on \n               EXPLODES UPWARDS. ARMS reach out, tackling Xander from behind.\n\n               Another TEAM of BLACK OPS SOLDIERS bursts from the weeds, \n               the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape.\n\n               They fall on him like a curtain.\n\n               XANDER'S P.O.V. - Soldiers hold him down while a BLACK HOOD \n               is pulled over his head.\n\n               FADE TO BLACK.\n\n               INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - DAY\n\n               As the MASSIVE HANGER DOORS CLOSE we can see CHOPPERS taking \n               off and landing. MEXICAN SOLDIERS load Jefe and his Narcos \n               onto a FEDERALE BUS. Virg resists and is BEATEN. T.J. can be \n               seen being loaded into an AMBULANCE.\n\n               The hanger doors slide shut with a THUD.\n\n               We see Xander's HANDS as the CHAINS are cut away.\n\n               Xander sits in a chair with the BLACK HOOD still over his \n               head. He blinks when the hood is torn off. A Black Ops Soldier \n               smirks as he walks away.\n\n               Xander looks around, sees the Black Ops Team unpacking some \n               STRANGE GEAR. Two of them are dumping bottles of a CLEAR \n               LIQUID into a RUSTY CLAWFOOT BATHTUB.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Nice of you to draw me a bath. Is it \n                         Saturday already?\n\n               The Black Ops guys grin knowingly.\n\n               On the other side, Xander sees a FLIGHT CREW readying a \n               GULFSTREAM for travel. Gibbons steps up from behind him.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         Congratulations, you've just graduated \n                         at the head of your class.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You're a cold piece of work.

BEAT-UP CAR - MOVING\n\n               Xander sits in the back, wedged between TWO IDENTICAL LOOKING \n               TOUGH GUYS.

Two, I don't \n                         wanna be here either, so just step \n                         off. Three, if you had the authority \n                         to shoot me you would've done it by \n                         now, so just ease up on the machismo, \n                         bitch. Now that we've got that sorted \n                         out, I'm gonna get some rest.\n\n               Xander lays down on the bed. Slovo stares, burning with \n               hatred.

A big \n               bouncer in a leather coat works the door. This is a highclass, \n               expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous.\n\n               Xander and Slovo walk up to the place. Xander's wearing a \n               Tshirt that says \"RON JEREMY: AMERICAN LEGEND\" complete with \n               a photo of the Hedgehog.\n\n               INT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT\n\n               A STRIPPER that looks like a runway model SLIDES across the \n               stage on SKATEBOARD KNEE-PADS while PATRONS cheer. The disco \n               is a combination STRIP-CLUB and CONCERT VENUE.

They're surrounded \n               by straight faced BODYGUARDS.\n\n               What ANARCHY 99 is doing in their booth with the STRIPPERS \n               looks like Led Zeppelin on tour. Booze, broads, good times... \n               These guys are living like rock stars.\n\n               They're all here: Anders the biker, Viktor, Kirill. In the \n               middle sit Yorgi and Petra.

He heads for the exit, \n               pushing his way through the crowd. But then he spots him, \n               not by the door but deeper in the club.\n\n                                     SLOVO\n                         Oh no!\n\n               He sees Xander walk right up to the Anarchy 99 booth and \n               start talking to them.\n\n                                     SLOVO\n                         Jesus Christ!\n\n               Slovo can't hear a thing, but they're obviously interested \n               in what he has to say. Next thing he knows Xander is pointing \n               at him and waving him over.\n\n                                     SLOVO\n                              (horrified)\n                         What the hell...?\n\n               Slovo makes his way through the crowd to the booth.

Before he \n               can pry it from her hand, she's pulled another gun from \n               nowhere and has it jammed against his neck.

ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY\n\n               Xander's timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the \n               door, a BUS passes by.\n\n               Kirill keeps focused, waiting for the bus to pass.\n\n                P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is sporadically visible \n               through the bus windows.\n\n               Kirill's finger tightens on the trigger...\n\n               As soon as the bus passes he FIRES!\n\n               But Xander's not there, he's ducked down to tie his shoe.\n\n               CRASH! The glass door behind him shatters. Feigning surprise, \n               Xander PUNCHES PETRA IN THE FACE and sprints down the block.\n\n               He runs bent low, the parked cars protecting him from the \n               sniper. Kirill fires anyway, taking out car windows.\n\n               At the end of the block is a long staircase with a METAL \n               RAIL down the middle.\n\n               As he runs by an outdoor restaurant Xander snatches the \n               SERVING TRAY from a startled WAITER, sending food and drink \n               flying.\n\n               He hops on the serving tray like it's a skateboard and does \n               a RAIL-SLIDE down the length of the stairs. He's moving too \n               fast for Kirill.\n\n               He jumps off at the bottom and the tray POPS UP INTO THE \n               AIR.\n\n               Kirill BLASTS it like a clay pigeon.\n\n               By now Xander is out of sight. Kirill pounds his rifle in \n               frustration.\n\n               Petra gets to the top of the stairs. She gives Kirill a \"Where \n               did he go?\" look. Her nose is bloody, helping to sell her \n               performance.\n\n               Then she turns and looks off after Xander. She sees his GTO \n               speeding away.\n\n                                                                   FADE TO:\n\n               EXT. NORWEGIAN FJORDS - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               We're looking down at a SHIP moving through the fjord, seen \n               from high above. It's towing a SMALLER BOAT behind it. An \n               airplane? No, we're at the top of the Trollveggen, Norway's \n               legendary \"Troll Wall\". It's a near 5,000 foot sheer drop to \n               the ocean.\n\n               Six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff. They wear \n               webbed \"squirrel\" jumpsuits, helmets and parachutes. On each \n               thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced \n               MP-5 sub-machine guns. Together they stare down at the ship.\n\n               Petra is among them. She looks down at her watch. It is \n               precisely 5:59PM. She glances around. The top of the cliff \n               is rocky and flat. Xander is nowhere to be seen.\n\n               FIFTY YARDS AWAY - we see Xander sneaking forward military \n               style. He's got his \"stakeout suit\" on and is keeping low.\n\n               HE CHECKS HIS WATCH: \"6 PM\"\n\n               The members of Anarchy 99 put on their goggles and, without \n               saying a word, they leap off the Troll Wall.\n\n               Xander runs to the edge and looks down. He sees the group \n               freefailing down the sheer cliff face.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Very nice.\n\n               The six plummet away from him at incredible speed. In a hard \n               arch, they peak at 120 m.p.h.\n\n               Then, using the webbed wings under their arms and between \n               their legs, they go into aerodynamic \"track\" positions and \n               rocket away from the wall.\n\n               Like dark angels, they soar out over the water in formation.\n\n               ON THE SHIP BELOW --\n\n               The ship below is a scientific research vessel. On the deck, \n               a few SAILORS and SCIENTISTS watch the sun set.\n\n               The six dark figures close in rapidly.\n\n               At the last moment they pull their chutes and deftly glide \n               towards the ship.\n\n               A sailor looks up and spots them.\n\n               Before he can shout, he's SHOT IN THE LEG and goes down.\n\n               Seconds later, they're on the deck, tearing off their rigs.\n\n               They race across the deck, taking over the ship in a surgical \n               manner. They herd everyone back heading for the bridge.\n\n               Petra hangs back. She looks back at the cliff, up towards \n               Xander.\n\n               XANDER'S P.O.V.\n\n               Through his SUPER BINOCULARS we see them storming the bridge.\n\n               As they head inside, they disappear from view.\n\n               Xander hits a button on the side of the binoculars.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Let's see what's going on inside...\n\n               \"PENETRATOR\" P.O.V.\n\n               Now he can see THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE SHIP.\n\n               He sees THE CREW, herded into a room and LOCKED IN by Anarchy \n               99.\n\n               INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Anarchy 99 seals the door, locking the crew away. They slap \n               five and bump chests, still totally amped up.\n\n               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               ANGLE ON - a LARGE SUBMERSIBLE VEHICLE. It's white and twelve \n               feet long. There are MOTORS on either side and a PANEL OF \n               SOLAR CELLS on the top of a periscope-like projection rising \n               from the back.\n\n               This is the AHAB DEVICE. It sits in the WET WELL at the back \n               of the ship, ready to be launched out the back sea doors.\n\n                                     YORGI\n                         Ready the boat.\n\n               There is a SMALLER BOAT moored to the back of the ship.\n\n               Kirill and Viktor hop onto it's deck. They start to WHISTLE \n               as they work. Sounds like the \"Andy Griffith\" theme.\n\n               XANDER'S BINOCULARS P.O.V.\n\n               He takes DIGITAL PHOTOS of the Ahab device.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         What the hell are you guys stealing?\n\n               BACK ON THE SHIP\n\n               The smaller boat is launched and ready to do. Yorgi goes to \n               the WET WELL CONTROLS and hits a switch.\n\n               The aft doors open, letting water into the wet well. In \n               seconds Ahab starts to float. Anders loosens it from it's \n               moorings and they TIE AHAB TO THE BACK OF THE SMALLER BOAT.\n\n                                     KIRILL\n                         Ready.\n\n               Yorgi hits another switch, opening the BALLAST DOORS on the \n               port side of the ship. Air flows out, causing the ship to \n               list to one side.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         What are you doing?\n\n                                     YORGI\n                         It all happened so fast.

Petra is the last to board. She \n               looks up towards Xander and MACHINE GUNS the panel some more, \n               making sure he notices.\n\n               XANDER'S P.O.V.\n\n               He sees the smaller boat pulling away, the Ahab device being \n               towed behind.

The thing is going down.\n\n               He pans over, clicks into \"penetrator\" mode, and sees the \n               Crew pounding on the walls below decks. They're trapped, \n               their WRISTS AND ANKLES BOUND WITH PLEXI-CUFFS.\n\n               EXT. TOP OF TROLL WALL - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Xander puts down the binoculars and gets up.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         No way, man, no way.

He's gone. One mile, straight down.\n\n               Suddenly we're falling with him.\n\n               We hear the rush of air as he free-falls a dozen feet from \n               the craggy rock face.\n\n               The force of the wind ripples his cheeks.\n\n               He streamlines himself into a track position and jets away \n               from the cliff like Superman.\n\n               Before he gets too low, he RIPS THE BUCKLE.\n\n               Immediately his jumpsuit TEARS OFF HIS BODY in MULTIPLE \n               LAYERS, unfurling into a full sized PARASAIL.\n\n               Xander looks up at his parasail, relieved, and glides towards \n               the ship.\n\n               EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Petra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep Yorgi \n               from spotting it.

He lands on the listing \n               deck and undoes his harness.\n\n               He sees several WOUNDED scattered on the deck.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Son of a bitch!\n\n               He looks across the water, sees the smaller boat far away.\n\n               EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Petra looks back one last time, catching sight of Xander on \n               the deck of the ship. She smiles, relieved.\n\n               Then she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the \n               price.\n\n               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Xander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in.\n\n               With the ship listing like this, the water is pouring below \n               decks.\n\n               INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Xander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold. Here \n               is where the entire Crew has been left to drown. They are \n               struggling to stay above water, their hands and feet bound.\n\n               As the far end of the room is another HATCH. Water pours in \n               from this one and Xander has to get it shut.\n\n               He swims through the struggling Crew, spots the CAPTAIN \n               holding his YOUNG SON above water. The water is rising \n               rapidly, filling up the compartment.\n\n               Xander braces his feet against the bulkhead and PUSHES, but \n               the force of the water is too much.\n\n               He surfaces. He's got to wait until the room floods before \n               he can close that door.\n\n               He watches as the Crew goes into a panic, the water rising \n               up to the ceiling. They are gasping in the last foot of air \n               that's available. He sees the Captain's Son, crying and \n               clutching at his father.\n\n               Xander takes a deep breath and dives down. He grabs the hatch \n               door, braces his feet and PULLS.\n\n               His muscles strain as the heavy metal door slowly swings \n               SHUT.\n\n               Xander surfaces and swims to the ladder. He CUTS the Captain's \n               plastic cuffs.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Is the boy alright?\n\n                                     CAPTAIN\n                         Yes. I will cut the others loose, \n                         you must run the bilge pumps!\n\n               The Captain takes the knife and swims to free his men.\n\n               Xander takes the Captain's Son and climbs up the ladder.\n\n               EXT. SHIP'S BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Xander scans the controls but has no idea what he's looking \n               for. The Captain's Son shows him the right switch.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You sure?\n\n               The Son nods and Xander flips the switch. MOTORS start to \n               HUM.\n\n               EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The bilge pumps spew out water furiously. Crew members come \n               up from below decks. They are soaked and grateful. They go \n               about tending to the wounded as Xander slumps down next to \n               the exhausted Captain.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Captain, huh? You get a lot of broads \n                         with that uniform?\n\n               They both laugh, relieved, as the ship slowly rights itself.\n\n                                                                   FADE TO:\n\n               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - THAT NIGHT\n\n               Xander is in a room with the SCIENTISTS from the ship. They \n               have blueprints of the torpedo spread out. The Captain's Son \n               is wrapped in BLANKETS, shivering.\n\n               Xander is talking to Gibbons on his communicator.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                              (into communicator)\n                         They call it \"Ahab\", it's a solar \n                         powered submersible.

He's all in BLACK, \n               packed with weapons and sporting a COMBAT VEST.\n\n               He grabs a toehold on the wall and ZOOM!

DINING HALL - NIGHT\n\n               He runs into a darkened dining hall, sprints across only to \n               find the opposite door locked. He hides behind one of the \n               many COLUMNS as his pursuers enter the room.\n\n               Kirill gives a thumbs up and puts on a pair of NIGHT VISION \n               GOGGLES. He scans the big room but sees nothing.\n\n               Xander, hidden at the opposite end, waits breathlessly.\n\n               Kirill advances slowly, his buddies covering him from the \n               door.\n\n                                     YORGI\n                         Xander, my friend, that can only be \n                         you.

He has to run across open ground to reach it. He \n               calls out to Yorgi.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Speaking of people that are full of \n                         shit, funny you should mention those \n                         guys!\n\n               Xander's voice echoes around the empty hall, making it \n               impossible to pinpoint.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         They put their records out through \n                         Sony, one of the biggest corporate \n                         machines on the planet.

COURTYARD - SUNRISE\n\n               Xander tuck and rolls, comes up running.\n\n               Guards are running around, unsure just what the hell is going \n               on.\n\n               Xander hops on one of the TRIALS MOTORCYCLES parked nearby \n               and fires up the engine. He hits a remote switch and BLAM!\n\n               The EXPLOSIVE CHARGE he left earlier blows-up.\n\n               He points the bike at a set of STONE STAIRS. They form a \n               \"ramp\" that he can use to JUMP THE WALL. He GUNS THE ENGINE.\n\n               A Guard races across the wall with a rifle, taking aim.\n\n               Xander races and JUMPS THE BIKE over the wail. As he goes by \n               he does a CAN-CAN AERIAL, KICKING THE GUARD OFF THE WALL \n               before he can shoot.\n\n               The Anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go.\n\n                                     YORGI\n                         He blew the gate control. Anders! \n                         Get the bastard!\n\n               Anders fires up the other trials bike, slings a submachine \n               gun across his back and goes up and over. Petra watches him \n               go, hoping for the best.\n\n               EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAYBREAK\n\n               (NOTE: action will be re-choreographed based on actual \n               locations. Any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated \n               by a physical reason)\n\n               Xander blazes down the street, Anders racing right behind \n               him. A wrong turn sends him into a dead end.\n\n               At the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall.\n\n               Xander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of \n               the truck and onto it's roof. Balancing on the rear wheel, \n               he hops onto the wall.\n\n               The machine gun blasts again. Xander drives off along the \n               top of the wall. Anders shoulders his gun and follows.\n\n               They are riding a 15' high wall that's only a foot wide.\n\n               They make several 90 degree turns, racing above a sleeping \n               neighborhood. Xander sees the end of the wall ahead and takes \n               a detour.\n\n               He hops onto the second floor balcony of a BUILDING UNDER \n               CONSTRUCTION.\n\n               INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MORNING\n\n               CONSTRUCTION WORKERS bolt out of the way as the motorcycle \n               leaps into their building.\n\n               Xander pops a wheelie and slams through a BLUEPRINT TABLE.\n\n               Anders follows, demolishing their SNACK TABLE.\n\n               Xander darts through the building, between beams and 2 x \n               4's, until he reaches a skeletal STAIRCASE.\n\n               More WORKERS appear at the bottom of the stairs so Xander \n               goes up. He cranks up three flights of stairs and bashes \n               onto the roof.\n\n               EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MORNING\n\n               Xander looks around for a way out. The next building isn't \n               that far away. He revs up and JUMPS ACROSS.\n\n               Anders jams another magazine into his sub-machine gun and \n               follows Xander.\n\n               They jump from roof to roof, down a DESCENDING SERIES OF \n               ROOFTOPS towards the river. Anders pulls up alongside as \n               they race towards that last apartment building.\n\n               Neck and neck they head for the brink. At the last jump, \n               Xander pulls up behind Anders.\n\n               They hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel. Anders clamps \n               on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop, Xander right \n               behind him.\n\n               They skid to a stop at the very edge, with Anders balanced \n               on his front wheel. He looks down, sees street five stories \n               below.\n\n               He glances back at Xander, sweat beading, struggling to keep \n               his balance. Xander observes him coolly, totally in control.\n\n               Anders reaches for his machine gun. Xander pops a wheelie \n               and RAMS Anders over the edge.\n\n               The bike tumbles and PANCAKES into the pavement. Anders tears \n               through several AWNINGS before slamming into the ground.\n\n               Xander turns and rides to the next apartment building.\n\n               He hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually \n               take him to street level.\n\n               As he makes his way down, Anders stirs. The guy is a bloody, \n               broken mess but he gets to his feet. He sees where Xander is \n               headed and he scurries off to intercept him.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - MORNING\n\n               Xander is heading to the far end of a dead end alley. The \n               only way out is fenced in. But there's a RAMP leading up to \n               a LOADING DOCK. Xander will have to use that ramp to jump \n               the fence.\n\n               Anders climbs to the second floor of the building. There is \n               a small crane arm loaded with metal. If he pushes it at the \n               right time, it will swing out and knock Xander from his bike.\n\n               He giggles maniacally, blood dripping.\n\n               Xander drops down into the alley and heads towards the jump.\n\n               Anders times it perfectly and swings the crane arm out.\n\n               IN SLOW MOTION: The bike leaves the ramp and soars up over \n               the fence.\n\n               The crane arm swings out, on a collision course with Xander.\n\n               Xander sees it and THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE BIKE, grabbing \n               onto the back in a SUPERMAN SEAT-GRAB. He passes RIGHT \n               UNDERNEATH the swinging crane arm.\n\n               Anders's face falls when he sees Xander go by, hanging on \n               with ONE HAND. In his OTHER HAND Xander's got his PISTOL.\n\n               BLAP!\n\n               Xander pulls himself back onto the bike and lands. He stops, \n               sees Anders' BLOODY HELMET come bouncing into the alley. He \n               tucks his pistol away and roars off.\n\n               INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Xander comes up the stairs and sees LIGHTS ON in his \n               apartment. He draws his gun and pushes the door open.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Slovo?\n\n               Slovo is sitting in the armchair.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Dude, what are you doing here?\n\n                                     SLOVO\n                         You killed me, remember?

You're new at this. \n                         Did you think you could just stroll \n                         into this business one day and have \n                         all the angles figured out?\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Why you dogging me up?\n\n                                     SLOVO\n                              (shrugs)\n                         They came and found me. They said \n                         they'd kill me unless I help them. \n                         Plus they offer me a lot of money. \n                         No big deal. These things happen. \n                         Dump your gun on the floor.\n\n               Xander does so.\n\n                                     SLOVO\n                         Where do you want it?

CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY\n\n               The beautiful and historic St. Charles bridge spans the river. \n               There are BANNERS hanging in celebration of the coming PRAGUE \n               PEACE CONFERENCE.

I \n                         thought believing in things was wrong. \n                         Turns out believing in nothing is \n                         worse. You might as well be dead. \n                         I'm not thrilled with the world, but \n                         I'm not gonna let those idiots start \n                         killing people.

Maybe that's my problem. If \n                         you don't feel fear you can do some \n                         amazing things, but you can also \n                         screw your life up in ways you can't \n                         imagine.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         I must be healthy, then, because I'm \n                         scared to death.

We're \n                         doing all this together, trusting \n                         each other, making plans, and we \n                         haven't even slept together yet.\n\n               Xander kisses her.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         That gives us something to live for.\n\n               Together they walk back across the bridge. We crane up, \n               revealing the PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE banners all over a big \n               BUILDING on the river.\n\n               EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY\n\n               We see a craggy, gnarly mountain. The front side is a rock \n               strewn, near vertical drop.\n\n               Then we see Xander come scaling up from the back side. He's \n               got GEAR strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a \n               helluva climb.\n\n               Xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath. It's \n               beautiful up here.\n\n               He pulls a COLLAPSIBLE SNOWBOARD off his back, hits a switch \n               and the thing SWITCHBLADES OUT to full size. He clamps it on \n               his feet.\n\n               Xander moves to the edge and peers down. At the bottom of \n               the mountain he can see the CASTLE, an imposing medieval \n               fortress in the snow. He leans over the edge and starts down \n               the mountain. He doesn't get far before he notices something \n               else. He slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging \n               to rocks for balance.\n\n               On the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a \n               GUARD OUTPOST. Right now he's in full view and he's been \n               spotted. He sees GUARDS scrambling out, hopping on \n               SNOWMOBILES. From up here they look like ants.\n\n               EXT. GUARD OUTPOST - DAY\n\n               Viktor, the goateed cold weather warrior, strides out of the \n               Outpost and looks up the mountain. He shouts orders to his \n               men.\n\n               A Guard runs up and brings him his weapon: A FLAME-THROWER.\n\n               Viktor straps it on and. climbs onto his SNOWMOBILE.\n\n               All around him the Guards are driving into position. They \n               form a gauntlet of AK-47's. There must be a DOZEN of them.\n\n               Viktor rides up twenty yards and waits, his engine idling.\n\n                                     VIKTOR\n                         Hold positions!\n\n               He squints up at the speck that is Xander.\n\n               EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY\n\n               Xander pulls a CONCUSSION GRENADE from his jacket.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Nothing like fresh powder.\n\n               He puts his goggles on and pulls the pin from the grenade.\n\n               Then he TOSSES IT OVER HIS SHOULDER.\n\n               The grenade lands in the snow above him and starts ROLLING \n               DOWNHILL TOWARDS HIM. Xander pushes off and starts bombing \n               down the mountain.\n\n               The grenade bounces after him and then WHAM! It goes up with \n               a tremendous shock.\n\n               There is a SHIFT in the snow, a GROAN of shifting weight, \n               then the ENTIRE CORNICE cracks loose and topples over the \n               brink.\n\n               Xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at \n               his heels.\n\n               From down below it's an awesome sight. The slack-jawed Guards \n               watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them.\n\n               Shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer, they \n               can see Xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face.\n\n               There's a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles and \n               ride for their lives. A furious Viktor spins around and makes \n               a run for it as well.\n\n               Nobody has a chance. The avalanche is coming like a freight \n               train, frothing like white water.\n\n               Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hits a \n               JUMP. He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof \n               of the Outpost.\n\n               The avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everything \n               and everyone in its way.\n\n               Guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbling \n               under the onslaught.\n\n               Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over \n               the Outpost. He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a \n               stop.\n\n               Then it's all quiet.\n\n               Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble. There's \n               nothing moving up there anymore. Xander pulls himself free.\n\n               Then he hears a gushing sound and a DEEP BENEATH THE SURFACE, \n               he sees the WARM ORANGE GLOW OF FLAME. It's Viktor and his \n               flame thrower. There's another SPURT and the glow fades for \n               good.\n\n               Xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath. He's \n               right above the Castle now. Then his communicator starts to \n               BEEP.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                              (into communicator)\n                         Gibbons, long time no talk.

How about a status report?\n\n               Xander looks down on the Castle. There seem to be MAFIYA \n               HENCHMEN all over the grounds.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Snow covered fortress.

CASTLE - DAY\n\n               A GUARD patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle. He \n               stops for a smoke when Xander walks right up to him.\n\n               WHACK! With two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps \n               walking. He's a man on a mission.\n\n               He runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall. There's \n               no hand-holds, it's, a perfectly flat climb. A canyon of \n               ROCKS is below.\n\n               Xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the \"TERMINATOR\" \n               CLIMBING CLAWS. He pulls on the metal gloves and CLAWS into \n               the solid rock.\n\n               Just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface.\n\n               We see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making \n               this impossible climb.\n\n               At the top is an overhang. It's a gnarly transition. As he's \n               rounding it, his FEET SLIP. His legs dangle over the rocky \n               chasm below.\n\n               Using all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the \n               way with his climbing claws.\n\n               At the top a GUARD leans over, aiming his gun at him. Xander \n               grabs him and pulls him over the edge.\n\n               The Guard FALLS into the chasm.\n\n               Xander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted. Then another GUARD \n               rushes him, grabbing for his rifle.\n\n               Xander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun \n               from his hands. With the other hand he SLASHES, taking the \n               Guard down.\n\n               He pulls off the claws and heads into the Guard Tower.\n\n               INT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY\n\n               Xander exits the Guard Tower at the ground level.\n\n               As he crosses the courtyard an EXPLOSION rocks the tower he \n               just left.\n\n               There is shouting as GUARDS race around the parapets, unsure \n               where the attack is coming from. A GUARD runs up to Xander.\n\n                                     GUARD\n                              (in Russian)\n                         What's going on?\n\n               Xander CLOTHESLINES him and catches his AK-47 as he drops.\n\n               Up inside the castle he can see Yorgi at a window. Yorgi \n               appears mildly shocked as they make EYE CONTACT.\n\n               Xander takes aim.\n\n               POV ON XANDER THRU SNIPER SCOPE\n\n               From up above, Kirill has Xander in his sights.\n\n               BLAW! The bullet hits Xander's AK, sending it spinning.\n\n               Xander rubs his sore hand but stays put. Kirill could have \n               killed him and he knows it. From a doorway comes Yorgi with \n               some Guards.\n\n               Yorgi walks up and SMASHES Xander in the face.\n\n                                     YORGI\n                         That was for Anders.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Don't forget goatee boy. I greased \n                         him up on the diamond run.\n\n               Yorgi punches him again.\n\n               INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY\n\n               Petra sits at a desk working on a LAPTOP. Yorgi enters with \n               Xander and Kirill.\n\n                                     YORGI\n                         Look who we found playing outside.\n\n               Petra looks up.

He looks \n                         slightly less than dead.\n\n               Kirill aims his gun at Petra.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         Yorgi, I thought he was --\n\n               Yorgi SLAPS her.\n\n                                     YORGI\n                         Do you think I didn't know about you \n                         all along? My contacts in the KGB \n                         told me you were coming. You show up \n                         undercover and, I must admit, you \n                         play your part to the hilt. When \n                         it's time to be cruel, you are cruel. \n                         When it's time to be passionate, you \n                         are very very passionate indeed.\n\n               Petra is devastated by this revelation.\n\n                                     YORGI\n                         I could have killed you, but I thought \n                         this would be so much more fun.

Why do you have such a \n                         problem staying away, my friend?

CASTLE - GARAGE - DAY\n\n               The Ahab device is in the back of a flatbed TRUCK. Yorgi and \n               Kirill start up the truck and jam it into gear.\n\n               EXT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY\n\n               The truck smashes through the garage doors and rumbles across \n               the courtyard.\n\n               Police open fire, but the truck tears out the gate and starts \n               heading down the mountain.\n\n               INT.

CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY\n\n               Xander and Petra are brought outside. They see the Police \n               working on the wounded Ivan 1.

Its ramp lowers and Xander's \n               blown-out '72 GTO comes rolling out.\n\n                                     IVAN 2\n                         We'll be right behind you.\n\n               Xander and Petra both strap on grenades and pistols.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Did you do your homework?\n\n                                     PETRA\n                              (nods)\n                         If they launch it, I know how to \n                         bring it back.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Let's do this.\n\n               They both climb in and the GTO peels out.\n\n               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY\n\n               Xander drives all out, trying hard to catch up.\n\n               He passes several of Ivan's Police Jeeps at a furious clip.\n\n               Up ahead they see the truck winding it's way down the \n               mountain.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Where's he headed?\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         He owns a big industrial complex on \n                         the river. He'll launch it from there.\n\n               Xander floors it.\n\n               Up ahead, in the flatbed truck, Yorgi drives. He can see the \n               GTO gaining on them.\n\n                                     YORGI\n                              (in Russian, subtitled)\n                         They're coming! Get back there.\n\n               Kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab. He \n               lays down, resting the rifle on the Ahab container.\n\n               As the GTO comes into view, he sights up and FIRES, WHACK! \n               The first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows \n               the headrest off Xander's seat.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You get down! I'll take care of this \n                         fool!\n\n               He pulls out an Mp-5 out and hangs it out the window.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         No! Don't shoot! He's hiding behind \n                         the nerve agent!\n\n               Another shot blasts through, taking off the rear-view mirror.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Goddamit! He's gonna stop playing \n                         around soon and shoot something \n                         valuable!\n\n               Kirill laughs and takes aim once again. He puts Petra in the \n               sights.\n\n               Xander jerks the steering wheel and BLAM! the shot goes wide.\n\n               The GTO veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain.\n\n               Xander fights for control as they slide around the turns.\n\n               The road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex \n               up ahead. They cut across a field, heading right for it.\n\n               EXT. OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY\n\n               The truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex.\n\n               Quickly the gates are closed again. Armed GUARDS can be seen \n               up above.\n\n               The GTO comes at the gates at full speed.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Let's see what my man put together.\n\n               Xander opens a DASH PANEL, revealing a ROW OF SWITCHES. He \n               flips one.\n\n               The HEADLIGHTS EJECT, revealing a MINI-GUN IN EACH FENDER.\n\n               BRRRAAAAAAPPP!! The mini-guns spin.\n\n               The metal doors are getting SHREDDED.\n\n               Empty SHELLS spill down the sides of the GTO.\n\n               The metal doors come apart, falling in chunks.\n\n               The GTO slams through the wreckage without slowing down.\n\n               A Guard comes tumbling down and BOUNCES off the trunk as the \n               GTO zips inside.\n\n               EXT. INSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY\n\n               The Anarchy 99 guys seem to have a whole other army in here.\n\n               Guards spill onto the road, shooting at them from everywhere.\n\n               A BELLY PANEL on the GTO opens and ping-pong ball sized \n               MINIBOMBS dump onto the road. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The bombs \n               send the Guards scattering.\n\n               The GTO sizzles away.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Where'd the damn truck go?!\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         Go to the water, it's that way!\n\n               A tactical (a pick-up with a .50 cal machine gun attached) \n               pulls up behind them and opens fire.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Toadies right behind.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         Let me.\n\n               Petra punches another button.\n\n               The REAR HUBCAPS pop off. They roll along the road on their \n               own. Inside they seem to be LINED WITH SPIKES.\n\n               As the Tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they BLOW \n               UP, SPRAYING SPIKES at both sides of the Tactical.\n\n               All four wheels BLOW OUT and the Tactical goes out of control.\n\n               It crashes through a fence and pitches into the water, the \n               men going sprawling.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         Fantastic options.\n\n               At the riverbank Yorgi and Kirill pull Ahab off the truck \n               and prepare for launching.\n\n               They remove it from it's box and carry it waist deep into \n               the water. Yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on Ahab's \n               insides.\n\n                                     YORGI\n                         I've got it, go! Cover me!\n\n               Kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off.\n\n               He climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building \n               on a WHARF. From here he can shoot and NOT BE SEEN. He takes \n               his LIT CIGARETTE and tucks it behind his ear.\n\n               When the GTO rounds the corner he FIRES.\n\n               The bullet goes through the window and SLAMS into the steering \n               column.\n\n               Xander jams it into reverse. They retreat behind a building.\n\n               Petra clutches her arm, wounded.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You okay?\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         A piece of shrapnel hit me.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop \n                         playing nice.\n\n               Kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make \n               their second approach. The GTO comes roaring out, spinning \n               in circles wildly. Xander's is just doing donuts as fast as \n               he can.\n\n               Kirill aims, but with all the dust being kicked up he doesn't \n               have much of a target.\n\n                                     KIRILL\n                         What are you doing!\n\n               He doesn't notice Petra pop up from behind a fence with a \n               HEAT SEEKING MISSILE LAUNCHER.\n\n               ANGLE ON - the missile launcher's COMPUTER SCREEN. The green \n               display shows a faint red glow in the upstairs window. Its \n               the GLOWING POINT of Kirill's lit cigarette.\n\n               The Launcher BEEPS as it locks in and she FIRES.\n\n               Kirill looks up to see the missile blazing down the wharf at \n               him.\n\n               He gets it immediately. In a panic he fumbles for the \n               cigarette...\n\n               Too late. The missile zeroes in on his head.\n\n               WHOOOSH! The entire wooden shack blows apart.\n\n               Xander walks up to Petra.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         I guess the surgeon general was right.\n\n               ANGLE ON - Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and let's it go. The \n               electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the river.\n\n               Xander and Petra run to the water's edge in time to see Yorgi \n               escaping in a MOTORBOAT. In the opposite direction they see \n               the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards it's destination.\n\n               Petra finds the CONTROLLER in the cab of the truck. She \n               presses buttons desperately.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         He's shut out the communication \n                         circuit!\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You can't talk to it?\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         No, it's like a safety. We are going \n                         to have to access the manual controls.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         A manual control on a moving torpedo. \n                         This day keeps getting better and \n                         better.\n\n               Xander starts running towards a second moored MOTORBOAT.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Radio Ivan! Tell him what's going \n                         down! Have them evacuate downtown!\n\n               EXT. THE RIVER - DAY\n\n               Yorgi is motoring away, smiling, when he glances back and \n               sees Xander and Petra take off after Ahab. He pounds on his \n               steering wheel and turns around. His bigger boat closes on \n               them and he reloads his weapons.\n\n               Xander drives while Petra checks her controller.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         It's running three meters down. Twenty \n                         knots.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         It has to surface to release the \n                         nerve agent, right?\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         By then it's too late! The only way \n                         to safely dispose of the nerve agent \n                         is in deep water! The chemicals will \n                         break down and dissipate!\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow \n                         it up underwater!\n\n               They're heading into downtown Prague now, the riverbank \n               getting more and more populated. Yorgi is closing fast.\n\n               Down below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab beneath \n               the water.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         There it is! Hold it steady!\n\n               Petra pulls the pin on a grenade. She tosses it out in front \n               of Ahab. WHOOMPH! A jet of water goes up, but too far behind. \n               She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's \n               boat pulls up alongside. Yorgi aims and FIRES and the bullet \n               GRAZES Petra's arm.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Petra!\n\n               She loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the \n               engine compartment.\n\n               Xander grabs Petra and jumps. Together they land in Yorgi's \n               boat. The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge \n               support and shatters.\n\n               They are in the heart of the old city now. We see piazza's \n               full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing \n               in front of cathedrals. And on the river Yorgi and\n\n               Xander battle it out while Petra steers the boat.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         Xander! It's coming up!\n\n               Xander glances down, sees Ahab nearing the surface. Yorgi \n               clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat. Petra \n               tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm.\n\n               Xander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs \n               him from behind in a chokehold.\n\n                                     YORGI\n                         This is going to be exciting, buddy! \n                         Front row seats to the apocalypse! \n                         Come on, sing with me!\n                              (singing madly)\n                         \"I am an Antichrist / I am an \n                         anarchist / I... wan-na be... \n                         Anarchy!\"\n\n               Xander elbow's Yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold. He flips \n               him and they both topple overboard.\n\n               They land on Ahab and both grab on. They punch and pummel \n               each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding \n               torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St. \n               Charles bridge.\n\n               On the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF \n               PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from \n               the river.\n\n               Xander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi \n               slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in \n               the torpedo's wake.\n\n               Ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open.\n\n               Inside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing \n               Silent Night. The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         No you don't.\n\n               He pries the first rocket off it's launcher. The thing is \n               BEEPING menacingly.\n\n               IN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his \n               hands. He looks over at Petra. She's shouting at him, but he \n               doesn't hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT.\n\n               He looks the other direction, to the mass of PEOPLE on the \n               bridge above him. Total strangers...\n\n               The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former \n               nihilist.\n\n               Through the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with \n               his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact.\n\n               Then Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the \n               water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab \n               starts to DIVE.\n\n               EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY\n\n               With Yorgi hanging on his back, Xander turns the rocket upside \n               down and stuffs it BACK IN THE LAUNCHER.\n\n               Ahab heads down to the bottom of the river, the two men \n               fighting.\n\n               We see one man get THROWN FREE, the other is caught up on \n               Ahab and continues downstream.\n\n               Then the booster rocket FIRES, giving off SPARKS and BUBBLES.\n\n               It's all in silhouette now as WHAM! The rocket EXPLODES, \n               setting off a CHAIN REACTION. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ahab and \n               it's unfortunate passenger are DISINTEGRATED by the BLASTS.\n\n               The chemicals BELCH OUT in harmless clouds.\n\n               EXT. THE RIVER - DAY\n\n               A FUNNEL OF WATER blasts into the sky. The crowd recoils.\n\n               EXT. THE RIVERBANK - DAY\n\n               Ivan 2 helps Petra off the motorboat. They look down at the \n               water, but there's no sign of Xander.\n\n               Gibbons and his men push through the cordon of POLICE, \n               scanning the water. Nothing.\n\n               Tears well in Petra's eyes. Even Gibbons looks dejected.\n\n               Then Petra let's out a gasp and they look downstream.\n\n               There's a boat ramp leading into the water. At first they \n               see a ripple, then the top of a SHAVED HEAD emerges.\n\n               The whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water, \n               walking up the boat ramp.\n\n               His shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered. But there's \n               a look on his face, a calm, a self-confidence we haven't \n               seen before. The Phoenix has risen.\n\n               Petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him. Xander \n               shakes Ivan 2's hand and then turns to Gibbons.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         Thought you bought the farm down \n                         there, X. Glad as hell to see you.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         I'm pretty happy to see me too. So \n                         are you done with me yet?\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         You've kept up your end of the \n                         bargain, I'll do the same. But you \n                         really should consider staying on, \n                         you make a decent agent.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         But I hate cops, remember? Except \n                         for her.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. \n                         You're a hero. Don't be afraid to \n                         join the good guys.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Who says you're the good guys?\n\n               He starts walking off with Petra.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         You know what they say, the only way \n                         to change the system is from the \n                         inside.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking \n                         this thing off my ankle? The poison \n                         needles?\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         On come on, X. Did you really think \n                         we were that barbaric?\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         No needles, huh? What about the acid \n                         bath?\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         All for show. Just a psychological \n                         mind game to get you to do the right \n                         thing.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                              (smiles)\n                         You're a jerk-off, you know that?\n\n               Gibbons waves.\n\n                                     GIBBONS\n                         We'll be talking soon, you'll see. \n                         You'll be back.\n\n               Xander and Petra move off through the crowd arm in arm.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                         I can't believe my mission is finally \n                         over. I don't even know what to do \n                         with myself.\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         You can't welch on me now. We had a \n                         deal.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               ANGLE ON - a big \"X\" spelled out in SEASHELLS on the sand.\n\n               The camera shoots up into the sky, showing a perfect white \n               beach, a perfect lagoon, a lush green island... BORA BORA...\n\n               Then we hear the BUZZING of a TATTOO NEEDLE.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A THIRD \"X\" BEING TATTOOED ON THE BACK OF XANDER'S HEAD.\n\n               INT. HUT - DAY\n\n               His ink done, Xander walks out onto the back deck.\n\n               EXT. BORA BORA - DAY\n\n               Craggy mountain peaks and perfect turquoise blue water.\n\n               Xander steps out of a hut built over the water.\n\n               We see Petra sprawled out on the deck in a bikini. She's got \n               a bucket of HINANO BEER chilling down. It's a vision of \n               heaven.\n\n               He lays down next to her, starts pulling her bikini bottom \n               off.\n\n                                     PETRA\n                              (laughing)\n                         What are you doing?\n\n                                     XANDER\n                         It's about your next mission. You \n                         need to be debriefed.\n\n               FROM UNDERWATER - we see the two of them dive into the lagoon \n               nude. There's too many bubbles to see any real skin, but we \n               know what they're up to.\n\n               Back on the surface we see BUBBLES rising and catch glimpses \n               of their outlines beneath the water.\n\n               The Camera pulls back to the deck, where we see Xander's \n               COMMUNICATOR on the table next to the beers. We hear them \n               surface and start SPLASHING off camera.\n\n               Then the damn communicator starts to BEEP.\n\n               FADE OUT.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nxXx\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Rich Wilkes\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:39:08.170005"}
