NYC STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981\n</b>\nIt's raining.    A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street.\n\n<b>INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nLooking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his\npassenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a \"P\"\ninsignia over his breast pocket. Several paper bags on the\nback seat hedge him in. The young man is immersed in the\nscrawled list he clutches in his hand. A passing street\nlight momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few\nof the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet);\n.38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays).\n\n<b>GONG SHOW\n</b>\nAn excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted). The video image\nfills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet,\npunctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The\naudience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck\nBarris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the\nwings to comfort the agitated performer.\n\n<b>                      PERFORMER\n</b>            Why'd they do that? I wasn't done.\n\n<b>                      BARRIS (AGE 50)\n</b>            I don't understand. Juice, why'd you\n            gong this nice man?\n\n<b>                         JAYE P.

TAXI CAB - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store. The\nyoung man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the\nfluorescent storefront. The cab driver waits, listens to\nstaticky reports in a foreign language on his radio. The\nmeter is running. The back seat is piled high with bags.\n\n<b>GONG SHOW\n</b>\nChuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene\nGene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points\nat it.\n\n<b>                      BARRIS\n</b>            We'll be right back with more stuff.\n\n<b>INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes.\nThe cab stops. The young man gets out and confers with a\nshady looking guy on the corner. The young man pulls out a\nbig wad of cash. Money and a small package change hands.\nThe meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change.\n\n<b>THE GONG SHOW\n</b>\nChuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog.\nThe audience howls with glee. Suddenly the video image\nexplodes. Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot\ntoward the camera. We pull back to reveal we're in a\ndarkened, messy hotel room. We pan across the walls, past\ntaped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like\n\"Gong Show a New Low in Television\", \"The Dumbing of\nAmerica\", and \"Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western\nCivilization.\" We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man\ncrouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. This\nis Chuck Barris. The television continues to sputter, spark,\nand smoke. There is a knock at the door.\n\n<b>                      BARRIS\n</b>                (mumbly)\n            Fuck. Shit. Piss.\n\n\nNaked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. He\nhesitates, trying to determine his options. Should he answer\nthe door? Should he climb out onto the window ledge?\nFinally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for\na long moment. He unlocks the door, opens it. The sweaty,\nyoung man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags.\n\n\n\n<b>                                                   (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                              3.\n</b><b>CONTINUED:\n</b>\nHe tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked\nChuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in\nthe background.\n\n<b>                    BARRIS (CONT'D)\n</b>              (weakly)\n          More stuff?\n\n<b>                    BELLHOP\n</b>          Yes sir, Mr. Barris.

TERRACE - DAY\n</b>\nThis feels real, verite. The actual Chuck Barris, smoking a\ncigar, is being interviewed. He stands outside his villa in\nSt. Tropez, older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the\nhotel room, and talks to someone off-camera.\n\n<b>                    ACTUAL BARRIS\n</b>          It was 1981. I had holed myself up in\n          this New York hotel. Parker Hotel.\n          Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my\n          life.\n\n<b>                     INTERVIEWER (O.C.)\n</b>          Ashamed?   What do you mean?\n\nBarris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks,\noccasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed.\n\n<b>                    ACTUAL BARRIS\n</b>          When you're young, your potential is\n          infinite. You might do anything, really.\n          You might be great. You might be\n          Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you\n          get to an age where what you might be\n          gives way to what you have been. You\n          weren't Einstein. You weren't anything.\n          That's a bad moment. But I remembered\n          something Carlyle wrote: \"... there is no\n          life of a man, faithfully recorded, but\n          is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or\n          unrhymed.\" I realized my salvation might\n          be in recording my wasted life,\n          unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a\n          cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me\n          understand why.\n\n<b>INT.

LA SCALA - EVENING\n</b>\nBarris enters the crowded restaurant, looks around, spots\nKeeler sitting at a table in the rear. As he makes his way\nback, Barris shakes hands and says hello to several early\nseventies tv celebrities scattered throughout the restaurant:\nCarrol O'Connor, Joanne Worley, Flip Wilson, Ron Palillo.\nBarris arrives at Keeler's table. Keeler rises and embraces\nChuck. He's already drunk.
