NYC STREET - NIGHT\n\nSUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981\n\nIt's raining.    A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street.\n\nINT. CAB - CONTINUOUS\n\nLooking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his\npassenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a \"P\"\ninsignia over his breast pocket. Several paper bags on the\nback seat hedge him in. The young man is immersed in the\nscrawled list he clutches in his hand. A passing street\nlight momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few\nof the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet);\n.38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays).\n\nGONG SHOW\n\nAn excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted). The video image\nfills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet,\npunctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The\naudience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck\nBarris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the\nwings to comfort the agitated performer.\n\n                      PERFORMER\n            Why'd they do that? I wasn't done.\n\n                      BARRIS (AGE 50)\n            I don't understand. Juice, why'd you\n            gong this nice man?\n\n                         JAYE P. MORGAN\n            Not to be.     That is the answer.\n\nThe studio audience laughs.\n\n                                                            2.\n\n\n\nINT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT\n\nThe cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store. The\nyoung man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the\nfluorescent storefront. The cab driver waits, listens to\nstaticky reports in a foreign language on his radio. The\nmeter is running. The back seat is piled high with bags.\n\nGONG SHOW\n\nChuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene\nGene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points\nat it.\n\n                      BARRIS\n            We'll be right back with more stuff.\n\nINT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT\n\nThe back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes.\nThe cab stops. The young man gets out and confers with a\nshady looking guy on the corner. The young man pulls out a\nbig wad of cash. Money and a small package change hands.\nThe meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change.\n\nTHE GONG SHOW\n\nChuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog.\nThe audience howls with glee. Suddenly the video image\nexplodes. Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot\ntoward the camera. We pull back to reveal we're in a\ndarkened, messy hotel room. We pan across the walls, past\ntaped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like\n\"Gong Show a New Low in Television\", \"The Dumbing of\nAmerica\", and \"Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western\nCivilization.\" We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man\ncrouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. This\nis Chuck Barris. The television continues to sputter, spark,\nand smoke. There is a knock at the door.\n\n                      BARRIS\n                (mumbly)\n            Fuck. Shit. Piss.\n\n\nNaked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. He\nhesitates, trying to determine his options. Should he answer\nthe door? Should he climb out onto the window ledge?\nFinally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for\na long moment. He unlocks the door, opens it. The sweaty,\nyoung man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags.\n\n\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              3.\nCONTINUED:\n\nHe tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked\nChuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in\nthe background.\n\n                    BARRIS (CONT'D)\n              (weakly)\n          More stuff?\n\n                    BELLHOP\n          Yes sir, Mr. Barris. Everything you\n          requested. Except I couldn't find a...\n              (consults list)\n          ...

Thank you for trying.\n          You are a scholar and a...\n\nBarris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the\nhall, then motions for the bellhop to enter. The bellhop\nplaces the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls\nout some bills.\n\n                    BARRIS (CONT'D)\n          Keep it. It's okay. Keep it.    You are a\n          scholar and a...\n\nBarris trails off.\n\n                    BELLHOP\n              (eyes averted)\n          Thank you, sir.\n\nSuddenly Barris becomes agitated.\n\n                    BARRIS\n          Why are you not looking at me like that?\n          Do I look ugly to you?\n              (runs to the mirror)\n          It's the not sleeping. I'm not sleeping,\n          see. I have a lot on my...\n\nBarris trails off. There is a pause.   The bellhop attempts\nto make conversation.\n\n                    BELLHOP\n              (re: exploded tv)\n          Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?\n\nThe naked Barris approaches the bellhop, drapes his arm over\nthe young man's shoulder and walks with him.\n\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              4.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n\n\n                    BARRIS\n              (conspiratorially)\n          You know what I'd do? -- And don't tell\n          anybody -- I'd rub... I'd rub Alpo brand\n          dog food on my dick so the dogs would\n          stick their noses into my... dick.\n          Guaranteed big laugh, right? That was my\n          trick, my great contribution to the\n          world. How wouldn't I degrade myself, I\n          ask you.\n\nThere is a silence.\n\n                       BARRIS (CONT'D)\n                 (screaming)\n          I ask you!\n                    BELLHOP\n          I... I... I don't know, sir.\n\nSuddenly Barris punches himself in the head, flops down on\nthe unmade bed. The bellhop glances at Barris's bare ass,\nlooks away.\n\n                    BELLHOP (CONT'D)\n          Mr. Barris, maybe if you just don't watch\n          the show every night, you wouldn't have\n          to --\n\n                    BARRIS\n          I always pay for the damn tv's, don't I?\n              (turning to face him)\n          Don't I?!\n\n                    BELLHOP\n          It's -- Yes, you do, sir, and we\n          appreciate that -- It's just that\n          there've been complaints from some of the\n          other guests, and Mr. Andrews, the\n          assistant manager, requested that I --\n\n                    BARRIS\n          Still? Complaints? I specifically used\n          the silencer this time! Specifically!\n\n                    BELLHOP\n          Well, the people in 917 found a bullet\n          lodged in their wall. And while we want\n          to accommodate you -- we certainly value\n          your patronage -- there is an issue of\n          customer safety.\n\nBarris lets this sink in.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            5.\nCONTINUED: (3)\n\n\n                    BARRIS\n          Yes, of course.\n\nBarris finds his pants draped over a chair, pulls out his\nwallet, holds some more money out to the bellhop.\n\n                    BARRIS (CONT'D)\n          My apologies. Buy -- 917, is it? -- buy\n          them a magnum of your finest champagne.\n          And... and your finest spackle. Oh, and\n          get me a bag of plastic army men while\n          you're out. I forgot to tell you before.\n\nThe bellhop sighs, takes the money.\n\n                    BELLHOP\n          Thank you for your understanding, sir.\n\nThe bellhop exists.\n\n                    BARRIS\n              (calling after)\n          And some black socks!   Seven black socks,\n          you rascule!\n\nBarris locks the door, dumps the contents of the bags onto\nthe floor, fishes through the mess for a cigar, puts the\ncigar in his mouth, studies himself in a full length mirror.\n\n                    BARRIS (CONT'D)\n          Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by\n          the sight of me. And why not? I'm\n          wrinkled...\n              (searches for simile, then\n               proudly)\n          ... like a prune. Covered in liver\n          spots...\n              (searches for simile)\n          ... like an old guy. My hair is falling\n          out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of\n          white, sickly scalp. A flabby inner-tube\n          of fat hangs from my waist, practically\n          obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and\n          shriveled and dead. Still leaking urine\n          even though I left the toilet ages ago.\n          My asshole itches. Hemorrhoids abound.\n          George Orwell said every man has the face\n          he deserves by fifty. Does every man\n          have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as\n          well? Does every fifty year old asshole\n          have the asshole he deserves?\n\n                                                             6.\n\n\n\nEXT. TERRACE - DAY\n\nThis feels real, verite. The actual Chuck Barris, smoking a\ncigar, is being interviewed. He stands outside his villa in\nSt. Tropez, older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the\nhotel room, and talks to someone off-camera.\n\n                    ACTUAL BARRIS\n          It was 1981. I had holed myself up in\n          this New York hotel. Parker Hotel.\n          Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my\n          life.\n\n                     INTERVIEWER (O.C.)\n          Ashamed?   What do you mean?\n\nBarris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks,\noccasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed.\n\n                    ACTUAL BARRIS\n          When you're young, your potential is\n          infinite. You might do anything, really.\n          You might be great. You might be\n          Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you\n          get to an age where what you might be\n          gives way to what you have been. You\n          weren't Einstein. You weren't anything.\n          That's a bad moment. But I remembered\n          something Carlyle wrote: \"... there is no\n          life of a man, faithfully recorded, but\n          is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or\n          unrhymed.\" I realized my salvation might\n          be in recording my wasted life,\n          unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a\n          cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me\n          understand why.\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\nBarris, now in a hotel terrycloth bathrobe and a porkpie hat,\nsits at a desk and types manically.\n\n                    BARRIS (V.O.)\n          My name is Charles Prescott Barris. I\n          have written pop songs, I have been a\n          television producer. I am responsible\n          for polluting the airwaves with mind-\n          numbing, puerile entertainment. In\n          addition, I have murdered thirty-three\n          human beings. I am damned to hell.\n\n                                                   DISSOLVE TO:\n\n                                                              7.\n\n\n\nEXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET - DAY\n\nIt's sepia. Three year old Chuck, dressed somewhat girlishly\nand sporting a blonde pageboy haircut is being posed on a\npony by a photographer. His mother stands by anxiously as\nthe boy totters on the animal.\n\n                    BARRIS (V.O.)\n          Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in\n          1931, my early childhood remains\n          accessible to me only as a series of\n          elliptical, enigmatic memories.\n\nINT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY\n\nA smiling butcher hands a slice of bologna to young Barris,\nwho puts it in his mouth.\n\n                    BARRIS (V.O.)\n          The taste of bologna fresh from the\n          butcher.\n\nEXT. CEMENT YARD - DAY\n\nA baby doll is set afire.   Young Barris dances around it.\n\n                    BARRIS (V.O.)\n          The sickly sweet smell of a burning\n          babydoll on a crisp autumn day.\n\nINT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY\n\nYoung Barris is being dressed by his mother. We're close on\nthe velvet material being slipped over his head.\n\n                    BARRIS (V.O.)\n          Velvet brushing against my tender young\n          skin, as my mother dressed me.\n\nEXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY\n\nYoung Barris rolling on the ground in battle with another\nboy, as a crowd of children look on.\n\n                    BARRIS (V.O.)\n          A constant, inarticulate rage leading to\n          fist fight after fist fight.\n\nINT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nYoung Barris watches dust motes lit by the early morning\nsunlight pouring through his bedroom window.\n\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             8.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                    BARRIS (V.O.)\n          The calm I felt watching dust suspended\n          in the early morning sunlight.\n\nINT. CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nYoung Barris sits on the floor and watches the shadow of a\nman walking upstairs. The young boy is clearly terrified.\n\n                    BARRIS (V.O.)\n          I remember fear.\n\nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nToddler Barris watches his mother change clothes. He studies\nher pendulous breasts. She looks down, smiles warmly.\n\n                       BARRIS (V.O.)\n          Love.\n\n                    MOTHER\n          You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie?\n\n                       BARRIS (AGE 4)\n          Yes.\n\n                    MOTHER\n          I bet you would like to be a mommy some\n          day, wouldn't you?\n\n                    BARRIS\n          Yes, mommy.

CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY\n\nFour year old Chuck sits at the dining room table with\nseveral other four year olds. They all wear party hats.\nBarris's father, a milquetoast middle-aged man enters in\nbirthday hat, carrying a cake decorated with four lit\ncandles. He leads the children in \"Happy Birthday Dear\nChuck\" as young Chuck beams.\n\n                       BARRIS (V.O.)\n          Rejection.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              9.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\nChuck glances at the kitchen doorway. His mother stands\nthere, staring at him. She dressed in black mourning\nclothes, complete with veil.\n\nINT. NURSERY - DAY\n\nYoung Chuck peeks in as his mother sits in a rocking chair\nand holds Barris's infant sister. She fusses with the bows\nand frills on the baby's outfit. The light in the room is\ngolden and warm.\n\n                       BARRIS (V.O.)\n          Expulsion.\n\nWe move in on the little boy's devastated face, then follow\nhim as he turns and walks down the hall into darkness.\n\n                                                    DISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nA sixteen year old Barris lies on his back on a couch lazily\ntossing a football in the air. Tuvia, a thirteen year old\ngirl, sits on the floor playing with a puppy. In the\nbackground, throughout the scene, we hear the inept playing\nof scales on a bass violin.\n\n                    BARRIS (V.O.)\n          When I was sixteen I had an experience\n          with my little sister's friend Tuvia that\n          left an indelible impression.\n\n                       BARRIS (CONT'D)\n             Phoebe's no Walter Page, huh, Tuvia?\n\n                    TUVIA\n          I don't know who that is.\n\n                     BARRIS\n          Of course you don't.\n              (beat)\n          Why are you waiting around anyway,\n          listening to this cacophonous cacophony,\n          when you could be in your own abode\n          disrupting the lives of your own\n          siblings?\n\n                    TUVIA\n          I don't know what anything you say means.\n\n                      BARRIS\n          No.    You wouldn't, would you.\n\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          10.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\nBarris watches Tuvia playing with the dog.

TUNNEL - DAY\n\nBarris crawls through a long dirt tunnel. Telephone cables\nrun along the floor. An occasional bare bulb lights the way.\n\nINT. APARTMENT BATHROOM - DAY\n\nA middle-aged man stands in his underwear at a mirror and\nshaves. The stall shower pushes away from the wall revealing\na hole. Barris steps through it, covered in dust. He nods at\nthe shaving man. He nods back, hands Barris a gun and a\nchange of clothes, and continues shaving.\n\nEXT.

Colbert emerges from his\nhouse, alone, and walks toward the car. A drained Barris\nsighs a sigh of relief, then suddenly and with unexpected\nforce, Keeler swings open the passenger door. The door hits\na stunned Colbert and sends him flying. Keeler races around\nthe car, grabs Colbert, throws him into the back seat, and\njumps on top of him. Barris watches, surprised at the\ndramatic personality shift in Keeler. Keeler is strangling\nColbert. A cigarettes is dangling casually from his lips as\nhe does this. Keeler turns Colbert over so he's facing him,\nso he can watch him die.\n\n                    KEELER\n              (calmly to Barris)\n          Under the seat, please.\n\nBarris reaches under the seat, pulls out a Polaroid camera.\n\n                    KEELER (CONT'D)\n          Please, if you don't mind, a photograph.\n          To remember.\n\nBarris is stunned, scared.

The place is a disaster. Food\nwrappers, crumpled papers, liquor bottles, strewn clothing,\nplastic army men set up for battle. He gets up, puts on a\nhotel bathrobe and his hat, grabs his gun, checks the\npeephole for a long moment, and answers the door. The\nhousekeeper is plump and kind-looking.\n\n                    BARRIS\n          Good morning, Mrs. Reynolds.\n\n                    HOUSEKEEPER\n              (looking around)\n          Another rough night, huh?\n\n                    BARRIS\n              (tapping his head)\n          The human psyche is a wondrous thing.\n\n                    HOUSEKEEPER\n              (smiling maternally)\n          Yes, I know it is.\n              (taking gun)\n          We don't need this now, do we?

EAST BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING\n\nA hollow-eyed Barris approaches the building that conceals\nthe tunnel entrance. Suddenly there's a commotion on the\nquiet street. The shaving man is being led handcuffed out of\nthe building by two trench-coated men. They shove him into a\ncar. Barris continues to walk by, betraying no interest. He\nglances casually into the entranceway of the apartment\nbuilding. Another trenchcoated man waits inside the shadows.\n\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                      82.\nCONTINUED:\n\nThe car drives away.

What about you?\n\n                    PICARD\n          They do not catch me, monsieur. This is\n          my talent, to get away always. In\n          guerre. In amour. This is my talent,\n          and perhaps this is my curse.\n\nEXT. BERLIN WALL - DAY\n\nThe fully-inflated rubber plane flies down the street,\ndipping and rising erratically.

It's called The Old Game.\n             You got three old guys with loaded guns\n             on stage They look back at their lives,\n             see who they were, what they\n             accomplished, how close they came to\n             realizing their dreams. The winner is\n             the one who doesn't blow his brains out.\n             He gets a refrigerator.\n\nThe camera holds on Barris's face as he puffs a cigar.\n\n                                                         BLACK.\n\n                             THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nConfessions of a Dangerous Mind\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Charlie Kaufman\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:56.204540"}
