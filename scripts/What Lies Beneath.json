Dark blues and greens, shafts\nof prismed purple.  A pale shard appears in the distance.\nGliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera.\nWe're UNDERWATER.  Arriving at the form, it finally sharpens\ninto focus.  It's a WOMAN'S BODY submerged in dark water,\narms floating lazily at her side.  The face is obscured by\nflowing hair.  All that is visible is a pair of COLD, STARING\nGREEN EYES, which blink closed...\n\n                                                    MORPH TO:\n\n...then open as BLUE EYES, as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges from\nwater.  CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream in\nher bathtub.  She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (the\nkind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side,\nreaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being\npulled.\n\nINT.  BATHROOM - DAY\n\nA HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound.\n\nA steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER.  Claire\nstarts to come into focus.  The dryer stops.  She presses the\nred G.F.I. button on the socket.  ZAP!  A big blue spark\nshoots out.  Claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer\nstarts whirring again.\n\nShe clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook.  She\nregards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant-\nlooking woman around forty.\n\nClaire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR\nabove her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek,\nas if confirming her existence.\n\nINT.  CLAIRE'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nClaire, now dressed, presses her face against a door,\nlistening for the sounds of stirring from within.  Silence.\nShe quietly pushes open the door.\n\nINT.  ROOM - DAY\n\nClaire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a\nwindow, then pulls the curtains to reveal:\n\nA LOVELY, WOODED LAKE.  It couldn't be more picturesque.  A\n24' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE\nLIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake.\n\nThe sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE\nstill shrouded by covers.\n\nClaire sits beside the sleeping form.  She scans the room\nbriefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a\ntomboyish ten year-old girl at camp.\n\nShe gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same\nface, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped\nhair and tiny nose ring.  Claire leans over and inhales the\nsleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN.  She places her\nhand on a cheek.  The girl's eyelids flutter softly.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Morning, beauty.\n\nCaitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Let's go.  Or we'll never leave on time.\n\nFrom out of the pillow comes Caitlin's voice.\n\n                     CAITLIN\n               (muffled)\n          I'm totally ready.\n\nClaire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Come on, I'll make you some waffles,\n          maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the\n          mall.\n               (beat)\n          Caitlin...\n\nClaire gently swats at the tiny lump that is Caitlin's\nbehind.\n\n                     CAITLIN\n          Mother...\n\nClaire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from\nthe floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box.\nCaitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow.\n\n                     CAITLIN\n          You're such a morning person.\n\nClaire turns at the door.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          It is unwise to heckle the keeper of the\n          plastic.\n\nShe starts to leave.  Caitlin calls out.\n\n                     CAITLIN (O.S.)\n          Blueberries!\n\nClaire smiles as she closes the door behind her.\n\nINT.  HALLWAY - DAY\n\nClaire bends down to pick up one of Caitlin's socks.  When\nshe stands, something catches her eye out a window.  She\ngazes down, transfixed.\n\nANGLE\n\nThrough a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNG\nCOUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door.\nClaire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an\nunruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood\nof their huge old Buick.  She tries to get a glimpse of the\nwoman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD.\n\nA TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist.  She lets out a\nsmall gasp as a hand closes on her breast.  It's Claire's\nhusband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck.\nHe's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks\nbeginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him\nlook more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the\nprominent academic that he is.  Claire, however, can't take\nher eyes off the scene below.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          They at it again?\n\nClaire nods.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Christ, that's twice in...When did they\n          move in?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I think three...\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Three weeks.\n\nShe continues to gaze downward.  The man leans over the hood,\nmurmuring darkly at his wife, though for Claire and Norman\nthe scene is entirely silent.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          What's their name?\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures.\n          They're all psychotic.\n\nOutside, Mr. Feur turns and walks toward his house.  Norman\nbegins, once again, to nuzzle Claire.  Her eyes close, but\nthen she gently demurs.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          She's awake.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.\n\nShe turns to him.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I don't want to be either.\n\nHe smiles.  A really good smile.  The lips and tongue on his\nfaded T-shirt mark him as a 'Stones fan.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          When's she out of here?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Norman Spencer.\n\nNorman gives up.  He busses her cheek.\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (moving toward the stairs)\n          Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm\n          going to class.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Don't.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Claire, I have to show up for the--\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          It's Saturday.\n\nNorman stops.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          I knew that.  You think I didn't know\n          that?\n\nShe smiles at him.  After a beat:\n\n                     NORMAN\n          It's today?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (wistfully)\n          Yep.\n\nThey share a warm, poignant look.  He turns and moves down\nthe stairs.\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (calling over his shoulder)\n          We're going to have to leave by three if\n          we want to beat the traffic.\n\nClaire returns her gaze to the scene below as Mr. Feur says\nsomething ominous to his wife, then stalks into the house.\n\n                     NORMAN (O.S.)\n          Claire?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (absently)\n          Three o'clock.\n\nANGLE\n\nMrs. Feur drops her face into her hands.\n\nEXT.  SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY\n\nClaire peruses her \"to do\" list as Caitlin munches a panini.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          ...and I still think we should get you\n          some mittens.\n\nCaitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly.\nThe bond between them is palpable.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Do you have a scarf?\n\n                     CAITLIN\n          Hey.\n\nClaire looks up from her little pad of paper.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Yes?\n\n                     CAITLIN\n          It's only two hours away.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I know that.\n\n                     CAITLIN\n          I'll come back all the time.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Of course you will.\n\n                     CAITLIN\n          I'm just saying, you're going to be\n          fine.\n\nClaire smiles.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Sweetheart, I've known this day was\n          coming for a long time.  I've got your\n          father and the garden and the new house.\n          You really don't have to worry.\n\nCaitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some\nconcern.  Claire takes her hand.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Really.\n\nShe nods reassuringly and pulls Caitlin into an embrace.  Her\neyes close.\n\n                     CAITLIN (V.O.)\n          Mother...\n\nEXT.  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY\n\nClaire's frozen in the hug.\n\n                     CAITLIN\n               (beat)\n          Mom.\n\nHer eyes open.  Widen to reveal Claire, holding Caitlin on\nthe college campus.  The URBAN SKYLINE looms in the\nbackground.\n\n                     CAITLIN\n          I have'ta go.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip.  Caitlin\nglances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed\nthis overt display of maternal affection.\n\n                     CAITLIN\n          I'll call you.\n\nClaire produces an ENVELOPE, which she presses into her\ndaughter's hand.  It's a book of TRAIN TICKETS.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Come home anytime.\n\nCaitlin looks at Norman.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Really gonna leave me, huh?\n\nShe nods.  They share a tender look.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Be good.\n\nShe throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist.  A bit\noverwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of\nCaitlin's head.  After a moment, she steps back...\n\n                     CAITLIN\n          Bye.\n\n...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old\nColumbia dorm.  A banner is draped across its portals which\nreads:\n\n                  \"WELCOME CLASS OF '04.\"\n\nClaire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly\nshaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps.  Her\neyes are shining.  Norman wraps an arm around her waist as\nshe daps at a tear with a Kleenex.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (smiling)\n          I almost made it.\n\nThey turn and head for the car.  Claire sneaks one last look\nover her shoulder.\n\nANGLE\n\nCaitlin glancing back at Claire with an apprehensive smile.\n\nINT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nClaire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton\nnightgown.  Norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes.\n\nShe gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside him\nand starts reading.  After a moment:\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Whatcha reading?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (reading the cover, sexy voice)\n          Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic\n          organisms.\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (slight smile)\n          How is it?\n\nClaire snuggles up.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells\n          just gang divided a virginal cheerleader\n          cell.\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (lost in his book)\n          Nice.\n               (beat)\n          Almost done.\n\nShe pulls slightly away.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          If you have to work...\n\n                     NORMAN\n          No, no.

To have some time\n          for myself.  Some time for us.\n\nHe caresses her.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          You did a great job.  She's a good kid.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          We did.\n\nThere's a weighty pause.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          It's just us now.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I know.\n\nHe kisses her.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Tired?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Nope.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Wanna fool around?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Yup.\n\nThey start to kiss.  It's slow and a bit methodical in the\nmanner of long time lovers.  Suddenly, the SOUND OF A WOMAN\nWAILING can be heard.  They stop.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Did you...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Shhh.\n\nThey listen.  The sounds start to become louder.  It is\nclearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and\nsavage love making.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Jesus.\n\nHe walks over and closes the window.  It doesn't help.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          I guess they're making up.\n\nThe woman's moaning becomes embarrassingly loud.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          What is he doing to her?\n\nThey lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          And we moved out here for the quiet.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Mmm.\n\nBeat.

CAITLIN'S ROOM - DAY\n\nClaire pushes open the door to Caitlin's room carrying an\narmful of FOLDED LAUNDRY.  She moves quickly to the bureau,\nnot wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a TINY\nBLACK TOP from the pile, and drops it into a drawer.  She's\njust about to close it, when something catches her eye.\n\nCLAIRE'S POV\n\nShe drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old\nJUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer.\nClaire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of\nCaitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES,\nSTUFFED ANIMALS.\n\nShe brings the now faded T-shirt to her face and drinks in\nthe smells.  She stares down at the word \"Juilliard.\"\n\n                                                MATCH CUT TO:\n\nINT.  BASEMENT - DAY\n\n\"JUILLIARD\"...now it's on the same T-shirt only Claire's\nwearing it and she's much younger.  It's an old photograph in\nan album.  Younger Norman stands next to her in the shot, his\narm draped around her waist.  A CELLO CASE stands beside her.\n\nClaire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and\nsees propped in the corner...THE CELLO CASE.  She gazes at\nother photos.\n\n-- Claire in her wedding dress, Norman beside her in a tux\n   with a very wide bow-tie.\n\n-- Claire and Norman in front of a UNIVERSITY BUILDING.  A\n   tiny Caitlin rests on her hip.\n\nClaire's chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob.\n\nEXT.  FRONT YARD - DAY\n\nHer face streaked with tears, Claire stumbles out into the\nimmaculately manicured ROSE GARDEN.\n\nThe yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE.  She collapses\ninto a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.  Suddenly,\nshe hears something coming from next door.\n\nShe cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.  It\nis, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING.  Claire makes\nher way over to the fence.  The women's sobbing becomes more\nplaintive and fevered.\n\nShe places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence\nand tries to peer through the crack.  All she can make out is\nA DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking.  Claire gathers\nher nerve and calls out...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Hello...\n\nThere's no reaction.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Mrs. Feur?\n\nThe sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering.  The blue\nshape vanishes from view.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Wait a minute.  I just want--\n\nSomething bumps against the fence.  Claire draws back.  She\nhears heavy breathing.\n\n                     MRS. FEUR\n               (sniffling)\n          Who are you?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.

FEUR\n          I've seen you.  From the window.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Is everything alright?\n\nClaire leans closer to the tiny crack.  She sees a fleshy\nblur and what might be part of an eye.  There's no response,\njust the breathing.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Hello?\n\n                     MRS. FEUR\n          I'm not...\n\nShe seems on the verge of losing it again.\n\n                     MRS. FEUR\n          He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I\n          can't breath...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Who?  Your husband?\n\n                     MRS. FEUR\n          And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid\n          of...\n\nShe trails off.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          What?  What are you afraid of?\n\n                     MRS. FEUR\n          I can't, no, no, I can't...\n\nClaire edges closer to the crack.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Tell me.  Please.\n\n                     MRS. FEUR\n          That I'll just...that one day I'll\n          just...disappear.\n\nBeat.  Claire's taken aback by this admission.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Tell me.  I can help you.\n\n                     MRS. FEUR\n          How?  How can you help me?  With your\n          flowers and your perfect life...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          That's not...It's not like that.\n\n                     MRS. FEUR\n          I've never even met you.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed\n          with...my daughter left...for school.\n\n                     MRS. FEUR\n          This fence...it's so...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why\n          don't you...\n\nTires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into\nthe Feur's driveway.\n\n                     MRS. FEUR\n          Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please\n          forget that I...I don't know what I'm\n          saying.  Please...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Wait!  Don't go...\n\nClaire listens to the sound of NAKED FOOTSTEPS, followed by a\nLARGE FRONT DOOR swinging shut.  A CAR DOOR swings open and a\nMAN'S SHOES follow down the path.\n\nClaire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence\nas the door closes a second time.  She sits there for a\nmoment listening, but all is quiet.\n\n                     CLAIRE (V.O.)\n          She sounded terrified.\n\nINT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nClaire and Norman eat dinner.  A rainstorm pelts the windows.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Of what?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Of him I think.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Did she say that?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          More or less.\n\nNorman chews.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Honey, they're young.  They're probably\n          newlyweds.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I'm telling you.  There was something in\n          her voice...\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Remember how we were?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Not like this.  We were never like this.\n               (beat)\n          I want to go over there.  After dinner, we\n          can--\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Why?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          To make sure she's all right.\n\nNorman puts down his fork.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Claire, honey, we are not going to march\n          next door and accuse our new neighbor of--\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (overlapping)\n          That's not what I'm sug--\n\n                     NORMAN\n          ...when tonight they'll probably be\n          keeping us awake.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          But what if something happens?\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Claire...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I'd never be able to live with mysel--\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (reassuring)\n          Nothing's going to happen.\n               (beat)\n          Besides, I have to work tonight.  The\n          conference is in less than two weeks.\n          I've got to stay focused on that for just\n          a little longer.\n               (beat)\n          This is...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I know.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          It's what I've been working for.\n\nShe glances down at her untouched plate.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I just wish you could have heard her.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych\n          department, see what I can find out.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Promise?\n\nHe gives her a \"Didn't I just say so\" look.  She smiles.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I'll make you some coffee.\n\nShe reaches for his plate to clear it.  Norman grabs her hand\nand kisses it.\n\nINT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nNorman snores softly.  Claire is awakened by the continuing\nSTORM.  She pads out to Norman's turreted library.  Rain\npelts the glass.  Her face is briefly illuminated by the\nLIGHTHOUSE BEAM.\n\nShe hears the sound of a DOOR CLOSING and moves to get a\nbetter view of the Feur's.  Nothing but blackness.  Just as\nshe's turning to go back to bed.  A LIGHTNING FLASH lights up\nthe night.  Claire's eyes go wide.\n\nCLAIRE'S POV\n\nIn the split second of brilliance, she sees Mr. Feur, in\nshirtsleeves, drenched, dragging A LARGE DUFFEL toward the\nopen trunk of his car.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (in a hoarse whisper)\n          Norman!\n\nHe's dead to the world.  She calls to him again.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Norman, you have to look at this!\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Mmnph.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Hurry...\n\nAnother flash illuminates...Norman at her side.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Look!\n\n...an EMPTY DRIVEWAY, then blackness.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          What is it?  What's the matter?\n\nShe stares down into the darkness.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw\n          something.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Is it gone?\n\nTHE BEACON illuminates the empty driveway.  She nods.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Come on, let's go back to bed.\n\nYet another bolt of lightning reveals Claire, still at the\nwindow.\n\nEXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING\n\nClaire sets up a camera and tripod.  She steps back and aims\nher camera.  She glances up at a large upstairs window at the\nFEUR'S HOUSE.  One side of the curtain seems to be pulled\nopen, but no one's there.\n\nFeeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera.  The\nmorning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERAL\nPICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house.\n\nShe glances back at the Feur's window.  The CURTAIN IS NOW\nCLOSED.\n\nShe walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it.\nWhen this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers\nacross the fence.  She can barely see over, but glimpses:\n\nA DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway.  Just then, a car\npulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from her\nperch.\n\nEXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY\n\nClaire walks out to find her best friend, JODY, pretty, in\nher forties, wearing hip, hippie-ish clothes.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Hey there.\n\nJody hugs her.\n\n                     JODY\n          How you holding up?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Good.  I'm good.\n\n                     JODY\n          You are?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Why does everyone find that so\n          surprising?\n\n                     JODY\n               (are you kidding?)\n          Cause...your...only daughter just went\n          away to school...who you were incredibly\n          close with aaand I'd be tripping...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Okay, I'm a little tender.\n\n                     JODY\n          Well good.  So you're human.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          And so far my day has consisted of taking\n          pictures of my roses for the garden club.\n\n                     JODY\n          Wow.  Got here just in time.\n               (reaching into her bag)\n          I brought you this.\n\nShe proffers several homemade tea bags.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          What is it?\n\n                     JODY\n          Kambucha mushroom tea...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Jody--\n\n                     JODY\n          It soothes heart-ache and promotes\n          psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          You're discussing me with your psychic?\n\n                     JODY\n          She's not a psychic.  Just a very\n          enlightened spirit.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Thanks, but I'm fine.\n\n                     JODY\n               (pressing it into her hand)\n          So you'll have some later.\n               (beat)\n          Notice anything...different?\n\nClaire gives her friend the once over, then notices the mint\nKarman-Ghia behind her.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Oh my god.  You bought it.\n\n                     JODY\n          Yep.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          It's niiice.\n\n                     JODY\n          Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband,\n          get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up\n          dudes?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Absolutely.\n\n                     JODY\n          Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought\n          I'd stop by and see if you want to take\n          the boat out, say Thursday morning?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          You got it.\n\nJody grins.\n\n                     JODY\n          See you then.\n\nJody drives off.  Claire walks down the driveway to her front\ndoor and sees Mr. Feur staring at her from a window.  She\nstarts to wave, but the curtain is drawn shut.\n\nClaire arrives at the front door and reaches out to touch the\ndoorknob.  She stops.  A FAINT RUSTLING can be heard from\nwithin.  Claire quietly opens the door and moves into:\n\nINT.  FOYER - DAY\n\nClaire stops inside the door.  Now it sounds like WHISPERING.\nTwo voices, tense, impassioned.  It seems to be coming from\nNorman's study.  She gathers her nerve, then bursts into the\nroom.\n\nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY\n\nBut the whispering has suddenly stopped.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Hello?\n\nThe lovely circular room is completely empty.  She looks\naround, puzzled.  Cooper, the family's aging lab, casually\nambles over.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (to Cooper)\n          Please tell me you heard that.\n\nEXT.  LAKE - DAY\n\nClaire and Cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at\nthe water's edge.  Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper, who\nbolts out onto the LONG WOODEN DOCK.  Claire gazes at the\nLIGHTHOUSE across the lake and a long BRIDGE in the distance.\nCooper starts BARKING and looking down into the water.\n\nClaire arrives at Cooper's side and stares down into the dark\nwater.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Cooper...what do you see?\n\nShe looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection.\nAfter a moment, she notices a FAINT WHITE SHAPE directly in\nthe reflection of her face.  Cooper rumbles a low growl.  The\nshape seems to be gaining definition.\n\nRRRING!\n\nClaire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her\nsweater and pulls out a cordless phone.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (into phone)\n          Hi.\n\n                     NORMAN (V.O.)\n               (on the other end)\n          I'm stuck here for another couple of\n          hours.\n\nClaire's smile fades.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Oh.\n\n                     NORMAN (V.O.)\n          Unless you need me to come home...\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          No, no.  It's fine.\n\nClaire slowly leans out over the water to check her\nreflection...\n\n                     NORMAN (V.O.)\n          You sure?\n\n...but the shape is gone.\n\n                     NORMAN (V.O.)\n          Claire?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.\n\nShe clicks off the phone and looks down at the calm water.\n\nINT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT\n\nClaire sits in a small workroom at a computer.  She focuses\nintently on the screen.\n\nANGLE\n\nIt's ALICE'S COMPUTER SOLITAIRE.  She flips the last card and\nan animated Queen of Hearts, accompanied by a series of\nmusical notes, parades across the screen.\n\n                     QUEEN OF HEARTS\n               (on computer)\n          You lost!  Off with your head!\n\nClaire hits \"New Game\" and watches as a fresh hand of cyber\nsolitaire is dealt.  She suddenly has a thought and\ndisappears into the kitchen.\n\nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nShe glances at Jody's tea, smiles, then refills her glass of\nred wine.  She picks up the phone from its cradle and moves\ninto:\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nShe dials a number.  LOUD REGGAE can be heard blaring through\nthe phone.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (straining to be heard)\n          Hello?  I'm looking for Caitlin Spencer.\n          She's in 314...Well, could you check?\n\nShe plugs one ear.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Oh.  Well, just tell her that her mother\n          called.  Her mother.  Thank you.  Excuse\n          me, how can you study with that?\n\nThe noise abruptly stops.  Claire clicks off the phone and\nreplaces it in the sweater pocket.  She tunes the stereo to a\nclassical music station.\n\nINT.  WORK ROOM - NIGHT\n\nShe walks in, places the cordless phone on a BASE UNIT, then\nhears a different set of musical notes from the computer.\nShe stares at the screen, stunned.\n\nANGLE\n\nThe game has been finished.  Cards with faces swarm\nchaotically across the screen with the message:  YOU WIN!\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Oh.  Kay.\n\nWithout warning, the radio dial rips cacophonously past\nseveral stations and comes to a stop on some angry, punkish\nrock and roll.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Jesus...\n\nShe bolts around a corner to the stereo.  The music is\nchaotic and deafening.  She finds Cooper growling at...no\none.  She turns off the stereo.  Cooper suddenly bolts down\nthe hall.  She follows him.\n\nINT.  FOYER - NIGHT\n\nThe foyer's empty, but the front door is open.  Claire\nnervously walks out and looks around.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Cooper!\n\nPOV - THE GARDEN\n\nNo sign of the dog.\n\nClaire turns to go back inside.  When she touches the\ndoorknob, she hears the whispering again.  A fleeting shadow\ndraws her eye to a COAT RACK MIRROR which reflects directly\ninto the study.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Hello...?!\n\nThe whispering stops.\n\nINT.  NORMAN'S LAB - NIGHT\n\nClaire walks in to find Norman surrounded by several GRAD\nSTUDENTS.  At school he's a very different man; pressed shirt\nand tie, hair neatly brushed back.  They're preforming some\nunseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness.\nShe stops by the door to watch him.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          ...and then what...Courtney?\n\nAn intense ASIAN GIRL answers.\n\n                     COURTNEY\n          We administer the Halothane.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Dosage?\n\nShe glances at her notes.\n\n                     COURTNEY\n          Three point five cc's.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Excellent.  Properties?  Andrew from\n          downtown...\n\nAndrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this.\n\n                     ANDREW\n          An organic, neuromuscular blocking agent,\n          which when administered in aerosol form\n          temporarily renders the subject immobile.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Nothing but net.\n\nHe measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an\napparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Prudence here's an old friend.\n\nHe moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods to\nCourtney who turns a valve on the apparatus.  The sheep\nsuddenly goes completely still.  Norman moves around and\nbegins a brief procedure.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          I try to stay on her good side because I\n          owe her my career and most of our grant\n          money.  Why else?\n\nHe completes the procedure.  They look at him blankly.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Always do unto others as you'd have\n          others do unto your ewe.\n\nGroans, laughter.  He stops Claire.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          That'll do it.  Write this up for Tuesday!\n\nAndrew and Amy tend to Prudence, the rest leave.  Claire\nmoves over to him.  They kiss.  Norman packs notes and some\nof the chemicals into a LEATHER CASE.\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (warm)\n          What are you doing here?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          There were some noises.  I didn't want to\n          disturb you.\n\nShe watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is led\nout of the room.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          What do you mean?  Some noises where?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          In the house.  I was scared.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Did you call the police?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you\n          back in the morning.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Of course.\n\nHe takes her arm.\n\nINT.  THE FOYER - NIGHT\n\nNorman pushes open the front door.  Cooper pads over, wagging\nhis tail.  They walk together past the stereo into...\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n...the living room.  All is quiet.  They move into...\n\nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT\n\nIt's undisturbed.  Norman checks the window locks.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          It was there.  This angry music all by\n          itself.  And I heard whispering.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          What kind of whispering?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I don't know.  Just...whispering.\n\nHe nods as Cooper appears.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          What'd you see, Coop?\n\nThe dog stares blankly.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (to Cooper)\n          Tell him!\n\nNorman smiles.\n\nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nNorman sits on the bed and pulls off his shoes.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          I'm gonna have the police check on the\n          house.\n\nClaire leans against the window sill.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Oh great, \"Can you look in on my wife,\n          she's hearing voices?\"  Wait'll that gets\n          around.\n\nHe walks over to her.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          I've got the conference next week.  I want\n          you to feel safe.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how\n          was your day?\n\nHe goes to his dresser and fishes a little joint from a box\nin his dresser.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Think I may have cracked it.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Really?\n\nShe produces a match and lights it.  They sit on the bed.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          I think so.  Maybe.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          You are so brilliant.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Yep.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman\n          Spencer...\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (smiling)\n          You know what that does to me.\n\nShe takes a little puff on the joint as he kisses her neck.\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (stopping)\n          Ohmigod.

No,\n          I didn't.\n\nHe takes a little toke, then vanishes into the bathroom.\n\n                     NORMAN (O.S.)\n          Cause that would be really--\n\nShe lays back on the bed.  Sounds of flushing.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I didn't.\n\nHe reappears without the joint.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Sorry.

He kisses her knee.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Do the brilliant Norman stuff some more.\n\nThen starts working his way up her thigh.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          And speak up.\n\nClaire smiles.\n\nINT.  LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\nClaire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in\nposition.  After an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow\nto string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound.\n\nClaire takes another deep breath, then launches into a\nbeautiful and melancholy piece of music.  She's very, very\ngood.  Eyes closed.  Her body begins to sway slightly as her\nleft hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck.\n\nShe reaches a difficult transition and falters.  She seems\nalmost surprised.  She attacks the transition again, and\nagain falters.  Claire bites her lower lip and tries yet\nagain, this time failing completely.\n\nShe sits back in the chair, despondent.  Almost as an\nafterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings.  At the\nend of the tone, something catches her ear.  She can just\nmake out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone.\n\nShe sits up and plays a different note, then another.  Each\ntime the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct.  Finally\nshe plays a sharp, higher pitched note.  The voice echoes\nwith a distinct, unsettling shriek.\n\nCRASH!\n\nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - DUSK\n\nClaire walks in and sees:\n\nINSERT-- Lying on the floor...A FRAMED NEWSPAPER PHOTOGRAPH\nOF NORMAN AND CLAIRE.\n\nThe caption announces that he's being promoted to the\n\"distinguished DUPONT CHAIR IN GENETICS.\"  Through the\nspiderwebbed glass, Norman can be seen shaking hands with an\nolder academic, hugging a smiling Claire to his side.\n\nClaire kneels down to gather the picture.  A single shard of\nglass is missing.  She finds it a foot away by a distinctive\nknot in the wood floor.\n\nShe notices a COPPER GLINT in the point of glass, but when\nshe moves it, it's gone.  She places the pieces of broken\nglass on the frame and stands.\n\nOut of the window directly in front of her sees:  Mr. Feur,\nremoving a DIRT COVERED SHOVEL from his trunk.  She glances\ndown at the picture, then back up at Mr. Feur, who carries\nthe shovel around back.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Oh no...\n\nClaire wraps up the broken picture.  She hears a car door\nslam and glances out the window in time to see Mr. Feur\ndriving off.\n\nEXT.  GARDEN - DAY\n\nA stiff autumn breeze.  Claire stands at the fence.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Mrs. Feur?\n\nShe looks through the tiny crack.  Nothing.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Hello?\n               (beat)\n          Are you there?\n\nSilence.\n\nEXT.  THE FEUR'S - DAY\n\nClaire glances down as she walks past THE FURROW.  She looks\nup at the house, which seems quite placid, then slowly heads\naround back.\n\nEXT.  FEUR'S BACK PORCH - DAY\n\nShe takes in the lake view from the large porch.  The wind is\nreally blowing.  Her eye catches on something.  Propped\nagainst the back door...\n\nTHE SOIL COVERED SHOVEL\n\nClaire takes a pinch of soil from the shovel and tastes it,\nthen knocks at the back door.  There's no answer.  She knocks\nagain.  Nothing.  She's turning to go, then the door swings\nopen.  The smile fades from Claire's face.\n\nCLAIRE'S POV\n\nThe immense MR. FEUR filling the doorway.\n\n                     MR. FEUR\n          Yes?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Um...\n\n                     MR. FEUR\n          I'm running late here.  I just came back\n          for my briefcase.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to\n          welcome you to the uh, to the\n          neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From\n          next door.\n\n                     MR. FEUR\n          This really isn't a good time.\n\nHe starts to close the door.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Well maybe your wife...\n\n                     MR. FEUR\n               (growing cold)\n          She isn't here.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          When...when will she be back?\n\n                     MR.

And Claire is staring at a closed door.\n\n                     JODY (V.O.)\n          What do you mean she's gone?\n\nEXT.  LAKE - DAY\n\nClaire and Jody knife slowly through the water in the\nSpencer's sailboat heading back toward the dock, the OLD\nLIGHTHOUSE, the BRIDE in the background.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          She's not there.  I haven't seen her since\n          that morning.  Well, I mean, I've never\n          actually seen her, but I'm telling you,\n          she's disappeared.\n\nJody finishes securing a line.  The breeze is mild, so they\njust cruise with the wind.\n\n                     JODY\n          What are you saying?\n\nClaire just looks at her.\n\n                     JODY\n          You think he killed her?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds\n          crazy.  But what else could it all be?\n\nJody shakes her head.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I mean, he's so kind of grim and\n          daunting, and she sounded terrified of\n          something.\n\nClaire glances over at Jody.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (laughing to herself)\n          Listen to me.  I sound like some middle-\n          aged Nancy Drew.\n\nJody regards her.

KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nClaire walks in and sets down some packages.  She opens one\nand pulls out new toothpaste and...AN ENVELOPE-- the kind\nyour pictures come back in.  She absently leafs through them,\nthen freezes.  She gapes at one of the shots.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Oh boy...\n\nINT.  UPSTAIRS - NIGHT\n\nClaire turns off the lights and crouches down.  She raises a\npair of BINOCULARS.\n\nPOV - BINOCULARS\n\nClaire rakes the binoculars across the Feur's house...past\ntheir car parked in front until she finds A LIGHT ON\nDOWNSTAIRS.\n\nThe tall, powerfully built Mr. Feur walks into the room and\nsits by himself at the dining room table, which is set for\none.  He eats a TV dinner, slowly chewing and staring\nstraight ahead.  He sips from a can of beer.\n\nJust then...A HAND GRABS CLAIRE'S ARM.  She lets out a\nscreech and turns to see Norman standing beside her.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          What are you doing?\n\nShe glances back out the window and sees Mr. Feur standing\nat the window, paging the curtain.  She squats down, pulling\nNorman with her.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (shrill whisper)\n          Get down!

CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nShe leads Norman in.\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (still whispering)\n          Why am I...\n               (full voice)\n          Why am I whispering in my own house?\n\nClaire turns.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          He killed her.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          What?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          He did.  She's in the picture.  I went\n          over to look and she's gone.  The table\n          was set for one.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          And that means he murdered his wife?\n          This is getting ridic--\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          No, no, no, no.

NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT\n\nThe picture has, once again, tumbled from its spot.  She\ndrops to her knees over the picture.  This time THE GLASS IS\nSHATTERED.  When she picks out the remaining shards, the\nnewspaper photo slides out.  Claire glances at the benign\nnews stories on the back.\n\nShe looks around and spots a piece of glass wedged in a crack\nin the floor boards by the knot.\n\nCLAIRE'S POV\n\nThe piece of glass, wedged next to what looks like A COPPER\nCOIN in the crack.  It's too big to be a penny.\n\nShe tries to use the piece of glass to pry it free, but\nrecoils.  A tiny drop of blood appears on her finger, which\nshe pops into her mouth.\n\nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nStill sucking on her finger, Claire walks in and begins to\nclean up the remains of the seance.  She bends down to pick\nup the Ouija board, then stops when she notices that the tub\nis again full to the brink of overflowing.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          What do you want?!\n\nClaire peers around, frustrated, half waiting for a reply.\nThere is only silence.  She reaches in to pull the plug,\nnearly scalding her hand.  When she turns for a hand towel\nshe finds a message traced into the steamed-up mirror:\n\n                      \"YOU KNOW\"\n\nShe draws in a breath and darts out of the bathroom.\n\nEXT.

This is\n          something that's happening to me.  It's\n          not to get even...and it's not some\n          warped bid for attention.

Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in\n          what's happening.  I don't want to, but I\n          do.

PORCH - DAY\n\nClaire's carrying some cuttings into the house.  She hears a\nknock at the gate, walks over and opens it to discover...Mrs.\nFeur.  The real one.\n\n                     MRS.

They're much prettier\n          up close.\n\nShe regards Mrs. Feur for a moment.

FEUR\n          Have you ever felt so completely consumed\n          by a feeling for someone that you\n          couldn't breathe?  That the time together\n          is so passionate and consuming that you\n          felt physical pain when they would leave?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Um...sure.\n\n                     MRS.

He brought my things up and\n          pleaded with me to come home.\n\nClaire is mesmerized.\n\n                     MRS.

FEUR\n          I'm sorry that I frightened you like\n          that.  But I was so touched by your\n          concern.  I've been lonely here.\n               (beat)\n          Perhaps we could be friends.\n\nClaire stares at this strange, passionate woman.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I would like that.\n\nMrs. Feur smiles at her.\n\nINT.

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - NIGHT\n\nClaire stands outside Caitlin's Columbia dorm, watching young\nlives in motion.\n\nINT.  DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nClaire walks past a number of doors.  Music booms out of one,\nshards of a conversation out of another.  Finally, she\narrives at a door that says \"Fur is murder.\"  She smiles to\nherself and knocks.  There's no answer.\n\n                     DIFFERENT VOICE (O.S.)\n          She's out.\n\nClaire turns to find an attractive YOUNG MAN standing at her\nelbow.\n\n                     YOUNG MAN\n          They're playing at CBGB's down on Bowery.\n          Probably won't be back for awhile.

CBGB'S - NIGHT\n\nClaire moves past a huge, BLACK SKINHEAD DOORMAN into an\nentrance area in the dark throbbing punk club.  She looks out\nover the MOB OF SEETHING YOUNG PEOPLE, swaying to a pulsing\npower-pop band.  PUNKS and CLUB KIDS push past her as they\nmove into the throng.  She looks up and her face changes.\n\nCLAIRE'S POV\n\nA shaggy trio of musicians on the stage, pumping through a\njangly, but surprisingly melodic song.  Her eyes race across\nthe faces of a BUTCH FEMALE DRUMMER, an emaciated\nGUITARIST/SINGER and stop on the BASS PLAYER...Caitlin.  She\nrocks back and forth to her own hypnotic bass line, EYES\nCLOSED, SWAYING TO THE MUSIC.\n\nClaire is transfixed, her face a mix of pride and sadness.\nThe song ends and Caitlin's eyes open.  She smiles for a\nmoment, then the smile fades as she spots Claire.  Panicked,\nClaire ducks behind a pillar.\n\nEXT.  CBGB'S - NIGHT\n\nThe last groups of YOUNG PEOPLE file out of the club.

NORMAN'S STUDY - DAY\n\nShe walks in and stands before:\n\nThe repaired photograph of herself and Norman...at the party\nfor the DUPONT CHAIR.\n\nShe takes it from the wall, stares at it for a moment, then\nSMASHES IT ON THE EDGE OF THE DESK.  She extricates the\npicture from the broken glass.  The caption reads:\n\n\"Dr. Norman Spencer being awarded the distinguished Dupont\nChair in Genetics by Dean of Sciences Torvald Ackerman.\"\n\nShe stares at the picture for a moment, then flips it over\nand scans the stories on the back.  One tells of a hotly\ncontested city council race, another contains details of a\nlarge alumni donation to the university.\n\nShe notices the bottom corner of another story she hadn't\nnoticed before.  It's only a small portion of one column, but\nit seems to detail the search for A MISSING GIRL.\n\nINT.  WORK ROOM - DAY\n\nClaire, online, logs onto a missing persons website.

Never understood how\n          a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't\n          get it from me.  They wanted to put her in\n          a special school for the gifted when she\n          was young.

Norman appears beside\nher.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Last sail of the year.\n\nShe gazes out.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          The leaves...\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Incredible.  We should take a drive before\n          they're gone.  Spend the night at some\n          cozy little bed and breakfast.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Look for antiques...\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Yep.  There's some great places nearby.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (a reflex)\n          Adamant.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          What?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Little village down seven.  Supposed to be\n          charming.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Huh.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Do you know it?\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Don't think so.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Maybe we can stop there for lunch.\n\nHe wraps an arm around her.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Whatever you'd like.\n\nShe leans against him, staring out.\n\nEXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY\n\nJody and Claire return from a walk.  Norman has the boat on\nthe trailer and is securing a tarp over it.  They stop under\na tree.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          But he acted like he'd never heard of it.\n\n                     JODY\n          Did he say that?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Jody he was lying.\n\n                     JODY\n          What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to\n          bring that up again just when you're\n          trying to make a new start?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I guess not.\n\n                     JODY\n          He's trying to put it behind him, Claire.\n          You should too.\n\nNorman smiles and waves.  They wave back as they arrive at\nthe Karman-Ghia.\n\n                     JODY\n          You've got a beautiful life.  And even\n          with this, it's always been clear that he\n          loves you.\n               (beat)\n          I've come to think that's all that really\n          matters.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I don't know...\n\n                     JODY\n          Trust me, Claire.

The rest is only\n          details.  And no one's ever glad they got\n          a hold of those.  If you want to put this\n          back together...just let it go.\n\nJody drives off.  Claire walks over to Norman.  She hugs him\ntightly.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          What's that for?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Nothing.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          I'm cooking you dinner.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          You don't have to do that.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          I know.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Fine.  I'll do the shopping.\n\nThey kiss.  She heads to the Volvo.\n\nINT.  VOLVO - DAY\n\nClaire is approaching a country market.  She spots a little\nsign with an arrow:\n\n                     ADAMANT - 11 mi.\n\nShe hesitates for a moment, then take the turn.\n\nEXT.  ADAMANT - DAY\n\nClaire stands on a street in the quaint little village.  She\nlooks around, spots a little cafe with outdoor tables.  A\nfriendly old HIPPIE WOMAN walks out of a store.  She watches\nClaire gazing around.\n\n                     HIPPIE WOMAN\n          What are you looking for?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I don't really know.\n\n                     HIPPIE WOMAN\n          Know what you mean.\n\nShe ambles off across the street.  Claire watches her go.\nThen notices a sign hung out above a little shop.  THREE\nINTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  She walks toward it.\n\nEXT.  SHOP - DAY\n\nClaire stands in front of the store window.  A sign in the\nwindow identifies it as \"The Sleeping Dog - Hand wrought\njewelry and gifts.\"  Claire tries to open the door, but sees\na closed sign.\n\nShe steps back out to the window and looks in.  On display\nare a selection of handcrafted jewelry and curios.\n\nSuddenly her eye stops on a small silver bracelet with an\nintricate ROSEBUD.\n\nHer eye travels up and behind it to the back of the display\nwhere she spots, a small ORNATE COPPER CHEST.  Protruding\nfrom its lock...THE INTERLOCKED CIRCLES.  Claire looks like\nshe's been punched.\n\nINT.  NORMAN AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nClaire glances over at the soundly sleeping Norman.  She\ngingerly slides out of bed.\n\nINT.  BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\nClaire sits among the boxes, leafing through the photo album,\ntracking the years of their life.  Her hands tremble.\nFinally she reaches the picture of their wedding, reaches\nbehind the photo and produces...THE KEY.\n\nEXT.  DOCK - NIGHT\n\nClaire in her nightgown and a jacket, walks slowly down the\ndock.  An expensive looking flashlight illuminates her path.\nShe stops and stares out at the moonlit lake.\n\nShe holds out a fist.  Her fingers unfold and in her palm\nlies THE KEY.  She holds the key out over the water and\nstands there, frozen.  The lighthouse beam sweeps past her\nonce...then again.\n\nClaire pulls her hand back and holds the key to her chest,\nthen carefully places it on the dock.  She very deliberately\ntakes off her jacket and slippers, steps to the edge of the\ndock, shines the flashlight on the dark water...then steps\noff the dock.\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nAN ANGUISHED CRY from downstairs.  Norman bolts upright in\nbed.\n\nINT.  NORMAN'S STUDY - NIGHT\n\nNorman walks through the darkened house into the moonlit\nroom.  He pulls up short when he sees the strongbox sitting\nclosed on his desk.  He looks around, sees the room is empty\nand walks over to it.\n\nThe mud and silt has been wiped from the top, on which is\nengraved:  To N.C.S. with love always, M.E.F.\n\nHe pulls open the lid and tentatively peers inside.\n\nTHE LIGHTS SWITCH ON.\n\nClaire stands in the doorway, holding out the SILVER ROSEBUD\nNECKLACE.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Looking for this?\n\nNorman stares at her dumbly.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          She's out there isn't she?  She's in the\n          lake.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what\n          this is.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING\n          NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (nearly hysterical)\n          I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus.\n          Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she\n          was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On\n          my life!  She took pills and she killed\n          herself in our house to destroy me!  To\n          destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here\n          before school, the painters would have--\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I don't believe you.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe\n          me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!\n               (beat, fighting tears)\n          I did what I had to, Claire.  She was\n          gone.  There was nothing I could do for\n          her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I\n          rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.\n               (beat)\n          And I've lived with that image ever since.\n               (beat)\n          I couldn't just stand there while\n          everything-- my career, us,\n          everything, just washed away.  Don't you\n          see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is\n          exactly what she wants you to think!\n\nClaire's lip is quivering with confusion.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          I don't know what's true anymore.\n               (beat)\n          But that girl must be brought up.  Now do\n          you want to call the police?  Or should I?\n\nNorman stares at the phone.  He's a wreck.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Fine.  I can't live with it anymore.\n\nHe takes the phone, punches in three numbers, waits.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          This is Dr. Norman Spencer.  No, it's not\n          an emergency.\n\nHe looks at Claire.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          I have some information about a missing\n          girl, Madison Frank...Yes.  Could you send\n          an officer?  Fifteen Willoughby, about a\n          mile before the bridge...Thank you.\n\nHe hangs up.  Long silence.  They look at each other.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          You did the right thing.\n               (beat)\n          I'm going to get cleaned up.\n\nHe walks out.  Claire walks over and stands before the box.\n\nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nClaire walks into the bedroom.  The shower can be heard\nthrough the bathroom door, which is partially ajar.  Steam\ndrifts out through the crack.\n\nShe stands in her dressing room and catches sight of her\nweary, distraught countenance in the mirror.  She glances\ndown.\n\nCLAIRE'S POV\n\nThe necklace still in her hand.\n\nShe looks up again into the mirror.  Her face goes strangely\nblank and, almost mechanically, she clasps the necklace onto\nher neck.\n\nSuddenly, she stares over at the CORDLESS PHONE lying on the\nbed for a long moment.  She walks over, picks up the phone\nand looks at it.\n\nCLAIRE'S POV\n\nThe redial button.\n\nShe stares at the bathroom door, then hits the button.  Two\nrings, then:\n\n                     VOICE\n               (on phone)\n          Directory assistance...\n\nClaire's eyes widen in terror.  She clicks off the phone,\nand, taking it with her, starts moving toward the door to the\nhall.  She keeps a steady eye trained on the bathroom.  She\nquietly pulls open the hallway door.\n\nSuddenly, A HAND WITH A WASHCLOTH IS THRUST OVER HER FACE.\n\nClaire shoves Norman's hand away and runs past him down the\nhall.\n\nINT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nShe's nearly at the top of the stairs when her body starts to\nfalter.  She tumbles over, dropping the phone, which clatters\ndown the stairs before her.\n\nClaire is pulling herself down the stairs, moaning in terror.\nNorman can be seen calmly following her, waiting for the\nHalothane to take its full effect.  Finally, she freezes.\nNorman picks up the phone and stands over her.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          God, how did we come to this?\n\nHe picks her gently up in his arms and starts carrying her\nslowly up the stairs.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          The ghost stuff, that was impressive.\n\nCLAIRE'S POV\n\nCeiling, shapes...\n\n                     NORMAN\n          I figure you saw her that day in the\n          house and just gradually intuited the\n          whole damn thing.  That would be pretty\n          astonishing.  A passive-aggressive\n          masterpiece.\n\nINT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nAnd into the bathroom.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Wasn't until the shower that I realized\n          you actually believed it.  Nearly froze to\n          death waiting for you.  Thought the\n          circuit breaker would kick back over and\n          I'd be toast.\n\n...then she's lowered into the tub.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          The crazy thing is...I have never for one\n          moment stopped loving you.\n\nHe actually wipes a tear from his eye.  He kisses her lips.\nWe can feel her revulsion.  His face over her.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Don't worry about Caitlin.  I'm sure in\n          some tragic way this'll bring us closer\n          together.\n\nHe turns on the faucets, then moves out of her line of\nvision.  Sound of a number being dialed.\n\n                     NORMAN (O.S.)\n          Hey, it's Norman.  Listen, we had a huge\n          blowout, so I'm going down to sleep at\n          the lab.  I guess you're out, but...\n          maybe...if you wouldn't mind stopping by\n          to check on her in the morning?\n\nShe glances down and sees on the edge of the tub...a\nprescription bottle of VALIUM with her name on the label.\nHer eyes go wide.\n\n                     NORMAN (O.S.)\n          It's just...Jody, it's bad.  I've never\n          seen her like this...\n               (he trails off, choking up)\n          I don't really know what to do anymore.\n\nNorman, lit periodically by the sweep of the light house\nbeacon, squats with the phone and gazes down at her.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          If anything ever happened to her, I'd...\n               (beat)\n          Anyway, thanks.\n\nClaire, mute, glances frantically around.  One of her fingers\nbegins to flutter.\n\n                     NORMAN\n               (tearfully)\n          I'm so sorry.\n\nThe tub is rapidly filling.  He checks his watch, then\nreaches for the Valium.  As much from will as the drug\nbeginning to fade, Claire lets out a garbled cry.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (sloppy, guttural)\n          Mmmuh...\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Shhhh.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (slurry)\n          Mauduh...\n\nNorman stops.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          What?\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          MADISON!\n\nNorman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her belief\nin the ghost.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          That's a little much, don't you think?\n\nHe sees the necklace on her neck.\n\n                     NORMAN\n          Oops.  Can't have that.\n\nHe puts down the bottle of Valium, then reaches around\nClaire's neck to remove the necklace.  When his hands close\non the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack.\n\nNORMAN'S POV\n\nHis arms around MADISON'S BEAUTIFUL CORPSE.\n\nNorman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the BRASS\nSHOWER NOZZLE.  He staggers out of the bathroom before\ncollapsing with a thud.  The water finally rises above\nClaire's nostrils.\n\nClaire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and\nyank it free.  The water slowly descends.\n\nWhen it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally\nclears the descending water.  She chokes in great gulps of\nair.\n\nThe drug is finally wearing off.  Claire sits up.  Norman's\nunconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway.  She\nturns off the water and stands unsteadily.\n\nShe looks around for the phone and finally spots the little\nantenna protruding from under Norman.  She delicately pulls\nthe phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's\nbeen broken by his fall.  She drops it and walks quietly out\nof the room.\n\nINT.  STAIRWAY - NIGHT\n\nClaire stumbles as fast as she can down the stairs.\n\nINT.  FOYER - NIGHT\n\nShe fumbles for some KEYS in a basket by the door, then looks\nat the cell phone's recharging cradle.  It's empty.\n\nShe spots Norman's coat hanging on the coat rack and rifles\nthrough the pockets.  She finds the phone, and flips it open\nto see if it's working.  A drop of something splats on the\nphone.  Then another.  It's blood.\n\nShe looks up and sees Norman, his forehead gashed, glaring\ndown from the landing.\n\nShe reaches for the door knob, but the keys and cell phone in\nher hand make it difficult to open.  Norman hurls himself\nover the banister.  THUD!\n\nA BLOODY HAND yanks her backwards.  Claire slams into the\ncorner by the armoir.  Norman advances on her.  At the last\nmoment, she throws her shoulder into the armoir which tumbles\nover on Norman.\n\nEXT.  DRIVEWAY - NIGHT\n\nClaire races over to the Volvo, which is blocked by NORMAN'S\nPICKUP, the dark hulk of THE SAILBOAT on a trailer behind it.\n\nShe starts to get into the pickup, then remembers to look in\nthe bed...nobody there.\n\nINT.  PICKUP - NIGHT\n\nThe truck is cold and doesn't want to turn over.  She stares\nat the door for signs of Norman.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Come on...come on...\n\n...and VROOM, the truck roars to life.  Claire spews gravel\nas she barrels the cumbersome rig out of the driveway,\nconstantly watching the door.\n\nWhen she veers to the right out of the driveway, she looks\ninto the rear view mirror.  The boat momentarily blocks the\nopen door, then clears.  Still nothing.\n\nEXT.  DIRT ROAD - NIGHT\n\nClaire wheels the truck and trailer out onto a two-lane road.\n\nINT.  PICKUP - NIGHT\n\nShivering with cold and adrenalin, she tries to work the\nancient heater.  She turns onto THE BRIDGE.\n\nEXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\nThe PICKUP and BOAT race across the deserted bridge.\n\nINT.  PICKUP - NIGHT\n\nANGLE\n\nClaire through the windshield.  Her face striped by the\nreflection of the bridge lights which whip one-by-one across\nthe windshield.  She flips open the cell phone and punches in\n911.  It blinks:  \"NO SERVICE.\"\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Shit.\n\nShe glances into the rear view mirror.\n\nCLAIRE'S POV\n\nA stern section of the boat's COVERING TARP untied, flapping\nin the breeze.\n\nClaire desperately punches the \"talk\" button again...\"NO\nSERVICE.\"  She's past the center of the bridge.  She looks\nagain:  \"ROAM.\"  Claire punches the talk button again.\n\nSMASH!\n\nA TRAILER CRANK punches through the window.  Norman's arm\nfollows, coiling like a python around Claire's neck, his grim\nvisage pressed against the glass.\n\nShe squashes down the accelerator.\n\nEXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\nThe trailer starts to weave from side to side, swerving the\npickup.  Claire chokes, then blacks out.\n\nEXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\nThe Pickup and trailer smash through the railing, barreling\nover bumpy terrain straight toward the BOAT RAMP.\n\nThe truck hits the water at fifty and Norman is hurtled\nthrough the rear window and into the passenger side\ndashboard.\n\nINT.  PICKUP - MOMENTS LATER\n\nClaire is unconscious in the driver's seat, a trickle of\nblood runs from her nose.  Norman stirs briefly as Claire\ngroggily comes to.  She hears the hissing of the smashed\nradiator, then sees Norman, a shattered bloody mess on the\nfloor of the cab.\n\nShe leans over to see if he's dead, hears a squeak and\nrealizes that the pickup, with the BATTERED SAILBOAT AND\nTRAILER miraculously still attached, is rolling deeper into\nthe water.\n\nBefore she can get the door open, the truck is half\nsubmerged.  She frantically manages to lower her window\nhalfway and starts to pull herself out.\n\nHer ribs have just cleared the glass when a bloody fist locks\nonto her ankle and yanks her inside.  Norman pulls her down\nuntil they're face to face.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Norman...NO...\n\nShe yanks the emergency brake, but it's too late...the\nsubmerged wheels lock and slide slowly down the mossy ramp.\nThe truck is nearly submerged.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n               (desperately)\n          Norman, please...\n\nThe water is up to the windows.  Norman shakes his head\nslowly as he blinks away blood from his eyes.\n\n                     CLAIRE\n          Think of Caitlin...\n\nWater sprays in through the hole in the rear window and\nmomentarily blinds Norman.  Claire jerks free and scrambles\nout of the driver's side window as the truck sinks.\n\nJust as she's free of the window, she jerks to a stop.  She\nlooks down and sees Norman, half out of the window, one hand\nclamped onto her ankle.\n\nThere is a wrenching metallic creak.  The truck lurches\ndownward...then silence.  IT DOESN'T SINK.  The boat buoys it\nlike a fishing cork as it drifts out into the lake.\n\nThe headlights pierce the darkness of the steep underwater\ndrop off.
