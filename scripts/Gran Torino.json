He has slate blue\n          eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut\n          hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.\n          Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his\n          hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.\n          Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at\n          his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his\n          GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.\n\n<b>          WALT\n</b>          Jesus Christ.\n          Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from\n          across the pews.\n\n<b>          MITCH\n</b>          Look at the Old Man glaring at\n          Ashley.
