In attendance\n          are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored\n          teenagers.\n          WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He\n          speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit.\n\n          OLDER MAN\n          I'm real sorry about Dorothy,\n          Walt. She was a real peach.\n\n          WALT\n          Thanks for coming, Al.\n          Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue\n          eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut\n          hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.\n          Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his\n          hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.\n          Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at\n          his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his\n          GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.\n\n          WALT\n          Jesus Christ.\n          Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from\n          across the pews.\n\n          MITCH\n          Look at the Old Man glaring at\n          Ashley.

He deliberately\n          stops at the boundary of his property.\n          The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now\n          mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged\n          to Polish families.\n          Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on.\n          Walt can see through the window that the living room is\n          jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong.\n          And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full-\n          blown, unrepentant racist.\n          Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.\n\n          WALT\n          Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats\n          can they cram into a living room?\n          Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.\n\n          INT.
