In his hands, he holds one of the chains from his\n          campanile.\n          \n          Judah grabs Ashe by the lapels of his coat, draging him close\n          so they're eye to eye -- close enough to breathe the same beath\n          -- two sides of a coin.\n          \n           \n          \n          JUDAH\n          \n          Tell me, Ashe.
