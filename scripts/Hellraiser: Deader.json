The only thing about her that isn't black is a\n   complexion so translucently pale that it bespeaks only the\n   most rare and grudging familiarity with daylight. She has a\n   paper coffee cup and a cigarette in the same hand, and she\n   alternates sips of coffee with puffs of her cigarette with a\n   practiced proficiency. She ignores the unhappy looks of her\n   fellow employees. She clearly has practice at this as well.\n\n   Little office cubbies scattered around a converted loft\n   space. \"Too Hip\" EMPLOYEES sit at their desks, typing at\n   computers, conferring at tables -- going about the business\n   of turning out another issue. They point and whisper as Amy\n   walks by.\n\n   Amy passes another cubicle as A YOUNG REPORTER holds the\n   newspaper's FRONT PAGE up in front of Amy. A big headline\n   reads, \"How to be a Crack Whore\" written over a photo of a\n   crack den in which we glimpse things better left unseen.\n   Beneath the headline is written, \"A special report by Amy\n   Klein.\"\n<b>\n</b><b>   I\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>                               4\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                        YOUNG REPORTER (O.C)\n</b>              Nice reporting Klein.

Winter.\n\n   Winter glances up, then dismisses the camera altogether. He\n   looks off screen, then raises his hand. The room quiets. We\n   hear various voices.\n\n<b>                        VOICES\n</b>              Shh. Quiet. We're starting.\n\n   Winter looks up and the camera swings toward Katya. She\n   hesitates. A girl next to her starts to prompt her.\n\n<b>                        WINTER\n</b>              Do you become one of us of your own free\n              will?\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>                               9\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                        KATYA\n</b>              Yes.\n\n<b>                        WINTER\n</b>              Are you afraid?\n\n<b>                        KATYA\n</b>              Yes.\n\n<b>                        WINTER\n</b>              Good.

The camera moves this way and that, trying to\n   get the best angle to cover the action. People spread towels\n   on the mattress, over the plastic, as Katya, naked, sits down\n   on the towels, then lays back, flat on the mattress.\n\n    inter looks to the Black Kid standing next to him. He comes\n   up with a big handgun -- maybe a .45.\n\n<b>                        KATYA\n</b>              I'm not real...\n\n   The camera moves in closer as Winter takes the gun and slips\n   it into Katya's hand.\n\n<b>                        KATYA\n</b>              I'm not...

She\n    continues to lie on the mattress, the barrel of the gun\n    pressed against the side of her head.\n\n<b>                           KATYA\n</b>                I'm not real.

Other hands\n    come in and press a doubled-over pillow against the towel.\n\n<b>                          KATYA\n</b>                I'm not real. I'm not...

We can see it splatter out the other side,\n    tearing through the towel and the folded over pillow, which\n    catch a great blast of bone and brain.\n\n    We hear some screams in the room.\n\n    AMY jumps back.\n\n<b>                          AMY\n</b>                Have you called the police on this?\n<b>\n</b><b>   \n</b>\n\n<b>                                11\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                        CHARLES\n</b>              Just watch...\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              I want to know if you've called the\n              pol...\n\n<b>                        CHARLES\n</b>              I said, \"Just watch.\"\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              Oh, man, don't tell me that was some\n              special effect...\n\n<b>                        CHARLES\n</b>              You tell me.\n\n<b>                         AMY\n</b>              This is sick...\n\n<b>                        CHARLES\n</b>              That's saying a lot, for you.\n\n    The camera is now pointing at Winter. There is a look of deep\n    tenderness in his face as he circles around and kneels down,\n    staring toward Katya, who is lying, as dead as dead can be,\n    on the mattress. Blood has run from the ghastly wound down\n    both sides of the plastic, and towels on the side of the bed\n    catch the mess.\n\n    Winter reaches down and gently removes the gun from Katya's\n    lifeless hand... and then, light as a feather, lies down on\n    top of her.\n\n    The camera moves forward and down as Marla, presumably,\n    elbows her way through for a better vantage point. The camera\n    moves in close as Winter stretches out along Katya's body.\n\n    He places his lips on her forehead, kissing her lightly, then\n    presses his lips against hers -- kissing her -- or maybe\n    something else. It seems almost as if he's breathing into\n    her. His body moves as his lungs expand and expel, and he\n    seems to be struggling toward some non-sexual climax.\n    AMY watches, both repelled and fascinated.\n<b>\n</b><b> \n</b>\n\n\n\n\n<b>                                12\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>    ON THE TAPE\n</b>\n    Winter continues his odd ritual, finally taking a great final\n    breath, as if he's reached the point of exhaustion, and\n    expels it. Nothing happens.\n\n    He leans in close.\n\n<b>    WITH AMY\n</b>\n    Amy leans in close as well.\n\n<b>    WITH WINTER\n</b>\n    He draws in another breath -- he seems to be in agony as he\n    does it -- presses his lips to Katya's dead ones, and\n    exhales. The breath seems to go on forever -- longer than it\n    should.\n\n    And then, when it seems as if Winter can't breathe out\n    another teaspoon of air, Katya's body abruptly twitches\n    beneath him -- and then she sucks in a ragged breath. Her\n    previously open and lifeless eyes, move. Her head raises up.\n\n<b>    WITH AMY\n</b>\n    She simply stares, breathing again for the first time in a\n    moment, unable to quite take in what she's seeing.\n\n<b>    ON THE SCREEN\n</b>\n    Winter, exhausted, looks down at Katya, smiling. There's\n    nervous laughter, sounds of relief from around the room.\n    Winter slides off of her. Katya looks this way and that,\n    presumably at the others, looking down at her.\n\n    A hand reaches down and she takes it. The camera follows as\n    Winter pulls her unsteadily up to standing. All this despite\n    the fact that there is still an exceedingly large and obvious\n    hole in her head... the size of a dime on one side, the size\n    of a half-dollar on the other.\n\n    The others move in, touching her, congratulating her. She's\n    still a bit shaky, uncertain. Then she lifts one of her hands\n    to the side of her head -- the side with the big exit wound.\n    She touches it gingerly, confirming that it is really there.\n\n    Then she slowly slides her fingers IN. They penetrate her\n    skull, unobstructed, to the second knuckle. Katya takes her\n    fingers from this ghastly wound and stares at them, bloody.\n    Yet she's alive. Fine.\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n\n<b>                             13\n</b>\n\n    She looks up at the others, then smiles widely.

She starts laughing.\n\n<b>                        KATYA\n</b>                  (as if actually realizing) it)\n              I'm fine...\n\n<b>                         K\n</b>    She touches the wound again.\n\n<b>                         ATYA\n</b>              I feel great...\n\n    She starts laughing.\n\n<b>                        KATYA\n</b>              Oh, man! Oh, man...\n\n    The image cuts off, goes to snow. There is a moment of\n    silence. Amy turns to Charles.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              What the hell...\n\n<b>                        CHARLES\n</b>              That's what I said.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              Have you... have you found any of\n              these...\n\n<b>                        CHARLES\n</b>              I haven't done anything.

Amy nods as he pulls the door closed.\n\n    She descends down the dark hallway. Her face tightens as she\n    takes in the deathly ripe air. The BUZZING of flies getting\n    louder with each step.\n\n    As she approaches a room, she recoils, clutching her face\n    from the stench. She inhales -- drawing in the smell to\n    acclimate herself -- and almost vomits. She steadies herself,\n    drawing in breaths through her nose, tentative at first, and\n    finally in larger breaths, until she can tolerate it.\n\n     he looks back toward the entry door, she is alone.\n<b>\n</b><b>   \n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                18\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>    INT.

Amy steps cautiously in.\n\n    She looks toward one side, sees a closet with a double\n    sliding door. She slides open one side, sees nothing that\n    shouldn't be there -- a ragged winter jacket, a green plastic\n    raincoat, a hangar festooned with scarfs, some other garments\n    still obscured beneath cleaning bag plastic.\n\n    She hesitates, then calmly slides the other side open. More\n    of the same.\n\n    She turns in the other direction. There's a little kitchen.\n    Nothing dead there. She starts forward then turns back --\n    staring at the refrigerator. She goes quickly over and tugs\n    it open. It's empty. Not so much as a ketchup bottle.\n    Curious, she opens the freezer. The same. Empty.\n\n    She heads through the living room and down a narrow corridor\n    leading to another bedroom. At the end of the hallway is a\n    bathroom. The door to the bathroom is open and the toilet, on\n    the far wall, faces the door.\n    Marla is there.\n\n    Dressed only in bra and panties, she is sitting on the closed\n    lid of the john, leaning forward in what seems, at first, to\n    be an impossible angle. Her hands hang forward, almost\n    touching the floor. Her head is cocked back, staring up. Her\n    skin is gray, swollen.\n\n    Amy takes a few steps forward, for a better look. As she\n    approaches, she sees the reason for the odd position of the\n    body.\n\n    A long boot-lace has been tied around Marla's neck and tied\n    to the wall pipe on the toilet. The flesh of her neck has\n    swollen out, almost burying the boot-lace. She has hanged\n    herself in this ghastly way.\n\n    Amy takes another step forward. As she does, there's a sudden\n    loud buzzing as the flies that crawl on Marla abruptly rise\n    up, alarmed (or whatever it is flies are) at her approach.\n    But they soon return to the corpse, crawling about the face,\n    around the edges of the glazed, eyes, around the margins of\n    the open mouth, rimmed with dry foam -- around the out-thrust\n    tongue.\n<b>\n</b><b>    \n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>                                19\n</b>\n\n\n    Amy covers her mouth with her shirt, trying to filter out the\n    stench. She backs away from the body and into another room.\n\n<b>    IN THE BEDROOM\n</b>\n    Amy starts to search -- fast, thorough, -- she's done this\n    sort of thing before. She finds a journal, opens it... no\n    writing. She tosses it aside. Pulls open a drawer. She tugs\n    out what looks like a blade-less knife handle. She presses a\n    stud. A STILETTO BLADE SPRINGS OUT. She tosses it back in the\n    drawer, tugs some other stuff into view.\n\n    Some bills, some shoelaces, loose change. She goes drawer to\n    drawer, looking for anything that might mean something.\n    Socks, ragged underwear, cheap jewelry, tee shirts and short\n    skirts and jeans.\n\n    Amy stops, surveying the territory. Where to look next? Then,\n    deciding, she goes to the bed.\n\n     She reaches under it, sliding her hand around, tugs out a\n    dust-encrusted skirt. Feels around some more, hesitates,\n    pulls something else out. She brings it out into view. It's a\n    desiccated mouse. She grimaces and tosses it back under the\n    bed in disgust.\n\n    She stops... then slides her hand between the mattress and\n    the box spring. She feels around, then stops, finding\n    something. She pulls out a little red paper folder -- the\n    kind that photographs come from. She opens it.\n\n    It appears to be a photographic record of another \"deader\"\n    party. We see some of the same participants -- we also see\n    Marla herself in some of the pictures. She's smiling. Amy\n    flips the next photograph.\n\n     It shows Marla next to Winter. He's holding something in his\n    hand. Amy looks closer. THE PUZZLE BOX -- Amy turns another\n    photograph and it shows somebody holding the box out in front\n    of Marla.\n\n    The picture is framed through a length of rope with a noose\n    on one end. Marla is on the other side-- Almost a kind of\n    \"joke\" photo.\n\n    She has a kind of sickly smile on her face. Amy's eyes\n    narrow. She holds the picture closer. There seems to be a\n    figure lost in shadows, and the closer she looks the more\n    reality merges with the grains of the photo. What is there? A\n    man?\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                20\n</b>\n\n\n    Amy hears a scratching noise coming from outside the room.\n    She stuffs the book in her satchel.\n\n    Amy turns toward the door that leads to the hall and the\n    unseen bathroom. She sits, silent, waiting.\n<b>    \n</b>    Then the sound of the scratching comes again. The sound of\n    flies rising -- and again, more distinct -- something\n    scratching. She keeps her position, still listening. Nothing.\n    Just the slow steady, untroubled buzzing.\n\n    She moves toward the bathroom.\n\n    And again there's the tiny scratching, and the rush of sound,\n    as if something has disturbed the flies.\n\n    The sound stops. The flies are still except for the\n    occasional buzz.\n\n    She advances, until she can glimpse the edge of one of\n    Marla's hanging, out-thrust hands, the tip of one finger just\n    touching the floor. Marla's long fingernails are painted\n    green.\n\n<b>    THE BATHROOM\n</b>\n    She comes around the edge of the bathroom door. Marla is\n    motionless.\n\n    She leans from the pipe by the shoelace. The shoelace is\n    still buried in her throat. The flies buzz up again.   The\n    glazed eyes remain fixed in their sockets. One of her hands\n    is not visible from Amy's position.. We see scratches on the\n    floor beneath her fingernails.\n\n    Amy steels herself -- and then walks closer. On the corner of\n    the sink, there's a thick manila envelope with something\n    bulky inside -- something that looks just like a cassette\n    tape. There's a name written on it, and the marker is right\n    next to it. It reads \"AMY\"\n\n    Amy must reach past the corpse in order to reach the\n    envelope, horribly close to the body in doing so.\n\n    She enters the cramped space and reaches toward the sink. She\n    is about six inches shy of grabbing it. She notices that her\n    hip is almost touching Marla's face as she leans. The flies\n    stir. The stench rises.\n\n    She stretches closer, and Marla's body is pushed aside a few\n    inches. Closer and closer AMY reaches.\n<b>\n</b><b>    \n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>                                21\n</b>\n\n\n    Her outstretched fingers just manage to touch the envelope.\n    She pitches it and pulls it toward her.\n\n    It falls off the sink and onto the floor behind Marla.\n\n    Now, Amy must kneel, and reach past Marla face. She holds her\n    breath as she reaches long and far...\n\n    She manages to grab the envelope, but her face is almost\n    cheek to cheek with the rotting corpse. As she pulls the\n    envelope up, she notices something else in Marla's hidden\n    hand.\n\n<b>    THE PUZZLE BOX.\n</b>\n    Amy reaches over and pries open Marla's hand. Her blackened\n    fingers snap as they are pulled off the box. Amy grabs the\n    box and envelope, stuffs them into her bag, and stands.\n\n    As she stands next to Marla's body suddenly-\n\n<b>    MARLA'S HAND GRABS AMY'S LEG!\n</b>\n    Amy shrieks and swats the dead hand away, falling backward\n    onto the floor as she does. She rolls over and, in a half-\n    crawl, half-scramble, gets herself back up to her feet.\n\n    Amy backs up against a wall, kicking Marla as she kicks the\n    floor. We can't tell if Marla is moving from the kicks or if\n    she is somehow alive. Either way, its to much for Amy. She\n    stops moving.\n\n    Marla's mouth emits a ghastly sound as a stream of liquid\n    falls to the floor. Its almost as if she is trying to speak.\n\n    Amy has seen enough. Up she goes as she tears down the hall,\n    through the living room and SMACK INTO THE MANAGER!\n\n    Which needless to say, scares the shit out of her. He's\n    standing inside the now open door to the apartment.\n\n<b>                         AMY\n</b>              She's dead...\n\n<b>                         MANAGER\n</b>              Dead...\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              Dead!

He pulls the cigar from his\n    mouth and points it in her direction. Amy hears police sirens\n    in the background.\n\n<b>                         MANAGER\n</b>               Already did. Who are you?\n                   (pointing his cigar at Amy's\n                    satchel)\n               What do you have in there?\n\n    In a flash Amy twists her arm out of his grasp, and slings\n    her knee up into his nuts. He doubles over.\n\n\n<b>    INT. THE HALL AND STAIRWAY - DAY\n</b>\n    Amy comes flying down the hall at top speed. She reaches the\n    top of the stairs and starts down... ...and as she does, her\n    feet slip.\n\n    She slides down five or six steps, then over-balances,\n    throwing out her hands to keep her chin from hitting the\n    polished stone steps. She keeps sliding down, finally over-\n    balancing again, flipping over and landing on her back on the\n    landing half-way between the floors.\n<b>                         A\n</b><b>                             MY\n</b>               Dammit!\n\n    The Manager looks down the stairs for her. He doesn't even\n    attempt to chase her.\n\n<b>                            MANAGER\n</b>\n               Stop her!\n\n    He curses her in his native tongue.\n\n\n<b>    EXT.   SIDEWALK - DAY\n</b>\n    Amy breaks through the doors of the building. She hits two of\n    the ten stairs down to the sidewalk. People walking by hardly\n    notice.\n\n    Up ahead, a police car is turning down the street. She stops\n    and walks calmly, diverting her eyes. The police car races\n    by, and Amy walks faster, and faster, then runs.\n<b>\n</b><b>              \n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                23\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>    INT. AMY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n    Close on a tray of ice being cracked apart. It's contents\n    poured into a open towel.\n\n    Amy is sitting on the floor in front of her couch, now\n    dressed in only panties and a bra -- an image unpleasantly\n    reminiscent of Marla -- especially with the spotting of\n    bruises and roughly bandaged scrapes on her pale skin.\n\n    She has a dripping ice pack in one hand, which she applies to\n    this bruise and that -- and a bottle of gin in the other. She\n    doesn't look happy. She takes a drink, then looks toward a TV\n    and VCR in front of her.\n\n    There's a tape half-inserted into the VCR. We can see the\n    empty envelope with \"AMY\" written on it, lying on the floor.\n\n      he tape is within reach of Amy's bare foot, and she lifts a\n    toe toward it, hesitant. She puts her toe against the\n    tape...hanging on the edge of decision. Finally, she shoves\n    it forward with her toe.\n<b>    \n</b>    It slides into the machine. She grabs up the remote and turns\n    on the set. The IMAGE appears.\n\n    It's Marla, looking like she hasn't slept in days, sitting on\n    a chair in her apartment staring into camera. Her eyes are\n    glazed, distant. But she looks a hell of lot better than she\n    did in the bathroom.\n\n<b>                        MARLA\n</b>                   (a little sad)\n              I knew you'd come.

It goes black for a few seconds, and\n    then cuts to snow.\n\n    Amy sits, staring at the snow, her face empty. She sets the\n    PUZZLE BOX on the table and stares at it.

Light seems to emanate from within as it clicks\n    into another form. The table beneath it seems tremble, the\n    ice in her drink taps against the edge of the glass.\n\n      figure appears in the darkness behind her. PINHEAD.

SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n</b>\n    A thunderous noise trails a subway car as it streaks out of a\n    station.\n\n     Lit with cold fluorescent light, Amy, now dressed, with her\n    sunglasses in place, slides her card through the slot and\n    shoves through the turnstile. She descends the long, non-\n    working escalator -- the only one on it at this time of\n    night.\n<b>    \n</b>    She reaches the subway platform. It is virtually empty.\n\n    Amy has come down stairs that land her just about in the\n    middle. She scans the far end of the platform, past a lone\n    FIGURE in a SHINY GREEN PLASTIC RAINCOAT who lies motionless\n    on a bench.\n\n    - a couple MIDDLE-AGED GUYS in security uniforms, maybe\n    heading for some night shift somewhere, stand, not moving,\n    hands thrust in pockets.\n\n    She turns back to the bench but the FIGURE in the SHINY GREEN\n    RAINCOAT is gone.\n\n    She takes up a position at the far end of the platform. She\n    waits.\n\n    A moment later, a bit of a breeze starts moving her hair. A\n    few seconds later, a train comes roaring into the station.\n    Amy watches the car pass her, one by one, as the train slows.\n    The train is virtually empty. One car after the next rolls by\n    as the train slows.\n\n    Finally, as the train moves slowly to a stop, a car different\n    from the others comes in. This one, for some odd reason,\n    seems to have newspaper covering all the windows -- taped up\n    from the inside.\n<b>\n</b><b>   \n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                28\n</b>\n\n\n    One of the doors of the covered car comes to a stop directly\n    in front of the spot where Amy is standing -- the spot marked\n    by the stenciled PUZZLE BOX. There's a pause, then the doors\n    slide open -- just one the one set in front of Amy. The\n    others stay closed. The interior of the car is dark -- the\n    lights, apparently, are not working.\n\n    A tall ODD-LOOKING MAN in a CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM is standing\n    there. He gestures toward the adjoining car.\n\n<b>                          ONDUCTOR\n</b>              Next car.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              Is Joey on this ride?\n\n<b>                        CONDUCTOR\n</b>              Come on in...\n\n    She enters. The doors slide closed. The train pulls out.\n\n\n<b>    INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT\n</b>\n    The interior of the car has been transformed into some odd-\n    ball cross between a very small nightclub and an crackhouse..\n\n    As the train passes out of the station, and the lights dim,\n    we can see the lights from joints and crack pipes -- or at\n    any rate something being smoked in some kind of pipe,\n    glinting in the darkness. Various hands reach up and tug down\n    the newspapers, and the tunnel lights come in, providing a\n    flickering, constantly changing illumination.\n\n    In the uncertain light, Amy can see the various CELEBRANTS\n    hanging out -- some on the seats, some on the floor, some\n    dressed, some partially undressed, some engaging in desultory\n    drug use, others in desultory sex acts -- mostly teenagers\n    and twenty-nothings.\n\n    Amy looks around, not particularly effected by the oddness of\n    the scene. The Conductor touches her arm.\n\n<b>                        CONDUCTOR\n</b>              Down that way...\n\n    She threads her way through the tangle of people. In the\n    flickering lights she catches glimpses of pale human flesh,\n    PIERCED FACES, PIERCED NIPPLES -- PIERCED THINGS that we\n    can't even be sure what they are.\n\n    Expressions flash by in the flickering light, some dull,\n    others laughing.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                29\n</b>\n\n    She pretty much ignores it all as she makes her way toward\n    the rear of the car. A rat feeds on the contents of a young\n    woman's purse as she and another woman are tangled in\n    passion.\n\n    There, illuminated in flashes, JOEY, a thin ill-shaven\n    English guy in his mid-twenties is sprawled on a seat. One of\n    his lower eyelids has a ring in it. It flicks up every time\n    he blinks. He reads a newspaper while a woman bobs her head\n    up and down in his lap.\n\n    Joey looks up and spots Amy. He points an accusing finger at\n    her, but his mood is good-natured..\n\n<b>                         JOEY\n</b>              Ahhhh, now here comes a daring soul. A\n              person committed to a just cause.

Marla Chen sent me. I'm\n              looking for a girl named Katya. Another\n              young girl with red hair and half her\n              head shaved. A guy with glasses named\n              Winter.\n\n    Joey's eyes narrow. Something has clearly clicked. He laughs\n    slightly, starts shaking his head.\n\n<b>                        JOEY\n</b>              And the plot thickens.

And that\n              would be such a regrettable waste. If he\n              refrains from telling her... she may yet\n              be saved.

It's always locked, and they're\n              not always there. I don't know where they\n              are when they're not. And once you get\n              mixed up with them -- it's like that\n              story with the tar baby -- chances are\n              you never get loose, and if you do, you\n              never get clean.\n\n    The \"Conductor\" shouts from somewhere.\n\n<b>                           CONDUCTOR\n</b>              Coming in!\n\n    Hands promptly reach up, covering the windows with newspaper.\n    The Conductor goes to the door. The band finishes its set as\n    the light from the station shines through the newspapers.\n    Joey, looking drab in the steady uneven light, stares at Amy.\n\n<b>                         JOEY\n</b>              I can't take responsibility for you.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              I'm not asking you to.\n\n    Amy begins to walk off.

He shouts over the\n    breaking train.\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n\n<b>                                32\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                         JOEY\n</b>              Amy Klein, I'm doing a change of heart\n              thing here, which doesn't usually happen\n              with strangers, but I'm trying to give a\n              little back, it's this whole Karma kick\n              I'm on -- don't do it.

SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT\n</b>\n    Amy stands on the platform as the door hisses shut. The train\n    pulls away. She checks her watch, then moves to the other\n    side of the platform. She looks down the tunnel. The light\n    from an approaching train is beginning to reflect off the\n    curved wall of the tunnel.\n\n    She turns back in the direction she just looked. Far down the\n    platform, there's a bench with a lone occupant - - a slumped\n    over figure dressed in a SHINY GREEN RAINCOAT. She turns\n    toward it, staring. In the distance, no details of face or\n    form are visible -- just the lumpy figure in the shiny green\n    raincoat. She takes a step toward it, but still cannot make\n    out any detail in the slumped over figure. She approaches...\n    as does the train. There is no sign of movement.\n\n    She comes around, closer to the edge of the platform, to get\n    a more direct view of the green-coated form. As she does, she\n    sees that one hand is draped off the front edge of the bench,\n    hanging limp. The hand is gray.\n\n    Amy takes a step forward.\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n\n<b>                                33\n</b>\n\n\n    His eyes pop open! He looks at her with large black eyes,\n    dead eyes. Dripping from beneath his raincoat is a small pool\n    of fresh blood.\n\n    Amy gasps, takes a step back -- and her heel lands on the\n    edge of the subway platform. She struggles for balance.\n\n    Abruptly, a man's voice comes from somewhere.\n\n<b>                           VOICE\n</b>              Amy Klein!\n\n    Amy stumbles forward, goes down to her knees and turns.\n    Around twenty feet behind her, standing on the edge of the\n    platform, with his back toward the drop, is-\n\n    - WINTER, wearing a black trench-coat, cinched at the waist.\n\n    He looks down the tunnel. Amy does as well. The train is\n    coming into the station. She turns back toward Winter. He\n    stares at her, with malevolent eyes.\n\n    And as the train comes flying in, he calmly falls backward,\n    directly into its path.\n\n    Amy screams.\n\n    In an instant she's up, running alongside the braking train.\n    The doors open, but virtually nobody comes out. The front of\n    the train is still far ahead.\n\n<b>                         AMY\n</b>              Hey! You hit someone! Someone fell in\n              front of the train! Hey! Hey!\n\n    The doors hiss and start to close. Finally, Amy reaches the\n    front window of the train. She hammers on it. It opens and a\n    middle-aged WOMAN'S face leans out -- the DRIVER.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              Somebody fell... somebody fell in front\n              of the train.\n\n<b>                        DRIVER\n</b>              Where?

TRACK WORKERS are poking around underneath it.\n\n    Amy is leaning against one of the metal pillars, staring at\n    the empty bench -- at the place where the mysterious figure\n    was sitting. She's looking grim.\n\n    Behind her, a Track Worker approaches the DRIVER, who's\n    standing with a pair of Transit Cops. He's shaking his head,\n    shrugging. The Driver curses, heads back toward the first\n    car. One of the COPS approaches Amy.\n\n<b>                        COP\n</b>              Well, the men have looked.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              And there's nothing there?\n\n<b>                        COP\n</b>              You don't seem terribly surprised.\n\n<b>                         AMY\n</b>              Hmm?\n\n    There's a sudden hiss.

Amy looks toward\n    it. The train is moving on one of the center tracks, so that\n    you can look through the windows of the cars and see through\n    them to the platform on the far side.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              ...and, um...

On the platform on the far side, there is a\n    lone figure, the man in the black trench-coat. Amy jumps,\n    looks more closely.\n\n<b>                        COP\n</b>              Did he say anyth...\n\n<b>                           AMY\n</b>              It's him.!\n\n    In an instant, Amy is tearing down the platform, heading for\n    the stairs that connect to the platform on the other side.\n\n<b>                         COP\n</b>              Hey...\n\n    Amy is watching, staring through the moving train windows.\n    The figures are still there. Winter is staring at her -\n\n<b>                        COP\n</b>              Hey, stop! Tomislav! Tomislav!\n\n     n the next instant, the Cop is giving chase, and another\n    Cop, clearly, the \"Tomislav\" called by the first Cop, further\n    down the station, is rushing in to head Amy off.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              It's them!

Then, the last car of the train passes,\n    leaving an unencumbered view of the far side.\n\n    The platform is empty. No sign of Winter. No sign of anybody.\n\n    Amy stop struggling, as the Cops tug her arms back,\n    handcuffing her. She hardly notices, but keep staring at the\n    empty platform across the tracks. She glances up at the Cops.\n\n\n      panting Tomislav looks down at her. Then circles his finger\n    around his ear to his comrades.

Not during\n              the day, you understand, but around three\n              in the morning, it keeps me up. I want to\n              know what's coming.

Amy watches him go, waves, then\n    spins back towards the curb. She flags down a cab and hops\n    in.\n\n\n<b>    EXT. POTEILARI AND MINVARA - DAY\n</b>\n    A ragged, run-down place, looking bleak and ugly in the\n    bright light of day. We see the street sign, identifying the\n    place -- Poteilari and Minvara. A cab pulls up and Amy gets\n    out.\n\n    She crosses the street, passes one side door -- and then\n    comes to a building that's been sealed up -- doors and\n    windows cemented shut with cinder-blocks.\n\n    Beyond a narrow railing is a stairway, pressed up sideways\n    against the building, running down to a basement entrance.\n    Amy looks down the stairway to it's narrow bottom. The stairs\n    and the bottom are littered with trash. A filthy mattress\n    lies at the very bottom. Amy heads down.\n\n<b>    EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS - DAY\n</b>\n    At the bottom of the stairs, there's a wooden door. A hole\n    has been punched through it and a heavy padlocked chain has\n    been threaded through it and through a heavy hasp that's been\n    bolted to the door frame. Some official government notice of\n    some kind has been tacked to the door -- long rendered\n    unreadable by the effects of time.\n\n    Amy inspects the padlock. It's heavy and uncompromising. She\n    tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the chain --\n    but that's only a few inches. Amy peers into the darkness\n    beyond, but can't see a thing.\n\n    She looks down at the mattress that she's standing on, steps\n    to the side and shoves it up.\n\n    Then, as if the light breaks, she reaches out, grabs the hasp\n    and pulls. The bolts holding the hasp to the wall are loose.\n    They slide out with it. She tugs the whole thing free and\n    pulls the door open.\n\n    There is a narrow corridor beyond, all in gloom. Amy enters.\n\n<b>    INT.   THE CORRIDOR - DAY\n</b>\n    Amy steps in, her way illuminated only by the indefinite\n    light that leaks in from the street.\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n\n<b>                                40\n</b>\n\n    There's an archway, presumably leading into the rest of the\n    basement, on one side, but it's blocked by a great heap of\n    rubble.\n\n    Amy ponders the chances of getting through it, and decides to\n    check out the rest of the hallway. She works her way through\n    a series of ominous corridors.\n\n    Amy senses that she is not alone, stops, and turns around. No\n    one. She continues.\n\n    There is only a single door left -- at the far end of the\n    hallway. It hangs half-open, but we cannot see what's inside.\n    She approaches it, reaches out and pushes the door open. It's\n    a bathroom.\n\n    As she enters we see a FIGURE beyond her in the hallways,\n    buried in the shadows.\n\n<b>    INT. THE BATHROOM - DAY\n</b>\n    This is one of those nasty little makeshift places built into\n    an available corner -- basically a toilet and a sink so close\n    that there's hardly room to move. A mop and some other\n    supplies, long forgotten, are propped up in a corner.\n\n    Amy steps in, looks down the toilet. Nothing left but some\n    nasty stains -- the water long dried up. Her face brushes\n    against something hanging in the air. She pulls back. It's a\n    pull string hanging from a naked light bulb.\n\n    She tugs on it. Nothing. No power here.\n\n    She stands in the dark, claustrophobic place, puzzled. She\n    looks back down the hall. It seems as if she's come to\n    another dead end. Then she stares at the bathroom door. Open\n    now, it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall -- the only place\n    she hasn't looked.\n\n    Amy steps back, virtually straddling the toilet, and pushes\n    the door closed. As she does, of course, what little light\n    there is, vanishes completely. If there's something behind\n    the door, she can't see it, or anything else.\n\n    Abruptly, there's a sharp click as she lights her lighter,\n    and the wavering light illuminates the tiny bathroom -- and\n    the previously unseen space behind the door.\n\n    The walls do not meet there. There is a narrow gap, leading\n    to a passage, apparently \"between\" the walls, perhaps ten\n    inches wide.\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n<b>                                41\n</b>\n\n\n    Hesitating only a moment, Amy turns sideways and slides\n    herself into the claustrophobic slot. She holds the lighter\n    up ahead of her, but its dim flickering light does not reach\n    to the end of the passage. She moves forward cautiously --\n    the floor is littered with dried chunks of plaster, rotting\n    insulation -- seventy-five years of stuff crumbled from the\n    insides of the walls.\n\n    As she disappears into the tunnel, the door slowly opens\n    behind her. Passing across the rusty doorknob, a menacing\n    blade appears.\n\n    Inside the tunnel, Amy reaches a vertical pipe up against one\n    side of the wall - - only a few inches thick, but it reduces\n    the available room to under eight inches. She hesitates.\n    Meanwhile, the lighter in her hand is getting hot. She lets\n    it click off. In some dim half-light we can see her slipping\n    a handkerchief carefully around it, for insulation.\n\n    She flicks the flint. The lighter lights.\n\n    And, abruptly, around a million roaches , which had returned\n    from their hiding places in the absence of the light, go\n    skittering every which way.\n\n    Amy lets out a squeak as the roaches vanish in an instant.\n\n<b>                          AMY\n</b>              Christ...\n\n    She looks at the pipe again, and then starts to squeeze past\n    it. It's a tight fit. She has to squirm to get through.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              Welcome to club anorexia...\n\n    She pops free and comes out the other side. She holds up the\n    lighter. Still the light cannot reach to the end of the\n    passage. Steeling herself, she moves on. But as she does, the\n    space seems to get progressively narrower and narrower.\n\n    From ten inches to nine, to eight, until both sides of her\n    body are scraping against the walls. She holds the lighter\n    out. The wall continues to narrow.\n\n    At the end of her outstretched arm, the walls are only around\n    five inches apart.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              What the...\n<b>\n</b><b> \n</b>\n\n<b>                                 42\n</b>\n\n\n    Clearly, she's reached the end of the line. Annoyed, she\n    starts to back out -- then realizes that the light on the far\n    side of her body renders the area into which she's now moving\n    essentially black as midnight.\n\n     She brings the hand holding the lighter close in to her body,\n    but she can't bring her hands together in front of her -- the\n    space is too narrow. Finally, she reaches her hand up, over\n    her head, passing the lighter from one hand to the other\n    directly over her head.\n\n    As she does, the lighter almost slips. She grabs for it, but\n    it goes out. Again she is lost in virtual darkness.\n\n    She strikes the flint. It flickers but doesn't light. As she\n    strikes it again, IT LIGHTS SOMETHING IN THERE WITH HER! Amy\n    doesn't see it, we do...\n\n<b>    AND IT HAS A KNIFE IN ITS HANDS.\n</b>\n    The light returns -- now illuminating the other side of her\n    body -- the way from which she's come. But, because the space\n    is so narrow, she can't turn her head towards the entrance.\n    Once again, the roaches go skittering away.\n\n    And Amy starts heading \"back\" from where she entered. Her\n    head facing away from her progress backward, trying to\n    squeeze through.\n\n    She holds up the lighter, it lights the area \"ahead\" which\n    she cannot see. The flickering fire exposes the figure\n    awaiting her.\n\n    The walls on this side now also seem to narrow. The space\n    revealed by the light is barely as wide as her fist, and\n    there is only darkness beyond. Darkness, and the figure with\n    the knife. Amy senses something is wrong.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              What the ...\n\n    She continues, but now she can barely move a few feet before\n    the wall becomes too narrow to pass. She pushes, trying to\n    shove through the narrow gap. But she cannot move. The walls\n    have literally closed in, until she is now squeezed between\n    them. Panic sets in.\n\n    Gasping, Amy pushes against the wall she's facing. Trying\n    desperately to turn her head around. She forces with all her\n    might to turn her head, her facial features stretching almost\n    comically. She finally gets it around.\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                43\n</b>\n\n\n    She is face to face with the knife as it comes RIPPING\n    THROUGH FRAME, narrowly missing her arm.\n\n    Amy screams and drops the lighter. Now in darkness, she\n    scurries frantically away -- back deeper into the space.\n\n    Amy starts struggling, panic growing on her, trying to climb,\n    to crouch, to tug free in some direction, but her movement is\n    very limited. The walls seem to close in on her.\n\n    She is struggling to breathe against the pressing walls. The\n    figure keeps advancing towards her.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              Stop! Please stop! Stop this!\n\n    She's flailing her arms now, frantic. The knife-wielding\n    figure struggles, having difficulty as well. One of Amy's\n    hands flies back and hits the wall behind her.\n\n    Now she really panics, her hands desperately scraping along\n    the wall looking for anyway out. There isn't any.\n\n    She looks back toward her attacker, who's now right on top\n    of her and raising the knife for one final blow.\n\n    Amy braces for the blade's impact as she pushes against the\n    wall when suddenly she-\n\n    Falls backward onto the floor. Her heart pounding. Her\n    breathing heavy.\n\n    She checks her arms for wounds. There aren't any.\n\n    She looks up. The Figure is gone.\n\n    She stands, confused, and finds herself in an empty room.\n    Some discarded junk, a pile of loose plaster. She leaps\n    forward, and nearly trips on a piece of rubble to get the\n    hell away from the entry. Odd thing is...here is no entry.       \n    She whips herself around towards the sound of someone sharply\n    exhaling.\n\n    She looks this way and that, but can't see the source of the\n    sound. The attacker?\n\n    A pale light is visible, coming from around a far corner.\n\n    Someone steps into the light. A young BLACK KID. He holds a\n    finger up to his lips.\n<b>\n</b><b> \n</b>\n\n<b>                                44\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                        BLACK KID\n</b>              Shhhh... follow me.\n\n    He signals her to follow him. Amy moves cautiously forward.\n\n<b>    AN ADJOINING ROOM\n</b>\n    The walls have been partially torn down. The light comes from\n    an adjoining room. Amy approaches cautiously, remaining in\n    the shadows, and leans forward, staring through a gap in the\n    wall into the room beyond.\n\n    The various participants, some of whom we recognize from the\n    videotape movie, are standing crowded around something on the\n    floor. Amy can't see just what it is that they're staring at,\n    at first, but she does see that one of the ones gathered\n    there is Katya, complete with the hole in her head. She\n    nervously puts a a finger into the hole and inspects the\n    blood.\n\n    The sound of the exhalations is coming from the unseen place.\n\n    Then somebody in the circle moves, to get a better vantage\n    point, and now Amy can see, clearly, what is going on.\n\n    Winter is lying on top of the corpse of a YOUNG MAN,\n    breathing into his mouth as he did with Katya. An almost\n    sexual encounter yields the same results as the tape.\n\n    He takes a final deep breath. And then, as before, the Young\n    Man gasps. Winter pulls away. As he does, we can see the\n    Young Man's face, smiling, despite the knife that is lodged\n    into his chest. Winters grabs the knife and yanks it out.\n\n    The others come forward, helping him up.\n\n    Winter stands and somebody slips a robe over his body. He\n    promptly looks straight at Amy, still hidden in the shadows.\n\n<b>                         WINTER\n</b>              I have a room of my own. Kindly join me.\n\n    He throws the knife at the wall, where it embeds itself in\n    way further then it should have, and walks away. Amy moves\n    away from the opening. She circles around, through a doorway,\n    and into the space that she was previously watching.\n\n    She moves forward hesitantly, trying to avoid the touch of\n    the various occupants, who don't behave aggressively, but\n    clearly press forward, into her personal space.\n\n    She looks this way and that, trying to find where Winter has\n    gone.\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n\n\n<b>                               45\n</b>\n\n\n    A hand comes down on her shoulder. She turns suddenly. It's\n    the Black Kid. He gestures.\n\n<b>                        BLACK KID\n</b>              Winter's through there.\n\n    He points toward a doorway, lost in shadow. Amy notices on\n    his pointing hand that his wrists have been deeply slashed.\n    She looks down to the other hand, which the kid politely\n    offers for her to examine.\n\n     Amy backs away through the crowd. Following her is the\n    recently revived Young Man, who's still completely naked.\n    He smiles at Amy. She moves away, and through the door to\n    Winter's room.\n\n\n<b>    INT. WINTER'S ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n    This is a small, dark space, light coming mostly from a\n    rather conventional-looking standing lamp. In the shadows\n    beyond the little space of light is a confusion of half-open\n    doors, walls and shadows, half lit rooms with un-guessable\n    occupants.\n\n    Winter is there, sitting in a padded chair in front of a\n    coffee table, reading a book. Amy steps inside. Winter\n    doesn't react to her presence. Abruptly, the door closes\n    behind her. She hesitates and walks forward.\n\n<b>                           WINTER\n</b>              Amy Klein.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              You know me.\n\n<b>                        WINTER\n</b>              I chose you.\n\n    Amy pauses, unsure, then moves forward and takes a seat\n    opposite him.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              That was a hell of a way in.

The water\n    drips to the floor, commingling with the blood, turning it a\n    nasty pink.\n\n    She reaches behind her back, feeling again -- her hand comes\n    back as vividly red as before. Again she washes them. She\n    stops dead, seeing something in the mirror.\n\n    Something is glinting between her breasts. She touches her\n    finger to it. It looks like a tiny bit of gleaming metal,\n    poking out from inside of her, almost like a tiny steel\n    splinter. It appears to have just barely broken through the\n    skin from \"inside\" -- barely a drop of blood.\n\n    She stands staring down at it, breathing fast. What the hell\n    is it?\n\n    Then, slowly, almost against her will, she turns her back to\n    the mirror and looks over her shoulder. She sees -- and we\n    see for the first time -- the center of her back where her\n    questing hands couldn't reach.\n\n    There is a knife there, literally thrust through the middle\n    of her back. The gleaming splinter between her breasts is the\n    tip of the knife that has literally transfixed her -- and\n    clearly transfixed the center of her chest -- her heart.\n\n    She strains her hands back, trying to reach this impossible\n    thing, but her grasping fingers can't touch it. She turns\n    back toward the mirror, staring into her own eyes.\n\n<b>                         AMY\n</b>              It's not real... it's not real.\n\n    She clenches her eyes... opens them. Her fingers feel\n    desperately for the metal tip between her breasts. It's still\n    there.\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              Wake up... wake up... wake up...\n\n    She starts slapping her hands against the side of her face --\n    not gently, hard slaps. But she isn't \"waking up.\" She grabs\n    her hair, pulls hard. Nothing. She's still there. The knife\n    is still stuck, impossibly in her back.\n\n    She sits on the closed seat of the toilet... not knowing what\n    to do. She reaches again for the knife, but she can't touch\n    it. She buries her face in her bloody hands.\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n\n<b>                                56\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                          AMY\n</b>                I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming...\n                    (screams)\n<b>                I'M DREAMING!\n</b>\n    She stands, turns this way and that, not knowing what to do.\n    She looks around her bathroom, searching for something. She\n    tugs open the medicine cabinet, searches beneath the sink,\n    tugging the various stuff out. Whatever it is that she's\n    looking for, she can't find it.\n\n    She spins back to the mirror. Opens it. Slips back against it\n    wedging the knife handle between the door and the medicine\n    cabinet.\n\n    Holding one hand against the mirror, she starts to push away,\n    wincing in pain.\n\n    We can see the tiny silver tip between her breasts vanish\n    from view, drawn back inside her body . Slowly, making a\n    wet, sticky sound, the long thin knife begins to slide out.\n\n    With a gasp she heaves out... and the knife goes flying. It\n    bounces on the floor, splattering blood. With shaking hands,\n    Amy bends over and picks it up. She stands, staring at it.\n    It's some kind of nasty stiletto. Amy stands, staring at it.\n\n<b>    A FLASHBACK\n</b>\n    Amy searching Marla's drawers, tugging one open -- pressing\n    the stud on a stiletto. ON THIS STILETTO.\n\n\n<b>    INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n    She looks down toward the floor. She is literally standing in\n    a pool of her own blood. She gasps, turns back toward the\n    mirror.\n\n    Blood is pouring from the wound. Gasping, almost crying, Amy\n    stumbles back into the main room. With shaky hands, she picks\n    up the phone, then realizes that she's still holding the\n    stiletto in her hand. She drops it on the table. Her bloody\n    fingers press in the numbers -- 9-9-9 (emergency).\n\n    She waits, standing in the middle of her dark hotel room,\n    shaking, bloody. She can hear the phone ring and ring.\n\n    Finally, there's a click as the line picks up. But there's no\n    voice on the other end.\n\n<b>                          AMY\n</b>                Hello, hello? Hello? Is there anyb...\n<b>\n</b><b>                               57\n</b>\n\n\n    Then she stops dead. There is somebody there, and making a\n    sound we've heard before. The nasty gurgling that Amy heard\n    when she tried calling Marla's room.\n\n<b>                        MARLA\n</b>                  (through phone)\n              Only he can bring you back.\n\n    She slams the phone down, tears the cord from the wall. As\n    she turns to fling it she hears the sound of a man speaking.\n\n    She turns at the sound.\n\n    PINHEAD is standing across the room from her, reading from\n    one of the books on a tiny bookshelf in the corner.\n\n<b>                        PINHEAD\n</b>                  (reading)\n              \"--to all of us - there comes the closing\n              of the doors - the entrances - the exits -\n              so that one may pass no more out or\n              in...\"\n\n    He closes the book, turns toward her.\n\n<b>                        PINHEAD\n</b>              Walt Whitman.

It hits the far wall and\n    falls to the floor. Winter's gone. She reaches a hand behind\n    her, to her back, brings it back, red with blood.\n<b>\n</b><b>   \n</b>\n\n<b>                                59\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>    A MOMENT LATER\n</b>\n    We see Amy rolling a towel up into a tight cylinder. Hands\n    trembling, she lays it across a wide strip of duct tape that\n    she's unwound from a roll and laid down on the table, sticky\n    side up.\n\n     She presses the towel down so that it sticks, then picks up\n    the tape, with towel attached. She slides the towel down the\n    center of her back until it covers the wound, and then tugs\n    the tape tight across her chest, compressing the towel\n    against the wound.\n\n    She takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around the towel\n    and herself a couple more times, finally biting through the\n    tape and tossing the roll away. She yanks yesterday's clothes\n    up, discards the skirt in favor of a pair of black jeans.\n\n    She tugs them up over her bloody legs, pulls a black shirt on\n    over her top, thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy\n    shoes and finally tugs on a black leather jacket.\n\n    She goes to the mirror, turns, trying to see how her profile\n    looks with the towel stuffed in her back.\n\n    She turns, about to leave... then realizes that her hands are\n    red with her own blood. She hurries to the sink, rinses them\n    off, and rinses the blood off of her face and neck, then\n    grabs her bag and heads out the door.\n\n\n<b>    EXT. AMY'S HOTEL - NIGHT\n</b>\n    Amy comes unsteadily down out of her Hotel.\n\n\n<b>    EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\n    More shadows than light.\n\n    She comes around a corner and onto a narrow street, moving\n    fast, her feet making loud echoey clip-clops on the street.\n\n    There's a bum, dressed in rags, leaning up against the wall\n    of a building.\n\n    As she approaches him, he stirs slightly. Then she looks more\n    closely.\n\n    The man is eating something very crunchy. He stares at her\n    blankly as he picks crickets off the wall and devours them,\n    one by one. He offers her one, and smiles.\n<b>\n</b><b>  \n</b>\n\n\n<b>                                60\n</b>\n\n\n    Amy leaps back, turns and runs. Some distance down the\n    street, there seems to be a flicker of light, a trace of\n    noise.\n\n    She scrambles toward it. It's coming up from a subway grate.\n    She throws herself down on it.\n\n    Down below she can hear the roar of a subway train passing\n    below. Indirect, flickering light shines up from below.\n\n    She looks up. There's a subway entrance. She hurries toward\n    it.\n\n\n<b>    INT. TOKEN BOOTH - NIGHT\n</b>\n    Amy comes down the stairs. No sign of life. The fluorescent\n    lights flicker - some dead. Amy fumbles for her metro card.\n    This is one of those unattended entrances with entry through\n    the top-to-bottom turnstiles.\n\n    She starts through the turnstile. Then with a squeak, it\n    sticks and she finds herself stuck half-way through, unable\n    to move forward or backward. She tries to back out, but the\n    thing won't turn in that direction. She heaves forward. It\n    finally gives way. She looks this way and that, back through\n    the turnstile, she sees her bloody footprints leading all the\n    way through.\n\n    Amy hears footsteps echoing towards her. Through a large\n    mirror at an intersection, she sees the source of the\n    footsteps. A cop on the beat.\n\n    Amy looks down and sees she is standing in a pool of her own\n    blood. The footsteps get louder.\n\n    She sees a stack of newspapers next to her on a stand. She\n    grabs one and throws it down in front of herself to cover the\n    blood. It soaks threw in no time. The Cop is nearing the\n    corner. She grabs another, then another, and throws them\n    down. The pool of her blood leaks from under them all. The\n    cop rounds the corner, he has a baton he taps against his\n    leg.\n\n    Amy grabs the whole stand and tips it over. With a loud\n    SMASH, it spills the newspaper everywhere. As the cop walks\n    in front of Amy, the blood is hidden beneath the pile of\n    newspapers. Amy bends down to attend to the mess.\n\n    She makes eyes with the Cop and shrugs her shoulders at her\n    \"mistake\". The Cop smiles and nods, and keeps on walking.\n    The sound of his footsteps vanish down the corridors.\n<b>\n</b><b> \n</b>\n\n<b>                                61\n</b>\n\n\n    Amy collects herself with a few deep breaths, and moves on\n    towards the platform.\n\n\n<b>    INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT\n</b>\n    Amy stands on the platform as a train whooshes into the\n    station at HYPER-SPEED then stops instantly in front of her.\n\n    The doors hiss open and Amy is greeted by the tall Odd-\n    looking Conductor. She pushes past him.\n\n\n<b>    INT. TRAIN - NIGHT\n</b>\n    The train lurches forward as Amy makes her way through the\n    usual crowd of CELEBRANTS.\n\n    She finds Joey sitting court in the middle of the train car.\n    He's wearing a pair of terminator sunglasses.\n\n    Amy approaches. His face seems sickly pale in the flashing\n    light.\n\n    He moves abruptly, a slight turn of the head -- toward her.\n\n<b>                        JOEY\n</b>              Well look who's back. What now?\n\n<b>                        AMY\n</b>              I need... please... please help me.\n\n<b>                        JOEY\n</b>              Help you with what?\n\n    Amy hesitates an instant, then tugs open her shirt, revealing\n    the gaffer's tape that holds the rolled-up towel to her back.\n    She works at it. Finally, it tears. She tears it straight\n    down the front of her chest as Joey watches, passive.\n\n    Her chest is stained with blood. She licks her fingers and\n    wipes the blood away from the middle of her chest. Joey's\n    eyes narrow. He leans forward to study it. He leans in\n    closer, hesitates, then leans back, looking Amy in the eye.\n\n<b>                        JOEY\n</b>              Wow, are those real?  \n<b>                                 \n</b>    Amy doesn't react.\n<b>\n</b><b>                       \n</b>\n<b>                                62\n</b>\n\n\n<b>                        JOEY\n</b>              Okay, you're not in the mood for my light-\n              hearted banter.

Joey leans back from her.\n\n<b>                         JOEY\n</b>              Whoa. It's time to give in Amy, you're\n              just fighting it too hard.

She regains\n    her footage and turns back to Joey but in the flickering\n    fluorescent light, Joey's skin suddenly looks sickly pale.\n\n<b>                         AMY\n</b>              Joey?\n\n    He doesn't answer.

He makes a       \n    sound at Amy and his chords vibrate.                             \n    But there's this one COKE HEAD GUY who was snorting a line\n    when Amy got on the train.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                64\n</b>\n\n\n    He looks normal as he snorts up the last rail off his hand-\n    held mirror.\n\n    She studies him for a moment when suddenly he turns to her\n    and we get a good look at his FACE.\n\n    The entire left side of his face has rotted away and we can\n    see the powdery coke lining his decaying left nostril.\n\n<b>                        COKE-HEAD GUY\n</b>              Looks like the party's over.\n\n    Suddenly all she can her is the LOUD ROAR OF THE TRAIN.\n\n    Amy stumbles back, turns to run into the next train car and\n    smacks right into-\n\n    MARLA CHEN.
