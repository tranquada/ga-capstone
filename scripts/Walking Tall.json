Chris \n               grabs the pole and they both fall. Chris has hurt his leg. Chris \n               stumbles off into the woods. Jay grabs an axe and goes after \n               him, he swings the axe but misses and they both fall down a large \n               earthy embankment. At the bottom they come to their senses and \n               begin fighting again, Jay with his axe and Chris with a log he's \n               ripped off a tree. Chris knocks Jay out by hitting him hard in \n               the legs.\n \n                                     CHRIS\n                         You're right Jay, this does change our \n                         relationship.
