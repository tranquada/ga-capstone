SUNNYVALE - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT - 2002\n\n               EVAN, 20, good-looking but with dark haunted eyes, frantically \n               hides himself in an unlit Doctor's office. His face and chest \n               are covered in blood. He holds his forehead in pain.\n\n               FLASHLIGHT BEAMS stab through the darkened corridor hunting \n               for him. ALARMS SOUND. GUARDS are heard shouting to each \n               other. Evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctor's \n               desk.

Finish this up for me.\n\n               Evan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb \n               back together.\n\n               Andrea, meanwhile, strips off her coveralls, revealing a \n               spotless nurse's uniform underneath.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         All the dads are gonna be there.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not \n                         so bad, am I?\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         No.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         Good. Because I've been waiting to \n                         see your art projects all week and \n                         I'd feel terrible if all you thought \n                         about was your father not being there.\n\n               Evan, disappointed, passes the wrench back to Andrea.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (beat)\n                         Done. Try it.\n\n               Andrea gets behind the wheel. She turns the ignition and the \n               engine roars to life. Evan wears a proud smile.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         You're amazing, kiddo.\n\n               EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING - 1989\n\n               Andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main \n               doors. Evan's already got the car door open and his foot on \n               the ground by the time the car skids to a halt. Andrea checks \n               her watch.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         Okay have a great day I love you \n                         I'll pick you up later gotta go...\n\n               Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. \n               As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window.\n\n                                     MRS. BOSWELL\n                         Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with \n                         you!\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         I'm sorry, but can it wait til \n                         tonight? I'm already late for work --\n\n               Mrs. Boswell's morbid expression stops Andrea.\n\n                                     MRS. BOSWELL\n                         I think you really need to see this.\n\n               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n               The classroom is filled with screaming, running children. \n               Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately \n               calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a \n               whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid.\n\n                                     MRS. BOSWELL\n                         TOMMY! LEAVE LENNY ALONE! DON'T MAKE \n                         ME SEND YOU TO MR. VOYTEK'S OFFICE!\n\n               Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, \n               but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, \n               sweet-looking girl.\n\n               Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk.\n\n                                     MRS. BOSWELL\n                         I was going to show this to the \n                         principal, but I wanted to talk to \n                         you first.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         What is it?\n\n                                     MRS. BOSWELL\n                         Yesterday I had all the children \n                         draw pictures of what they wanted to \n                         be when they grew up. Most of them \n                         made drawings of what their parents \n                         did, but this...\n\n               Mrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls \n               out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         I don't understand... Evan did this?\n\n               The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while \n               standing on a heap of dead bodies. It's extremely \n               sophisticated for a seven-year old. Some of the corpses have \n               been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically \n               correct.\n\n               Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, \n               and struggles to control her concern.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         Thank you for showing it to me first. \n                         I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I \n                         have the picture?\n\n                                     MRS. BOSWELL\n                         Of course. There is one more thing, \n                         Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for \n                         mentioning it...\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         What?\n\n                                     MRS. BOSWELL\n                         When I asked Evan about his drawing, \n                         well, he didn't remember doing it.\n\n               Andrea is visibly shaken now.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         I have to go.\n\n               EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER\n\n               Andrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot \n               even start the car.\n\n               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER\n\n               The children hang artwork on the walls in prep for Parent's \n               Night. Each child has a picture of his or her family made \n               from colored construction paper and macaroni. Evan's picture \n               (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, Crockett and \n               himself on a green hill. Tommy and Kayleigh's pictures each \n               show two kids and a single father. And their 'mother' is \n               stuck to the far end of page.\n\n               Lenny beams as he pins-up his picture of an ideal nuclear \n               family. He looks at Tommy's picture and is confused.\n\n                                     LENNY\n                         You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. \n                         Boswell has macaroni and glue if you \n                         wanna fix it.  \n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         You're such a retard!\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         Mommy lives far away but she comes \n                         and visits.\n\n                                     LENNY\n                              (to Tommy)\n                         If I'm retarded, why didn't my mommy \n                         move away from me?\n\n               Tommy gets upset. He swipes his hand down Lenny's picture \n               and his macaroni \"mother\" crumbles to the floor. Lenny begins \n               to cry.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Hey, what'd you do that for?\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         Fat little baby, crying for mommy.\n\n               Evan takes the ruined picture and leans down next to Lenny.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Come on, Lenny. It's not that bad. \n                         You can still see your mom a little.\n\n               Lenny, unable to stop crying, begins hyperventilating out of \n               control. His desperate gasps for breath are frightening.\n\n               Evan, scared, looks around for Mrs. Boswell, but cannot find \n               her. He reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his \n               own macaroni \"mother\" apart and places it over Lenny's \n               picture. It's a nuclear family again.

LOBBY - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Evan follows her to a small alcove.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         I'm sorry Kayleigh.

What you \n                         deserve is a better brother and \n                         father. All they do is make you feel \n                         like shit.\n\n               She looks into his eyes.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         You really have no clue how beautiful \n                         you are, do you?\n\n               She searches his eyes for sincerity. And finds it. They lean \n               into each other for a TENDER KISS. After a moment, a ROAR \n               from nearby.\n\n                                     TOMMY (O.S.)\n                         What the fuck are you doing??\n\n               They jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring \n               at them from across a small crowd. By now, some teens chuckle \n               at Tommy.\n\n                                     TEEN PUNK (O.S.)\n                         Buying popcorn, what the fuck are \n                         you doing?\n\n               Tommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan. His hands in \n               fists. Suddenly a FOOT reaches out and trips Tommy. Tommy \n               falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him.\n\n               Tommy slowly gets up, locks eyes with Evan. Hatred oozing.\n\n               Evan looks guilty, weakly shaking his head, it's not what \n               you're thinking.\n\n               Tommy suddenly lunges at the TEEN PUNK who must be at least \n               a foot taller than he is. Tommy lands a flurry of punches \n               before the Teen Punk can even defend himself, frequently \n               taking opportunities to eyeball Evan.\n\n               Evan, Kayleigh and even the punk's FRIENDS look on helplessly \n               when TWO SECURITY GUARDS SEIZE TOMMY. Tommy valiantly \n               struggles against them at first. But the moment he realizes \n               it's hopeless, he allows his body to go slack.\n\n               As Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan, a sick \n               smile on his face.  Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless.\n\n               INT.

Oh my god, she \n               knows.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                              (faking poorly)\n                         What do you mean?\n\n               Andrea pulls the car over and stops.

Tommy moves to the fire, Crockett \n               squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid.\n\n               Evan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart \n               from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped \n               in the tied gunny sack.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Kayleigh!

Evan reaches behind his seat \n               and opens a large cardboard box. It is filled with past \n               journals. He finds the most recent journal, uncaps a pen and \n               writes something.\n\n               Finished he presses the journal to the window.\n\n               EVAN'S DIARY\n\n               \"I'll come back for you.\"\n\n               Evan waves back to her, trying nonchalantly to wipe away his \n               own tears as she fades into the distance.\n\n               When Kayleigh disappears from sight, Andrea looks over to \n               see what he's written.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         I'm sorry.\n\n               Evan returns the journal and begins writing furiously.\n\n                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT.

He closes the Blue Book with a cocky grin just as \n               PROFESSOR CARTER, 40, calls out to the class:\n\n                                     PROFESSOR CARTER\n                         Time!

EVAN'S DORM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Evan's dorm is cluttered \"double\" whose walls are adorned \n               with head-shop posters of Gothic rock bands.\n\n               By Evan's bed is a bookshelf filled with books on amnesia, \n               memory loss, fugues, hypnotism and other related bands.\n\n               Evan's roommate, THUMPER, 19, is a completely punked out \n               Gothic boy who weighs 300 pounds. He currently hands a black \n               lacy dress to CRICKET, 17, a pierced Goth co-ed. She slips \n               the tattered dress on as Thumper wipes his post-coital self \n               off with a black tee-shirt.\n\n               Evan barges through the door, throwing his pscyh books on \n               the bed and politely looking away from the half-naked girl.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Whoa. Smells like patchouli and... \n                         ass.\n\n               Evan opens the window and checks out his Psych project: a \n               small maze has several flatworms at one end and a bowl of \n               cornflakes at the other.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         Cricket, meet my well-mannered \n                         roommate, Evan.\n\n               Cricket puts on her Doc Martens as Evan watches the worms.\n\n                                     CRICKET\n                         Yeah, you're the one who fucked up \n                         the bell-curve on my Anthropology \n                         final.

Found your T-shirt.\n\n               Evan nods thanks, picks up his journal. Reads something and \n               smiles.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking \n                         me out for my birthday.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         I thought you were a December baby.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         This is bigger. Seven years to the \n                         day.

DIRTY HANK'S BAR - DAY\n\n               INT. DIRTY HANK'S BAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n               A popular watering hole. A dark rustic interior, blasting \n               alternative rock.\n\n               Plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their \n               tables.\n\n               Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women. HEIDI, \n               beautiful, wears ripped jeans, no make up. She sinks the \n               eleven ball off the rail. KRISTEN coolly smokes a cigarette, \n               confident that she and Heidi will hold the table.\n\n                                     KRISTEN\n                         So... which one of you has a pet \n                         worm?\n\n               Thumper proudly steps forward.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         Worms, plural.\n\n                                     KRISTEN\n                         That's so gross.\n\n               Thumper steps back, points to Evan.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         Talk to him about it, he's got the \n                         fetish.\n\n               Heidi sinks another ball and looks up at Evan strangely.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Actually, they're for a psych project. \n                         A study on memory.\n\n               Heidi misses her shot and passes the cue to Evan.\n\n                                     HEIDI\n                              (stifling a yawn)\n                         Shit, better explain before all the \n                         excitement gives me a heart attack.\n\n               Evan speaks as he knocks the one-ball in the corner pocket. \n               As he talks, at a table behind them, some obnoxious Greeks, \n               including HUNTER, SPENCER, and GWEN make fun of Thumper.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         It's an experiment with flatworms \n                         and a maze. You take a flatworm and \n                         run it through the maze until he's \n                         memorized it. Then you put a new \n                         flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. \n                         Banging into walls, getting lost, \n                         whatever.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                              (thoughtfully)\n                         Like Ozzy.\n\n               Gwen giggles as Spencer throws popcorn at Thumper's head.\n\n                                     SPENCER\n                         Ten bucks says he eats it off the \n                         floor.\n\n               Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the \n               three-ball in the side.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         You chop up the smart flatworm and \n                         feed it to the dumb one and presto, \n                         the dumb one suddenly knows the maze \n                         inside and out.\n\n               Evan walks past Heidi, putting his hand on her shoulder to \n               squeeze by. The hand lingers longer than necessary and Heidi \n               doesn't mind. He sinks another ball.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Just by absorbing the first worm \n                         into its cellular structure, it gets \n                         all of the worm's memories.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                              (thoughtfully)\n                         That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's \n                         so smart.\n\n               A handful of popcorn hits Thumper's face. They all try to \n               ignore Hunter and Spencer's jeers.\n\n                                     HEIDI\n                         So what's the point?\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (setting up the eight)\n                         Maybe if I can figure out how the \n                         memories of a simple worm function, \n                         it'll help me understand the \n                         complexities of the human brain.\n\n               Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket. Although \n               his hand clenches on the cue. He meekly shuffles away to the \n               opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks.\n\n                                     HEIDI\n                              (intrigued)\n                         So are you planning on becoming a \n                         doctor or something?\n\n               Thumper casually takes the pool cue from Evan.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         No, I just don't want to lose my \n                         mind.\n\n               As Heidi digests this, Thumper carefully lines up his shot... \n               The eight ball.\n\n               CRASH!!! The cue ball intentionally jumps the table, rocketing \n               into the pitcher of beer on the Greek's table. They're all \n               soaked with beer and debris.\n\n               Just as they begin to rise, Thumper smashes the cue stick on \n               the table, WHISTLING innocently (while now brandishing a \n               spear). They sit the fuck down.\n\n               Kristin, impressed, casually wraps her arm around Thumper's \n               waist. He smiles coolly, it's nothing.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (to Heidi)\n                         I think that's your game.\n\n               INT.

He flips it open to \n               a random place and takes the beer from her hand.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (re: her beer)\n                         For courage.\n\n               Evan takes and finishes her beer and begins reading. As he \n               reads, he seems more and more on the verge of passing out.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         It's like my mind refused to believe \n                         what it was seeing. Hearing Crockett \n                         make those awful screams... Just \n                         writing about it gives me the shivers.\n\n               Color drains from Evan's face as he realizes what he's \n               reading. He looks over at Heidi, who kisses him.\n\n                                     HEIDI\n                         Come on, go on...\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         It was like Tommy was possessed or \n                         something.

His voice becomes distant and \n               SOUNDS ECHO around him like distant memories resurrecting \n               themselves...\n\n               FLASH!\n\n                                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY - 1995\n\n               Evan is THIRTEEN again. The scene begins exactly where Evan's \n               blackout occurred as a child. Tommy has just knocked Kayleigh \n               unconscious with a wooden plank, Lenny is frozen at the sight \n               of Crockett in the fluid-soaked gunny sack. And Evan, seething \n               with rage, stands up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy \n               at full speed.\n\n               Evan looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         What the hell is going on?\n\n               Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and \n               swings the plank, hitting Evan's head. Evan is sent sprawling \n               backwards, his forehead bleeding freely.\n\n               Tommy knocks Evan hard in the ribs with his boots. Evan \n               writhes in agony, his face against the ground. Lenny moves \n               toward the gunny sack, lifts it and tugs desperately on the \n               rope that traps Crockett inside.\n\n                                     LENNY\n                         I can't undo the rope!\n\n               Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         Drop it or I'll slit your mother's \n                         throat in her sleep.\n\n               As if on cue, Lenny does exactly as he's told. His eyes begin \n               to glaze over.\n\n               Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of \n               strength, grabs Tommy's foot and holds on.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         I got him, Lenny. Help Crockett!\n\n               Lenny remains frozen in place. Tommy yanks his leg back, \n               breaking Evan's grip.\n\n               Evan groans on the ground in a writhing heap.\n\n               Tommy's voice hitches. His eyes water from pent up \n               frustration.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         Listen to me good, Evan.

Very \n               little has changed in the past seven years.\n\n               INT. LENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               ANGLE ON LENNY\n\n               Now 20, making a model airplane.

Hundreds of them.\n\n               A KNOCK on Lenny's bedroom door. Mrs. Kagan, grayer, fatter, \n               opens the door and escorts Evan inside. She glares at Evan \n               while pretending to be cheerful.\n\n                                     MRS.

Squadrons of hanging \n               planes crash to the floor. Lenny digs his fingers into Evan's \n               shoulder.\n\n                                     LENNY\n                         Make one peep and I swear it'll be \n                         your last, motherfucker.\n\n               Evan is terrified. Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins \n               working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away. \n               Evan is speechless.\n\n               The door bursts open. Mrs. Kagan looks at the smashed model \n               airplanes by Evan's feet. Evan ignores her accusing stare.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Well, thanks for seeing me, man.

EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT\n\n               Evan pulls a dozen journals from beneath his bed and begins \n               pouring over them.\n\n               Nearby, Thumper empties a can of hairspray into his Mohawk.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         You really think he wanted to kill \n                         you?\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         All I know is that I might be able \n                         to unblock some of my repressed \n                         memories.\n\n               He finds something he's looking for, marks the page with a \n               yellow post-it note marked, BLACKOUT and sets the book in a \n               separate pile.\n\n               As he sets the next journal on the bed, it automatically \n               opens up to a place where the spine was bent. Staring up at \n               him is the message:\n\n               EVAN'S DIARY\n\n               \"I will come back for you.\"\n\n               Evan looks overcome by guilt.\n\n               Later that evening:\n\n               INT.

HALPERN, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of \n               the car and walks to the mailbox.\n\n               Across the street, Tommy digs his fingers into the nerves of \n               Lenny's shoulder.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         Make one peep and I swear it'll be \n                         your last, motherfucker.\n\n               Tommy's words make Evan flinch. From inside the car, a BABY \n               begins to cry. Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car.\n\n               Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in \n               pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the \n               lit cigarette to the ground. He pulls up his shirt revealing \n               a fresh BURN MARK on his stomach.\n\n                                     MRS. HALPERN\n                         How's my sweet girl?

Evan and Tommy double back and grab him. They try to \n               make him break out into a run, but Lenny's feet drag limply \n               against the ground. Both Tommy and Evan grab an arm and begin \n               to run with Lenny through the woods.\n\n               FLASH!\n\n                                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n\n               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT\n\n               Evan comes to. Lurches his body over the bed and vomits.\n\n               Sounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room. Looking sick \n               and pale, he lifts his shirt to see a NEW SCAR from the \n               cigarette burn.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         What the hell?\n\n               In the next bed, Thumper's head, wrapped in a blanket, pops \n               up from above a NAKED GESELA'S waist.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         Christ, man. You wanna clean that up \n                         before I lose my appetite here?\n\n               Evan sits upright in bed and begins writing in the margins \n               of the journal.\n\n               INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY\n\n               The lobby is decorated with colorful streamers, balloons, \n               posters and banners announcing PARENTS' WEEKEND.\n\n               Carefree STUDENTS and their parents carry shopping bags toward \n               the bustling elevators. Evan leans against the side of a pay \n               phone, holding his ear to drawn out the noise.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Yes, hello, uh, Mrs. Kagan, this is \n                         Evan Treborn.\n                              (rolling eyes)\n                         I know.

As she signs for the bill, \n               she leans over and kisses Evan on the cheek.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Please, mom.

He got straight A's without \n                         ever touching a book. That was the \n                         one area where his memory never failed \n                         him.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Ma?

He said he figured \n                         out a trick to remember the past.\n\n               Evan tries not to react.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         I couldn't tell if they were real \n                         memories or just phantoms. You know, \n                         he might only have thought he actually \n                         remembered them...\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Sure...\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         And then, just before it got so bad \n                         that he had to be committed, he said \n                         that he could...\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         What?

He was far \n                         too sick by then.\n\n               Evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface.\n\n               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT\n\n               Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room \n               looking for a certain book. Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly \n               watches Evan with growing concern.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (reading aloud)\n                         I never wanted to be in the movie \n                         anyway and it was cold so I wanted \n                         to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller \n                         took his shirt off --\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         What the fuck are you doing?\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Shhh! I need quiet for this.\n\n               Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         Are you stupid or what?\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         What?\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a \n                         reason why you've repressed the one \n                         day when some old lecher had you in \n                         your tighty whities, dammit!\n\n               Thumper begins scanning the journal entry. A bitter laugh.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         Yeah, man. I'd think twice about \n                         this. You could wake up a lot more \n                         fucked up than you are now.\n\n               He hands the journal back to Evan. Evan opens it and begins \n               reading it silently.\n\n               His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in \n               defeat.\n\n               INT. EVAN'S CAR - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY\n\n               Evan, looking haggard and frail, wipes the greasy hair from \n               his eyes and punches the accelerator. His teeth are clenched \n               and he hammers his fist on the dashboard.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - EVENING\n\n               Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. He eyes a \n               piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out.\n\n               INT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - CONTINUOUS\n\n               A run-down greasy spoon. Filled with a number of TOWNIES and \n               TRUCKERS. The place is stale with cigarette smoke and appears \n               decorated in grime motif.\n\n               Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of \n               the kitchen with a tray full of food.\n\n               Kayleigh, now twenty, looks pale and sickly thin. She bangs \n               her hip on the swinging door and an order of food crashes to \n               the floor. Her BOSS stares back in aggravation.\n\n                                     BOSS\n                         Can we get through one goddamned day \n                         without you breaking something?\n\n               Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up \n               the order. She is humiliated and Evan leans back against a \n               pay phone so that she can't see him watching her.\n\n               As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a CUSTOMER pinches \n               her ass. Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. \n               She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the \n               customer. Evan backs out uncomfortably.\n\n               EXT. RIDGEWOOD DINER - NIGHT\n\n               Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she \n               exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first, \n               but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her \n               face and she allows herself to be hugged.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         God, Evan!

He \n               steps closer to Kayleigh and softly strokes her face. She \n               flinches at first, but remains in the same spot.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Whatever happened, it wasn't our \n                         fault. You know we couldn't have \n                         stopped it.\n\n               Kayleigh begins to tremble. Tears flow.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Look, Kayleigh. This may sound like \n                         bullshit coming from a guy who hasn't \n                         spoken to you in seven years...\n\n               She moves her face away from his hand.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         But you were seven years old and \n                         there's nothing you could've done to \n                         deserve...\n\n               Her face collapses and she turns away.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                              (defeated)\n                         Just shut up, Evan.

You want me to cry on \n                         your shoulder and tell you that \n                         everything's all better now? Well \n                         fuck you, Evan!

Nothing ever gets \n                         better!\n\n               Kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         If I was so wonderful, Evan, why \n                         didn't you ever call me? Why'd you \n                         leave me here to rot?!\n\n               She turns and runs away. Evan looks sick with guilt.\n\n               EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - QUAD - DAY - 2002\n\n               A few GREEKS play frisbee and talk trash. Evan, tired and \n               depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn \n               scar on his belly. Contemplating...\n\n               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT\n\n               Evan enters his dorm. He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's \n               bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong. He chokes out a \n               message.\n\n                                     THUMPER\n                         Some dude left a message for you.\n\n               Evan puts a towel under the door.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         You can smell it all the way in the \n                         bathroom.\n\n               Evan hits \"play\" on the answering machine.\n\n                                     ANSWERING MACHINE\n                              (male voice)\n                         Hi, Evan, this is Professor Carter. \n                         Just wondered why you didn't hand in \n                         your essay this afternoon. I was a \n                         bit concerned. Call me to schedule a \n                         make-up.\n\n               BEEP. Thumper offers Evan a magnified frown of disapproval.\n\n                                     ANSWERING MACHINE\n                              (male voice)\n                         What did you say to my sister \n                         motherfucker?!

Reacting quickly, he grabs a towel from under the door \n               and wipes off Evan's comforter.\n\n                                     ANSWERING MACHINE\n                              (Tommy; cont'd)\n                         She... she fucking killed herself \n                         tonight.

CEMETERY - DAY\n\n               Evan, dressed in black, gets out of his car at the edge of \n               the cemetery. A small cluster of friends and family gather \n               at the grave. Evan grabs a bouquet of roses and begins walking \n               to the grave. When he suddenly spots Mr. Miller and Tommy.  \n               Evan's hands tense up into fists. He becomes weak in the \n               knees and stops walking. After an uncomfortable moment of \n               standing still, he retreats to his car and watches the \n               ceremony from the driver's seat.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY\n\n               The last of the mourners are filing away. Evan exits his car \n               and walks to the deserted grave. He drops the roses on the \n               casket and turns to make sure nobody is watching.\n\n               Evan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sheet of paper. \n               He unfolds it and leaves it on her gravesite:\n\n               EVAN'S DIARY\n\n               \"I'll come back for you.\"\n\n               INT. EVAN'S DORM - NIGHT\n\n               He makes a weighty decision and gets up. He hastily hunts \n               through his journals, looking for a certain book.\n\n               Evan opens his journal marked \"Age 7\". He plops on his bed \n               and starts writing sideways in the margins.\n\n                                     EVAN (V.O.)\n                         It's been said that a person's life \n                         is little more than the sum of his \n                         experiences. If that's true, then \n                         I'm not sure I know who I am anymore.\n                              (beat)\n                         I definitely never knew Kayleigh.\n\n               He turns the page and begins reading the journal. As he mouths \n               the entry to himself, the resonance of an older man's voice \n               seems to REVERBERATE throughout the room and the WORLD behind \n               his head FAINTLY VIBRATES.\n\n               FLASH!\n\n                                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Mr. \n               Miller takes a quick peek at him.\n\n                                     MR. MILLER\n                         I've got an idea. Let's go downstairs, \n                         it'll look more like a dungeon down \n                         there.\n\n               INT. MILLER'S BASEMENT - DAY - 1989\n\n               Mr. Miller puts the camera on a tripod in the basement. \n               Kayleigh and Evan sit on folding chairs in front of the \n               camera. Tommy stands at the top of the basement stairs, \n               looking down.\n\n                                     MR.

MILLER\n                         You're gonna see my fist in about \n                         two seconds unless you do what I \n                         tell you.\n\n               Tommy sulks and closes the door. Mr. Miller lowers his voice \n               and speaks to Evan and Kayleigh.\n\n                                     MR. MILLER\n                         Now in this part of the story, Robin \n                         Hood just married Maid Marian and \n                         they have to kiss and stuff like \n                         grown-ups do.\n\n               Kayleigh giggles and covers her mouth with her hand. Evan \n               looks skeptical.\n\n                                     MR. MILLER\n                         So take your clothes off Kayleigh.\n\n               Kayleigh stops giggling. Evan says nothing.\n\n                                     MR. MILLER\n                         Come on, like when you take a bath. \n                         Don't make a deal out of it. You \n                         too, Evan.\n\n               Mr. Miller gets behind the lens. The room is dead silent.\n\n                                     MR.

He walks behind Kayleigh \n               and cups his hands tightly around her ears. She can't hear \n               anything now.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         What time is it?\n\n                                     MR.

This is the \n                         very moment of your reckoning. In \n                         the next thirty seconds you're going \n                         to open one of two doors.

FRAT HOUSE - ROOF - CONTINUOUS\n\n               The wooden door to the rooftop swings open, revealing Kayleigh \n               and Evan. Kayleigh is dazzled by what she sees:\n\n               The entire roof is decorated with fairy-lights, Chinese \n               lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles. And elegant \n               romantic table for two awaits them, flanked by twelve FORMALLY \n               DRESSED SERVANTS (previously seen pledges) who respectfully \n               stare ahead with the utmost class.\n\n               Two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by. \n               Kayleigh applauds and laughs with delight.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         I don't know what to say.

Sit down.\n\n               As she takes a step toward the table -- FLOWER PETALS shower \n               down on her. She looks up to see TWO MORE PLEDGES standing \n               on ladders, delicately tossing pedals.\n\n               Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         Why are you doing all this for me?\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Simple math. When I woke up this \n                         morning and saw your smile... I knew \n                         that I wanted to spend the rest of \n                         my life with you.\n\n               Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely. Her eyes \n               tell him she feels the same way. A magical moment.\n\n               And they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it \n               might as well be their first ever --\n\n               Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time.\n\n                                     HUNTER\n                         We been lookin' all over for you, \n                         man.\n\n                                     SENIOR BROTHER\n                         Someone trashed your car.\n\n               The moment's gone. Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks.\n\n               EXT. FRAT HOUSE - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked \n               at the bottom of the hill. His face collapses.\n\n               Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass. \n               The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been \n               mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the \n               roof.\n\n               The most unnerving thing, however, is a SPIKED LEATHER DOG \n               COLLAR hangs off the rearview mirror.\n\n               By now a crowd has gathered. Evan runs up to people.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (panicked)\n                         Did you see who did this?

He's probably watching.\n\n               INT. FRAT HOUSE - EVAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Evan leads Kayleigh into his bedroom and shuts the door. \n               Evan can't help but look under the bed. No one. He then locks \n               the door, reaches into his desk and finds a tiny canister of \n               Pepper Spray.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         It's my fault.

He \n                         wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying \n                         to scare you away from me.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (shaking the cannister)\n                         Yeah, right.

COLLEGE QUAD - NIGHT\n\n               Kayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus. \n               Evan seems especially paranoid.

I don't want \n                         anything to happen to us.\n\n               The guy along the path gags loudly into the bushes. Kayleigh \n               and Evan instinctively avert their eyes. Suddenly, Kayleigh's \n               ears perk and she stops walking mid-stride.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         Wait. Something's not right.

He has long, greasy \n               hair and some tattoos. He holds a TIRE THUMPER (a short, \n               steel bat for truckers) menacingly in his right hand.\n\n               Evan stands frozen in fear, his hands rooted in his coat \n               pockets.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Leave us alone you sick fuck!\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         Get this \"us\" shit. As if I was gonna \n                         lay a hand on my own sister. You've \n                         done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice \n                         friends, nice life, not to mention \n                         you're fucking my sister.

I believe you just said \n                         \"sick fuck.\"\n\n               Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in \n               the shoulder and ribs.\n\n               Evan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, \n               Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face.\n\n               Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free \n               hand. Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, \n               keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray. \n               Kayleigh screams. Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly \n               swinging the tire thumper. Evan charges forward in an \n               uncontrollable rage, rips the weapon out of Tommy's hands \n               and sprays a lethal dose of pepper spray into Tommy's open \n               mouth.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         He's a fucking maniac!\n\n               Evan knocks Tommy down with the tire thumper. Kayleigh screams \n               and tries to hold Evan back, but he easily wrestles free of \n               her. She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         He ruined Lenny's life --\n\n               Evan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs. Kayleigh pushes a button \n               on the \"Blue Light\" lamp post and an ALARM WAILS.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         He killed Crockett --\n                              (kicks him)\n                         Murdered that woman and her baby!\n                              (kicks again)\n                         And he's trying to kill me, Kayleigh! \n                         He's trying to fucking kill me!\n\n               Evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings \n               down OFF CAMERA.\n\n               CRUNCH!\n\n               Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified. \n               Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother. And stops \n               cold when she sees the damage to Tommy.\n\n               Evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards, still \n               terrified by his rage, and skitters away from him in a \n               crablike fashion.\n\n               SIRENS come racing to the quad. Evan looks away from Tommy's \n               limp body.\n\n               Collapses to the ground and begins to weep.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY\n\n               A SECURITY VEHICLE pulls through the ominous metal gates of \n               the large state prison. The vehicle stops and Evan, along \n               with nine other convicts, exit in leg and hand restraints.\n\n               INT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY\n\n               Evan, now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform, enters \n               the General Population area of the prison. PRISONERS begin \n               screaming vicious taunts and catcalls at the fresh batch of \n               new inmates. Evan tries to keep composed and walks toward \n               his cell. Evan looks up to see one of the men leaning over \n               the second tier, KARL, a huge muscular con with tattoos of \n               swastikas and other Nazi symbols on his arm, blows a kiss at \n               Evan and winks.\n\n               INT. EVAN'S CELL - DAY\n\n               Evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of Jesus \n               Christ and various Saints. Burning flames on open cans of \n               shoe polish serve as candles to the large shrine.\n\n               There is a stained bare mattress on the top bunk. Sitting on \n               the bottom bunk is CARLOS, 30s, a massive Hispanic convict \n               covered with faded Indian ink jail tats of Christ in agony.\n\n               Carlos stares at Evan disinterestedly as Evan makes up his \n               bed on the top bunk.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         First time?\n\n               Evan nods glumly.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's \n                         luggage that way.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (desperate)\n                         Can you protect me?\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Jesus himself couldn't make me take \n                         on the Brotherhood. When they come, \n                         just put your mind in another place, \n                         man. Be somewhere else.\n\n               A BUZZER SOUNDS. Carlos leaves the cell without another word.\n\n               INT. PRISON CAFETERIA - EVENING\n\n               Evan sets his tray down at a table filled with Carlos and \n               some other INMATES. No sooner has he sat down to eat, do \n               eager forks reach onto his tray and steal his food. Carlos \n               shrugs at Evan and offers him a roll.\n\n               INT. MAVIS VISITING CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               Andrea sits across from Evan in the visitor's chamber. Her \n               hair is now bottle-blonde. Four inches of Plexiglas separate \n               the two and they talk on monitored phones. Andrea, frazzled, \n               twirls an unlit cigarette.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         ...I spoke to your new lawyer about \n                         the appeal.

She all right?\n\n               Andrea's look tells him to look for hope elsewhere.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         What about my journals, Mom? Did you \n                         bring the ones I asked for?\n\n               Andrea nods, holding up two comp books. \"AGE 7\" and \"AGE \n               13\".\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         I found these.

I told you I need them \n                         all!\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I \n                         think it's far more important to \n                         focus on your case right now.\n\n               Evan looks as if he's about to disagree with her, but he \n               closes his mouth and placates her.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Sure, Mom. You're right. Just try to \n                         tell Kayleigh I'm sorry.\n\n               And officer signals Evan and points to his watch.\n\n                                     ANDREA\n                         I'm not gonna lose you, kiddo. Promise \n                         me you'll hang on, Ev.\n\n               They look at each other and Evan slowly lowers the phone. He \n               hangs up, Andrea still pressing her phone to her ear.\n\n               INT. MAVIS PENITENTIARY - DAY\n\n               Evan walks closely behind Carlos through a corridor, clutching \n               his journals. As he passes Karl, the Neo-Nazi, Karl reaches \n               over and firmly grabs Evan's crotch.\n\n               Evan, totally violated, turns white with rage.\n\n                                     KARL\n                         Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.\n\n               Evan stands there, stunned, unable to react when --\n\n               Another Neo-Nazi, RICK, swats Evan's journals out of his \n               hands and onto the floor. Life springs back into Evan as he \n               rushes for the journals. He and Rick grab the journals at \n               the same time. A minor tug of war.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Let go! They're mine!\n\n               Rick tears them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn \n               pages. Evan sees the damage and goes mental.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Motherfucker!\n\n               Evan swings at Rick and misses. INMATES CHEER! It's on! Rick \n               lunges for Evan, a brief and painful scuffle ensues, the \n               journals getting trampled. Suddenly -- The sounds of COCKED \n               RIFLES echo through the air. The fight stops instantly as \n               Rick and Evan look up to see --\n\n               ANGLE ON\n\n               OFFICER STATION. Officers aim rifles at the pair. From an \n               upper tier, even more officers with more rifles.\n\n               Their barrels sight directly at Evan. Rick steps away, quick \n               to maliciously scoop up Evan's torn journals.\n\n                                     KARL\n                         We'll be comin' for you tonight, \n                         sister.\n\n               Evan catches his breath, then looks at the remaining few \n               pages on the floor.\n\n               INT. EVAN'S CELL - DAY\n\n               Evan enters the cell with a few entry pages. He looks through \n               them. Nothing there.\n\n               Evan nods depressed, then sees the page from his \"Age 7\" \n               journal, grabs Carlos' duct tape and tapes the page over his \n               bed.\n\n               INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n               Evan, walking toward some White Supremacists, flinches \n               whenever the occasional INMATE brushes against him. Evan is \n               completely paranoid, waiting for an inevitable attack. Karl \n               makes himself visible among them, holding a journal. He reads:\n\n                                     KARL\n                              (from Evan's journal)\n                         Today I found my grandfather's death \n                         certificate. He died in a nut house, \n                         just like my father. Mom denies it, \n                         but she thinks I'm gonna end up the \n                         same way...\n\n               The other Supremacists start laughing and calling \"looney\" \n               and \"nut job.\" Evan rushes past them and they make chicken \n               clucks at him.\n\n               EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY\n\n               Evan and Carlos sit on BLEACHERS that overlook the other \n               prisoners working out.\n\n               Evan closely watches Karl and Rick who stare daggers at him \n               from across the yard. A SKINHEAD PASSES SOMETHING with a \n               white-taped handle to Karl but no officers seem to notice.\n\n               Evan slides closer to Carlos and stares at the Jesus Christ \n               tattoos all over Carlos' back.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         You're religious Carlos, you believe \n                         that bit about \"the Lord works in \n                         mysterious ways?\"\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Straight up.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Because I think he sent me to your \n                         cell on purpose.

FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM - DAY - 1989\n\n               Evan, seven, COMES TO in an old familiar place. WE are back \n               in Mrs. Boswell's first grade class. All of the children \n               draw colorful pictures. Evan sees some paper spindles sitting \n               on Mrs. Boswell's desk. As he heads over to them, Mrs. Boswell \n               firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own \n               desk.\n\n                                     MRS. BOSWELL\n                         No monkey business, Evan. Sit still \n                         and finish your drawing.\n\n               Evan, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper. He \n               smiles mischievously, and grabs some colored pencils.\n\n                                     MRS. BOSWELL\n                         That's great everyone! Just imagine \n                         anything you want to be. There are \n                         no limits.\n\n               Soon enough, an image emerges: Evan holding a knife, stands \n               over a heap of several dead inmates Karl and Rick.\n\n               When done, he sneaks over to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where the \n               two paper spindles sit. The metal needles reach up and skewer \n               a number of paper notes and messages.\n\n               Evan looks over to see Mrs. Boswell holding up his drawing, \n               horrified.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (musically)\n                         Oh, Mrs. Boswelllllllll?\n\n               She looks over in time to see Evan using all of his seven-\n               year old strength to WHIP his hands down toward the spindles!\n\n               The moment before his palms reach them there's a brief instant \n               where SOUNDSCAPES COLLIDE and the world behind him VIBRATES.\n\n                                                         AND WE'RE BACK TO:\n\n               INT. EVAN'S PRISON CELL - DAY - 2002\n\n               Evan comes to as ECHOES OF SCREAMING CHILDREN FADE. Alertness \n               slowly creeps back up on him as he hears:\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Oh sweet Jesus. It's true.

KARL'S CELL - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Karl and Rick wait expectantly as Evan nervously enters. \n               They say nothing, relishing the fearful silence.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Look.

You gotta \n                         join a gang or else end up dead meat.\n\n               They continue to stare.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Well it sure ain't gonna fucking be \n                         with no niggers or spics.

Evan looks \n               miserable, about to do the deed when -- CARLOS bulldozes \n               past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall \n               and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch!\n\n               Rick instantly charges Carlos, but trips on the pants around \n               his ankles. Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's \n               face before snatching his journals from Karl's shelf.\n\n               Evan frantically flips through them, hunting for something, \n               as the other WHITE SUPREMACISTS charge the cell.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Carlos!\n\n               Carlos drops Karl's writhing body to the floor and presses \n               his girth against the cell door.\n\n               Evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as \n               the other supremacists force the door open -- Evan focuses \n               on the words. Chanting quickly.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         We took the woods behind the junkyard \n                         just to make sure we wouldn't bump \n                         into Tommy. We hadn't seen the smoke \n                         yet.\n\n               WORDS from the entry begin to SHIMMER. REVERBERANT SOUNDS OF \n               BARKING break the sound barrier and the image of Aryans \n               storming the cell behind him become a FRENETIC BLUR\n\n                                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. JUNKYARD WOODS - DAY - 1995\n\n               Evan, thirteen again, comes to in the woods. Evan stumbles \n               at first, then rights himself. He seems strangely exhilarated. \n               A sinister victory smile.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Rot in hell you fucking animals.\n\n               Kayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take. \n               Evan shrugs \"just kidding\" and looks around, getting his \n               bearings. He whips his hand out and stops them.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Wait. Before we --\n\n               He suddenly notices Kayleigh who now no longer looks an \n               awkward and unkempt tomboy, but rather a vibrant and feminine \n               young girl. Whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering \n               before, she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles.  \n               Evan remembers his mission and darts over to a JUNK PILE.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         We need something to cut open the \n                         sack!\n\n               Kayleigh and Lenny stare at him, concerned for his sanity.\n\n               Evan roots through the trash until he finds something: a \n               razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long. Evan offers \n               it to Lenny.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         I want you to take this, Lenny. \n                         Today's your day of atonement.

If you've ever trusted me \n                         before, trust me on this one.\n\n               Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Cut the rope.\n\n               Lenny slowly follows Evan as he bolts away.\n\n               EXT. JUNKYARD - LATER\n\n               Evan groans on the ground, writhing. Tommy's voice hitches, \n               eyes watering from pent up frustration.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         Listen to me good, Evan...\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         I'll do whatever you want. You don't \n                         want me to ever see Kayleigh again, \n                         fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, \n                         you kill him now and they'll stick \n                         you in juvy for sure. And I know \n                         you'd never leave your sister alone \n                         with your father.\n\n               Evan's words hit home and Tommy's anger slowly dissipates. A \n               look of understanding passes between them. Gratitude, even.\n\n               Tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it. Lenny comes \n               screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell!

Garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off \n               the sides of the house. Inside, Mr. Miller yells at someone.\n\n                                     MR.

SEEDY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Evan steps over some passed out bodies that litter the hallway \n               of an incredibly seedy motel. The kind with hourly rates. He \n               knocks on a door.\n\n               Kayleigh, now haggard, strung-out junkie, opens the door and \n               immediately the contempt for Evan grows in her eyes.

So you...\n\n               Evan reaches for his wallet and throws it on her dresser. \n               Kayleigh eyes the wallet. But makes no move to pick it up.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         Well, I guess I can spare ten minutes \n                         for an old friend, right?\n\n               Tears fall freely from Evan's eyes.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         So how's tricks?

Something catches the corner of Evan's \n               eyes and he turns to examine it.\n\n               To the left of Thumper's Buddha statuette sits a large VOTIVE \n               CANDLE that bears a portrait of Jesus Christ.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (humble)\n                         Lord give me the strength and guidance \n                         I need to set things right.\n\n               As he begins reading a passage to himself, SOUNDS ECHO \n               backward at us from another time and place. And the entire \n               ROOM SHIMMERS around him --\n\n                                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. MRS. HALPERN'S HOUSE - DAY - 1995\n\n               Evan comes to as he, Kayleigh, Lenny and Tommy -- all thirteen -- \n               watch Mrs. Halpern carry her baby back to the mailbox across \n               the street with intense anticipation. Evan suddenly comes to \n               life and makes himself visible, running across the street \n               shouting.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Lady, stay back! Don't go near the \n                         mailbox!\n\n               Mrs. Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically \n               as she absently continues toward the mailbox.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!\n\n               Lenny comes running across the street to Evan's aid, and \n               Tommy shrugs and follows after him.\n\n                                     LENNY\n                         There's a bomb in the mailbox. Get \n                         away!\n\n               Tommy, still running, cringes to hear Lenny's stupid \n               confession and rolls his eyes at the situation. Evan positions \n               himself between Mrs. Halpern and the mailbox, frantically \n               waving his hand at her to stay back, because she's STILL \n               COMING.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         I'll save you lady!\n\n               Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs. Halpern, perhaps a bit \n               too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, \n               but no major injuries.\n\n               Seeing things are safe, Evan backs away from the mail --\n\n               BOOM!\n\n               The blast is deafening! Evan's body is hurled backwards \n               dramatically.\n\n               FLASH!\n\n                                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n\n               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002\n\n               Evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the \n               wall, the sheets are the same. Even the familiar sounds of \n               Thumper having sex under the covers.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         I thought I told you two to beat it.\n\n               Evan's face falls as he hears a familiar voice, but not \n               Thumper's.\n\n                                     LENNY\n                         What? Hey, sorry, man. We wake you \n                         up?\n\n               Evan is confused by Lenny's presence, but smiles to himself \n               and shakes his head \"no\".\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         No, it's cool.\n                              (re: Lenny's okay)\n                         Really cool.\n\n               Evan yawns, bringing his hand to his mouth, but there's no \n               hand. No arm, really, either. Just two FLESHY STUMPS!\n\n               Evan bolts upright in bed and stares down at his amputations.\n\n               A FLOOD OF MEMORIES ASSAULT HIM:\n\n               We see countless and brief image flashes of Evan growing up \n               from the age of thirteen with NO ARMS, and requiring a \n               WHEELCHAIR.\n\n               INT. MULTIPLEX THEATER LOBBY - DAY - 1995\n\n               Tommy and Kayleigh load popcorn and drinks onto Evan's lap \n               as Lenny pushes the wheelchair.\n\n               INT. ANDREA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - 1995\n\n               Evan celebrates his 14th birthday and blows out the candles. \n               Andrea, Kayleigh, Tommy and Lenny all clap.\n\n               EXT. CHURCH - DAY - 1995\n\n               Tommy pushes Evan to church.\n\n               INT. EVAN'S DORM - DAY - 2002\n\n               Evan screams as blood pours from his nose. Lenny is out of \n               bed at once to help him... as is KAYLEIGH! (Now beautiful \n               and natural looking).\n\n               QUICK SERIES OF FLASHES:\n\n               EXT.

HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - 1999\n\n               Evan looks on longingly as Lenny and Kayleigh become lovers \n               in high school.\n\n               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT - 1999\n\n               A campfire. Evan sips from a BEER CAP as Lenny and Kayleigh \n               make out in plain sight with Tommy's bashful approval.\n\n               BACK TO EVAN:\n\n               INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY - 2002\n\n               Evan's in agony as Kayleigh opens a series of dorm doors and \n               Lenny rushes Evan's wheelchair through. Kayleigh carries a \n               pair of prosthetic arms in her hands.\n\n               Evan moans and tries to rub his temple with his stump.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Where are we going?\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         We have to get you to Sunnyvale. \n                         You're having one of your famous \n                         hemorrhages.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Stop!

Your \n                         mother would kill me.\n\n               Evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of \n               the wheelchair. Lenny must halt in order not to crush Evan. \n               As Evan writhes about on the floor, his legs paralyzed, a \n               CROWD GATHERS.\n\n               Evan focuses on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd \n               that titters and snickers in the background.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Take me back, Lenny!\n                              (teeth clenched)\n                         You owe me that much.\n\n               Kayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         What are you geeks looking at? Must \n                         be nice to be so goddamned perfect, \n                         huh? Fucking losers.\n\n               The crowd breaks up and leaves.\n\n               EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY\n\n               It's calm now. Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair \n               around the quad. Evan now wears prosthetic arms. Random PEOPLE \n               call out to Lenny. He's extremely popular in this world.\n\n                                     LENNY\n                         'Sup, Sheila!

Think I \n                         like getting up for \"eight thirty's\"?\n\n               Lenny pushes Evan past Thumper and Cricket. Their conversation \n               stops and they stare at their feet as Evan gets wheeled by. \n               Evan boils to be treated as if he were non-existent.\n\n                                     LENNY\n                         Hey, there's Tommy.\n\n               Evan spins around in fear. He sees Tommy, clean-cut, and \n               handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads \"Campus \n               Crusade for Christ.\" Tommy seems good-natured now, working \n               hard and soliciting names for his list. He looks up as Evan \n               rolls along and his eyes brighten to see Evan.\n\n                                     TOMMY\n                         I did what you said, man!

What's the point of Psych \n                         now? Tomorrow I could wake up as \n                         some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.\n\n               Another exchanged glance. Kayleigh looks at Evan.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         Let's go for a stroll.\n\n               Evan allows Kayleigh to roll him away from the others. To \n               the very spot where Evan once killed Tommy.\n\n               Evan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can \"magically\" \n               will to open, close, open, close...\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         So Tommy's really into this Jesus \n                         kick, huh?\n\n               Kayleigh looks at him curiously.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         You know how spiritual he's gotten \n                         ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and \n                         Katie.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the \n                         twisted fuck.\n\n               Kayleigh, now by a bench. Stops and sits. As she casually \n               uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a \n               granola bar and hands it to him.\n\n               His prosthetic hand crushes it. It crumbles to dust. She \n               seems more confused.\n\n                                     KAYLEIGH\n                         Is something the matter?\n\n                                     EVAN\n                              (re: prosthetic arms)\n                         Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed \n                         or something.\n\n               She leans into him, gently feeding him her remaining bar.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Kayleigh?

And there it ends.\n\n               She looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically. \n               Tears streak down Evan's face as he speaks in a pleading \n               tone.\n\n                                     EVAN\n                         Would it make any difference if I \n                         told you that no one could possibly \n                         love anyone as much as I love you?\n\n               Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up. Evan \n               turns to see Lenny waving her over. She puts her hand on \n               Evan's shoulder, stands and goes to Lenny.\n\n               Evan can't take his eyes off her.\n\n               ANGLE ON\n\n               Lenny kissing Kayleigh.

Beside the tub, the wheelchair has been tipped over.\n\n               The water rises past his mouth, to his nostrils -- Evan makes \n               his peace and takes a final breath.\n\n               And the water spills over the side of the tub. All Evan can \n               do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose.\n\n               A beat. Then the door opens.\n\n               TOMMY ENTERS.

And that's really all that \n                         matters now.\n\n               Tommy feels Evan's anguish and plops his ass on the wet floor \n               by the tub. He lays his head onto Evan's shoulder.\n\n               Evan bristles at first, but finally gives in to his hatred, \n               ultimately resting his own head against Tommy's.
