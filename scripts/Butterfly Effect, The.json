He's unexpectedly \n               gently prodded forward by Andrea.\n\n<b>                                     ANDREA\n</b>                         Go on, Evan. Introduce yourself.\n\n               Evan slowly approaches Kayleigh, only five. She smiles \n               bashfully at him. An old memory comes back to him.\n\n<b>                                     KAYLEIGH (V.O.)\n</b>                         When my folks split, they gave me \n                         and Tommy a choice who we wanted to \n                         live with. I couldn't stand my dad, \n                         but I knew if I lived with my mom, \n                         I'd never see you again...\n\n               Evan slowly looks around the yard, taking in the reality of \n               this distant memory.\n\n               He even inhales the aroma of the place. Savoring the moment. \n               He locks eyes with Kayleigh.\n\n<b>                                     ANDREA (O.S.)\n</b>                         He's not usually this shy.\n\n               It's time. Evan leans over to Kayleigh as if he's about to \n               kiss her. Then whispers in her ear:\n\n<b>                                     EVAN\n</b>                         I hate you.

Bursting into tears and runs \n               into Kayleigh's mother's arms.\n\n<b>                                     KAYLEIGH'S MOTHER\n</b>                         What did you say to her? What \n                         happened?!\n\n               Evan ignores them.

He grabs a pillow and covers \n               his head with it as a flood of memories seizes him.\n\n               Lenny (looking fit) grabs a towel from atop an award-winning \n               flatworms project and hands it to Evan.\n\n<b>                                     LENNY (O.S.)\n</b>                         You alright? Should I call the doctor?\n\n               Evan groans and shakes his head \"no\". He rides out the pain \n               like a seasoned pro.\n\n               When it finally subsides, he lowers the pillow and smiles \n               feebly.\n\n<b>                                     EVAN\n</b>                         I'll think I'll be alright this time.\n                              (a new hope)\n                         I really do.\n\n               Lenny nods, still concerned.\n\n<b>               INT.

They silently dump tons of journals into the fire. \n               Evan steps outside and returns with a box of home movies, \n               photo albums, old report cards, etc. In they go.\n\n<b>               CLOSE ON\n</b>\n               Burning journals.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

See ya soon.\n\n               As he clicks off, an attractive woman wearing a power suit \n               approaches from the other direction. Evan has to look closely, \n               but it's Kayleigh. A mature woman, now.\n\n               He stumbles slightly, caught off guard. As she passes, her \n               eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary, but there's \n               no recognition. Evan watches her continue past him and down \n               the sidewalk.\n\n               After a hesitant beat, he takes a breath, turns around and \n               follows her.\n\n<b>               FADE TO BLACK.\n</b>\n               Roll credits...\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Butterfly Effect, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=J.
