He told me there\n                      is a signal. It is \"Cut the tall trees.\"                       \n                      When they hear the signal, the militia                         \n                      are to go to war.\n          \n                                  FEDENS\n                      Please, let us take Tatiana with us.

Barely a car on the road.\n          Shadows dart past faint house lights. The windscreen clouds. Paul\n          switches on his wipers. A Toyota truck, loaded with Militia, appears\n          from the mist, speeds past. Paul switches the preset buttons on the\n          radio as he drives. He can only find fevered drum-based MUSIC.\n          \n          \n          \n                                                                             31.\n          \n          \n          EXT. PAUL'S STREET. NIGHT\n          \n          Paul turns onto his street. The houses are dark: windows shuttered;\n          gates closed; not a soul about. Paul stops before his gate. HONKS\n          twice. The gate doesn't open. He hops out and opens it with a key.\n          Gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car. He hears the\n          far off sound of gunfire. Distant explosions light the night sky.\n          \n          \n          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT\n          \n          Paul drives in. His compound is curiously dark.     His headlights sweep\n          across his pitch-black house.\n          \n                                                                         UT TO:\n          \n          The gates swing shut. We PULL BACK as Paul turns and faces his house.\n          Paul whistles for the dog, nothing. He goes back to the car, gets a\n          flashlight, heads for the front door.\n          \n          \n          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          The door slowly opens. Paul steps in quietly, tries the light switch,\n          nothing. He listens. The only sounds are distant explosions and\n          gunfire. The beam of his flashlight cuts the blackness, illuminating:\n          magazines arranged on a coffee table; an empty chair; children's toys\n          in a basket.\n          \n          \n          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT\n          \n          Paul continues his search. Scans the counter. There's food on the\n          stove. The table is set. He hears a GROWL, quickly cut short, from one\n          of the bedrooms.\n          \n          \n          INT. PAUL'S HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          Paul shines the light into a room. Looks for a second, then closes the\n          door, and walks to the next. He stops and listens with his ear to the\n          door. Nothing. He pushes it in.\n          \n          \n          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          Paul's light sweeps across the room and illuminates:\n          \n          Eyes - terrified eyes, a room full of faces, staring back.\n          \n          THEIR POV: A dark figure behind a blinding light.\n          \n          The dog breaks free, runs to Paul.\n          \n          \n          \n          \n                                                                           32.\n          \n                                  PAUL\n                      Pealiss!\n          \n          From among the faces, Tatiana's voice heavy with relief.\n          \n                                  TATIANA\n                      Paul!\n          \n          Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded\n          into this small room.
