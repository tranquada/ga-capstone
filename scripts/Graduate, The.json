As he starts to turn\n\tback, he looks up at Elaine's portrait.  There is a\n\tmovement reflected in the glass of the portrait.  He\n\tturns quickly.  Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the\n\tdoor to the bedroom behind her.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tOh God.\n\n\tShe smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEN\n\t\tLet me out.\n\n\tShe turns the lock on the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.
