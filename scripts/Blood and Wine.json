I'm ready to listen.\r\n          He sits down beside a pole and looks over at Gabriella,\r\n          who has put on a hat. She's staring out to sea.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JASON\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         (TO GABRIELLA)\r\n</b>          Alex wants to make me an offer.\r\n          She gives no sign of having heard him.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALEX\r\n</b>          We're giving you a hard choice,\r\n          Gabby.

The line\r\n          reels out very, very fast. He lets the fish run with it.\r\n          Gabriella has turned around to watch. Now Jason reels in\r\n          a little, making the line taut, testing the weight.\r\n          He yanks back. The line rises from the ocean, bringing to\r\n          the surface a big, dark green fish. _\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALEX\r\n</b>          Jesus! What the hell is that?\r\n\r\n<b>                         JASON\r\n</b>          Hammerhead. Young. Male.\r\n          Jason plays the shark until it's close to the boat and\r\n          thrashing for its life. Gabriella's scared.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GABRIELLA\r\n</b>          Help him, Alex.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALEX\r\n</b>          I'd just get in his way.\r\n          His hand comes to rest on her shoulder as Jason expertly\r\n          reels in the bucking hammerhead. She shrugs away from his\r\n          hand. Jason has hooked a ten-foot, three-finned sea beast\r\n          with a spade-shaped head and black eyes on each side. He\r\n          attaches the line to a winch and winds it up onto the\r\n          deck. It twists wildly, knocking things over until it\r\n          slows down and finally lies very still. His chest heaving\r\n          with the effort, Jason looks around. Alex has disappeared\r\n          without either of them noticing.\r\n\r\n<b>          216 INT.

His gun materializes in his hand.\r\n          Jason retreats a step.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JASON\r\n</b>          Is this your backup plan?\r\n\r\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          116.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         216\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         216 CONTINUED:\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         ALEX\r\n</b>          No.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JASON\r\n</b>          You want it so bad, it's yours.\r\n          He pulls out the necklace and hurls it away from Alex.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALEX\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         (MOANING)\r\n</b>          You little prick.\r\n\r\n<b>                         217\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          217 INT./EXT.

The shark's body stops it from\r\n          dropping out the open gate in the transom.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALEX\r\n</b>          scrambles toward the necklace.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GABRIELLA\r\n</b>          Don't let him have it!

Alex turns his head, puzzled,\r\n          warned. Too late. The shark suddenly thrashes, its jaws\r\n          snapping around him. Gabriella screams with Alex. He\r\n          FIRES his GUN over and over until it's empty. The shark\r\n          continues to tear at him.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALEX\r\n</b>          Help me, help.mel!\r\n          Gabriella runs down into the cabin. Much as he hates\r\n          Alex, Jason can't let him die. like this. He charges.\r\n          forward and straddles the shark, jams the blade of his\r\n          knife into the primordial brain. He twists the handle\r\n          once. The shark dies instantly. Trembling with\r\n          adrenalin, Jason gets off its back. With his elbows Alex\r\n          drags himself out of the jaws. He's badly mangled.. The\r\n          shark slowly changes color to a dull brown.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALEX\r\n</b>          You knew it wasn't dead.\r\n          Jason squats down beside him to access his injuries.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JASON\r\n</b>          Mom didn't take the necklace.\r\n          did.\r\n\r\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          117.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         217 CONTINUED: 217\r\n</b>          Alex struggles to stay conscious.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALEX\r\n</b>          Then you killed her yourself.\r\n          Jason slowly nods.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JASON\r\n</b>          And you were in the car behind us.\r\n          Gabriella drops down beside them. She has a flare gun, no\r\n          longer needed, and sheets from the cabin to stop the\r\n          bleeding. She starts to tear them up. She's crying\r\n          slightly.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GABRIELLA\r\n</b>          We were supposed to turn him ini I\r\n          didn't think you were going to kill\r\n          him!\r\n\r\n<b>                         JASON\r\n</b>          Well, I didn't.\r\n          Alex manages to laugh.\r\n\r\n<b>                         ALEX\r\n</b>          Jesus.

She smears away the tears so she\r\n          can see and leaves blood tracked across her face. She\r\n          looks down to see his bloody hand clutching the necklace.\r\n          They look at each other.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JASON\r\n</b>          has the microphone in his hand. He's setting course.\r\n          Gabriella appears behind him. She's holding the flare\r\n          gun. She puts it back where she found it, and steps\r\n          beside him and puts her arm around his waist. He lays his\r\n          arm over her shoulders and holds her close while he uses\r\n          the radio.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JASON\r\n</b>          This is Hercules II, calling the\r\n          Harbormaster...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          218 EXT.

Henry and Jason carry Alex off\r\n          the boat and lay him on the planks. SIRENS can be faintly\r\n          heard. Jason leaps back on the boat.

Alex rolls onto his belly and starts\r\n          dragging himself down the dock, too much of an optimist to\r\n          give up hope in a hopeless situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Blood-and-Wine.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Blood and Wine</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Nick Villiers\" title=\"Scripts by Nick Villiers\">Nick Villiers</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Blood and Wine Script.html#comments\" title=\"Blood and Wine comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:00:45.667474"}
