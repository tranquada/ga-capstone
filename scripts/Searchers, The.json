PLAINS COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - MOVING JUST ABOVE GROUND \n               LEVEL - A STUDY OF HOOFPRINTS - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their \n               way through scrubby desert growth. An occasional tumbleweed \n               drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints; \n               and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing \n               them. The CAMERA FOLLOWING the hoofprints\n\n               RAISES SLOWLY TO:\n\n               EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               We see the rider now. BACK TO CAMERA, jogging slowly along -- \n               heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house \n               with its outlying barn and corrals.\n\n               EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - MED. SHOT - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The CAMERA FRAMES and MOVES with the lone horseman. He is \n               ETHAN EDWARDS, a man as hard as the country he is crossing.\n\n               Ethan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard.\n\n               Dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his \n               clothing. He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one \n               pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows.\n\n               His trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down \n               the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the \n               Yankee cavalry. His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries \n               a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho...\n\n               Rider and horse have come a long way. The CAMERA HOLDS and \n               PANS the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto \n               his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk \n               sash wrapped around it... Horse and rider pass, moving closer \n               to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing \n               around the corner of the house.\n\n               EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. SHOT - DEBBIE - \n               LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               She is staring wide-eyed at the distant horseman o.s.\n\n               Her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly.\n\n               DEBBIE quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the \n               neck, crouching over him. Debbie is 11 years old with a \n               piquant, memorable face.\n\n               EXT. THE YARD - CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE\n\n               Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her \n               face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again \n               five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps \n               the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of \n               scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger.\n\n               EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. SHOT - AARON - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and \n               cross-timbered roof, deep windows. A small gallery or porch \n               extends across the front. AARON EDWARDS comes through the \n               door, attracted by the dog's barking -- and then he, too, \n               sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious \n               but not at all apprehensive. Aaron is a lean, weathered and \n               tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man \n               than Ethan and possibly a few years older.\n\n               As he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, \n               LUCY, comes out to stand behind him. Lucy is from 16 to 18 -- \n               a pleasant, feminine girl. She is carrying a mixing bowl \n               with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely \n               forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger.\n\n               In the next instant MARTHA EDWARDS follows the daughter onto \n               the porch. Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years \n               have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work \n               has worn and coarsened her hands. Those hands will never be \n               idle when Martha is on scene... And now, while she shares \n               the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she \n               automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and \n               she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter.\n\n               EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Along the side of the house comes BEN EDWARDS, 14, with a \n               man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. He, \n               too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. So much \n               so that he trips, but recovers his footing. He pauses to \n               dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always \n               riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward \n               the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. Beyond Ben, \n               MARTIN PAULEY emerges from the barn and crosses the open \n               ground heading toward CAMERA. Martin is somewhat under 20, a \n               lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight \n               hair and a white man's eyes. He is carrying bridle or other \n               horse-gear. He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if \n               they recognize the stranger -- then out again. He continues, \n               followed by Ben, toward where\n\n               Debbie crouches over her dog.\n\n               EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LONG SHOT - ETHAN - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               As he rides downslope toward the house.\n\n               THE CREDITS END.\n\n               EXT. THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA, LUCY, AND \n               AARON - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Suddenly, Martha's eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron -- \n               recognizes the distant rider. Her hand goes to her mouth to \n               check the name that trembles on her lips... An instant later \n               Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman.\n\n                                     AARON\n                              (incredulous)\n                         Ethan?\n\n               He looks at her, frowning, then slowly steps out onto the \n               hard ground. Martha hands the bowl back to Lucy and follows \n               Aaron.\n\n               EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP\n\n               as Ethan rides in and sits his horse, looking down at them.  \n               There is a noticeable constraint on all of them. Finally:\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Hello, Aaron...\n\n               His eyes shift to Martha and hold. Ethan is, and always has \n               been, in love with his brother's wife and she with him.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Martha...\n\n                                     MARTHA\n                              (a bit shakily)\n                         Hello, Ethan.\n\n               Ethan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle. Aaron and \n               Martha exchange quick glances... troubled, puzzled. Aaron \n               pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse \n               toward their side.\n\n                                     AARON\n                         How's California?\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         How should I know?\n\n                                     AARON\n                         But Mose Harper said...\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         That old goat still creakin' \n                         around?... Whyn't someone bury him?\n\n               He goes to his saddle pack, begins unlacing it. Ben and Debbie \n               have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious.\n\n               Debbie's dog begins sniffing at his heels. Ethan looks down \n               at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Ben, ain't you?\n\n               Ben nods.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (frowning at Debbie)\n                         Lucy, you ain't much bigger than \n                         when I saw you last.\n\n                                     DEBBIE\n                         I'm Deborah!\n                              (pointing)\n                         She's Lucy.\n\n               Ethan looks in the direction of the pointing finger.\n\n               EXT. YARD - ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               as Lucy steps down from the porch and approaches.\n\n                                     MARTHA\n                         Lucy's going on seventeen now...\n\n                                     BEN\n                         An' she's got a beau!

Martin watches \n               with a touch of resentment: Ethan doesn't trust him.\n\n               Ethan turns and sees the look. He doesn't care what Martin \n               thinks, nor does he explain.

THE EDWARDS HOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA\n\n               She stands alone, looking after Ethan -- his coat in her \n               arms.

EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT\n\n               The family is finishing dinner -- and the scene is not quite, \n               but almost, a still-life. Loud in the room is the pendulum \n               tick of a Seth-Thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace -- \n               in which logs are burning briskly. Ben crouches near the \n               fireplace, fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre \n               Ethan has brought home from the wars.\n\n               He tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard.\n\n               Aaron sits at one end of the hand-hewn table, Martha at the \n               other. At her right is Ethan, his fork scraping the last \n               crumb off his plate. Lucy sits at her father's right and \n               Martin at his left. Next to Martin is Debbie. In the center \n               of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal. \n               Lucy and Martin have finished eating. Aaron is sipping his \n               coffee, and Martha -- her own plate largely untasted -- is \n               watching Ethan.\n\n               Ethan has shaved, changed his shirt. He straightens \n               contentedly and every eye is on him, expectantly.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Good.\n\n               The clock rattles alarmingly -- the usual preliminary to its \n               striking; and then it bangs out the strokes like a fire-alarm \n               gong.

Debbie is at his side.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         How about this?\n\n               It is a gold medal or medallion -- something appropriate to \n               Maximilian of Mexico -- suspended by a long multi-colored \n               satin ribbon.\n\n                                     DEBBIE\n                         Oh! LOOK! My gold locket!\n\n               She holds it high for mother -- and all -- to see. Martha \n               takes it and reacts at its weight.\n\n                                     MARTHA\n                         It's solid gold...

Just something I \n                         picked up in Mexico.\n\n               Martha reluctantly surrenders it to Debbie's eager hand.\n\n               Aaron hasn't missed the word \"Mexico\" and looks sharply at \n               Ethan.\n\n                                     DEBBIE\n                         Oh, thank you, Uncle Ethan...\n\n                                     LUCY\n                              (to Debbie)\n                         Come along...\n\n               The two girls leave the main room. Martha and Aaron both \n               look at Ethan -- half expecting some further explanation.\n\n               He turns from them and looks into the fire. Martha begins to \n               clear the table. Aaron gets up, takes a pipe and a spill -- \n               lights it at the fire.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Passed the Todd place comin' in...\n                         What happened to 'em?\n\n                                     AARON\n                         They gave up... went back to the \n                         cotton rows...

She \n                         wouldn't let a man quit.\n\n               Ethan turns and looks at her -- still busy with her dishes.\n\n                                     AARON\n                              (change of tone)\n                         Ethan, I could see it in you before \n                         the war...\n                              (Ethan looks at him)\n                         You wanted to clear out!\n\n               Martha freezes in what she's doing -- listening.\n\n                                     AARON\n                         And you stayed out beyond all need \n                         to... WHY?\n\n               Ethan can't answer, but he takes it as a challenge and almost \n               welcomes it.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (hard)\n                         You askin' me to clear out now?\n\n                                     AARON\n                              (straightening -- \n                              with grave dignity)\n                         You're my brother...

Ethan crosses to his pack, \n               reaches into it for a leather pouch, brings it back and tosses \n               it onto the table. It lands with a resonant clink.\n\n               Both Martha and Aaron draw close to the table.\n\n               (NOTE TO WINTON HOCH: This scene should be dramatically back-\n               lighted.)\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         There's sixty double eagles in \n                         there... twelve-hundred dollars.\n\n               He opens a waistline shirt button and hauls out a leather \n               money belt and drops that on the table.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         An' twice that in here.\n\n               He reaches into the belt and takes out a few mint-fresh gold \n               pieces which he slides across the table.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         ...only these got the late Emperor \n                         Maximilian's picture on 'em.\n\n               Martha picks up one of the gold pieces, staring at the face \n               on the coin: the same as that on the medal -- staring sharply \n               then at Ethan. Aaron is examining another coin with a \n               different interest.\n\n                                     AARON\n                         Mint fresh... not a mark on 'em.\n\n               He glances questioningly at Ethan.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         So?\n\n               Aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. He raises the \n               seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing \n               and then raises a false-bottom lid and drops pouch and money \n               belt into it. Carefully he replaces everything. During this \n               Ethan's attention has gone to Martha's hand, to one cut \n               finger, its wound barely healed. He takes the hand -- gently.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Cut yourself?\n\n               She nods and withdraws the hand.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (softly)\n                         You were always hurting about your \n                         hands.\n\n               She looks quickly at him and self-consciously tries to hide \n               her hands, conscious of their work-worn appearance.\n\n               Then for a moment their eyes meet and hold -- and a world of \n               sadness and hopelessness is in the look.\n\n               Aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair.\n\n                                     AARON\n                         Time for bed...\n\n               He picks up one of the lamps and starts away toward their \n               bedroom door. Martha looks at Ethan again. His expression is \n               bitter.\n\n                                     AARON\n                         Night, Ethan... Come 'long, Martha.\n\n               She turns obediently and follows Aaron. Ethan looks after \n               them and waits as Aaron opens the bedroom door. Martha goes \n               into it and Aaron follows and closes the door.\n\n               Ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel, blows it out.\n\n               Only the firelight strikes his face as he stares broodingly \n               at the closed bedroom door.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               EXT.

He is a minister of the \n               Gospel with a .44 on his hip.\n\n               LARS JORGENSEN, the Edwards' neighbor, is a harried little \n               man, Scandinavian. As we shall find out soon, he has a brisk \n               and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children.\n\n               BRAD JORGENSEN is one of these: sandy-haired, brash, amiable, \n               impulsive. He is in his early twenties.\n\n               CHARLIE MacCORRY, slightly older than Brad, is Sergeant of \n               Company A of the Rangers. (He is also Company A.) Charlie is \n               a taciturn, gently-spoken, competent man, clearly patterned \n               by his association with Captain, the Rev. Sam.\n\n               MOSE HARPER is an old scout -- a walking bone-rack, yet \n               capable of tireless feats of endurance. Some think him \n               \"tetched\" yet he has managed to endure to his age during a \n               time and in a region where few men lived to see their \n               grandchildren. He wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather, \n               a narrow-brimmed hat with a feather in its band.\n\n               ED NESBY is a rancher and homesteader in his mid-thirties; \n               resolute, honest, self-effacing; nothing picturesque or \n               dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist.\n\n               16-A\n\n               INT.

We hear the heavy foot- \n               falls of the approaching men, then a loud knock thrice \n               repeated -- an ominous sound.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               17-A\n\n               INT.

We hear Aaron coming at a \n               run, breathing hard. Ben takes a step as though to go to \n               him, but Martha's hand at once is on his shoulder. Aaron \n               gains the porch.\n\n                                     AARON\n                         In the house, boy... and...\n\n               He puts finger to his lips, sign for Ben to say nothing.\n\n               Ben nods and goes inside. Aaron and Martha face each other, \n               the question large on her face. Slowly he nods the \n               confirmation of her fears, then gently propels her ahead of \n               him through the door.\n\n               INT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - SUNSET\n\n               The room is deeply shadowed except where the dull crimson of \n               the sun through door and windows slashes the blackness.\n\n               Ben is waiting and Martha turns toward Aaron as he pulls the \n               door shut, bars it and sets the shotgun down. He takes the \n               revolver from his waist and Martha holds it as he reaches \n               for his gun belt.\n\n                                     AARON\n                         Ben, close the shutters.\n\n               Buckling on his gun belt, he moves toward the middle of the \n               room, looking around him, taking inventory of his resources.  \n               Lucy slowly approaches, biting a knuckle, eyes wide with \n               fright.\n\n                                     LUCY\n                         Pa?\n\n               One shutter closes and the bar of light they were standing \n               in goes out.

The men are not compactly bunched, but strung out, \n               each taking his own best course and his own speed... As the \n               riders pass and the dust of their passing, we see two other \n               riders -- Ethan and Mose -- minute specks in the distance, \n               possibly a mile or two behind.\n\n               EXT.

Suddenly the \n               room leaps alight as Lucy opens an inner door and enters, \n               holding a lighted lamp.

Then, with faintest little \n               rustle, Debbie comes snaking along the ground into the hollow \n               between the two graves and lies there face down, pressed \n               against Topsy. She becomes one with the earth and the \n               stillness. And then the moonlight strikes the tips of the \n               scrub growth and as a cloud scuds by, the moonlight reveals \n               something glittering -- like beads.

Breathing hard himself, his face ashen in the \n               moonlight, Martin looks desperately off in the direction of \n               the ranch. Then he jerks the rifle from its saddle scabbard -- \n               struggling with it because it is under the horse. He freezes \n               then -- listening... And we hear the steady beat of two \n               horsemen approaching. Martin knows who they are and his face \n               is alive with hope.

Little tongues of fire are licking the edges \n               of the uprights. A few arrows, imbedded in the wood, are \n               burning along their shafts. Beyond are the glowing ashes of \n               the hayricks and the charred, smouldering rails of the corral.\n\n               There are no bodies in evidence... The red glow of the burning \n               is on the faces of the men as they dismount.\n\n               Ethan strides to the porch, knocking away one of the blazing \n               arrows as he heads to the door. He stops there -- and what \n               he sees makes the big shoulders droop, the huge frame slump.\n\n               Slowly then -- and removing his hat -- he goes in. Mose \n               shuffles to the edge of the porch and squats there and rocks \n               back and forth, his face working and crying soundlessly with \n               senile grief. We hear a splintered door crash from its hinges \n               within the room and Ethan's muffled voice calling through \n               the house:\n\n                                     ETHAN (O.S.)\n                         Lucy?...

Martin would pass \n               him, but Ethan grabs his arm.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (harshly)\n                         You stay out!\n\n               Martin tries to fight his arm free.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Nothing for you to see.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         Leggo...\n\n               Ethan turns him and drives a brutal right to his jaw. Martin \n               goes down -- out cold. And only now do we understand how \n               merciful the blow was as Ethan looks compassionately at the \n               fallen figure.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Don't let him go in there, Mose...\n\n               And he takes off at a stumbling run for the hilltop.\n\n               EXT.

Some cattails \n               in the near ground. The effect is eerie, very still except \n               for the trilling of frogs. Then, very quietly, the men emerge \n               from the mist swirling around them. They are leading their \n               horses. Sam looks baffled, angry. They stand still, listening -- \n               then slowly continue.\n\n               EXT.

A moment \n               later another owl hoot, from the same side but up ahead.\n\n               From the interchange of looks, we must know that the riders \n               are aware of its significance. Mose cups hand to his mouth \n               and he hoots in exact imitation of the other calls. Clayton \n               glares at him.\n\n                                     MOSE\n                              (in soft apology)\n                         Jus' bein' sociable, Cap'n...\n\n               Ethan grins wryly. And now the first, faint, ruddy touch of \n               the sun hits the slowly moving horsemen and begins to burn \n               through the mist.\n\n               74-B\n\n               EXT.

An occasional \n               shred of mist drifts by. Everything about the little cavalcade \n               bespeaks tension, watchfulness. Suddenly -- and every man \n               sees it at the same time -- we see a file of eight Comanches \n               ride slowly out of a canyon at a distance, walking their \n               horses at the same pace and on a course roughly parallel \n               with, but slightly converging on, our group.\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                              (softly)\n                         Keep goin'...\n\n               Brad, who has been looking up ahead, sounds a new warning.\n\n                                     BRAD\n                              (tensely)\n                         Look!\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                         Easy!\n\n               74-C\n\n               EXT.

Clayton slightly alters course, veering slightly \n               away from the converging files, but still riding slowly. And \n               then, from ahead but at a 100 yards, another Comanche group \n               seems to rise out of the ground and slowly begins closing \n               the gap.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (to Clayton)\n                         If you were tryin' to surround 'em, \n                         you sure succeeded.\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                         How far's the river from here, Mose?\n\n                                     MOSE\n                         I been baptized, Reverend... yes \n                         suh, been baptized, thank ye...\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                         Well, you better brace yourself for \n                         another one...

In the next instant, the Comanches whoop and give \n               chase.\n\n               74-D\n\n               EXT.

Somehow his gun is in \n               position and he is firing as fast and well as the others.\n\n               77-A\n\n               EXT. THE RIVER - FULL SHOT - INDIAN CHARGE\n\n               The Comanches are coming in, crouched low over their ponies' \n               necks, whooping and firing. Men and horses go down, counted \n               off by the expert marksmanship of the Texans. But they keep \n               coming.\n\n               77-B\n\n               EXT.

One Comanche breaks through from the side, his \n               buffalo lance ready for the thrust. Ethan whirls and fires.\n\n               The Comanche horse charges through the defense line and out \n               and there is a muffled scream of pain from Ed Nesby.\n\n               77-C\n\n               EXT. THE RIVER - WIDE ANGLE - THE INDIANS\n\n               The charge breaks and Comanches wheel left and right, racing \n               back across the river. With magnificent horsemanship, one \n               brave rides to an unhorsed warrior crouched in the shallows \n               and swings him up behind. Two others, riding together, head \n               for one of the two dead Comanches Ethan and Mose had downed \n               on their first shots. Swinging simultaneously from their \n               saddles, they grab the dead man and carry him off.\n\n               77-D\n\n               EXT.

Most of \n               the Comanches have regained the far bank now and are racing \n               away. The firing from the Texans has stopped.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         I still got one out there.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               EXT.

Anyway, I ain't goin' \n                         back to look for it...\n\n               He leads out. Brad rides up beside Martin. Again the two \n               exchange puzzled looks. Martin shrugs and the three continue \n               along the broad trace of the Indian ponies into the setting \n               sun.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. NIGHT CAMP - A POCKET IN THE HILLS - TWILIGHT\n\n               Ethan crouches over a small fire built into a slit trench so \n               that barely the glow of the flames can be seen. Beyond him \n               Martin is leading their unsaddled horses away. The men have \n               come to the end of another long day. Both men look up as \n               Brad comes over a hill slope and rides recklessly down the \n               incline to their camp. His horse is lathered.\n\n                                     BRAD\n                              (shouting it)\n                         I saw her!...

Brad can't speak -- and \n               then finally:\n\n                                     BRAD\n                         Did they...?

He turns --\n\n               walking stiff-legged as though on stilts back to his horse.\n\n               He bends his head against the saddle, as though to hide his \n               grief. Martin turns away from him and walks back to Ethan.\n\n               And in that moment, Brad mounts and takes off in the same \n               direction from which he had ridden in.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                              (frantically)\n                         BRAD!...\n\n               They run for their horses.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               92-A\n\n               EXT.

He rips off a neckerchief as though to relieve \n               the rush of raging blood.\n\n               92-B\n\n               EXT. THE EDGE OF A RISE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - BRAD - NIGHT\n\n               He reaches the crest and reins in. A distant firelight is on \n               his face. He takes one moment to look down into the Comanche \n               camp o.s. Then he has his gun out. His eyes are wild, his \n               face wet with sweat. Then he throws back his head and he \n               yells -- and with the yell goes charging into the camp.\n\n               92-C\n\n               EXT. A RIDGE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - NIGHT\n\n               They rein in -- staring -- as from afar they hear Brad's \n               yell echoing and bouncing off the canyon walls. There is \n               nothing they can do. They hear his shouts, then the quick \n               bark of his .44, and the angry shouts of the Comanche.\n\n               92-D\n\n               EXT. COMANCHE CAMP - EXTREME CLOSEUP - BRAD - RIDING - NIGHT\n\n               His face is red with the reflected light of the fires he is \n               passing o.s. and his eyes are alight with a crazy, savage \n               joy. His gun cracks once, then again -- and the hammer clicks \n               on a spent shell.\n\n               92-E\n\n               EXT. COMANCHE CAMP - CLOSE SHOT - SCAR - NIGHT\n\n               He stands apart, warbow drawn and arrow notched. He releases \n               it at his running target. We hear its impact and a high gasp \n               of pain... and then the jubilant, yammering yells of other \n               Comanches.\n\n               92-F\n\n               EXT.

Martin \n               slumps in his saddle. Ethan listens a moment, then turns to \n               Martin.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Let's just hope he took some with \n                         him...\n\n               He turns his horse back the way they had come.

Tomorrow's another \n                         day...\n\n               Slowly, he rides away. Slowly, reluctantly but helpless to \n               do otherwise, Martin follows.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - LOW ANGLE SHOT - DAY\n\n               A study of horseprints etched in the soil -- the mark of the \n               passage of many horses; perhaps an eagle or turkey feather \n               fallen from a warbonnet. And then we hear and see the approach \n               of two plodding horses, and the dusty boots of the horsemen -- \n               Ethan and Martin -- following the trail. The Search Theme \n               resumes and continues over the next three shots, helping us \n               suggest the passage of time, the change of scene.\n\n               EXT.

THE JORGENSEN HOUSE AND APPROACH - WIDE ANGLE -\n\n               TWILIGHT\n\n               The time is spring. It is a year and a half later.\n\n               The Jorgensen house is larger than the Edwards place -- of \n               sod and logs, with a covered breezeway connecting the two \n               separate buildings of the house: one being the keeping room, \n               the other the sleeping quarters of the numerous Jorgensen \n               brood. A meadowlark breaks into his sudden song. A dog or \n               two come barking around the side of the house as Ethan and \n               Martin ride slowly from behind CAMERA toward the house. In \n               that instant a lamp is lighted within the house and Lars \n               Jorgensen comes to the door.\n\n               EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT - NEAR DOOR - TWILIGHT\n\n               Jorgensen peers at the two men as they ride up - recognizing \n               them, of course, but ill-prepared for the change in their \n               appearance and full of unspoken questions.\n\n               Bearing a lamp, Mrs. Jorgensen hurries out to stand beside \n               her husband -- and her face works and tears begin to well in \n               her eyes. Two tow-headed boys -- 13 or 14 -- come after her. \n               Jorgensen makes a little signal with one hand, not even \n               looking at the boys, and they hurry out to take the reins as \n               Ethan and Martin dismount.\n\n               EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - MED. SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN\n\n               The passage of time has stamped Martin -- and will continue \n               during our story more and more to stamp him -- in the image \n               of Ethan. Now it may show only in the set of his hat or trick \n               of standing; later it will be in his walk, in his speech (or \n               paucity of speech). Neither man is sure of his reception. \n               They are thinking of Brad -- dead because of their search; \n               and Martin is thinking of Laurie. And then Mrs. Jorgensen is \n               running across to Martin and has him in her arms as though \n               he were her son -- saying nothing, just holding him. He stands \n               frozen a moment and then he returns the embrace. Ethan watches \n               a moment, then crosses to Jorgensen.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (to Jorgensen)\n                         You got my letter about your son, \n                         Brad?\n\n                                     JORGENSEN\n                         Yah...

JORGENSEN\n                         The little one?... Debbie?\n\n               Ethan shakes his head. She squeezes his arm reassuringly and \n               they start indoors.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. THE SPARE BEDROOM OF THE JORGENSEN'S - MED. SHOT -\n\n               MARTIN - NIGHT\n\n               This is a room off the kitchen end of the keeping room --\n\n               and described in the book as the \"grandmother room\": with \n               narrow, slit-like windows, a set of single bunk beds, possibly \n               a fireplace.\n\n               Martin is in a deep wooden tub, taking a hot bath, currying \n               his back with a long-handled brush. Beyond him is the door. \n               It opens and Martin turns casually -- and at once stops being \n               casual as Laurie enters and purposefully crosses to a stool \n               or bench on which his discarded clothing is scattered.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         Hey... What you doin'...?\n\n               She picks up the shirt, puts it over one arm; she reaches \n               for his long-handled and ragged underwear, runs a fist through \n               a hole in its seat, clucks and shreds it into rags. During \n               this:\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                              (a yelp)\n                         Don't go takin' that stuff...\n\n                                     LAURIE\n                         Ain't worth the mendin'...\n\n               She turns and looks at him, matter of fact.\n\n                                     LAURIE\n                         What you gettin' red-in-the-face \n                         for?... I have brothers, haven't I?\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         Well I ain't one of 'em!\n\n                                     LAURIE\n                         I'm a woman, Martie...\n                              (he tries to say \n                              something but she \n                              goes right on)\n                         We wash and mend your dirty clothes \n                         all our lives... When you're little \n                         we even wash you... How a man can \n                         ever make out to get bashful in front \n                         of a woman I'll never know...\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         You talk like a feller might just as \n                         leave run around nekkid...\n\n                                     LAURIE\n                         Wouldn't bother me...\n                              (she heads for the \n                              door)\n                         I wouldn't try it in front of pa, \n                         though, was I you...\n\n               And she is laughing as she closes the door behind her.\n\n               INT. THE KEEPING ROOM OF THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - FULL SHOT\n\n               It is a plastered room, everything bright and shiny; a big \n               wood-burning cookstove, above it a row of shiny copper pots; \n               the furniture handmade and probably not too much unlike the \n               good plain Swedish modern of today.\n\n               There should be Scandinavian accents in the decor. All told, \n               a cheerful, warm-smelling room.\n\n               Ethan is talking as Laurie enters the room still carrying \n               Martin's shirt, the rags of his underwear. She will wait, \n               listening for a break in what Ethan is saying, to try to get \n               her mother's attention. Jorgensen is sitting in his usual \n               chair -- with his boots off, puffing his pipe more or less \n               in tune with what Ethan is talking about. Mrs. Jorgensen is \n               in her rocker, darning or knitting. Ethan is standing near \n               the mantel.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         ...an' then it snowed and we lost \n                         the trail...

Trouble is we don't even \n                         know which band that war party \n                         belonged to...\n\n               Mrs. Jorgensen looks up from her darning.\n\n                                     MRS. JORGENSEN\n                         Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         I got your boy killed.\n\n                                     MRS.

JORGENSEN\n                         Now Lars!... It so happens we be \n                         Texicans... We took a reachin' hold, \n                         way far out, past where any man has \n                         right or reason to hold on... Or if \n                         we didn't, our folks did... So we \n                         can't leave off without makin' them \n                         out to be fools, wastin' their lives \n                         'n wasted in the way they died... A \n                         Texican's nothin' but a human man \n                         out on a limb... This year an' next \n                         and maybe for a hundred more.  But I \n                         don't think it'll be forever.  Someday \n                         this country will be a fine good \n                         place to be... Maybe it needs our \n                         bones in the ground before that time \n                         can come...\n\n               The speech impresses everyone but Laurie, who probably hasn't \n               heard a word of it.\n\n                                     LAURIE\n                         Ma!... Martie's drawers is a sight!  \n                         Ain't fit for rags!... Would it be \n                         all right if we gave him some of \n                         Brad's things?\n\n               There is just the briefest hesitation...\n\n                                     MRS. JORGENSEN\n                         Why...'course it would! They're in \n                         the chest...\n\n               And she leads the way briskly, with Laurie following, to a \n               big chest at the far end of the room.\n\n                                     JORGENSEN\n                              (rising excitedly)\n                         By golly, the letter... In the chest, \n                         mama... It came for you, Ethan...  \n                         last winter...\n\n               Ethan and Jorgensen cross together to where Mrs. Jorgensen \n               is raising the top of a huge dower chest. She extracts a \n               letter, wrapped in oilskin against moths.\n\n                                     JORGENSEN\n                              (continuing)\n                         Joab Wilkes of the Rangers brought \n                         it...\n\n               Ethan takes the letter and studies it very carefully before \n               venturing to open it. Jorgensen is quite curious, but trying \n               not to seem nosy. The women remain at the chest -- pulling \n               out various folded garments, etc. Finally Ethan carefully \n               opens it and takes out a letter -- dirty as to paper, crudely \n               printed in pencil and with a horseshoe nail pinning a two-\n               inch square snip of calico to the bottom of the sheet. He \n               reads the letter with the habitual difficulty of a man unused \n               to words and then he turns the letter, removes the nail and \n               looks at the snip of cloth.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (quietly)\n                         Mrs. Jorgensen...\n\n               She comes to him, her arms piled with clothing; and\n\n               Laurie a step behind her, holding up a new pair of long-\n               handled underwear -- measuring it with her eyes for holes, \n               etc.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Will you look at this?\n\n               He holds out the snip of calico.\n\n                                     MRS. JORGENSEN\n                         Why it's just a snip of calico...\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         You ever see it before... like mebbe \n                         on a dress Debbie wore?\n\n                                     MRS.

He looks broodingly into the fire.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (continuing)\n                         ...not yet...\n\n               Laurie's face is troubled as she turns from him and heads \n               for the grandmother room, carrying the armful of clothes.\n\n               INT. THE SPARE BEDROOM - FULL SHOT - NIGHT\n\n               Martin is sitting sulkily on a cot, wrapped in a blanket.\n\n               He glares up as Laurie enters. His feet are in his boots.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         Might at least have left me my pants!\n\n                                     LAURIE\n                         Shush!...

Ethan studies him and \n               looks thoughtfully after the girl and at Martin.\n\n               He takes the letter out of his pocket -- as though he meant \n               to read it -- and then he puts it back decisively.\n\n               He starts to undress. Martin lies back on his bunk.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle \n                         with my own...\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                              (staring)\n                         YOUR cattle?...

She wears moccasins for slippers. Her \n               flannel nightgown is high at the collar and almost trails \n               the floor. She is at the stove, frying bacon and eggs; a \n               coffee pot is on the boil. Beyond her the door to the \n               grandmother room opens and Martin comes in -- dressed in \n               Brad's clothes. His eyes whip around the room.

Then we hear the \n               drum of horses' hooves, the sound of Martin riding away.  \n               Laurie flings open the door, almost as though to call him \n               back.\n\n               113-B\n\n               EXT.

FUTTERMAN, TRADER'\n\n               There are adjacent outbuildings and corral. Four horses are \n               tied outside, two being pack animals. A surly-looking white \n               man or breed sits in a stool tilted back near the door, \n               whittling with a long-bladed knife, eyeing the horses \n               covetously. He glances aside and glares as a squaw shuffles \n               along bearing a clumsy load of faggots on her bowed back.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Andale!

FUTTERMAN'S TRADING POST - FULL SHOT - DAY\n\n               It is a grimy establishment with some dusty trade goods on \n               shelves; a counter which serves as a bar; a few plank tables \n               and benches.\n\n               The breed seen outside enters and crosses to a side table \n               where another mean-looking hombre sits preparing to play a \n               game of solitaire with a deck of limp cards.\n\n               Ethan and Martin are at a table in the center of the room, \n               examining a dirty, rumpled child's dress -- Debbie's.\n\n               Martin nods soberly in answer to Ethan's inquiring look; \n               yes, it's hers. Both look up as FUTTERMAN crosses from the \n               bar, carrying a whisky jug and two dirty glasses -- his \n               fingers thrust inside the glasses. Futterman is a squaw man \n               and a killer -- dead eyes in a white face.\n\n                                     FUTTERMAN\n                         Drink?\n\n               He sets the jug down, picks up one of the glasses -- so grey \n               and thumb-printed it is almost opaque. Both Ethan and Martin \n               regard it with disgust. Futterman gives a slight shrug, takes \n               the dress and starts to wipe the dirty glass with it.

Then Ethan tosses a few more heavy pieces of dry \n               wood on the fire, making it blaze up.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         Hey!

The score is softly reprising \"Skip to my Lou.\"\n\n               EXT. NIGHT CAMP - FULL SHOT - PAST ETHAN - NIGHT\n\n               Look is standing with her blanket folded over one arm, her \n               head shyly downcast, not far from where Martin (back to her) \n               is spreading his own bed roll. He sits on it then and begins \n               pulling off his boots. He is very conscious of Ethan's \n               watchful scrutiny. Finally he is ready. He lies back on his \n               blanket. At once Look is at his side to spread her own \n               blanket. Martin sits bolt upright and tugs his blanket free \n               and wraps it protectively around him. She stares at him, \n               puzzled.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         Water!...\n                              (in Comanche)\n                         Pah!\n\n               She nods her understanding, hurries off to fetch a canteen.\n\n               Martin glares at Ethan.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         That's the way to train 'em.

Martin recoils, plants \n               his foot in the small of her back and sends her sprawling.\n\n               Ethan busts a gut laughing. Martin jumps to his feet, angrily.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                              (hotly)\n                         I don't think it's so funny...

Standing, facing the newcomers, is a woman who may be \n               no more than in her mid-thirties.\n\n               She is mad -- wild-eyed, frightened, with matted, unbrushed \n               golden hair, torn garments. It is she who has been making \n               the keening sound, the animal moans. Now she crouches at the \n               sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape. \n               Two girls are asleep, heads together and backs to the door. \n               One has light hair, like Debbie's; the other brown hair. The \n               afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light \n               hair.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         Debbie?... DEBBIE?\n\n               He has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room.\n\n               Now the madwoman begins her screaming, running from side to \n               side like a trapped animal. Ethan follows Martin into the \n               room, Keefer behind him. Martin comes to a stop, realizing \n               the woman is afraid of him. The two sleeping girls stir, but \n               do not turn.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         Don't be scared, ma'am...\n\n               The madwoman crouches behind one of the benches, looking at \n               them with frightened eyes.\n\n                                     KEEFER\n                         Just don't pay any attention to her...\n\n               Martin swallows and nods and crosses to the light-haired \n               girl. He reaches a hand gingerly to touch her shoulder.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                              (softly)\n                         Debbie?\n\n               At the touch, the girl is on her feet, crouching -- one hand, \n               like a claw, drawn back to rake his face. She is unmistakably \n               a white girl, but she is painted like a Comanche woman --her \n               ears red inside, streaks of paint accenting the savagery of \n               her face. Her eyes are frightened, yet full of hate.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         Pabo-taibo!\n                              (White man!)\n                         The other girl has risen almost in \n                         the same instant -- but more out of \n                         fear. She is younger, but painted \n                         like the other. She moves to stand \n                         behind the savage one.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                              (slowly)\n                         No...

Where's that doll?\n\n               Martin stares at him, then realizes what he has in mind.\n\n               He fishes the rag doll from under his coat and holds it out \n               to the girl. She looks at it... and we may almost suspect it \n               is rekindling a memory -- but then she spits at it. The other \n               girl laughs. Martin turns away and he's sick.\n\n                                     KEEFER\n                         Was your niece about their age?\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Not far from it...\n\n                                     KEEFER\n                         Hard to realize they're white, isn't \n                         it...\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (grimly)\n                         They're not white any more -- they're \n                         Comanche!...

As they do, the madwoman -- eyes \n               fixed on the rag doll in Martin's hand -- begins creeping up \n               behind him. Martin is torturedly watching Ethan and Keefer \n               as first one blanket then another is raised -- we will never \n               see the dead. During this:\n\n                                     KEEFER\n                              (the dispassionate \n                              pro)\n                         I'd like you to see them all...

She cradles it and she croons.\n\n               Martin reaches to take it away. But she calmly sits, cradling \n               the doll, and rocks to and fro, humming a lullaby. He can't \n               take it. Ethan returns.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Well, we only got the one lead --\n                         Scar...

JORGENSEN KEEPING ROOM - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP - \n               EVENING\n\n               Laurie has reached the last page of the letter, reading it \n               by the lamp on the table. Jorgensen is knocking out the dead \n               ashes of his pipe.  Charlie is in the shadows, a guitar in \n               his hands -- not playing it, but occasionally softly picking \n               a note or chord. Mrs. Jorgensen is dabbing moist eyes with a \n               corner of her apron.\n\n                                     LAURIE\n                         ...so we're setting out for New Mexico \n                         Territory in the morning...

JORGENSEN\n                              (quick sympathy)\n                         And you knittin' that muffler...\n\n                                     LAURIE\n                              (impatiently)\n                         What's the difference!\n\n                                     MRS. JORGENSEN\n                         Well, I just thought it would be a \n                         sin and a shame not to let SOMEONE \n                         get some good of it...\n\n               She looks almost too obviously at Charlie, which annoys \n               Laurie. Laurie resumes her letter reading:\n\n                                     LAURIE\n                              (peering closely)\n                         There's a word crossed out...

Not a cross on it. Laurie just looks at \n               it. Jorgensen stands, pocketing his pipe, easing the crick \n               in his back. He ceremoniously removes the spectacles and \n               replaces them on the mantel.\n\n                                     JORGENSEN\n                         They never find that girl.\n\n                                     LAURIE\n                              (half to herself)\n                         Yours truly...\n                              (hotly)\n                         And he even has to write his full \n                         name...

Mrs. Jorgensen \n               looks at him -- and the matchmaker is at work.\n\n                                     MRS.

Laurie has \n               opened the door and is staring out wistfully... and Charlie \n               begins playing and singing a verse from \"Skip to My Lou.\"\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                              (singing)\n                         One old boot and a button shoe One \n                         old boot and a button shoe...\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n               FADE IN\n\n               EXT.

DESERT COUNTRY - CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN -\n               DAY\n\n               Their faces are sun-tanned, burned dark and dry. Gone are \n               the heavy coats and clothing of their northern days. They do \n               not speak, just ride -- and there is the same bleak, fanatic, \n               hard look about them both. The music theme segues into \n               something livelier and Mexican as we -\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. A MEXICAN VILLAGE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN AND MARTIN - DAY\n\n               It is a small place -- a single dirt street, a few adobe \n               houses; a few racks of dried meat; a burro with a load of \n               faggots on its back being driven along by a small boy; the \n               music coming from a little cantina in the middle of the \n               street. Before the cantina is a bone rack of a horse, without \n               a saddle -- only a blanket pad. There is something familiar \n               about the horse and Ethan is staring at it as they ride in.\n\n               EXT. THE CANTINA - FULL SHOT - DAY\n\n               The two men dismount, beating dust out of their clothes.\n\n               Ethan takes another look at the sorry old nag tied outside.\n\n               Martin pauses beside Ethan.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         Recognize it?\n\n               Martin shakes his head. They start toward the cantina.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         There couldn't be two like that in \n                         all the world...\n\n               INT. THE CANTINA - FULL SHOT - DAY\n\n               as Ethan and Martin enter. It is a dirt-floored room with a \n               small bar near the door, chairs and benches along the walls. \n               A pair of guitar players are at the far end of the room. A \n               couple of Mexicans are playing a noisy game of dominoes, \n               slapping the dominoes down hard... EMILIO FIGUEROA, back to \n               the door, spurred boots across one of the tables, is sipping \n               a drink. Emilio is a cynical, middle-aged, aristocratic-\n               looking man in modified charro costume. Watching the domino \n               game is ESTRELLA, lithe, sensuous, smoking a brown-paper \n               cigarette; she is barefoot. Behind the bar is the proprietor, \n               dozing on his stool. Ethan takes a step into the room.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (loudly)\n                         MOSE!.... MOSE HARPER?\n\n               The proprietor awakens. The domino game is suspended in mid-\n               play. Estrella turns... and from beside Emilio, previously \n               obscured by the man's back and the big charro hat, pokes the \n               head of old Mose. Emilio turns then to look at the newcomers.\n\n                                     MOSE\n                         Ay-eh...?\n\n               He is on his feet and advancing to meet them. As he recognizes \n               them a wide, foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens \n               and closes in words that won't come out.

She rests her buttocks against a table \n               and waits, her eyes challenging Martin to make a move. Emilio \n               is watching Estrella and Martin with something akin to bored \n               amusement.\n\n               158B\n\n               INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLE AT BAR\n\n               Ethan has poured a drink for Mose, now one for himself --\n               leaving Martin's glass empty.\n\n                                     MOSE\n                         I been helpin' ye, Ethan...

Where is he... this man?\n\n               Mose winces under the grip. He can't speak, but he looks \n               past Ethan and he points. Ethan turns. Emilio swings his \n               boots off the table and slowly crosses to them. He lets \n               cigarette smoke curl out of his mouth. Then he smiles.\n\n                                     EMILIO\n                         I am this man, senor...

Emilio looks at the bottle on the bar, disdainfully \n               pushes it away and imperiously signals the proprietor to \n               bring something better.\n\n                                     EMILIO\n                         Un otra!\n\n               INT. THE CANTINA - ANGLING PAST MARTIN TO ESTRELLA\n\n               He is knocking off his tequila and looking at the girl \n               hungrily. She is doing her swaying dance, playing up to him \n               and with unmistakable effect. He sloshes another drink into \n               his glass and, never taking his eyes off her, downs it.\n\n               INT. THE CANTINA - FULL SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DANCE\n\n               Beyond Estrella we see Ethan, Emilio, and Mose at the bar --\n               gestures, headshakes, the entire pantomime of an inaudible \n               conversation. Then Ethan takes out his pouch and begins \n               dropping gold pieces into Emilio's hand. Meanwhile, dance \n               and dancer are achieving their purpose with Martin. And the \n               tequila is working. He gets to his feet, a little groggily. \n               Estrella's smile deepens and there is a clear invitation in \n               her eyes... Ethan turns then, his deal with Emilio concluded, \n               and he sees what is going on. He starts for Martin's table \n               just as Martin moves out to take the girl.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (tolerantly)\n                         Come on, Don Juan...

They dismount nearby and Emilio inclines \n               his head toward the one tepee. Ethan and Martin brace \n               themselves and wait.

It has several scalps on it, including one \n               with light red hair. Slowly she carries it back. Scar never \n               takes his eyes from the faces of the white men, savoring \n               every moment of it. The girl extends the lance between them, \n               so that it is like a bare blade separating two duelists. \n               Neither Ethan nor Martin dares at first look at more than \n               the scalp pole...

THE TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE GROUP AS BEFORE\n\n               Scar is watching the white men like a hawk. Martin's eyes \n               are wide and his breathing seems suspended.

SAND CREEK - FULL SHOT - INCLUDING THE DUNES - DAY\n\n               A mounted Comanche is on the crest of the dune above them --\n               rifle raised. Martin's first shot brings him down the dune \n               in a spectacular horse-and-man fall. Debbie goes running \n               like a deer up the creek, away from Martin; in the same \n               instant we hear the angry yells of distant Comanches charging \n               from the far left.

Their hoofbeats and those of the \n               pursuers bounce and echo off the canyon walls, and bullets \n               whine and ricochet.\n\n               175-B\n\n               EXT.

He runs toward one of the huge boulders, \n               crouches and starts firing.\n\n               175-D\n\n               EXT.

He starts dragging himself \n               to the cave as Martin grabs the rifles from their saddle \n               scabbards, yanks off the water canteens and then drives their \n               horses away. Then he too runs for the shelter of the cave.\n\n               175-F\n\n               EXT. THE CANYON - ANGLING FROM BEHIND MARTIN AND ETHAN\n\n               Both men are crouching, rifles ready. In the distance we see \n               their horses running off -- pursued by some yelling Comanches. \n               Four or six others come into sight, heading for the cave -- \n               moving cautiously, uncertainly -- not seeing their quarry. \n               Then the white men open fire and the Comanches bend low over \n               their horses' necks and clear out of there. Ethan looks grimly \n               at Martin.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         They'll be back...\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         We won't be here...

He looks \n               unsympathetically toward Ethan, then continues to the fire, \n               takes a knife and starts to sterilize it.

We can hear the lively music \n               of the square dance. As Jorgensen opens the door and sets \n               out toward the barn, a battered dusty trap drives in -- and \n               on it are Martin and Ethan. Jorgensen at first doesn't \n               recognize them.\n\n                                     JORGENSEN\n                              (hailing them)\n                         Hi!...

Then first one, then \n               another sees him. They gape, and the music falters and stops. \n               Sam Clayton crosses to confront him across the width of the \n               room. Jorgensen tries to be the easy, smiling host--and makes \n               a very bad job of it.\n\n                                     JORGENSEN\n                         Look everybody...

THE JORGENSEN HOME - BREEZEWAY\n\n               Charlie waits assuredly as Martin follows him outside.\n\n               Martin makes a wild run, swings. The blow is neatly guarded \n               by Charlie's left and countered with a crisp right that puts \n               Martin down. Martin gets to his feet, more cautiously this \n               time, and comes in at a crouch; he's fighting like an Indian, \n               not a white man. The men from the wedding party come out now \n               at a run.\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                              (yelling)\n                         Sergeant MacCorry!\n\n               Charlie turns slightly and in that instant Martin springs \n               and drives a straight right at his face -- almost as though \n               there were a knife in the hand. MacCorry stumbles back into \n               Clayton's arms.\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                         Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                              (regaining his balance)\n                         No sir... pleasure.\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                         In that case, give the boys room...\n\n               Martin waits at a crouch as Charlie comes in, feints his \n               right and crosses his left. It is a hard blow but Martin \n               recovers and waits... Charlie circles and starts to repeat. \n               He feints his right but this time Martin springs in, ducks \n               and -- as the left shoots out -- he grabs the wrist and throws \n               Charlie over his head. What we are looking at, in effect, is \n               a wrestler against a boxer.\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                         Fight fair, son...

Let 'em alone...\n\n               Charlie is on his feet and warily starts circling -- now \n               trying to imitate Martin's crouch. Suddenly Martin feints a \n               right swing and connects with a solid left -- reversing the \n               order of business. Charlie staggers and Martin follows up \n               with a wrestling hold, leaping behind Charlie, locking both \n               legs around him and driving his arms upward behind his back \n               so that his face is in the dirt and so he could -- under \n               other circumstances -- be neatly and expeditiously scalped. \n               With the hands locked, Martin then calmly draws a knife. He \n               looks innocently into the aghast faces of the crowd.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         Could scalp him... but I'll just \n                         count coup!\n\n               With that he releases the paralyzed arms just long enough to \n               grab a lock of Charlie's hair and neatly snip it off.\n\n               He stands then and laughs as Charlie lamely gets to his feet -- \n               easing the tortured arms. Clayton goes to Charlie's side. \n               Laurie moves to Martin's side.\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                         You all right, sergeant?\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Dunno...

Charlie MacCorry is sitting dejectedly, \n               studying a spot on the floor. Ethan is at the mantel. Laurie \n               is in her room -- presumably changing out of her wedding \n               gown. Martin is at a sink, bathing a cut on his lip.

He picks up a stone or a \n               chunk of wood and throws it. The dog yelps and runs off. \n               Scar's air is troubled, suspicious. He heads for the horse \n               herd. The camp sleeps on.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN - AT RIM OF A MESA - DAWN LIGHT\n\n               His face betrays a bitter inner satisfaction.

Then he squirms back, retrieving his hat.\n\n               FULL SHOT - HEAD OF RANGER COLUMN - DAWN LIGHT\n\n               Sam, seeing Ethan in the near distance, raises his hand in a \n               signal for halt and waits.

Slowly he tears it into shreds.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                         It's your funeral...\n\n               Martin squats and starts pulling off his boots. He glances \n               up as Charlie MacCorry comes over, an Indian blanket in his \n               hands. He tosses it onto Martin's shoulder.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Here... you fight like a Comanch... \n                         Maybe this'll help ya pass as one.\n\n               Then he grins and extends his hand. Martin takes it -- and \n               they shake as Charlie pulls him to his feet. Martin drops \n               his hat, and then -- at a crouching run -- he heads for the \n               distant Comanche camp.\n\n               FULL SHOT - FROM BEHIND CLAYTON AND ETHAN, TOWARD MARTIN\n\n               as he runs downslope under the shelter of the hogback toward \n               the unseen camp.

Whyn't you have your bugler \n                         sound the charge while you're at \n                         it??\n\n                                     GREENHILL\n                              (blankly)\n                         Sir?\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                         Never mind...

Troop's about ten miles \n                         back...

Good work, son... \n                         Good work.\n\n               He starts away. Greenhill follows.\n\n                                     GREENHILL\n                         If there's anything I can do, sir...\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                              (under his breath)\n                         God forbid... No, son, you flog on \n                         back and tell your pa where we're \n                         at... and where he's at...\n\n                                     GREENHILL\n                         But he knows THAT, sir... Can't I \n                         stay, sir?\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                              (reluctantly)\n                         All right...

OUTSKIRTS OF COMANCHE CAMP - FULL SHOT - DAWN LIGHT\n\n               Martin runs from behind CAMERA and dodges behind a rock. The \n               camp is still asleep, very quiet. Martin runs out from behind \n               the rock and makes another short dash toward the camp, \n               dropping behind a pile of blankets or other impedimenta. A \n               dog runs out of one of the tepees, begins barking.\n\n               EXT. THE HORSE HERD - MED. CLOSE SHOT - SCAR\n\n               He stands with another Comanche -- inspecting the horse lines. \n               In the near distance the dog's barking is heard -- shrill, \n               insistent. Scar, almost like an animal, sniffs the air \n               suspiciously. The other Comanche laughs.\n\n                                     COMANCHE\n                         Tahbo.\n                              (A rabbit.)\n\n               Scar isn't satisfied but returns to his work.\n\n               EXT. THE COMANCHE CAMP - ANGLE FAVORING SCAR'S TEPEE PAST \n               MARTIN\n\n               He is staring at it -- remembering it from certain distinct \n               decorations. The lower part of the tepee is rolled up, for \n               better air circulation. Martin wraps Charlie's blanket around \n               him and begins walking to the tepee.\n\n               EXT. THE LEE OF THE HOGBACK OR RISE - FULL SHOT - THE \n               RANGERS\n\n               The line is drawn up, dismounted, the men checking their \n               sidearms, tightening cinches, etc. Sam moves briskly along \n               the line of men, then mounts his horse.\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                         The State of Texas is payin' you \n                         boys $12 a month. Here's your chance \n                         to earn it... Now I don't want any \n                         foolin' around after scalps. We ain't \n                         got the time... Yankee cavalry's on \n                         its way here to set those Comanches \n                         free... We gotta beat 'em to it -- \n                         our way... Now mount an' guide center \n                         on young Greenhill here. Son, you \n                         just follow me... And WATCH THAT \n                         KNIFE!\n\n               The last comes as Greenhill tries to mount, simultaneously \n               flailing out his sabre perilously close to Clayton.\n\n               EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN\n\n               Martin has gained the tepee, takes one quick look around, \n               then strides in.\n\n               INT. SCAR'S TEPEE\n\n               as Martin enters. One robe, tossed back, shows where Scar \n               has slept. Against one wall lie the huddled figures of two \n               squaws. Two other figures -- one being Debbie's -- sleep in \n               robes. Martin's eyes go to Scar's place and then rove slowly \n               and hold on:\n\n               INT. TEPEE - MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE\n\n               She moves slightly so that the light strikes her fair hair. \n               Martin kneels close to her and gently touches her shoulder, \n               to awaken her. Her eyes open, then widen in fear. Martin \n               quickly claps a hand over his mouth.\n\n               Silently she fights him, trying to pull the hand away.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                              (a hoarse whisper)\n                         Debbie... don't!\n\n               And then her fingernails rake his hand. He winces and lets \n               go. She screams and tries to leap up. He grabs her. The other \n               squaws wake -- begin squawking.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                              (grimly)\n                         I'm takin' you whether you want to \n                         or not...\n\n               Debbie sees something beyond him. Her eyes widen.\n\n                                     DEBBIE\n                              (a scream)\n                         MARTIN!\n\n               INT. TEPEE - SHOOTING FROM EXTREME LOW ANGLE, AS FROM HER \n               P.O.V. - SCAR\n\n               He looms in the flap of the tepee much as he had over the \n               grave when he first kidnapped her. He has a scalping knife \n               in his hand. Scar whips his arm back. Behind him we see the \n               other Comanche -- the one from the horse herd.\n\n               INT. TEPEE - FULL SHOT\n\n               Martin spins and his gun is out. He fans the trigger hammer \n               twice -- and both slugs hit Scar. As the other Comanche leaps \n               in, Martin's gun speaks again. And then he is on his feet, \n               catching Debbie by the arm -- unresisting now -- and pulling \n               her after him through the camp. Shouts and cries bespeak the \n               awakening of the camp.\n\n               EXT. THE HOGBACK - FULL SHOT - THE RANGER GROUP\n\n               They are mounted and in line. The echo of a shot comes \n               bouncing back. Clayton is facing the men. He solemnly doffs \n               his hat and bows his head.\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                         For these Thy gifts which we are \n                         about to receive...\n                              (donning his hat, he \n                              turns to the bugler)\n                         Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us \n                         Go Amongst Them...YA-HEE!\n\n               And shouting the rebel yell, he leads the charge. The yell \n               is picked up by every man and the bugler sounds the charge \n               as though he had a regiment at his back. Lt. Greenhill -- a \n               West Point beau sabreur in strange company -- has his sabre \n               at the \"charge.\"\n\n               FULL MOVING SHOT - ON THE CHARGE\n\n               In the swamp of men and horses, we just have time to notice \n               that Sam is darting a somewhat worried look at Greenhill's \n               saber ominously close to his back. The charge is sounding, \n               the hooves are drumming and the men are yelling the way they \n               did when they rode with Bedford Forrest -- reins in their \n               teeth, guns in their fists.\n\n               EXT. THE ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - AS THE RANGERS HIT\n\n               Comanches are running from the tepees, trying to reach their \n               horse herd as the file of Rangers knifes in.  The bark of \n               hand guns is a steady sound now -- and the Comanches have \n               never been up against such marksmen. One charging Ranger \n               rides down a tepee. Another, with two guns drawn, scores a \n               running double on two Indians racing toward him from opposite \n               sides of his fast-running horse. A dodging Comanche screams \n               as a barrel-chested roan hits him broadside and sends him \n               sprawling into the embers of the campfire.\n\n               EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN\n\n               He yanks his horse back to its haunches, firing at a Comanche \n               crouched near the tepee. The charge races past him. Ethan \n               swings off and runs to the tepee flap, whips it open and \n               glares. A squaw comes running out at him, knife upraised, \n               but he knocks her sprawling with a full arm sweep. He turns \n               and his face is a mask of frustration -- and then he freezes, \n               seeing what he has been looking for:\n\n               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - LONG SHOT - ETHAN'S P.O.V.\n\n               Martin is running with Debbie, trying to pull her along, \n               while she kicks and claws and tries to break free. (They are \n               about thirty yards from the camp proper.) Riderless horses \n               are milling, circling. O.s. we can hear the firing, the yells.\n\n               EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - FULL SHOT\n\n               Ethan remounts and heads around the side of Scar's tepee.\n\n               In the distance we see Martin and Debbie. The Rangers, \n               regrouping, are charging back through the camp, driving the \n               Comanche horse herd.\n\n               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN AND DEBBIE\n\n               Martin hears Ethan's horse riding down at them; he turns, \n               and Debbie pulls free and starts to run away.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         No, Ethan! NO!\n\n               He goes running into the path of Ethan's horse.\n\n               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MOVING SHOT - ETHAN\n\n               as Martin runs and grabs hold of his stirrup, trying to fight \n               the horse to a stop. Ethan swings on him -- once, twice -- \n               and Martin is knocked sprawling. Ethan rides on, relentlessly.\n\n               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - DEBBIE AND ETHAN\n\n               She is running and dodging, trying to escape the horseman.\n\n               Ethan has his gun drawn. She ducks to one side and the horse \n               goes past. Both figures are almost obscured in the dust. \n               Ethan spins his mount and charges after her. She runs and \n               then falls -- and he is off his horse and striding toward \n               her.\n\n               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - ETHAN AND DEBBIE\n\n               Ethan is at the left of CAMERA and slightly closer to the \n               foreground, with Debbie at the right, supine on the ground \n               and the dust swirling around her. Ethan draws and raises his \n               gun. The hammer goes back.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (quietly)\n                         I'm sorry, girl... Shut your eyes...\n\n               The dust clears. The CAMERA MOVES slightly forward along the \n               gun arm and HOLDS on Debbie's face -- the eyes gazing \n               fearlessly, innocently into Ethan's. We HOLD for a long moment \n               and then the gun lowers. Ethan slowly holsters it and walks \n               over to her.\n\n               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - CLOSE SHOT - ETHAN\n\n               He looks down at her.\n\n                                     ETHAN\n                              (softly)\n                         You sure favor your mother...\n\n               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO\n\n               He extends his hand to her. She takes it and he helps her to \n               her feet. And then she is against his chest and his arm goes \n               protectingly about her. They are standing that way when Martin \n               stumbles up -- and stares.\n\n                                                                   WIPE TO:\n\n               233-A\n\n               EXT. COMANCHE CAMP - WIDE ANGLE - DAY\n\n               The line of Rangers is afoot now, each man near his horse, \n               each man with rifle out, pumping shot after shot at the \n               fleeting remnant of Comanches riding down the long valley \n               with their scattered horse herd milling and criss-crossing \n               in mid-ground... And then as the firing slackens, from afar \n               we can hear the blare of a cavalry bugle sounding the charge: \n               sign of the approach of Greenhill's troop.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - FAVORING CLAYTON\n\n               It is perhaps half an hour later. Clayton is very grim of \n               face and occasionally wincing. His trousers are down over \n               his ankles, his shirt-tails flapping over his long-handled \n               red underwear. Behind him Charlie MacCorry is kneeling, \n               applying some crude first aid to Sam's rump. Beyond them \n               some of the Rangers are readying for the move-out. Sam looks \n               up angrily as COLONEL GREENHILL, a guidon bearer, and bugler \n               ride in. Greenhill is a choleric man.\n\n                                     COLONEL\n                         Clayton, if you were in my command \n                         I'd have you courtmartialed for this!\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                              (angrily, to MacCorry)\n                         Hurry it up!\n\n                                     COLONEL\n                         What's the matter, sir... You wounded?  \n                         What is it, Sergeant -- a bullet or \n                         an arrow?\n\n               Charlie just gapes, but Clayton -- grim-lipped -- bends a \n               meaningful glare on someone off. Greenhill looks that way.\n\n               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - CLOSE SHOT - LT. GREENHILL\n\n               He is standing with his sabre at salute -- looking as \n               miserable as any shavetail would look when in disgrace. It \n               could be that the end of the sabre has a pronounced bend.\n\n               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP\n\n               Sam suddenly slaps MacCorry's hand away and grabs for his \n               pants and pulls them up -- and around a tepee come three \n               figures -- Ethan, Debbie, and Martin -- with Ethan holding \n               Debbie's hand. And Sam's face is split by a grin as he tucks \n               his shirt-tails in and goes to meet them.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. THE JORGENSEN HOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - MOSE HARPER -\n               AFTERNOON\n\n               He is in a rocker on the porch. Suddenly he stares out and \n               stops rocking. Faint in the distance, but coming closer, the \n               clop-clop of two horses, moving at a walk. A moment later \n               Jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside Mose, shading \n               his eyes and squinting against the sun, still not recognizing \n               the distant horsemen.  He is joined by Mrs. Jorgensen. And \n               then Laurie comes out and she too stares, frowning at first, \n               then with dawning realization.\n\n               Lars and Mrs. Jorgensen also begin to guess... to suspect...  \n               and then to know. And Laurie starts to run.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT - MOVING WITH LAURIE\n\n               The CAMERA MOVES ahead of her as she runs blindly over the \n               hard-packed ground, running as hard as she can toward the \n               still unseen but nearing horsemen.\n\n               FULL SHOT - THE GROUP\n\n               Ethan has Debbie on the pommel of his saddle, his arm \n               supporting her, and she is asleep. Martin is riding beside \n               them. Laurie comes running up to stare at Ethan and at the \n               girl. He smiles and puts a finger to his lips -- cautioning \n               her against waking Debbie -- and then he rides by. Laurie \n               looks then at Martin. He doesn't know whether to smile or \n               not; he just waits. And then she is beside him and she steps \n               onto his stirruped foot and vaults up beside him, and she \n               kisses him just as she had on the day he left the graves to \n               take up the search. And still holding her beside him, he \n               rides slowly after Ethan and Debbie toward the house.\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearchers, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Frank Nugent\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Western\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:34:44.650963"}
