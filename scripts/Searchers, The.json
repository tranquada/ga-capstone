An occasional tumbleweed \n               drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints; \n               and lightly-blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing \n               them.

BACK TO CAMERA, jogging slowly along -- \n               heading down a long valley toward a still-distant ranch house \n               with its outlying barn and corrals.\n\n<b>               EXT. PLAINS COUNTRY - MED. SHOT - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               The CAMERA FRAMES and MOVES with the lone horseman. He is \n               ETHAN EDWARDS, a man as hard as the country he is crossing.\n\n               Ethan is in his forties, with a three-day stubble of beard.\n\n               Dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his \n               clothing. He wears a long Confederate overcoat, torn at one \n               pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows.\n\n               His trousers are a faded blue with an off-color stripe down \n               the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the \n               Yankee cavalry. His saddle is Mexican and across it he carries \n               a folded serape in place of the Texas poncho...\n\n               Rider and horse have come a long way. The CAMERA HOLDS and \n               PANS the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto \n               his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk \n               sash wrapped around it... Horse and rider pass, moving closer \n               to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing \n               around the corner of the house.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Debbie is 11 years old with a \n               piquant, memorable face.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE YARD - CLOSE SHOT - DEBBIE\n</b>\n               Here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her \n               face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again \n               five or six years later, we would know it is she -- perhaps \n               the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of \n               scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE EDWARDS HOUSE - MED. SHOT - AARON - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               The ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and \n               cross-timbered roof, deep windows. A small gallery or porch \n               extends across the front. AARON EDWARDS comes through the \n               door, attracted by the dog's barking -- and then he, too, \n               sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out -- curious \n               but not at all apprehensive. Aaron is a lean, weathered and \n               tired man, with a down-swept mustache; a gentler-looking man \n               than Ethan and possibly a few years older.\n\n               As he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, \n               LUCY, comes out to stand behind him. Lucy is from 16 to 18 -- \n               a pleasant, feminine girl. She is carrying a mixing bowl \n               with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely \n               forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger.\n\n               In the next instant MARTHA EDWARDS follows the daughter onto \n               the porch. Martha is a still-lovely woman, although the years \n               have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work \n               has worn and coarsened her hands. Those hands will never be \n               idle when Martha is on scene... And now, while she shares \n               the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she \n               automatically notes that Lucy has forgotten her task -- and \n               she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter.\n\n<b>               EXT. YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               Along the side of the house comes BEN EDWARDS, 14, with a \n               man-sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. He, \n               too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. So much \n               so that he trips, but recovers his footing. He pauses to \n               dump the wood into a woodbox by the door -- his eyes always \n               riveted on the oncoming rider -- and then he moves toward \n               the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. Beyond Ben, \n               MARTIN PAULEY emerges from the barn and crosses the open \n               ground heading toward CAMERA. Martin is somewhat under 20, a \n               lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with Indian-straight \n               hair and a white man's eyes. He is carrying bridle or other \n               horse-gear. He looks to the family on the porch -- to see if \n               they recognize the stranger -- then out again. He continues, \n               followed by Ben, toward where\n\n               Debbie crouches over her dog.\n\n<b>               EXT.

THE EDWARDS RANCH - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTHA, LUCY, AND \n</b><b>               AARON - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               Suddenly, Martha's eyes widen as she -- even before Aaron -- \n               recognizes the distant rider. Her hand goes to her mouth to \n               check the name that trembles on her lips... An instant later \n               Aaron, too, identifies the oncoming horseman.\n\n<b>                                     AARON\n</b>                              (incredulous)\n                         Ethan?\n\n               He looks at her, frowning, then slowly steps out onto the \n               hard ground. Martha hands the bowl back to Lucy and follows \n               Aaron.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE YARD OF THE EDWARDS HOUSE - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP\n</b>\n               as Ethan rides in and sits his horse, looking down at them.  \n               There is a noticeable constraint on all of them. Finally:\n\n<b>                                     ETHAN\n</b>                         Hello, Aaron...\n\n               His eyes shift to Martha and hold. Ethan is, and always has \n               been, in love with his brother's wife and she with him.\n\n<b>                                     ETHAN\n</b>                         Martha...\n\n<b>                                     MARTHA\n</b>                              (a bit shakily)\n                         Hello, Ethan.\n\n               Ethan slowly, stiffly swings out of the saddle. Aaron and \n               Martha exchange quick glances... troubled, puzzled. Aaron \n               pastes on an uncertain smile as Ethan comes around his horse \n               toward their side.\n\n<b>                                     AARON\n</b>                         How's California?\n\n<b>                                     ETHAN\n</b>                         How should I know?\n\n<b>                                     AARON\n</b>                         But Mose Harper said...\n\n<b>                                     ETHAN\n</b>                         That old goat still creakin' \n                         around?...

Ben and Debbie \n               have inched closer -- half-shy, half-curious.\n\n               Debbie's dog begins sniffing at his heels. Ethan looks down \n               at them - not unfriendly, just a man not used to children.\n\n<b>                                     ETHAN\n</b>                         Ben, ain't you?\n\n               Ben nods.\n\n<b>                                     ETHAN\n</b>                              (frowning at Debbie)\n                         Lucy, you ain't much bigger than \n                         when I saw you last.\n\n<b>                                     DEBBIE\n</b>                         I'm Deborah!\n                              (pointing)\n                         She's Lucy.\n\n               Ethan looks in the direction of the pointing finger.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Martin\n\n               is at his heels, eager and expectant. Beyond them stands \n               Keefer, grave and compassionate. There is a keening sound in \n               the room -- almost an animal sound.\n\n<b>               INT. THE CHAPEL - REVERSE SHOT - FULL\n</b>\n               It is a simple log-sided room with plank benches without \n               backs. Up front is a small box-like pulpit, no altar.\n\n               Across the front of the room, set up either on benches or on \n               boards over saw-horses are four blanket-covered figures -- \n               at least two being the bodies of children.\n\n               Squatting on the floor near them is an elderly white woman \n               with hair hanging loosely down her back and clad in Indian \n               robes. Standing, facing the newcomers, is a woman who may be \n               no more than in her mid-thirties.\n\n               She is mad -- wild-eyed, frightened, with matted, unbrushed \n               golden hair, torn garments. It is she who has been making \n               the keening sound, the animal moans. Now she crouches at the \n               sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape. \n               Two girls are asleep, heads together and backs to the door. \n               One has light hair, like Debbie's; the other brown hair. The \n               afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light \n               hair.\n\n<b>                                     MARTIN\n</b>                         Debbie?... DEBBIE?\n\n               He has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room.\n\n               Now the madwoman begins her screaming, running from side to \n               side like a trapped animal. Ethan follows Martin into the \n               room, Keefer behind him. Martin comes to a stop, realizing \n               the woman is afraid of him. The two sleeping girls stir, but \n               do not turn.\n\n<b>                                     MARTIN\n</b>                         Don't be scared, ma'am...\n\n               The madwoman crouches behind one of the benches, looking at \n               them with frightened eyes.\n\n<b>                                     KEEFER\n</b>                         Just don't pay any attention to her...\n\n               Martin swallows and nods and crosses to the light-haired \n               girl.

She is unmistakably \n               a white girl, but she is painted like a Comanche woman --her \n               ears red inside, streaks of paint accenting the savagery of \n               her face. Her eyes are frightened, yet full of hate.\n\n<b>                                     GIRL\n</b>                         Pabo-taibo!\n                              (White man!)\n                         The other girl has risen almost in \n                         the same instant -- but more out of \n                         fear. She is younger, but painted \n                         like the other.

She looks at it... and we may almost suspect it \n               is rekindling a memory -- but then she spits at it. The other \n               girl laughs.

As they do, the madwoman -- eyes \n               fixed on the rag doll in Martin's hand -- begins creeping up \n               behind him.

A \n               couple of Mexicans are playing a noisy game of dominoes, \n               slapping the dominoes down hard... EMILIO FIGUEROA, back to \n               the door, spurred boots across one of the tables, is sipping \n               a drink. Emilio is a cynical, middle-aged, aristocratic-\n               looking man in modified charro costume. Watching the domino \n               game is ESTRELLA, lithe, sensuous, smoking a brown-paper \n               cigarette; she is barefoot.

As he recognizes \n               them a wide, foolish grin splits his face and his mouth opens \n               and closes in words that won't come out.

The blow is neatly guarded \n               by Charlie's left and countered with a crisp right that puts \n               Martin down. Martin gets to his feet, more cautiously this \n               time, and comes in at a crouch; he's fighting like an Indian, \n               not a white man.

It is a hard blow but Martin \n               recovers and waits... Charlie circles and starts to repeat. \n               He feints his right but this time Martin springs in, ducks \n               and -- as the left shoots out -- he grabs the wrist and throws \n               Charlie over his head.

Suddenly Martin feints a \n               right swing and connects with a solid left -- reversing the \n               order of business. Charlie staggers and Martin follows up \n               with a wrestling hold, leaping behind Charlie, locking both \n               legs around him and driving his arms upward behind his back \n               so that his face is in the dirt and so he could -- under \n               other circumstances -- be neatly and expeditiously scalped. \n               With the hands locked, Martin then calmly draws a knife. He \n               looks innocently into the aghast faces of the crowd.\n\n<b>                                     MARTIN\n</b>                         Could scalp him... but I'll just \n                         count coup!\n\n               With that he releases the paralyzed arms just long enough to \n               grab a lock of Charlie's hair and neatly snip it off.\n\n               He stands then and laughs as Charlie lamely gets to his feet -- \n               easing the tortured arms.

Shouts and cries bespeak the \n               awakening of the camp.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE HOGBACK - FULL SHOT - THE RANGER GROUP\n</b>\n               They are mounted and in line. The echo of a shot comes \n               bouncing back. Clayton is facing the men. He solemnly doffs \n               his hat and bows his head.\n\n<b>                                     CLAYTON\n</b>                         For these Thy gifts which we are \n                         about to receive...\n                              (donning his hat, he \n                              turns to the bugler)\n                         Sound that horn, son, and Leave Us \n                         Go Amongst Them...YA-HEE!\n\n               And shouting the rebel yell, he leads the charge. The yell \n               is picked up by every man and the bugler sounds the charge \n               as though he had a regiment at his back. Lt. Greenhill -- a \n               West Point beau sabreur in strange company -- has his sabre \n               at the \"charge.\"\n\n<b>               FULL MOVING SHOT - ON THE CHARGE\n</b>\n               In the swamp of men and horses, we just have time to notice \n               that Sam is darting a somewhat worried look at Greenhill's \n               saber ominously close to his back. The charge is sounding, \n               the hooves are drumming and the men are yelling the way they \n               did when they rode with Bedford Forrest -- reins in their \n               teeth, guns in their fists.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - AS THE RANGERS HIT\n</b>\n               Comanches are running from the tepees, trying to reach their \n               horse herd as the file of Rangers knifes in.  The bark of \n               hand guns is a steady sound now -- and the Comanches have \n               never been up against such marksmen. One charging Ranger \n               rides down a tepee. Another, with two guns drawn, scores a \n               running double on two Indians racing toward him from opposite \n               sides of his fast-running horse. A dodging Comanche screams \n               as a barrel-chested roan hits him broadside and sends him \n               sprawling into the embers of the campfire.\n\n<b>               EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - FULL SHOT - ETHAN\n</b>\n               He yanks his horse back to its haunches, firing at a Comanche \n               crouched near the tepee. The charge races past him. Ethan \n               swings off and runs to the tepee flap, whips it open and \n               glares. A squaw comes running out at him, knife upraised, \n               but he knocks her sprawling with a full arm sweep. He turns \n               and his face is a mask of frustration -- and then he freezes, \n               seeing what he has been looking for:\n\n<b>               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - LONG SHOT - ETHAN'S P.O.V.\n</b>\n               Martin is running with Debbie, trying to pull her along, \n               while she kicks and claws and tries to break free. (They are \n               about thirty yards from the camp proper.) Riderless horses \n               are milling, circling. O.s. we can hear the firing, the yells.\n\n<b>               EXT. SCAR'S TEPEE - FULL SHOT\n</b>\n               Ethan remounts and heads around the side of Scar's tepee.\n\n               In the distance we see Martin and Debbie. The Rangers, \n               regrouping, are charging back through the camp, driving the \n               Comanche horse herd.\n\n<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARTIN AND DEBBIE\n</b>\n               Martin hears Ethan's horse riding down at them; he turns, \n               and Debbie pulls free and starts to run away.\n\n<b>                                     MARTIN\n</b>                         No, Ethan! NO!\n\n               He goes running into the path of Ethan's horse.\n\n<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - MOVING SHOT - ETHAN\n</b>\n               as Martin runs and grabs hold of his stirrup, trying to fight \n               the horse to a stop. Ethan swings on him -- once, twice -- \n               and Martin is knocked sprawling. Ethan rides on, relentlessly.\n\n<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - FULL SHOT - DEBBIE AND ETHAN\n</b>\n               She is running and dodging, trying to escape the horseman.\n\n               Ethan has his gun drawn. She ducks to one side and the horse \n               goes past. Both figures are almost obscured in the dust. \n               Ethan spins his mount and charges after her. She runs and \n               then falls -- and he is off his horse and striding toward \n               her.\n\n<b>               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - ETHAN AND DEBBIE\n</b>\n               Ethan is at the left of CAMERA and slightly closer to the \n               foreground, with Debbie at the right, supine on the ground \n               and the dust swirling around her. Ethan draws and raises his \n               gun. The hammer goes back.\n\n<b>                                     ETHAN\n</b>                              (quietly)\n                         I'm sorry, girl... Shut your eyes...\n\n               The dust clears. The CAMERA MOVES slightly forward along the \n               gun arm and HOLDS on Debbie's face -- the eyes gazing \n               fearlessly, innocently into Ethan's. We HOLD for a long moment \n               and then the gun lowers. Ethan slowly holsters it and walks \n               over to her.\n\n<b>               EXT.

And then she is against his chest and his arm goes \n               protectingly about her. They are standing that way when Martin \n               stumbles up -- and stares.\n\n<b>                                                                   WIPE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               233-A\n</b>\n<b>               EXT. COMANCHE CAMP - WIDE ANGLE - DAY\n</b>\n               The line of Rangers is afoot now, each man near his horse, \n               each man with rifle out, pumping shot after shot at the \n               fleeting remnant of Comanches riding down the long valley \n               with their scattered horse herd milling and criss-crossing \n               in mid-ground... And then as the firing slackens, from afar \n               we can hear the blare of a cavalry bugle sounding the charge: \n               sign of the approach of Greenhill's troop.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - FAVORING CLAYTON\n</b>\n               It is perhaps half an hour later. Clayton is very grim of \n               face and occasionally wincing. His trousers are down over \n               his ankles, his shirt-tails flapping over his long-handled \n               red underwear. Behind him Charlie MacCorry is kneeling, \n               applying some crude first aid to Sam's rump. Beyond them \n               some of the Rangers are readying for the move-out. Sam looks \n               up angrily as COLONEL GREENHILL, a guidon bearer, and bugler \n               ride in. Greenhill is a choleric man.\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL\n</b>                         Clayton, if you were in my command \n                         I'd have you courtmartialed for this!\n\n<b>                                     CLAYTON\n</b>                              (angrily, to MacCorry)\n                         Hurry it up!\n\n<b>                                     COLONEL\n</b>                         What's the matter, sir...

Greenhill looks that way.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - CLOSE SHOT - LT. GREENHILL\n</b>\n               He is standing with his sabre at salute -- looking as \n               miserable as any shavetail would look when in disgrace. It \n               could be that the end of the sabre has a pronounced bend.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - FULL SHOT - THE GROUP\n</b>\n               Sam suddenly slaps MacCorry's hand away and grabs for his \n               pants and pulls them up -- and around a tepee come three \n               figures -- Ethan, Debbie, and Martin -- with Ethan holding \n               Debbie's hand. And Sam's face is split by a grin as he tucks \n               his shirt-tails in and goes to meet them.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

Faint in the distance, but coming closer, the \n               clop-clop of two horses, moving at a walk. A moment later \n               Jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside Mose, shading \n               his eyes and squinting against the sun, still not recognizing \n               the distant horsemen.  He is joined by Mrs. Jorgensen. And \n               then Laurie comes out and she too stares, frowning at first, \n               then with dawning realization.\n\n               Lars and Mrs. Jorgensen also begin to guess... to suspect...  \n               and then to know. And Laurie starts to run.\n\n<b>               CLOSE SHOT - MOVING WITH LAURIE\n</b>\n               The CAMERA MOVES ahead of her as she runs blindly over the \n               hard-packed ground, running as hard as she can toward the \n               still unseen but nearing horsemen.\n\n<b>               FULL SHOT - THE GROUP\n</b>\n               Ethan has Debbie on the pommel of his saddle, his arm \n               supporting her, and she is asleep. Martin is riding beside \n               them. Laurie comes running up to stare at Ethan and at the \n               girl. He smiles and puts a finger to his lips -- cautioning \n               her against waking Debbie -- and then he rides by. Laurie \n               looks then at Martin. He doesn't know whether to smile or \n               not; he just waits. And then she is beside him and she steps \n               onto his stirruped foot and vaults up beside him, and she \n               kisses him just as she had on the day he left the graves to \n               take up the search. And still holding her beside him, he \n               rides slowly after Ethan and Debbie toward the house.\n\n<b>                                                                   FADE OUT\n</b>\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b>\n\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Searchers, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Frank Nugent\" title=\"Scripts by Frank Nugent\">Frank Nugent</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Western\" title=\"Western Scripts\">Western</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Searchers, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Searchers, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:15:29.543976"}
