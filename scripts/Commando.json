Matrix can only see Cindy.\r\n\r\n                         COOKE\r\n          Open the door.\r\n          Cindy unlocks the chain and opens the door.\r\n\r\n                         COOKE\r\n          Move out of the way.\r\n          Cindy moves away from the door. Matrix tenses, ready\r\n          to attack. Cooke looks into the room at the rumpled\r\n          bed, suitcase and fast food containers.\r\n          The shower SOUNDS continue to echo from the bathroom.\r\n          Cooke cautiously enters the doorway. WHAM!\r\n          Matrix SLAMS the gun against the brawny Cooke's head.\r\n          Cooke crashes back against the wall, but doesn't go\r\n          down. He grabs Matrix's gun hand by the wrist and\r\n          the two of them STRUGGLE for the gun.\r\n          BLAM! BLAM! The gun FIRES into the ceiling as they\r\n          wrestle around the room.

The\r\n          barrel gets CLOSER... CLOSER... then almost points right\r\n          at Matrix.\r\n          With a sudden SURGE of power, Matrix lifts Cooke off\r\n          the ground, pushes him toward the wall and the two of\r\n          them CRASH RIGHT THROUGH THE DOOR into the adjoining\r\n          room.\r\n\r\n                         142\r\n\r\n                         ADJOINING ROOM\r\n          A twenty-year-old couple in bed look up in shock as\r\n          Matrix and Cooke bounce off their bed and SLAM against\r\n          the wall.\r\n          BLAM! The gun FIRES, SHATTERING the mirror above the\r\n          young couple and they SCRAMBLE to safety on the floor\r\n          on the other side of the bed.\r\n          Matrix and Cooke come off the wall and SLAM onto the\r\n          floor, the gun coming out of Matrix's hand. Cooke\r\n          picks it up before Matrix can reach it.\r\n          Cooke points the gun right at Matrix's face, pulls back\r\n          the trigger, then smiles.\r\n\r\n                         COOKE\r\n          Fuck you, asshole.\r\n          He pulls the trigger.

There's a wallet\r\n          containing only cash. Matrix tosses it to the floor.\r\n          He brings out a lighter and a package of cigarettes,\r\n          examines the lighter, then tosses both objects to the\r\n          floor.\r\n          He pulls out two keys on a key chain.

Bennett\r\n          quickly THROWS SAND in matrix's eyes.\r\n          Matrix, blinded, stumbles badly.\r\n          Bennett immediately grabs Matrix's knife hand around\r\n          the wrist, then SINKS his own knife into Matrix's\r\n          side.\r\n\r\n                         MATRIX\r\n\r\n          AAAHHH!\r\n          Matrix's eyes go glassy, then he drops his knife.\r\n          Bennett lets Matrix's wrist go, looks at Matrix's\r\n          glassy eyes for a beat, then he pulls his knife out of\r\n          Matrix's side.\r\n          Matrix STAGGERS for a beat, then STUMBLES a few steps\r\n          and drops to one knee against the front outside hull of\r\n          the boat.\r\n          Bennett slowly approaches Matrix from behind, casually\r\n          feeling the blade of his knife.\r\n          He looks at Matrix's wide, unprotected back and Bennett\r\n          smiles.\r\n          Bennett pulls the knife back with his arm, preparing to\r\n          plunge it into Matrix's back.\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON MATRIX 401\r\n          Out of Bennett's sight, Matrix slips the knife out of\r\n          his boot and GRIPS the knife.\r\n\r\n                         A85\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         95\r\n\r\n          MATRIX AND BENNETT 402\r\n\r\n                         BENNETT\r\n          Fuck you, asshole...\r\n          He PLUNGES the knife down toward Matrix's back.\r\n          Matrix moves LIKE LIGHTNING to the side. The knife\r\n          misses him and GETS STUCK in the hull of the boat.\r\n          Matrix turns toward Bennett.\r\n\r\n                         MATRIX\r\n          (shaking his head)\r\n          No...\r\n          Bennett tries desperately to get his knife unstuck from\r\n          the boat hull, but he can't. Fear FLOODS his eyes.\r\n          Matrix moves close to Bennett.\r\n\r\n                         MATRIX\r\n          Fuck YOU, asshole...\r\n          He DRIVES his knife into Bennett's throat so hard the\r\n          knife goes through Bennett's neck and comes out the\r\n          other side.\r\n          Still holding the knife, Matrix then DRIVES the knife\r\n          into the hull of the boat.\r\n          The knife STICKS into the hull, holding Bennett's neck\r\n          there like a thumbtack holds a note on a bulletin board.\r\n          BOOM? Suddenly there is another, larger EXPLOSION in\r\n          the fiery back of the boat and the whole boat EXPLODES\r\n          into FLAMES, leaving Bennett lost in the fireball.\r\n\r\n          MATRIX AND JENNY 403\r\n          Matrix limps away from the flames, Jenny rushes into\r\n          his arms and he holds her close. She's crying.\r\n          She shows him she was holding his gun.\r\n\r\n                         JENNY\r\n          I wanted to shoot...but I\r\n          couldn't, I just couldn't.\r\n          Matrix looks at her.\r\n          Cont.\r\n\r\n                         A85\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         96\r\n           403 Cont.\r\n\r\n                         MATRIX\r\n          You know something? I'm glad\r\n          you couldn't.\r\n          He takes the gun from her and tosses it past the burning\r\n          boat into the ocean.\r\n\r\n          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 404\r\n          He sees two Army helicopters approaching from the air\r\n          and Cindy bringing her seaplane to the beach.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BEACH 405\r\n\r\n          Matrix lies down, his head in Jenny's lap, and tries\r\n          to still his bleeding.\r\n          The two copters land. Kirby gets out of one and two\r\n          medical corpsmen with a stretcher get out of the other.\r\n          The corpsmen bring the stretcher to Matrix and gently\r\n          ease him onto it. They start to carry him as Jenny\r\n          walks alongside.\r\n\r\n                         KIRBY\r\n          I just saw what's left of Arius'\r\n          estate...
