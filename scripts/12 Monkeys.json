CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY\n\n\tCLOSE ON A FACE.  A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide\n\twith wonder. watching something intently.  We HEAR the sounds of\n\tthe P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the\n\tsounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.\n\n\tYOUNG COLE'S POV:  twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on\n\tthe floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.\n\n\tA BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S\n\tview, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering\n\tto his wound.\n\n\tANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of\n\tview, as they steer him away.\n\n\t\t\t\tFATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tCome on, Son --this is no place for us.\n\n\tYOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.\n\n\tYOUNG COLE'S POV:  intermittently visible through a confusion of\n\tFIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching\n\tup and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture\n\tof enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.\n\tSYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...\n\n\t\t\t\tP.A. SYSTEM\n\t\tFlight 784 for San Francisco is now\n\t\tready for boarding at inmate number\n\t\t66578, Greely.\n\n\tINT.  PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT\n\n\t\t\t\tPRISON P.A. SYSTEM\n\t\t--number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...\n\n\tCOLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one\n\tof many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim\n\tcorridor.  He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.\n\n\tThen, as he \"recovers\" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR\n\tFIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF\n\tETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS\n\t\"REALITY\" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE\n\t\"DREAMLIKE\" THAN HIS DREAM.\n\n\tFlashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,\n\tGUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.\n\n\tCOLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tSsssst!  Jose, what's going on?\n\n\tJOSE's face is almost lost in shadow.  What there is of it is\n\tyouthful.  He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!\n\n\t\t\t\tJOSE\n\t\t\"Volunteers\" again.\n\n\tJOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a\n\tmenacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms\n\tclose to COLE's cage and unlocks it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCARFACE\n\t\t\"Volunteer duty\".\n\n    The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tI didn't volunteer.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCARFACE\n\t\tYou causing trouble again?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\t\t(controls his temper)\n\t\tNo trouble.\n\n\tINT.  EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT\n\n\tCOLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit\n\tin a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.\n\n\t\t\tTITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE\n\n\tCOLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.\n\n\t\t\t\tOFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tAll openings must be closed.\n\n\tCOLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tOFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tIf the integrity of the suit is compromised\n\t\tin any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper\n\t\tnot closed, readmittance will be denied.\n\n\tINT.  SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE, wearing the \"space suit\" and a helmet with a plastic visor,\n\tsteps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock.  The heavy door\n\tclangs shut behind him.  He's alone.  COLE'S breath comes quicker\n\tnow as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.\n\n\tOn the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.\n\tCOLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It\n\n\tINT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks.  He looks\n\tdown at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.\n\n\tThe map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.\n\n\tINT.  SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through\n\n\tRATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.\n\n\tThe flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.\n\n\tReaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.\n\n\tEXT.  CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)\n\n\tA SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved\n\taside.  COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city in\n\tmoonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No people\n\tanywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.\n\n\tEXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.\n\t\n\tMoving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for\n\tsomething.  Finds it.  An insect.\n\n\tCOLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts it\n\tinto a collection tube, something makes him turn.\n\n\tThere's something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.\n\n\tCOLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by the\n\tlight, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.\n\n\tANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.\n\t\n\tThen, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the\n\tflashlight, it pads quickly down the street.\n\n\tINT.  SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT\n\n\tUsing the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked\n\tfloor and gets another specimen.  DOGSHIT!\n\n\tThe only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.\n\n\tThen, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  More\n\tdogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  It's a DOGFIGHT!\n\n\tEXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)\n\n\tA giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings\n\tand lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.\n\n\tBelow, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted\n\tbuildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.\n\n\tINT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A large\n\tSPIDER tries to hide from the light.\n\n\tCOLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and\n\tputs it into one of his specimen tubes.\n\n\tThen, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  There's\n\tnothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.\n\n\tEXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN\n\n\tAs COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the\n\tbuilding.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled\n\tlogo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it is\n\twritten, \"WE DID IT!\"\n\n\tCOLE looks up.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LION\n\tpatrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.\n\n\t\t\tTTTLES END\n\n\tINT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT\n\n\tROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the\n\twall, pummel the still-suited COLE.\n\n\tINT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT\n\n\tStark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on\n\tlong poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING\n\tFIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their\n\twindowed masks.  It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,\n\tdripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,\n\n\t\t\t\tAMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tRaise your arms above your head.\n\n\tCOLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.\n\n\tINT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)\n\n\tStill naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN\n\tin a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws\n\tblood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.\n\n\tCOLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque \"window\" of thick\n\tplastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk\n\tbehind the translucent aperture, studying him.\n\n\tThe TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.\n\n\tINT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT\n\n\tUshered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...\n\ta blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces\n\theaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with\n\tstring, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a\n\tdilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering\n\tbooks and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference\n\ttable, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,\n\tBOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They represent\n\ta \"modern\" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,\n\toutdated, patched-together technologies.\n\n\t\t\t\tTINY\n\t\tJames Cole.  Cleared from quarantine.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICROBIOLOGIST\n\t\tThank you.  You two wait outside.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCARFACE\n\t\tHe's got a history, Doctor.  Violence.\n\n\tCOLE'S eyes return to the walls.\n\n\tHeadlines:  \"CLOCK TICKING!  NO CURE YET!\"\n\n\t\t\t\tSCARFACE\n\t\tAnti-social six -- doing 25 to life.\n\n\t\t\t\tENGINEER\n\t\tI don't think he's going to hurt us.  You're\n\t\tnot going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?\n\n\tCOLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tNo, sir.\n\n\tThe GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICROBIOLOGIST\n\t\tWhy don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.\n\n\tCOLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.\n\n\t\t\t\tASTROPHYSICIST\n\t\tWe want you to tell us about last\n\t\tnight.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tI went to the surface and I collected\n\t\tspecimens like I was told.\n\n\tThe SCIENTISTS don't say anything.  They just study him carefully.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\t\t(worried)\n\t\tI mashed the spider, didn't I?\n\n\t\t\t\tMICROBIOLOGIST\n\t\tWe'll get to the spider later, Mr.\n\t\tCole.  Right now, we want to know\n\t\teverything that you saw.\n\n\tINT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard\n\tsketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.\n\n\t\t\t\tASTPOPHYSICIST\n\t\tWhere you collected sample #4, what\n\t\tstreet was that?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tUh...\n\n\t\t\t\tBOTANIST\n\t\tIt's important to observe everything.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tI think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.\n\n\tAs the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,\n\tCOLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the\n\twall.  One headline screams, \"VIRUS MUTATING!\"  Another features\n\ta photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on)\n\tand the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, \"IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE\".\n\n\t\t\t\tASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tClose your eyes, Cole.\n\n\tStartled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.\n\n\tBLACKNESS.  Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING.  But we HEAR their VOICES.\n\n\t\t\t\tENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tTell us in detail what you've seen in\n\t\tthis room.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tUh, in this room?  Uh...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tHow many of us are there?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tSix...seven, if you count me.\n\n\t\t\t\tASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tTell us about the pictures on the wall...\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tUh, you mean the newspapers?\n\n\t\t\t\tA MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)\n\t\tTell us about the newspapers.  Can you\n\t\thear my voice?  What do I look like?\n\t\tWhat does he look like, the man who\n\t\tjust spoke?  How old were you when you\n\t\tleft the surface?\n\n\tThe VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.\n\tSYSTEM at the airport.\n\n\tINT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY\n\n\tTHE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked\n\tby his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE\n\tland through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse\n\tleading to the departure gates.\n\n\t\t\t\tP.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)\n\t\tFlight 784 now boarding at gate...\n\n\tSuddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the\n\tmonotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn\n\tto see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face\n\taverted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago\n\tHulls Sports Duffle Bag.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. PONYTAIL\n\t\tWATCH IT!\n\n\tYOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and\n\tthe man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.\n\n\tJust then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, \"NOOOOOOOOO!\"\n\n\tYOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as\n\tTRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others\n\trunning.  A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks\n\tup at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....\n\t\n\t\t\t\tTERRIFIED TRAVELER\n\t\tJust exactly why did you volunteer?\n\n\tINT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)\n\n\tCOLE comes abruptly awake.  Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS.\n\n\t\t\t\tASTROPHYSICIST\n\t\tWake up, Cole.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tUh, I didn't hear the...\n\n\t\t\t\tMICROBIOLOGIST\n\t\t\t(tapping a pencil on the table)\n\t\tI asked you, why did you volunteer?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tWell, the guard woke me up.  He told me\n\t\tI volunteered.\n\n\tThe SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.\n\n\tCOLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as\n\tthe ENGINEER speaks to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tENGINEER\n\t\tWe appreciate you volunteering.  You're\n\t\ta very good observer, Cole.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tUh, thank you.\n\n\t\t\t\tENGINEER\n\t\tYou'll get a reduction in sentence.\n\n\tCOLE keeps his face impassive.\n\n\t\t\t\tASTROPHYSICIST\n\t\tTo be determined by the proper authorities.\n\n\t\t\t\tENGINEER\n\t\tYou don't want to jeopardize that reduction,\n\t\tdo you, Cole?  Have it taken away?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tNo, sir!\n\n\t\t\t\tASTROPHYSICIST\n\t\tWe have a very advanced program, something\n\t\tvery different, requires very skilled people.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICROBIOLOGIST\n\t\tAn opportunity to reduce your sentence\n\t\tconsiderably...\n\n\t\t\t\tZOOLOGIST\n\t\tAnd possibly play an important role in\n\t\treturning the human race to the surface\n\t\tof the earth.\n\n\t\t\t\tENGINEER\n\t\tWe want tough minded people.  Strong\n\t\tmentally.  We've had some...misfortunes\n\t\twith \"unstable\" types.\n\n\t\t\t\tASTROPHYSICIST\n\t\tFor a man in your position...an opportunity.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOTANIST\n\t\tNot to volunteer could be a real mistake.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICROBIOLOGIST\n\t\t\t(tapping his pencil again)\n\t\tDefinitely a mistake!\n\n\tCOLE gives away nothing.  He's in a box here.  He has no choices.\n\tHe stares at the tapping pencil.\n\n\tINT.  ART GALLERY - NIGHT\n\n\tA strikingly \"real\" world of bright colors.  Extravagant paintings\n\tadorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his\n\tglasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty\n\tseated on folding chairs.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOET\n\t\tStill among the myriad microwaves, the\n\t\tinfra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones\n\t\tand zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally\n\t\tsmall, byte-sized now, tinier even than\n\t\tscience lurking in some vague electricity\n\t\twhere, if we listen we can hear the solitary\n\t\tvoice of that poet telling us,\n\t\t\"We are no other than a moving row\n\t\tOf Magic shadow-shapes that come and go\n\t\tRound with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold\n\t\tIn Midnight by the Master of the show.\"\n\n\tAs the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE\n\tJUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.  Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-\n\teight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses.  She's KATHRYN RAILLY.  And\n\tit's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS.  BEEP!  BEEP!\n\n\t\t\t\tPOET'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\t\"The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\n\t\tMoves on:  nor all your Piety nor Wit\n\t\tShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\n\t\tNor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.\"\n\n\tBEEP!  BEEP!  Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET\n\tlooks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the\n\tbeeper and rises, embarrassed.  As she makes her way to an exit,\n\tthe glaring POET continues...\n\n\t\t\t\tPOET\n\t\t\"Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare;\n\t\tTomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair:\n\t\tDrink!  for you know not whence you came, nor why:\n\t\tDrink!  for you know not why you go, nor where.\"\n\n\tINT.  CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT\n\n\tDETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANKI\n\t\t-- so they get there and they ask the guy\n\t\treal nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets\n\t\tagitated, starts screaming about viruses.\n\t\tTotally irrational, totally disoriented,\n\t\tdoesn't know where he is, what day it is,\n\t\talla that stuff.  All they got was his\n\t\tname.  They figure he's stoned out of\n\t\this mind, it's some kinda psychotic\n\t\tepisode, so they're gonna bring him...\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tHe's been tested for drugs?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANKI\n\t\tNegative for drugs.  But he took on\n\t\tfive cops like he was dusted to the\n\t\teyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?\n\n\tFRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed\n\tglass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.\n\n\tRAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  a MAN, his back to her, in\n\tstrait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded\n\tcell with the distorted intensity of a \"mental case\".\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tYou have him in restraints.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANKI\n\t\tWere you listening?  We got two officers in\n\t\tthe hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus\n\t\tthe medic gave him enough stellazine to kill\n\t\ta horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.\n\n\tRAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW:  the MAN in the cell turns, looks\n\tright at her.  In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly COLE.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tThat would explain the bruises, I\n\t\tguess.  The struggle.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANKI\n\t\tYou want to go in?  Examine him?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tYes, please.  You said he gave a name...\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANKI\n\t\t\t(unlocking the door)\n\t\tJames Cole.  That's everything we got.  None\n\t\tof the James Coles on the computer match him.\n\t\tNo license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing.\n\t\tYou want me to go in with you?\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\t\t(entering)\n\t\tNo, thank you.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANKI\n\t\tI'll be right here...just in case.\n\n\tINT.  ISOLATION CELL\n\n\tCOLE stares at RAILLY.  The environment is intensely real...vivid\n\tcolors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud...\n\tand yet she appears to him almost like a vision.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tMr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly.\n\t\tI'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the\n\t\tCounty -- I don't work for the police.\n\t\tMy only concern is your well being --\n\t\tdo you understand that?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tI need to go now.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tI'm going to be completely honest.  I'm\n\t\tnot going to lie to you.  I can't make\n\t\tthe police let you go...but I do want\n\t\tto help you.  And I want you to trust\n\t\tme.  Can you do that, James?  May I\n\t\tcall you \"James\"?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\t\"James\"!  Nobody ever calls me that.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\t\t(frowns, studies him)\n\t\tHave you been a patient at County?\n\t\tHave I seen you someplace?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tNo, not possible.  Listen, I have to\n\t\tget out of here.  I'm supposed to be\n\t\tgetting information.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tWhat kind of information?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tIt won't help you.  You can't do anything\n\t\tabout it.  You can't change anything.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tChange what?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tI need to go.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tDo you know why you're here, James.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tBecause I'm a good observer.  Because I\n\t\thave a tough mind.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tI see.  You don't remember assaulting a\n\t\tpolice officer...several officers?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tThey wanted identification.  I don't have\n\t\tany identification.  I wasn't trying to\n\t\thurt them.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tYou don't have a driver's license,\n\t\tJames?

POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING\n\n\tCOLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his\n\tankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tWhere are you taking me?\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN #1\n\t\tSouth of France, buddy.

CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY\n\n\tA Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen\n\tprisoners, crawls through a busy street.  The Police Department\n\tlogo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.\n\n\tINT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)\n\n\tFierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future.

We all gonna\n\t\tget along fine if you just relax.\n\n\tCOLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the\n\tlice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.\n\n\tINT.  HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)\n\n\tCOLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the\n\tlarge room.  His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where\n\tlight pours in from outside.  Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON\n\tCOMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.\n\n\tPATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily\n\tat the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.\n\n\tBILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,\n\ta twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLINGS\n\t\tJeffrey.  Yo!  Jeffrey.  This here is James.\n\t\tWhyncha show James around?  Tell him the TV\n\t\trules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t(with a sly look)\n\t\tHow much you gonna pay me?  Huh?  I'd\n\t\tbe doing your job.\n\n\t\t\t\tBILLINGS\n\t\tFive thousand dollars, my man.  That\n\t\tenough?  I'll wire it to your account\n\t\tas usual, okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tOkay, Billings.  Five thousand.  That's\n\t\tenough.  Five thousand dollars.  I'll\n\t\tgive him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.\n\n\tAs BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tKid around, kid around.  It makes them feel\n\t\tgood, we're all pals.  We're prisoners, they're\n\t\tthe guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?\n\n\tCOLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are\n\tplaying cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tHere's the games.  Games vegitize you.\n\t\tIf you play the games, you're\n\t\tvoluntarily taking a tranquilizer.\n\n\tCOLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,\n\tTHE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tWhat'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How\n\t\tmuch?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tI need to make a telephone call.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tA telephone call?  That's communication\n\t\twith the outside world!  Doctor's\n\t\tdiscretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts\n\t\tcould just make phone calls, it could\n\t\tspread.  Insanity oozing through telephone\n\t\tcables, oozing into the ears of all those\n\t\tpoor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos\n\t\teverywhere!  A plague of madness.\n\t\t\t(suddenly sly and confidential)\n\t\tIn fact, very few of us here are actually\n\t\tmentally ill.  I'm not saying you're\n\t\tnot mentally ill, for all I know you're\n\t\tcrazy as a loon.  But that's not why\n\t\tyou're here.  Why you're here is because\n\t\tof the system, because of the economy.\n\t\t\t(indicating the TV)\n\t\tThere's the TV.  It's all right there.\n\t\tCommercials.  We are not productive\n\t\tanymore, they don't need us to make\n\t\tthings anymore, it's all automated.  What\n\t\tare we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay,\n\t\tbuy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.\n\t\tBut if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you\n\t\tknow what?  You're mentally ill! That's\n\t\ta fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet\n\t\tpaper, new cars, computerized blenders,\n\t\telectrically operated sexual devices...\n\t\t\t(getting hysterical)\n\t\tSCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN\n\t\tRADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH\n\t\tBRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-\n\t\tACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...\n\n\tA woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she's helping.\n\n\t\t\t\tTERRY\n\t\tTake it easy, Jeffrey.  Be calm.\n\n\tAbruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and\n\tcontinues, completely calm now.  But COLE isn't listening.  He's\n\tmesmerized by the TV.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tSo if you want to watch a particular\n\t\tprogram, say \"All My Children\" or\n\t\tsomething, you go to the Charge Nurse\n\t\tand tell her what day and time the show\n\t\tyou want to see is on.  But you have to\n\t\ttell her before the show is scheduled\n\t\tto be on.  There was this one guy who\n\t\twas always requesting shows that had already\n\t\tplayed.  He couldn't quite grasp the\n\t\tidea that the Charge Nurse couldn't\n\t\tjust make it be yesterday for him, turn\n\t\tback time ha ha.  What a fruitcake!!\n\n\tThis last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and\n\the turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tSeriously, more and more people are\n\t\tbeing defined now as mentally ill.  Why?\n\t\tBecause they're not consuming on their\n\t\town.  But as patients, they becone\n\t\tconsumers of mental health care.  And\n\t\tthis gives the so-called sane people work!\n\t\t\t(hysteria again)\n\t\tWHOOO!  SHOCK THERAPY!  GROUP THERAPY!\n\t\tHALLUCINATIONS!  THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!\n\t\tIGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG!  PERFECT!  THE\n\t\tSYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...\n\n\t\t\t\tTERRY\n\t\tOkay, that's it, Jeffrey, you're gonna\n\t\tget a shot.  I warned you...\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t(calming himself, smiling)\n\t\tRight!  Right!  Carried away, heh heh.\n\t\tI got \"carried away\".

PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)\n\n\tCOLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tThis is a place for crazy people!  I'm\n\t\tnot crazy!\n\n\tRAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY'S best\n\tfriend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sit\n\taround a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facing\n\tthe doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him.  (Some of the DOCTORS\n\tbear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)\n\n\t\t\t\tRESIDENT #1\n\t\tWe don't use that term...\"crazy\", Mr. Cole.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tWell, you've got some real nuts in here!\n\t\tListen to me, all of you -- I have to\n\t\ttell you something that's going to be\n\t\tdifficult for you to understand, but...\n\n\t\t\t\tDR.

Do you\n\t\tknow what year it is right now?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\t1989.  Look, I'm not confused.  There's been\n\t\ta mistake, I've been sent to the wrong place.\n\n\tSuddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLE\n\tis just grabbing a pad and pencil.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tHey, I'm not going to hurt anybody.\n\n\tFLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\t\t(drawing)\n\t\tDo any of you know anything about the\n\t\tArmy of the Twelve Monkeys?  They paint\n\t\tthis, stencil it, on buildings, all\n\t\tover the place.\n\n\tCOLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.\n\n\t\t\t\tDR. CASEY\n\t\tMr. Cole...\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tRight.  I guess you wouldn't, this is\n\t\t1989, they're probably not active yet.\n\t\tThat makes sense!  Okay.  Listen to me,\n\t\tthree billion people died in 1995.\n\t\tThree billion, got that?  Almost\n\t\tthe whole population.  Of the world!\n\t\tOnly about one percent survived.\n\n\tDOCTORS exchange knowing looks.  This is an old story, apparently.\n\n\t\t\t\tRESIDENT #2\n\t\tAre you going to save us, Mr. Cole?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tSave you?  How can I save you?  It\n\t\talready happened!  I can't save you.

I'm a convict,\n\t\tsure, I have a quick temper, but I'm as\n\t\tsane as anyone in this room.  I...\n\n\tCOLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil.  COLE'S seen\n\tthat tapping before -- in the future!  It disorients him.\n\n\t\t\t\tDR. RAILLY\n\t\tCan you tell us the name of the prison\n\t\tyou've come from?\n\n\tCOLE doesn't answer.  He's staring at the tapping pencil.\n\n\t\t\t\tDR. FLETCHER\n\t\tDoes this bother you, Mr. Cole?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\t\t(recovering, new tack)\n\t\tNo!  Look, I don't belong here!

Send you to the future?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tNo, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called,\n\t\t\"voice mail\".

Look, I've been given\n\t\ta lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid.\n\t\tYou have to let me use the phone.  One call!\n\n\tCOLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.\n\n\tINT.  LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY\n\n\tFour little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS\n\tinsistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER\n\tlunges for the phone, answers sharply...\n\n\t\t\t\tMOTHER\n\t\tYes?\n\t\t\t(listens, frowns, then)\n\t\tWhaaaaat?  \"Voice mail\"!

Sympathetically,\n\tRAILLY takes it from him.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tIt wasn't who you expected?\n\n\tCOLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset.  Nuts?\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tIt was some lady.  She didn't know anything.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tPerhaps it was a wrong number...\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tNo.  That's the reason they chose me --\n\t\tI remember things.\n\n\tRAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.\n\tIt's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool,\n\tdetached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tJames, where did you grow up?

The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!\n\n\tJust then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure.  It's\n\tthe BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured.  He's\n\tsprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his\n\tmoustache slightly askew!\n\n\tA sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out!  Then, DAZZLING LIGHT.\n\tEverything goes white!\n\n\tINT.  DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT\n\n\tCOLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.\n\n\tHe's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward.  Disoriented.\n\tWhich world is this?  The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,\n\toccasional MOANS.  He can barely discern the shadowy figures of\n\tan ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.\n\n\tHis eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.\n\n\tHe turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.\n\n\tWith a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of\n\tbed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single\n\ttree.  Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.\n\n\tANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tIt won't work. You can't open it.\n\n\tAlarmed, COLE turns, sees JEFFREY in the next bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tYou think you can remove the grill but\n\t\tyou can't.  It's welded.\n\n\tCOLE checks the grill anyway.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tSee?  I toldja.  And all the doors are\n\t\tlocked, too.  They're protecting the\n\t\tpeople on the outside from us.  But the\n\t\tpeople outside are as crazy as us.\n\n\tCOLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along\n\tthe window sill.  He's staring at it when he's distracted by a\n\tsudden SOUND.  Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed\n\tjust as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with\n\tthe blade of his flashlight.\n\n\tANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.\n\n\tThe flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.\n\n\tFor a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,\n\tSNORES, occasional MOANS.  Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse\n\twhisper, picking up right where he left off.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tYou know what \"crazy\" is?  \"crazy\" is\n\t\t\"majority rules\".  Take germs for example.\n\n\tAlthough COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get\n\tout of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, \"germs\"!\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tGerms?!\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\tIn the 18th century there was no such\n\t\tthing!

He tries to convince people...\n\t\tother doctors mostly...that there are\n\t\tthese teeny tiny invisible \"bad things\"\n\t\tcalled germs that get into your body and\n\t\tmake you...sick!  He's trying to get\n\t\tdoctors to wash their hands.  What is\n\t\tthis guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible\n\t\twhaddayou call 'em?...\"germs\"!\n\n\tAs JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to\n\tfigure out where to put the SPIDER.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEFFREY (cont.)\n\t\tSo cut to the 20th century!  Last week\n\t\tin fact, right before I got dragged\n\t\tinto this hellhole.  I order a burger\n\t\tin this fast food joint.  The waiter\n\t\tdrops it on the floor.  He picks it up,\n\t\twipes it off, hands it to me...like it\n\t\twas all okay.\n\n\tNo alternative.

On the screen is\n\ta slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in\n\tapparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained\n\tby PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE\n\tof this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tAccording to the accounts of local\n\t\tofficials at that time, this gentleman,\n\t\tjudged to be about forty years of age,\n\t\tappeared suddenly in the village of Wyle\n\t\tnear Stonehenge in the West of England in\n\t\tApril of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words and\n\t\tspeaking in a strange accent, the man made\n\t\tdire prognostications about a pestilence\n\t\twhich he predicted would wipe out humanity\n\t\tin approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and\n\t\thysterical, the man raped a young woman of the\n\t\tvillage, was taken into custody, but then\n\t\tmysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.\n\n\tWE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern\n\tin a pool of light.  She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the\n\tengraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing\n\tscenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an\n\taudience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAILLY (cont.)\n\t\tIn 1841, Mackay wrote, \"During seasons\n\t\tof great pestilence, men have often\n\t\tbelieved the prophecies of crazed\n\t\tfanatics, that the end of the world was\n\t\tcome.\"  Obviously, this plague/doomsday\n\t\tscenario is considerably more compelling\n\t\twhen reality supports it in some form,\n\t\twhether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,\n\t\tor AIDS.  In addition to these \"natural\"\n\t\tcontagions, there are now technological\n\t\thorrors as well:  besides radiation,\n\t\tconsider our lurking fear of germ\n\t\twarfare and its close approximation,\n\t\tchemical warfare, which first reared\n\t\tits ugly head in the deadly mustard\n\t\tgas attacks during the First World War.\n\n\tON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I\n\tSOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)\n\t\tDuring such an attack in the French\n\t\ttrenches in October, 1917, we have an\n\t\taccount of this soldier...\n\n\tON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows\n\tJOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried\n\tby SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appears\n\tto be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until\n\tthe image approximates Munch's famous painting.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.)\n\t\t-- who, during an assault, was wounded\n\t\tby shrapnel and hospitalized behind the\n\t\tlines where Doctors discovered he had\n\t\tlost all comprehension of French but\n\t\tspoke English fluently, albeit in a\n\t\tregional dialect they didn't recognize.\n\t\tThe man, although physically unaffected\n\t\tby the gas, was hysterical.  He claimed\n\t\the had come from the future, that he was\n\t\tlooking for a pure germ that would\n\t\tultimately wipe mankind off the face of\n\t\tthe earth in the year... 1995!\n\n\tThe AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.\n\n\tON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This time\n\the's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)\n\t\tAlthough seriously injured, the young\n\t\tsoldier disappeared from the hospital\n\t\tbefore more data could be gathered.  No\n\t\tdoubt, he was trying to carry on his\n\t\tmission to warn others, substituting\n\t\tfor the agony of war...a self-inflicted\n\t\tagony we call the \"Cassandra Complex\".\n\n\tAs RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,\n\tRAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening\n\tattentively.  Further away, another MAN listens intently.  A MAN with\n\tshoulder-length carrot-colored hair.  His name is DR. PETERS.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY (cont.)\n\t\tCassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,\n\t\twas condemned to know the future but to be\n\t\tdisbelieved when she foretold it.  Hence,\n\t\tthe agony of foreknowledge combined with\n\t\timpotence to do anything about it.\n\n\tINT.  RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)\n\n\tA stack of new books.

In this\n\t\tcontext, isn't it obvious that \"Chicken\n\t\tLittle\" represents the sane vision and\n\t\tthat Homo Sapiens' motto, \"Let's go\n\t\tshopping!\" is the cry of the true lunatic?\n\n\tDR.

He pulls a\n\trazor and shaving soap from a paper bag, then goes into the\n\tbathroom, leaving the door open, and starts to shave.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOLE\n\t\tYou were in my dream just now.

I\n\t\tdon't want to go back.\n\n\tRAILLY's astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the\n\tchoice he's made.  Given up the future (if it exists, and it's\n\tlooking like it does)!  Risking his life to be with her!  For\n\tthis brief time!  She's overwhelmed, lips trembling, tears\n\twelling in her eyes.  But just then, the SOUNDS of SHOUTS and\n\tfeet THUNDERING up the stairs snap her back to reality.\n\n\tINT.  STAIRWELL/GLOBE HOTEL\n\n\tCOPS' boots THUNDER up the stairwell.\n\n\tINT.

BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n\tA city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the\n\ttoney downtown shopping district.  Among them, RAILLY looks\n\tfurtively left and right, COLE on her heels.  She's hidden her\n\tbruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody\n\thandkerchief to his mouth.\n\n\tAs he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling\n\tcity, the tall downtown buildings.  His eyes go up.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  a building, towering toward the sky.  A building\n\twith a ledge.  The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!!\n\n\tANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed\n\tentrance to a store.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tWait here.  I'm going to try that phone\n\t\tnumber.  Let's hope it's nothing!\n\n\tDazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches\n\ther hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made\n\tintermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES\n\tlooming frighteningly close.\n\n\tA BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display\n\twindow.  Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away\n\n\tRecovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size\n\ttoy in the display window.  Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into\n\tthe phone.\n\n\tANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a\n\tpanhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand.  Confused, COLE stares\n\tat the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating\n\tBUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him,\n\teyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY\n\t\tJames!  James!  It's okay.  We're\n\t\tinsane!
