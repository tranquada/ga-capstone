COLE'S breath comes quicker\n\tnow as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.\n\n\tOn the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.\n\tCOLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It\n\n<b>\tINT.

CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)\n</b>\n\tA SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved\n\taside.  COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET:  a city in\n\tmoonlight!  A surreal image of abandoned buildings.  No people\n\tanywhere.  The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.\n\n<b>\tEXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)\n</b>\n\tCOLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMoving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for\n\tsomething.  Finds it.  An insect.\n\n\tCOLE takes the bug in his gloved hand.  As he clumsily inserts it\n\tinto a collection tube, something makes him turn.\n\n\tThere's something across the street in the dark.  Something alive.\n\n\tCOLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR!  Startled by the\n\tlight, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.\n\n\tANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThen, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the\n\tflashlight, it pads quickly down the street.\n\n<b>\tINT.

DOGSHIT!\n\n\tThe only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.\n\n\tThen, a different SOUND.  GRRRR!  A dog.  More GRRRRS.  More\n\tdogs.  Then, a YIP.  Then, VICIOUS GROWLS.  It's a DOGFIGHT!\n\n<b>\tEXT.  STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)\n</b>\n\tA giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings\n\tand lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.\n\n\tBelow, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted\n\tbuildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.\n\n<b>\tINT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)\n</b>\n\tCOLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store.  A large\n\tSPIDER tries to hide from the light.\n\n\tCOLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and\n\tputs it into one of his specimen tubes.\n\n\tThen, he shines his light all around the once elegant store.  There's\n\tnothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.\n\n<b>\tEXT.  DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN\n</b>\n\tAs COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the\n\tbuilding.  COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled\n\tlogo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle.  Over it is\n\twritten, \"WE DID IT!\"\n\n\tCOLE looks up.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  high up on a building across the street, a LION\n\tpatrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTTTLES END\n</b>\n<b>\tINT.  FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT\n</b>\n\tROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the\n\twall, pummel the still-suited COLE.\n\n<b>\tINT.  SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT\n</b>\n\tStark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on\n\tlong poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING\n\tFIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their\n\twindowed masks.  It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,\n\tdripping walls.  From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,\n\n\t\t\t\tAMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tRaise your arms above your head.\n\n\tCOLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.\n\n<b>\tINT.  TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)\n</b>\n\tStill naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN\n\tin a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws\n\tblood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.\n\n\tCOLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque \"window\" of thick\n\tplastic in the rusty iron wall.  VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk\n\tbehind the translucent aperture, studying him.\n\n\tThe TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.\n\n<b>\tINT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT\n</b>\n\tUshered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.\n\n\tCOLE'S POV:  wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...\n\ta blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces\n\theaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with\n\tstring, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a\n\tdilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering\n\tbooks and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference\n\ttable, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS:  an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,\n\tBOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST.  They represent\n\ta \"modern\" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,\n\toutdated, patched-together technologies.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTINY\n</b>\t\tJames Cole.

Right now, we want to know\n\t\teverything that you saw.\n\n<b>\tINT.  ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)\n</b>\n\tCOLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard\n\tsketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tASTPOPHYSICIST\n</b>\t\tWhere you collected sample #4, what\n\t\tstreet was that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOLE\n</b>\t\tUh...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOTANIST\n</b>\t\tIt's important to observe everything.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOLE\n</b>\t\tI think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.\n\n\tAs the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,\n\tCOLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the\n\twall.  One headline screams, \"VIRUS MUTATING!\"  Another features\n\ta photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on)\n\tand the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, \"IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE\".\n\n\t\t\t\tASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tClose your eyes, Cole.\n\n\tStartled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.\n\n\tBLACKNESS.

How old were you when you\n\t\tleft the surface?\n\n\tThe VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.\n\tSYSTEM at the airport.\n\n<b>\tINT.  CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY\n</b>\n\tTHE DREAM AGAIN!  But at an earlier moment.  YOUNG COLE, flanked\n\tby his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE\n\tland through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse\n\tleading to the departure gates.\n\n\t\t\t\tP.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)\n\t\tFlight 784 now boarding at gate...\n\n\tSuddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the\n\tmonotonous airport routine.  As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn\n\tto see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face\n\taverted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago\n\tHulls Sports Duffle Bag.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR.

A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks\n\tup at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTERRIFIED TRAVELER\n</b>\t\tJust exactly why did you volunteer?\n\n<b>\tINT.

Extravagant paintings\n\tadorn the walls.  A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his\n\tglasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty\n\tseated on folding chairs.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPOET\n</b>\t\tStill among the myriad microwaves, the\n\t\tinfra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones\n\t\tand zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally\n\t\tsmall, byte-sized now, tinier even than\n\t\tscience lurking in some vague electricity\n\t\twhere, if we listen we can hear the solitary\n\t\tvoice of that poet telling us,\n\t\t\"We are no other than a moving row\n\t\tOf Magic shadow-shapes that come and go\n\t\tRound with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold\n\t\tIn Midnight by the Master of the show.\"\n\n\tAs the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE\n\tJUNKIES or BOHEMIANS.

On the screen is\n\ta slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in\n\tapparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained\n\tby PEASANTS.  The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE\n\tof this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)\n\t\tAccording to the accounts of local\n\t\tofficials at that time, this gentleman,\n\t\tjudged to be about forty years of age,\n\t\tappeared suddenly in the village of Wyle\n\t\tnear Stonehenge in the West of England in\n\t\tApril of 1162.  Using unfamiliar words and\n\t\tspeaking in a strange accent, the man made\n\t\tdire prognostications about a pestilence\n\t\twhich he predicted would wipe out humanity\n\t\tin approximately 8OO years.  Deranged and\n\t\thysterical, the man raped a young woman of the\n\t\tvillage, was taken into custody, but then\n\t\tmysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.\n\n\tWE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern\n\tin a pool of light.  She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the\n\tengraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing\n\tscenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an\n\taudience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAILLY (cont.)\n\t\tIn 1841, Mackay wrote, \"During seasons\n\t\tof great pestilence, men have often\n\t\tbelieved the prophecies of crazed\n\t\tfanatics, that the end of the world was\n\t\tcome.\"  Obviously, this plague/doomsday\n\t\tscenario is considerably more compelling\n\t\twhen reality supports it in some form,\n\t\twhether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,\n\t\tor AIDS.  In addition to these \"natural\"\n\t\tcontagions, there are now technological\n\t\thorrors as well:  besides radiation,\n\t\tconsider our lurking fear of germ\n\t\twarfare and its close approximation,\n\t\tchemical warfare, which first reared\n\t\tits ugly head in the deadly mustard\n\t\tgas attacks during the First World War.\n\n\tON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I\n\tSOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)\n\t\tDuring such an attack in the French\n\t\ttrenches in October, 1917, we have an\n\t\taccount of this soldier...\n\n\tON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows\n\tJOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried\n\tby SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack.  JOSE appears\n\tto be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until\n\tthe image approximates Munch's famous painting.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.)\n\t\t-- who, during an assault, was wounded\n\t\tby shrapnel and hospitalized behind the\n\t\tlines where Doctors discovered he had\n\t\tlost all comprehension of French but\n\t\tspoke English fluently, albeit in a\n\t\tregional dialect they didn't recognize.\n\t\tThe man, although physically unaffected\n\t\tby the gas, was hysterical.  He claimed\n\t\the had come from the future, that he was\n\t\tlooking for a pure germ that would\n\t\tultimately wipe mankind off the face of\n\t\tthe earth in the year... 1995!\n\n\tThe AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.\n\n\tON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE.  This time\n\the's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.\n\n\t\t\t\tRAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)\n\t\tAlthough seriously injured, the young\n\t\tsoldier disappeared from the hospital\n\t\tbefore more data could be gathered.  No\n\t\tdoubt, he was trying to carry on his\n\t\tmission to warn others, substituting\n\t\tfor the agony of war...a self-inflicted\n\t\tagony we call the \"Cassandra Complex\".\n\n\tAs RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,\n\tRAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening\n\tattentively.
