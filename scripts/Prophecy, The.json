All in black, mostly elderly, they \n               kneel in prayer.\n\n               Before them, on the cramped altar, lies a man. Dressed in \n               the uniform of a general, surrounded by the silk softness of \n               his casket.\n\n               He's an old man, far from the crump of battles, consumed now \n               with stillness, listening to the prayers of old people. Of \n               desert wind, moaning through thin wood.\n\n               The candle beside his head flickers and wanes in the ceaseless \n               gusts, strains for life, then goes out.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NIGHT\n\n               It's not the best part of town and probably never was. A \n               place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting \n               fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad \n               drainage. It's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure \n               enters.\n\n               Wearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he \n               pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the \n               flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing Mexican \n               radio stations. One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, \n               catches his gaze.\n\n               There's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long-coated \n               figure effortlessly pops up onto. Sunglasses focused on the \n               window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch, \n               on the railing with the ease of a crow. Or a gargoyle.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               Dawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve \n               the alley. The figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle \n               perched on the railing. Watching the window.\n\n               The shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's \n               movement behind the window.\n\n               The sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up \n               to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing.\n\n               BEHIND THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW\n\n               Is a room as grim as we expect. Lumpy iron bed, sink that's \n               been pissed into one too many times, and SIMON; a man in a \n               tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets \n               on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary \n               column.\n\n               Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body \n               stifffening. He whips around to face the window just as it \n               EXPLODES into fragments.\n\n               The gargoyle LEAPS into the room on the trail of glass. Simon \n               spins and THROWS himself against the intruder. The two \n               STRUGGLE savagely across the room, SMASHING chairs.\n\n               Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the \n               back of his skull against the wall. The gargoyle gets his \n               locked fists up and SWINGS them like a war club, SMACKING \n               Simon's face and SPRAWLING him backwards onto the bed.\n\n               The two, across the room for each other, pause.\n\n                                     GARGOYLE\n                         Where is it?\n\n               Simon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now \n               walking slow circles around each other.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Leave me alone.\n\n                                     GARGOYLE\n                         You've found it, haven't you?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Fuck you.\n\n               The gargoyle drops his head and DRIVES himself into Simon, \n               who HAMMERS the gargoyle with his fists. Blood SMEARS.\n\n               The gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he JAMS into Simon's \n               leg. Pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle SLAMS Simon \n               up against the wall. He TEARS open Simon's shirt, digging \n               his fingers into the chest, RIPPING the skin aside, the first \n               plunging deep, CRACKING the sternum bone, pushing even \n               further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath --\n\n               -- Simon PLOWS his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. Over \n               and over. Till the grip loosens and Simon SHOVES him to one \n               side, using the momentum and drives to SWING the body around \n               and at the shattered window. The gargoyle SMACKS the frame \n               and COLLAPSES, his head CRACKING on the sill and FORCING a \n               shard of glass through his neck.\n\n               Simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's \n               sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. Pushing \n               his thumbs into them, Simon uses the leverage to lift the \n               gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window.\n\n               The gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread-\n               eagles thirty feet to the asphalt.\n\n               Somebody turns up their Mexican radio station.\n\n               The gargoyle's a wreck.\n\n               But he manages, slowly -- his shattered remains arguing every \n               inch -- to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his \n               feet. A bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to \n               stumble three or four feet before being HIT by a freeway-\n               speed firebird BOMBING down the alley.\n\n               The impact PINS the gargoyle to the grill and RAMS him into \n               a brick wall, CRUSHING a chest that BELCHES out a sickly, \n               bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's \n               windshield.\n\n               THREE FLOORS ABOVE\n\n               Simon leans against his splintered window and looks down at \n               the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. His own \n               shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing \n               is difficult. Pain flashes across his forehead as he checks \n               that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of \n               his nose.\n\n               At the sound of a distant siren Simon turns and quickly \n               finishes packing his duffle bag. Stiffly pulling on an \n               oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage \n               beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               The gargoyle, still pinned to the wall by the firebird.\n\n               A FLASH bounces off his skin. Then another. He's being \n               photographed. Go wide and find him in the middle of a police \n               investigation. Bored blue uniforms, yellow barrier tape. The \n               usual.\n\n               A plain jane sedan pulls up and deposits THOMAS DAGGET, \n               thirties, tweed coat and steel notebook. He smiles at a couple \n               of cops, ducks under the yellow barrier, and nods a greeting \n               to an older uniform sergeant, BURROWS.\n\n                                     THOMAS DAGGET\n                         Hey.\n\n                                     BURROWS\n                         Hey.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                              (looks up at sky)\n                         Thought those clouds this morning \n                         spelled rain for sure, but it's turned \n                         into a beautiful day, wouldn't you \n                         say, Sergeant Burrows?\n\n               Thomas takes a deep, healthy breath.

Before the night swallows it all whole,\n\n               Come upon The Town.\n\n               It used to be something. But that's long gone. Now, wrapped \n               in the sucking blackness of a wilderness night, it's a shell \n               of a place.\n\n               Lights still burn in some of the windows but fool no one. \n               The ghosts are the majority here. Biding their time. Waiting \n               for The Town to surrender and slip beneath the waves of the \n               desert.\n\n               The wind slinks over the hills, creeps down past boarded-up \n               storefronts, skeletal ocitillo, and the rusting hulks of \n               abandoned mining equipment. The corpse of a summer's kite \n               twists slowly on a power line.\n\n               ON THE EDGE OF TOWN\n\n               From the inky oblivion of the road, comes a crunch of gravel.\n\n               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN\n\n               Stands a large, nineteenth century brick schoolhouse. An \n               icon from a more prosperous past, its dark massiveness was \n               meant for scores of ruddy-faced miner's kids. Now it seems \n               to be imploding, eating itself with creeping decay. On this \n               night it is silent and dark but for a small glow in one corner \n               and the faint sound of children's voices in song.\n\n               It is a hymn. An ancient, Latin one. The melancholy beauty \n               of voices rising and falling in choir.\n\n               INSIDE THE BUILDING\n\n               Is a school auditorium. On the stage, dwarfed by it, are \n               twenty five students from first grade to high school, singing \n               together as a choir. A young woman, KATHERINE, directs their \n               acapella voices as the small group of parents, lonely in the \n               huge room, look on.\n\n               OUTSIDE\n\n               The voices drift on the night, down the road, and lap against \n               the peeling facade of a storefront. A mortuary.\n\n               INSIDE\n\n               The rooms are dark but for one. There, bathed in the \n               flickering light of a tall candle, lies the body of the old \n               general we saw at the opening.\n\n               THE FRONT DOOR\n\n               Of the mortuary has a locked handle that jiggles from outside. \n               A small panes of glass beside it is BROKEN by a hand.\n\n               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM\n\n               Young voices struggle with the complicated hymn and its pain \n               of centuries. Faces white, Mexican, Navaho. Katherine guides \n               them with soft hands. She smiles in pride. They smile back. \n               Proud. Of her. Of themselves and the beauty coming from their \n               mouths.\n\n               One small, beautiful navaho girl, MARY, maybe eight, gets a \n               special smile of special friendship from Katherine.\n\n               THE MORTUARY'S\n\n               Front door now stands ajar in the darkness. Small shards of \n               glass glisten in the carpet.\n\n               INSIDE\n\n               Is the dead General. Even in the bleached ravages of age and \n               death, his face still holds a shadow of vigor and pride.\n\n               It takes a moment in the weak flicker of the candle to realize \n               someone is there with him. Simon in his oversized surplus \n               jacket. His arms are folded tightly across his middle, as if \n               in deep cold. But his gaunt face is moist with sweat and his \n               breath is shallow and uneven. He stares at the old man behind \n               sunglasses and takes slow, cautious steps forward into the \n               amber glow.\n\n               Holding out two blood-stained fingers, Simon touches the \n               General's forehead. A new strain crosses his perspiring face. \n               Concentration.\n\n               Placing his right palm on the General's chin and the left on \n               his forehead, Simon CRACKS OPEN the dead man's mouth.\n\n               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM\n\n               The hymn is reaching its aching climax of medieval longing.\n\n               IN THE MORTUARY\n\n               Simon leans down to the open mouth, and in a voice soft and \n               deeply weary,\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Qui ex Patre Flioque procedit...\n\n               Then, with the school choir distant and faint in the night, \n               the living man places his mouth over that of the dead man...\n\n               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM\n\n               It's coffee and cake now as parents proudly hug their children \n               and congratulate their young teacher. Even in this gloomy, \n               crumbling building it's a warm, small town moment.\n\n               OUTSIDE\n\n               Simon has left the mortuary and now limps with difficulty \n               through the silent streets, leaning against shop walls for \n               support.\n\n               AT THE SCHOOL BUILDING\n\n               Through the doors out steps the eight year old Navaho girl, \n               Mary. Alone, she stands on the stone stairs and looks out \n               into the night with sensitive eyes. She concentrates. Knows.\n\n               Katherine follows her out.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Hey bright eyes, what's the deal \n                         being out here all alone without a \n                         coat?\n\n               The girl's eyes seem too serious for a child's. Too \n               perceptive.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Someone's here.\n\n               Katherine looks out into the night.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Where?\n\n               Mary stares a moment longer, then becomes a child again, \n               smiling and popping Katherine one on the arm.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Pig out on all the cake?\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Oh, there might be one, tiny, skinny \n                         piece left, but you're gonna have to \n                         race me for it.\n\n               Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         What's that?\n\n               When Katherine turns Mary dashes back into the building.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Ha!\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         You little sneak!\n\n               Katherine chases after her.\n\n               AT THAT MOMENT\n\n               Simon comes limping up from the road. His breathing's bad \n               now as he moves stiffly along the school's brick walls, coming \n               to an old, rusty back door he creaks open and slides through.\n\n               INSIDE\n\n               He climbs a littered and disused staircase, past broken beer \n               bottles and condom wrappers to a dark and creaky second floor.\n\n               It's part of the school building long abandoned. Doors to \n               classrooms lie half off their hinges, windows are broken, \n               rats squeak between ancient desks stacked like funeral pyres.\n\n               Simon, his breath echoing in the cold darkness, shuffles \n               along the broken linoleum till he comes to a rectangle cut \n               in the wall where a row of lockers used to be. He crawls \n               into the space and there, surrounded by rot, curls up on \n               himself and sucks his thumb.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. APARTMENT\n\n               Thomas Dagget's eyes opening slowly. He sits up in his bed, \n               runs a hand through his hair, and looks out with only medium \n               enthusiasm at the morning.\n\n               INT. CHURCH\n\n               Thomas lights an offering candle and kneels for a brief, \n               silent prayer. He crosses himself, stands, and walks for the \n               door. Before leaving he glances back at the altar. A \n               questioning moment between two akward, estranged friends.\n\n               INT. POLICE CENTER\n\n               Thomas sits at his desk half-heartily trying to make sense \n               of the three dozen files piled there. Lt.

Wearing levis and boots, she \n               carries a saddle swung over one denim shoulder out to a corral \n               behind the house where a horse shuffles and whinnies \n               impatiently.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         In a minute, in a minute...\n\n               Katherine throws the saddle over the horse and cinches it \n               down as the sun, still tucked behind pink and grey cliffs, \n               begins to heat up the sky.\n\n               EXT. SANDSTONE CANYON - MORNING\n\n               Deep and narrow, an idyllic canyon of compressed sandstone \n               walls smoothed, rounded and etched by centuries of wind. A \n               tiny creek flows past weak banks of scrub pine and pocked \n               sycamore. A silent place a long way and a long time from \n               anything but the approach of galloping hooves.\n\n               Katherine and her horse run full-out through the canyon, the \n               clack and splash of hooves echoing off steep, shadowed walls. \n               Horse and rider drive each other harder and harder, their \n               hot breath brief clouds in the arch, thin desert air.\n\n               Boulders shattered by winter cold and summer heat, deep wind-\n               cut caves hiding scorpions, sidewinders, or a wary mountain \n               lion all pass as in a blur; arrogant hawks and patient \n               buzzards, ruins of thousand year old Anasazi villages high \n               on the cliffs, their weather-beaten skulls, seen and unseen, \n               staring out; everything is one smear of color and smell as \n               Katherine gallops past them and up the cliff trail, out of \n               the canyon, and onto the main plateau.\n\n               ON THE PLATEAU\n\n               Katherine strokes her horse and feeds it a bag of carrots. \n               She pulls a thermos from the pack, sits down against some \n               old man rocks, and with the coffee steaming in her hand, \n               greets the sun now cresting the Chuska Mountains.\n\n               There's a rutted, silty dirt road nearby. An ancient, battered \n               school bus rattles its way past and stops.

All twenty-five of them. \n               There's high school age sons of white ranchers, Navaho girls \n               on the edge of puberty, tiny Mexican children. All being \n               taught together in one room.\n\n               It's dinosaur day. Katherine has a large fossilized bone on \n               her lap.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         This is \"Camposaurus\". Camposaurus \n                         was a herbavore, which meant he only \n                         ate plants. Camposaur stayed mostly \n                         to himself and never bothered anyone.\n\n               The little girls smile. They like Camposaurus. Katherine \n               holds up another bone fragment.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         This is a leg fragment that belongs \n                         to the killer of the plateau, \n                         Alosaurus. Alosaurus was a vicious \n                         carnivore, which meant he'd eat \n                         anything that moved, especially nice, \n                         juicy Camposaurs.\n\n               The little boys grin. They like Alosaurus.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Both these guys lived together right \n                         here on the White Rock plateau eighty \n                         million years ago, when this area \n                         used to be on the banks of a huge, \n                         shallow sea. Remember how we talked \n                         about how sedimentation fossilizes \n                         bones? That's also what made the \n                         hills out behind our town and put \n                         the copper in the ground.\n\n                                     HIGH SCHOOL KID\n                         Lot of good that did us.\n\n               Katherine lifts off the desk an ancient 1950s gieger counter \n               and switches it on. It ticks softly when she points it at \n               the dino bone.\n\n                                     BOY\n                         It's radioactive!

Uranium, that's the rock they \n                         use in nuclear power plants --\n\n                                     BOY\n                         And bombs!\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         And bombs Alex, yes, is all through \n                         these hills naturally. Millions of \n                         years ago the dinosaurs here ate \n                         plants and drank water which had \n                         uranium in it that became concentrated \n                         in their bones, which is exactly \n                         how, with Mr. Geiger counter here, \n                         we're going to find some.\n\n               The class CHEERS.\n\n               EXT. HILL - DAY\n\n               With the brick schoolhouse tiny in the background, Katherine's \n               class trudges its way up the barren, rocky hillside behind \n               the town. The teenage rancher's kids try to make time with \n               the Mexican girls One of the little boys has gotten into a \n               shoving match with a little girl.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                              (coming between them)\n                         -- Hey. Come on. What's the deal, \n                         Brian?\n\n               The girl folds her arms defiantly. The boy is pissed, \n               embarrassed.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         She...\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Yes?\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         ...She, she called me a \"Dick Head\".\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Sandra?\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Well, he is.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         All right, Brian.

Focusing grimly on the rock in front of her, \n               Mary guides the detector over the stones till suddenly it \n               begins clicking softly.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         I got one!

Don't break it.\n\n               Almost immediately, an eye socket appears in the dust.\n\n               As the students carefully brush away the dust, Katherine \n               looks back across the crumbly path. A coyote has crept up \n               onto a near ledge. It just stands there. Watching her.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. BIG CITY CHURCH\n\n               It's mostly empty at this time of day and the young man \n               sitting in the pew, staring at the altar, is alone. His name \n               is GABRIEL and he wears jeans, a faded leather jacket, and \n               dark sunglasses, even inside. His thin hair is slicked back \n               and there's an almost feminine quality about him.\n\n               He sits there a moment longer, staring, then gets up and \n               leaves.\n\n               EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY\n\n               The alley from the beginning. Gabriel pulls his old, \n               convertible rambler to a stop and walks into the flophouse.\n\n               INT. FLOPHOUSE\n\n               He comes upstairs to the landing, where the door to the room \n               is covered with a strip of yellow tape: POLICE INVESTIGATION. \n               DO NOT ENTER.\n\n               Gabriel pulls the tape aside and KICKS the door open.\n\n               INSIDE\n\n               It's still the disaster we remember. Gabriel walks slowly \n               through the room. He scratches up some blood, tastes it.\n\n               There's spray-painted outlines where the police have removed \n               certain items. Gabriel takes note of this, tastes the blood \n               again, and leaves.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. KATHERINE'S CLASSROOM BUILDING - DAY\n\n               It's lunch break. Most of the students sit in loose cliques \n               around the front of the building; eating, skipping rope, \n               picking fights.\n\n               INSIDE\n\n               The recently unearthed skull sits on Katherine's desk. Feet \n               up beside it, she leans back in her chair looking through a \n               dinosaur book. One of her students, a twelve year old boy, \n               finishes cleaning up the floor and stands beside her.\n\n                                     BOY\n                         I'm all done with the cleaning, Miss \n                         Henley.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Thank you, Jason.

Thanks. See ya.\n\n               Katherine watches him leave, smiles again, and goes back to \n               the book.\n\n               AROUND THE BACK OF THE BUILDING\n\n               On the abandoned back stairs, a couple of Mexican boys sit \n               smoking cigarettes. They whistle and kid with the four young \n               girls that pass them going up the steps.\n\n               UPSTAIRS\n\n               Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building. The four \n               girls know they're not supposed to be here and that's probably \n               half the fun. They run through the crumbling halls, giggling \n               and hiding from one another. Their cries, the smack of their \n               shoes, echo off off the peeling halls.\n\n               One of them is Mary, running down a hall, banging a stick \n               with another girl. At a corner Mary peels off from her friend, \n               runs down a new hall, turns a corner,\n\n               And comes on Simon. He's still curled where we last saw him, \n               in the wall niche where some lockers used to be. The two \n               stare at one another. Finally,\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Hi.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Hi.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         What's your name?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Simon.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         You don't look so good, Simon.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         No, I don't.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         I'm Mary.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Hello Mary.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Does Miss Henley know you're here?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         No one does, Mary. Can we keep it \n                         just our secret. For a little while?\n\n               Mary thinks.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Okay.\n\n               You can hear her friends coming closer.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         I have to go.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         It was nice meeting you, Mary.\n\n               Mary goes to leave, stops, turns back.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Are you hungry? I could bring \n                         something.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         That would be very nice.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Okay. Bye.\n\n               She smiles and runs down the hall. Simon grits his teeth, \n               turns to the wall, and prepares himself for a long, long \n               day.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\n               An old fifties two-level, Polynesian lamps and glitter stucco, \n               now faded and browinish with water stains. Gabriel, the young \n               man with the sunglasses and leather jacket we last saw kicking \n               down the door at the flophouse, walks up the apartment's \n               stairs to the second level, knocks once, and opens the door.\n\n               THE APARTMENT INSIDE\n\n               Hasn't been very well looked after lately. Either has the \n               occupant. Sitting slumped in a kitchen chair, staring at the \n               floor, he peers through dully yellow eyes that barely seem \n               to register his visitor.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Gee Jerry, you look like shit.\n\n               The eyes lift to Gabriel, revealing a pale, bloodless face \n               eaten with dried sores.\n\n                                     JERRY\n                         Leave me alone, Gabriel.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Soon, pal.

Anyway, it was settled \n                         when the bishops of the world got to \n                         together at the Council of Nicene in \n                         325 and hashed out the various \n                         interpretations of scripture into a \n                         uniform dogma of belief. The result \n                         was the Nicene Creed, which basically \n                         said that Christ was in fact the \n                         same as God and was owed the same \n                         power and respect as the Father. \n                         That they were the same.\n                              (smiles)\n                         But it's not exactly the sort of \n                         thing angels would fight over.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Why?\n\n                                     BILL\n                         Well, they could just ask God, right?\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Do you think it's possible that John \n                         might have written that extra chapter?\n\n                                     BILL\n                         Who knows?

Daylight and Jerry don't get along very \n               well. His sunken, filmy eyes squint at its glare. The decayed \n               flesh cracking along his cheeks flames at its touch. He \n               shuffles down the sidewalk, the brackish, amber fluid that \n               gurgles down his leg filling his shoes and leaving behind \n               shiny wet footprints like a snail.\n\n               There's nobody around the back door and its unlocked. Jerry's \n               shrunken claws pull it open.\n\n               INSIDE\n\n               Is a crush of filing cabinets and erector-set shelves. All \n               of it crammed with low grade stuff. The heroin busts and \n               million dollar currency arrests don't end up here. Here it's \n               all shoe boxes and dusty files. Fragments of small lives \n               forgotten.\n\n               Jerry pulls the brim of his hat down even further as he works \n               his way past rack after rack. The single uniform he meets \n               looks only casually at Jerry's lapel ID badge. It's on the \n               third shelf he finds it. John Doe #78.

Nobody's around when \n               Gabriel enters. He walks over to a file cabinet and removes \n               a thick folder. Then he walks to the big filing cabinets, \n               the ones that hold a body in each drawer. He strolls along, \n               tapping each label till he finds the one he's looking for, \n               slides it open, and looks down at the naked body of the \n               gargoyle.\n\n               He's been sewed back together. Kind of. Gabriel grabs the \n               eyeless corpse under the armpits and drags him out onto the \n               floor where he pushes the legs together and outstretches the \n               arms, like a crucifix. From his coat Gabriel takes out a \n               small vial of oil and rubs it onto the gargoyle's feet and \n               hands. Anointing them. Then with the tip of his finger, he \n               draws a faint sign of the cross on the forehead, stands, and \n               walks for the door.\n\n               In the background, as Gabriel leaves, we see the body of the \n               gargoyle BURST into flame.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT.

The rambler's parked next to a new one, Slim \n               Pickens on the AM, as Jerry digs up the fresh grave marked \n               General Arnold Hawthorne.

With a socket wrench Jerry \n               removes the fastening bolts, then with the edge of his shovel, \n               pries open the lid.\n\n               It's the ancient, wasted general we saw at the beginning. \n               His medals flash in the moonlight.\n\n                                     JERRY\n                         Not much to look at.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Ah, but it's not what's on the outside \n                         that matters --\n\n               Gabriel leaps off his perch down into the grave.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         -- It's what's on the inside.\n\n               Gabriel reaches down, places one hand on the General's \n               forehead, one on his chin, and BREAKS the mouth open. He \n               gazes down into it.

I don't even \n                         know why anymore, but I can't.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         You know the routine.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (swallows hard)\n                         Yes.\n\n               Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, \n               claw-like. They press into the flesh. Hard. And harder. Until \n               Simon starts to bleed.\n\n               Then to burn.\n\n               INT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Katherine startles abruptly in her bed at the faraway sound \n               of Simon's screams. Screams carried either on the wind or \n               her dreams.\n\n               INT. MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.\n\n               INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Gabriel releases his grip on Simon, letting him fall back \n               against the wall, afire. His clothes twist and blacken. His \n               skin creeps and pops. His sunglasses melt and fall away; \n               revealing two hollow pits beneath. Gabriel lifts Simon's \n               entire body up off the floor by just the disintegrating face, \n               and stares into the hollow pits.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Not yet.\n\n               And the fires go out. Gabriel drops the crackling, acrid \n               body onto the floor. Impossibly, through the sizzling mucus \n               and molten hair, it breathes. It gasps in pain. It won't \n               die.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         I can do this for five months, \n                         Simon...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.

THE SCHOOL BUILDING\n\n               Gabriel's lizard boots pace back and forth past Simon's \n               writhing, burning body. Gabriel's more jittery now. Losing \n               his patience. He bends down and pulls Simon's face up to \n               his.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         This is getting boring, Simon.\n\n                                     JERRY\n                         Amen.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Where is it? Where did you put it?\n\n               The seared skin around Simon's mouth comes off in Gabriel's \n               hand. But Simon is still, even now, silent.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Where is it!\n\n               He flings Simon with a horrible crunch against the wall.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         I'm just about out of tricks here. \n                         You're a tough one, friend. Old \n                         school.\n\n               He walks over and places a hand with something like friendship \n               on Simon's charred shoulder.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         God loves you, Simon.\n\n               And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's \n               chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart. Simon's mouth \n               springs open and hisses emptily. Gabriel slips the heart \n               into his pocket and lets go of Simon's shoulder. The body \n               instantly disintegrates and crashes to the floor.\n\n               EXT. THE TOWN - MORNING\n\n               Katherine squints at the morning glare as she drives through \n               town. Pulling into the school's drive she sees, parked at \n               the building's back door, a sheriff's patrol car.\n\n               INT. SCHOOL BUILDING\n\n               Katherine comes up the stairs of the building's abandoned \n               floor, passing the stacks of rotting desks toward where she \n               last saw Simon. There's a bad smell in the air.\n\n               At a turn stands a deputy that looks up as Katherine \n               approaches.\n\n                                     DEPUTY\n                         You may want to skip this, ma'am.\n\n               Katherine looks past him to where a second deputy crouches \n               down beside... beside something. It's human shaped, but like \n               a shadow. A shadow twisted in agony and slicked with a tarry, \n               smoldering ooze. The smell is overpowering. The crouched \n               deputy has a handkerchief over his mouth.\n\n                                     CROUCHED DEPUTY\n                         God damn...\n\n                                     DEPUTY\n                              (to Katherine)\n                         Were any of your students up here?\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Mary...\n\n               EXT.

Her \n               grandmother is there, and so is an elderly Navaho. He stands \n               beside Mary's side, holding above her body a clenched pouch \n               that he passes slowly back and forth.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                              (to grandmother)\n                         How is she?\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n                         Same.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Did the doctor come by?\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n                         He found nothing. But something is \n                         in her. I know. Something the \n                         Belagaana doctor can't see. The night \n                         people have been around two days \n                         now.

MARY'S FAMILY TRAILER - DAY\n\n               Katherine walks back out toward her pickup. She stops. Thirty \n               yards away, almost invisible in the sage say for the glare \n               of its evil, intelligent eyes, is a coyote. As she feels \n               it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder. Katherine \n               turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of \n               her eye, a glimpse of something very large.\n\n               And winged.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A huge semi ROARING deafeningly past on an empty desert \n               highway, KICKING UP a dusty cyclone that drifts over a one-\n               horse gas station and Thomas, sitting there in his car \n               checking a map.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

Nothing seems \n               newer than 1940, including the coffee pot the Sheriff pours \n               a mugful from.

The grave keeper, a young, gangly, drifter type stands \n               nearby with his shovel.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         How long ago was he buried?\n\n                                     GRAVE KEEPER\n                         Which time?\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         What do you mean?\n\n                                     GRAVE KEEPER\n                         Somebody dug him up last night. I \n                         just finished putting him back.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Did they take anything?\n\n                                     GRAVE KEEPER\n                         Nothin' on the outside.\n\n               INT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE\n\n               Thomas's breath escapes in warm clouds here in the unheated, \n               abandoned part of the building. Rats scurry away from feeding \n               on the dark, human-like stain on the floor as Thomas crouches \n               down beside it. He probes the dried, black, crusty flotsam \n               with his ball-point pen. Just like the burned body back at \n               the morgue.\n\n               Far away you can hear the sounds of children. Of a teacher's \n               voice.\n\n               DOWNSTAIRS\n\n               It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of \n               the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted \n               by eager third graders. The creepy silence transforms itself \n               into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom \n               door and whoop themselves outside for recess.\n\n               The last one out is Katherine. She's surprised to see Thomas.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Hello.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                              (suspicious)\n                         Can I help you with something?\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Tom Dagget.

She tosses two to Thomas.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Here, make yourself useful.\n\n               Arms full, she pushes the building door open with her shoulder \n               and backs out into the sunshine. She tosses the balls out to \n               the kids.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Okay, everbody stays on the courts \n                         today.\n                              (kids groan)\n                         -- I mean it.\n\n               She sits down beside Thomas on the building's stone steps.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         What grade is this?\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         All of 'em.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Town doesn't look that small.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Nearly all ghosts now.

We just teach out of this \n                         one corner of the schoolhouse now. \n                         Rest of it's been abandoned for years.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         You're the only teacher.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Yup.

He \n                         looked hurt. Bloody. Like someone \n                         had cut him.

He watches Thomas walk to his \n               car. He watches the children playing, lifting his nose to \n               snort the air, like a coyote.\n\n               INT. THE TOWN LIBRARY\n\n               Thomas sifts through some clippings on General Hawthrone. \n               Tactical genius. The man who saved Korea. Brutal. Almost \n               court marshalled a dozen times for his inspired savagery. A \n               truly ruthless man -- who spent the last twenty years quietly \n               tending his garden in a dying town.\n\n               INT. THE TOWN CHURCH\n\n               Small, simple, and woodplanked. The church we saw at the \n               beginning. Thomas sits there, staring at the candles, the \n               altar, the crucifix.\n\n               He's alone there. But for a creeping buzz. A feeling in the \n               air.\n\n                                     GABRIEL'S VOICE\n                         It's unusual to see someone of your \n                         age in church on a weekday.\n\n               Thomas turns in surprise. Gabriel is kneeling in the row \n               behind, inches from his ear.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Don't get me wrong. I think it's an \n                         excellent sign of character.\n\n               There's something cold and creepy about Gabriel. Out of place \n               in here. There's another sound. Teeth chattering far in the \n               back. Thomas turns and sees Jerry, deep in the shadows of \n               the choir box. Jerry waves.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Never mind him. He shouldn't even be \n                         in here. Least not standing.\n\n               Those sunglasses. Impenetrably dark. Like at the skid row \n               flophouse.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         You're not from here.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Either are you.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         I'm looking for something.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Have you found it?\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         I will.

Death. And a small, \n               dark-haired girl. Thomas's eyes open and fix on the ceiling.\n\n               Out his window, perched on the railing of his balcony, is \n               something dark and winged.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               The honey warmth of dawn heats the bluish, quiet streets of \n               The Town. Across shale hills and abandoned 19th century \n               miner's shacks, there echoes the faint, clear notes of a \n               trumpet. The bluesy notes drift over narrow dead-end streets, \n               junked cars, and the abandoned copper mine out past the end \n               of town.\n\n               INT. MINE\n\n               Deep in the tunneled rock, past the rusting conveyor belts, \n               Gabriel sits in a small cave blowing Miles Davis on his \n               trumpet. There's just the blanket he sits on and a single \n               candle. Jerry comes around the corner.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Get any sleep?\n                              (Jerry only stares)\n                         -- Just kidding.\n\n               EXT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE - MORNING\n\n               As Katherine climbs out of her pick-up she sees several of \n               her students standing in a circle. Crouched in the center, \n               talking to them, is a man. Gabriel. Jerry stands nearby.\n\n               Gabriel is showing a boy his trumpet. Demonstrating where to \n               put his fingers.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         ...There, and there. Now pucker your \n                         lips... aim it that way, and just \n                         blow a little bit, this is a special \n                         trumpet.\n\n               The boy puffs lightly. The trumpet emits a piercing, clear \n               note that SHATTERS a window high up in the abandoned part of \n               the building. The youngsters whoop and applaud.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Very good, Timmy. Very good. Here, \n                         have a Junior Mint on me. Open up.\n\n               As Timmy opens his mouth we clearly see Gabriel looking down \n               into it. Looking for something...\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Who's next?\n\n               Katherine approaches the scene warily. The children all beg \n               for their turn. Gabriel selects Sandra, one of Mary's second \n               grade friends, and puts her on his knee.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         And who are you?\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Sandra.\n\n               She can barely get her fingers around the trumpet.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         And did you see the man upstairs, \n                         Sandra?\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         A little.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Did you talk to him?\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         No.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         And who did, Sandra.

Everyone \n                         else, go inside. Now.\n\n               The kids reluctantly shuffle off.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         'Bye, Gabriel.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         See ya, kids.

That terrible coldness that swirls \n               about him. The shriek of ghosts under his breath. Then he \n               climbs into the rambler with Jerry and pulls away. Katherine \n               watches the car drive off, then yells over to the school \n               janitor.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Al!

THE TOWN - DAY\n\n               Katherine drives through the main drag and out past the fringe \n               of town. As she passes the old copper mine she sees, parked \n               near the mine's tunnel entrance, Gabriel's rambler.\n\n               EXT MARY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY\n\n               As Katherine pulls up, she's surprised to see Thomas climbing \n               out of his own car.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         You weren't suppose to be here till \n                         noon.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         You're a little early yourself.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         I wanted to check on her.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         That makes two of us.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               On the sandy lot that extends back from the trailer is a \n               wizened cottonwood tree.

In the dust is the \n               rambler's tracks and several footprints leading into the \n               mine.\n\n               Thomas steps up to the edge of the tunnel.

And after the first \n               bend it isn't even that anymore. There's only the glow of \n               the flashlight; glancing off the abrupt edges of tunneled \n               rock. Here and there are the flotsam of a bankrupt industry; \n               dented ore carts lying on their side, rusted drill bits, \n               piles of support timbers. And all around them the sucking \n               blackness of the earth.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         It's cold...\n\n               They walk further down into the mine. The atmosphere becomes \n               close and creepy. Thomas has been following tracks left in \n               the dusty floor that abruptly disappear. He stops and sighs.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Shit.\n\n               -- A BAT suddenly SHRIEKS out of the darkness, glancing off \n               Thomas's shoulder and TANGLING in Katherine's hair. She \n               screams and spins around, loosing her footing and half falling \n               into a yawning ore chute she hadn't seen beside her. Thomas \n               rushes over and pulls her out. She climbs shakily to her \n               feet.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         You okay?\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Yeah... Sorry.\n\n               Thomas takes a last pass at the mine shaft with his \n               flashlight.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Well, I've seen enough.\n\n               As he turns to leave the flashlight burns out.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Wonderful.\n\n               He bangs it once against his thigh before he notices for the \n               first time a dim, amber light coming from a space between \n               the rocks.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         What is that?\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         I don't know. Maybe a bum or \n                         something.\n\n               But his gun's out at his side. Just in case. They follow the \n               light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into\n\n               A CAVERN\n\n               -- That could easily belong to a bum. It's Gabriel and Jerry's \n               digs. Just the moldy blanket, single oil lamp, piles of \n               twinkie wrappers,\n\n               And something else.\n\n               From outside the cave it's the same whine, the same blurryness \n               that drips off Gabriel like sweat. But once they step into \n               the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume. This \n               is where Gabriel sleeps, and it's thicker here, like honey \n               on the walls. Thomas has difficulty focusing his eyes.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Do you feel it?\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         ...Yes.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         What is it?\n\n               But Thomas can't hear Katherine anymore, her voice has \n               disappeared beneath the whine. As it becomes too much he \n               leans his weight against the rock wall and shuts his eyes.\n\n               It's then they come. Flashes of images: Of screams and fire. \n               Of impossible vistas of emptiness and death. And shrieking \n               overhead, shrieking everywhere; grotesque, winged creatures \n               with no eyes. Some with faces we know; Gabriel, Simon, and \n               the gargoyle. All these images are being jammed into both \n               their minds by the cave.\n\n               Thomas forces his eyes open but the scenes playing all around \n               him won't go away. Tears are running down Katherine's face \n               as she stands there locked in the same images. Thomas stumbles \n               about the room as if drunk, the visions, incomprehendibly \n               black visions of war and destruction on an alien plateau, \n               eat his brain. He sinks to his knees and begins to cry.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Oh no... Oh God no...\n\n               Katherine's curled up on the floor like a child, weeping. \n               The images are driving them mad. Thomas, fighting the insanity \n               pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the \n               oil lamp. His fingers grasp it spasmotically as he rises to \n               his knees and leans back.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         No!\n\n               He HEAVES the lamp against the cave wall, where it EXPLODES, \n               the oil erupting into a swirling blaze that CONSUMES the \n               corner.\n\n               The images break a second in the heat and light and sucking \n               wind. Just long enough for Thomas to grab Katherine's arm \n               and pull her out of the room.\n\n               EXT. MINE - DAY\n\n               Katherine and Thomas lie in the dust outside the mine's tunnel \n               entrance. Catching their breath. Trying to organize and repair \n               the short circuits in their brains. Thomas rolls on his side, \n               squints at the sun. Katherine's voice is faint and raspy.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         What... What was that?

She looks up and shouts \n               at the endless sky above them.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         You dumb fucking assholes!

He immediately \n               pulls out his pistol, runs for the closed door at the end of \n               the hall and KICKS it in. The door FLIES open, revealing \n               Gabriel sitting on the bed beside Mary.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Get away from her.\n\n               His gun's leveled at Gabriel's head.

The gun skitters to one side as Jerry \n               SINKS his rotting teeth into Thomas's shoulder. Thomas cries \n               out and SLAMS his fist against Jerry's head, knocking off an \n               ear.\n\n               Gabriel turns back to Mary's frightened face and smiles as \n               he runs a hand through her hair.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         It'll only be a moment...\n\n               Katherine suddenly HAMMERS Gabriel across the side of the \n               head with a chair, KNOCKING him to the floor. As he gets up \n               she HITS him again.\n\n               Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard \n               against the chest, forcing him off.\n\n               Gabriel GRABS both of Katherine's legs and PULLS, CRASHING \n               her flat on her back.\n\n               Thomas scrambles for his gun, grabs it, and as Jerry comes \n               at him again spins and FIRES twice. The slugs RIP into Jerry's \n               chest and knock him to his knees. As the putrid, curdled \n               juices pump lumpily out of him, Jerry looks up at Thomas and \n               smiles.\n\n                                     JERRY\n                         Thanks man, I appreciate it. You're \n                         a sport.\n\n               Thomas FIRES a slug into his forehead. Jerry's brain winks \n               out as he collapses to the floor, dead.\n\n               Thomas's gun is abruptly WRENCHED from his hand onto the bed \n               as Gabriel NAILS him with a thrown lamp, vaults the bed \n               between them, and grabs him by the collar, SLAMMING Thomas \n               up against the wall. He looks down at Jerry's finally lifeless \n               corpse, incensed at Thomas's handiwork.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         You little pest, do you have any \n                         idea how hard it is to get one of \n                         those?\n\n               He THROWS Thomas down onto a table, SPLINTERING it. Katherine \n               climbs shakily to her knees.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         You son of a bitch, why?

The moment he gets close, \n               Mary lifts Thomas's pistol up from the sheets and SHOOTS him \n               twice, the impact KNOCKING him on his ass.\n\n               Katherine rushes to Mary, scoops her up and runs for the \n               door. She pauses beside Thomas, still lying in the wreckage \n               of the table.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Go. Go!\n\n               Katherine disappears through the bedroom doorway.\n\n               Gabriel spins around and stands. Thomas leaps from a ragged \n               crouch, HITTING Gabriel low with a body-block.\n\n               It's like butting concrete.\n\n               Gabriel picks up Thomas by the scruff of the neck and HEAVES \n               him THROUGH the flimsy room paneling. Thomas CRASHES with a \n               mass of splinters into the kitchen. He stumbles backward \n               hopelessly as Gabriel peruses him through the trailer. He \n               desperately throws pots, glasses, anything at Gabriel. Finally \n               trapped, he scrambles up onto the dinner table, SCATTERING \n               salt and sugar bowls, and DIVES through the levored window.\n\n               OUTSIDE\n\n               Thomas, in a hail of shattered glass, smacks the red earth, \n               pulls himself up to his knees and tries to stumble and crawl \n               away as Gabriel BANGS open the trailer door and stomps down \n               the stairs toward Katherine, her arms around Mary.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         ...You...\n\n               He eases his gait, measuring the distance to her.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         ...Can't...\n\n               There's just those sunglasses coming.

Again. Again. The \n               slugs BANG off the corregated metal, SMASH a window, KICK up \n               some dust,\n\n               And PUNCTURE the propane tank beneath the trailer.\n\n               -- WUMPP-BAM!\n\n               The entire trailer EXPLODES in a fiery cloud of TWISTING \n               METAL.\n\n               Katherine huddles Mary close to the ground as flaming chunks \n               WHACK everywhere.\n\n               Gabriel is HAMMERED to the earth and disappears in the rolling \n               fire cloud. Thomas, further away, is KNOCKED head-over-heels \n               in the ruddy dust.\n\n               The fire cloud dissipates quickly into the sky, leaving behind \n               scorched brush, and little else, crackling softly. Gabriel's \n               body looks blackened and still. Katherine rushes to Thomas, \n               who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above \n               his eye bleeding badly. She helps him to his feet and over \n               to the pickup, where he sits down against the tire as \n               Katherine pulls out her first aid kit. Mary's there, standing \n               with her shaken grandmother.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                              (re grandmother)\n                         Where...\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         She was coming up the street.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Is Gabriel dead?\n\n               Mary's knelt down beside Thomas.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         They're not like you and me.

Two firemen kneel down beside \n               him with medical kits.\n\n               The deputy has walked over to his partner and the two are \n               dragging back between them a cuffed, comatose Gabriel.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                              (hoarse, faint)\n                         You'll never hold him.\n\n               Thomas tries to get up, but the pain and a hand from the \n               firemen keep him down. As the deputies pass, he manages to \n               desperately grab the one's pant cuff.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Take off his sunglasses... Jesus \n                         Christ, just take off his \n                         sunglasses...\n\n               Gabriel's head lies low between the shoulders. The deputy \n               looks with concern at the firemen.\n\n                                     FIREMAN\n                              (re Thomas)\n                         He'll be all right. Just a bad hit.\n\n               The deputy nods. As they carry on to the car with Gabriel, \n               the angel turns his head slightly and smiles a smile only \n               for Thomas.\n\n                                     FIREMAN\n                              (to partner)\n                         Let's get a splint.\n\n               The patrol car pulls away. As the firemen walk back to their \n               engine, Thomas looks frantically at Katherine.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         We have to get out of here.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         But your head...\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         If you want Mary to stay alive past \n                         sundown we have to leave, and we \n                         have to do it now.\n\n               They lock eyes. Then Katherine without a word helps Thomas \n               up into the passenger side of the pickup. Mary gathers her \n               grandmother into the pickup's bed and climbs up beside her \n               as Katherine starts the engine. The firemen turn in confusion \n               as the truck peels out of the lot and up onto the road.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\n\n               Katherine's truck shoots by. Just before town, near the copper \n               mine, it slows down at a junction.\n\n               And there, lying on its side down the embankment, is the \n               sheriff's patrol car. A single, bent tire turns aimlessly.\n\n               Katherine hits the gas and takes the junction that leads \n               away from town, out onto the endless expanse of the plateau.\n\n               INT. TRUCK\n\n               The bandage on Thomas's forehead covers most of one eye. He \n               closes the other tightly, riding a spasm of pain, before \n               letting his forehead rest against the door glass and gazing \n               out at the empty tracks of land.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Where are we going?\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Mary's village.\n\n               Katherine looks over her shoulder to Mary's grandmother \n               sitting in the truck bed. She nods in understanding.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               Katherine's pickup passing alone through the wrinkled desert.\n\n               EXT. GAS STATION - DAY\n\n               A trading post with a few pumps, growing orange in the \n               weakening afternoon light. A scruffy dog barks constantly as \n               the teenage Indian sticks the nozzle in Katherine's pickup. \n               Still glassy-eyed with throbbing pain, Thomas takes another \n               handful of aspirin and climbs out of the cab.\n\n               There's a tiny, weatherbeaten church across the weedy lot \n               from the trading post with a pay phone bolted to it. Thomas \n               crunches across the lot, picks up the receiver, and punches \n               in some numbers.\n\n                                     TELEPHONE VOICE\n                         County Coroner's office, Assistant \n                         Coroner Raphael speaking.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Willie?\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Tom?\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         You weren't crazy, man.\n\n               And Thomas hangs up. He backs away from the phone and for \n               the first time notices the church it's attached to.\n\n               INT. CHURCH\n\n               Thomas steps inside. It's empty and there's some doubt whether \n               it's been used in a generation. The pews are dusty and \n               scraped, some broken down completely. Thomas sits in one and \n               looks across the space and dust and years to the crucifix \n               hanging behind the altar.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         So what's the deal, huh?\n\n               The pew creaks and groans as he shifts his weight.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         I mean, do you have any kind of plan \n                         here? Cause I'm just about of ideas, \n                         friend.\n\n               Jesus' pressed-metal eyes gaze only upward.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Do you even listen?

Old Man, \n                         you have been calling me most of my \n                         goddamn life, but every time I get \n                         close, you just keep moving that far \n                         away. What's it to be? You want me \n                         to kill your henchmen? Can't you \n                         even control your own killers anymore?\n\n               Thomas holds his face in his hands a silent moment. When it \n               raises we see the raw hurt in the eyes as he shouts,\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         What do you want from me!\n\n               The only reply is dust dancing in the light and the rumble \n               of semis on the highway.\n\n               Standing in the back, watching Thomas with tears welling in \n               her eyes, is Katherine.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               The road's turned to dirt and the plateau into a maze of \n               ragged cliffs and brutally hacked canyons.\n\n               The light is shadowy and golden now as Katherine's pickup \n               turns off the small dirt road onto an even smaller one that \n               winds impossibly up the side of a volcanic butte.\n\n               Higher and higher the truck climbs on the rutted and \n               treacherous path, till at last it crests the ridge and comes \n               upon\n\n               THE VILLAGE\n\n               Perched frighteningly on the leading edge of Old Woman Butte, \n               this is the home of the Bitter Sky Clan. The village is a \n               small grouping of ancient adobe walled hogans first built a \n               thousand years ago by the Anasazi. There's no electricity \n               here, no TV antennas or frozen yogurt. Just the slow curl of \n               cooking fires drifting up through smoke holes and the stern, \n               deeply lined face of an old Navaho man approaching the pickup \n               as Katherine stops.\n\n               The old man wears jeans, a bright maroon silk shirt, and a \n               black felt reservation hat with a turkey feather. He holds \n               in his right hand a small leather case.\n\n                                     OLD MAN\n                         I am Bartholomew Grey Horse, born to \n                         the Deer Spring Clan, born for the \n                         Slow Talking People. Today I am the \n                         yataalii for Mary Tsosie of the Bitter \n                         Sky Clan.\n\n               The old man, Bartholomew Grey Horse, walks up to Mary and \n               her grandmother sitting in the bed.\n\n                                     GREY HORSE\n                         Ya-tah.\n\n                                     GRANDMOTHER\n                         Ya-tah-hey.\n\n               Several villagers approach and greet Mary and her grandmother, \n               some nodding politely to Thomas and Katherine as they climb \n               out of the cab. Nearly all of them are elderly.\n\n               Thomas, one eye still half-shut by a bandage, walks over to \n               the village's edge where a short stone wall, and little else, \n               separates the adobe homes from the long, 2000 foot drop to \n               the desert floor. He leans against it and gazes out on a \n               view that must encompass half the world. In all directions, \n               for tens upon tens of miles, there are only volcanic spires \n               and crumbling buttes, all reduced from up here to short, \n               ominous playthings. A village truly alone in the world.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         This is a good place.\n\n               She's appeared beside him. Thomas crouches down to her level \n               and smiles.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Yes?\n\n               Mary's sight is on the view, eyeing it critically.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         Separate water source. Stocked grain. \n                         Only one possible approach. A man \n                         could, with the proper defenses, \n                         hold off an entire battalion for \n                         weeks. Months.\n\n               Thomas's voice sighs sadly as he runs a hand softly through \n               her hair.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Which one of you is that talking, \n                         Mary?

KIVA - NIGHT\n\n               Under the village, beneath the surface of the butte, is the \n               large communal kiva room. Accessible by a single ladder \n               through a single smoke hole, it is down here that the village \n               performs its Enemy Ghost Way for Mary.\n\n               The little girl is there, attended by her grandmother, sitting \n               stoically still on a blanket as Grey Horse, grasping his \n               painted prayer sticks, by the glow of a fire chants the Enemy \n               Ghost Way cure. Katherine's eyes sting in the smokey air as \n               she watches Grey Horse take from his case small handfulls of \n               colored sand that he pours in fine patterns onto the floor.\n\n               The whole Bitter Sky Clan surrounds them.

Its head and hands are \n               hairless and waxy white. There are eyes in this winged head, \n               but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow.

So loud and so often that by \n                         thirteen I knew I was going to be a \n                         priest.

The voice that kept \n                         coaxing me along, telling me there \n                         was a reason.

I never questioned \n                         a damn thing. But on the morning I \n                         spent looking down at three parallel \n                         graves, I asked it one question. \n                         Why. Why were these people taken \n                         from me? And the voice, that same \n                         voice that would wrench me out of my \n                         sleep some nights with its jabbering, \n                         it was suddenly stone silent. It was \n                         the only question I ever asked of it \n                         and it just left me hanging in the \n                         fucking wind...\n\n               He blinks back the tears welling in his eye.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         So after that I traded in priest \n                         school for homicide school. Because \n                         if God wouldn't talk to me the devil \n                         sure as hell would, and his ways \n                         were a lot easier to understand.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         We've never seen God, have we?

Katherine lays her head on \n               Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds \n               her. They hold each other.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               John the bus driver lying fully dressed on his bed asleep. \n               The night breeze through the window, and maybe something \n               else, tickles his nose. His eyes open, blink, turn left, \n               right, then up,\n\n               -- And see Gabriel perched on the headboard, staring down at \n               him.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Heavy sleeper, John.\n\n               John's eyes open wide in shock. Gabriel's skin is blackened \n               and blistered in parts. Whole shards of his shirt are missing. \n               John tries to sit up but Gabriel forces his head back down \n               with his palm. With the ease of a spider he slides down and \n               beside John.\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         Don't -- Don't hurt me, man.

He looks at himself in the mirror, \n               runs a hand through his hair, and walks out the door into\n\n               A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR\n\n               At the end of it is the intensive care unit, that \n               institutional purgatory where a small handful of patients, \n               wired and tubed and oxygenated, lay inconclusively between \n               life and death. There's a nurse's station there, all health \n               status video screens and a single nurse that looks up from \n               her work at Gabriel.\n\n                                     NURSE\n                         Can I help you?\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Someone's going to die here soon. \n                         I'll just be a minute.\n\n                                     NURSE\n                         There's no visitors allowed in ICU.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         The timing's important.

He watches patiently, listening the beeping scrawl of \n               the EKG above her.\n\n               It was weak to begin with but now it's faltering badly, \n               becoming the unsynched etchings of a child. A beeping alarm \n               has begun to ring and her breathing is slowing to nothing. \n               At the last possible moment Gabriel places his fingers across \n               her face, whispering to her, coaxing her.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Whoa, not just yet. Come on back. \n                         That's it...\n\n               The EKG's still flat but the woman is breathing. She begins \n               to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes. \n               She looks in disbelief around her, finally settling on \n               Gabriel's grin.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Hi.\n\n               A look of utter desolation and sadness sweeps over her as \n               she begins to cry.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         No, no...\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Hey, c'mon, don't start...\n                              (looks at chart)\n                         -- Rachael.

She looks out \n               the simple window to the glow of morning without expression, \n               turns, and walks out.\n\n               IN THE OTHER HOGAN\n\n               Mary's Grandmother and some of the other elderly villagers \n               are attending Mary as Katherine enters.

This he stirs, heats over flame, and feeds to Mary. \n               She grimaces and leans back in the bed as Grey Horse says a \n               brief prayer.\n\n               OUTSIDE\n\n               Katherine runs into Thomas outside the hogan.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         How's the head?\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Shitty.

To form the words.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         Come come, must you be so wishy-washy \n                         about everything? With the absent-\n                         minded eagle scout, I can see that. \n                         But you're looking at the devil man, \n                         say something.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Fuck you.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         Much better. Can I have some coffee?\n\n               Thomas gingerly hands him the cup. The angel Lucifer lifts \n               it, and with something unimaginably awful darting out of his \n               mouth, drinks. He offers the mug back to Thomas for a sip.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Keep it.\n\n               He finishes it.

You are armed, however \n                         pathetically, with the one thing \n                         they never really understood: \n                         theology. It's not much, but that's \n                         life.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Is this supposed to be our \"win one \n                         for The Ripper\" speech?\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         Don't press your luck, Mr. Daggett.\n\n               And you know instantly, in the bottom of your stomach, that \n               those eyes mean it.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         Go and get ready, Thomas.\n\n               Thomas hesitates, holds the gaze, then turns and leaves. In \n               an instant Lucifer sweeps down from the hogan roof to \n               Katherine's side. Face and eyes and maggot breath \n               uncomfortably close, he smiles.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         Have you ever considered Katherine, \n                         that the great absentee landlord, \n                         the soft-eyed eagle scout your \n                         childhood prayers are for, is just \n                         using you? That you're only the \n                         exterminator to get rid of his pests?\n\n               Lucifer places a cloaked arm around her shoulder and leads \n               her to the walled edge to look out across the endless plateau. \n               His mouth presses against her ear and whispers,\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         God's junkies are coming, Katherine. \n                         And when they do, all hell is going \n                         to break loose...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A tiny speck on the empty horizon. It grows, takes shape, \n               and finally becomes a red convertible rambler as it WOOSHES \n               past on a desolate throat of forgotten highway.\n\n               Gabriel's at the wheel. Beside him, grey-blonde hair streaming \n               out behind her, is Rachael, recently lifted from the file-\n               and-forget section of the hospital ICU. She tilts her head \n               up. Lets the sun warm her pallor. Just a sociopathic angel \n               and his somewhat deceased babe out for a top-down cruise \n               across a sixty million year old desert.\n\n               It could happen.\n\n               INT. ROADSIDE DINER - DAY\n\n               A reality bruised waitress, Madge, sets down a coffee and \n               milkshake before Gabriel.

Madge.\n\n               The waitress' eyes move from the guy with sunglasses and \n               burn marks on his shirt to the woman sitting alone outside \n               in the rambler.\n\n                                     MADGE\n                         Isn't your friend hungry?\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Not for a while, I'm afraid. Funniest \n                         thing.\n\n               Madge has a lot of things she misses in her life, but one of \n               them she decides isn't Gabriel.\n\n                                     MADGE\n                         Take 522 to the Sonsela Wash cut-\n                         off.

VILLAGE - DAY\n\n               Thomas drags a heavy chain from Katherine's truck and begins \n               fastening it to a post. Lucifer watches perched on a nearby \n               rooftop.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         You could always lend a hand.\n\n               Lucifer just smiles or sneers or whatever he does with that \n               hideous mouth.\n\n               INSIDE THE KIVA\n\n               Grey Horse begins laying out his prayer instruments as Mary \n               is prepared with paint and oils.\n\n               OUTSIDE\n\n               Katherine leans against the doorway, nervously watching the \n               horizon.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               The sky thinning into uneasy pastels as the sun falls \n               unceremoniously toward the mountains. A few lanterns have \n               been lit, and from inside the kiva can be heard the chants \n               of the Navaho Enemy Ghost Way.\n\n               Katherine's eyes are still on a horizon dropping off into \n               shadow. She stiffens. There, at the end of the earth, appears \n               a silent plume of dust. It could be anybody's car, but it \n               can only be one car. Thomas steps up beside her.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         He's coming.\n\n               Thomas sticks his head into the kiva, speaks softly to one \n               of the elderly villagers attending the ceremony.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Is there any way to speed this up?\n\n                                     VILLAGER\n                         No.\n\n               A fire has been built on the kiva's floor. Through the choking \n               smoke can be seen Mary lying on a mat as Grey Horse chants \n               to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the growing \n               sand painting beside her. His voice rises and falls in \n               guttural syntax. He's coaxing. Coaxing the alien spirit out \n               of the child.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Lock the door.\n\n               He pulls his head out and hands Katherine the pistol.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         Stay inside. It's only one round, so \n                         make it count.\n\n               There's a pause and for a moment their eyes lock. She touches \n               his arm, almost says something, then disappears into the \n               kiva. Thomas closes the door behind her. He turns and looks \n               out at the distant plume of dust. Growing closer.\n\n               EXT. GABRIEL'S RAMBLER - DAY\n\n               Radio turned up, sophomoric grin glued on his face, Gabriel \n               roars past and begins the snaking climb up the side of the \n               butte. The sun has almost completely slipped away now, leaving \n               the land a deathly bluish grey.\n\n               The road flattens out at the top of the butte and Gabriel \n               can see the village glowing at the far end. He punches the \n               rambler, winding it up for the last stretch, and pats the \n               blonde on the knee.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         You'll like this, Rachael.\n\n               Maybe not.\n\n               There's a sudden glint of metal in the headlights as Thomas \n               at the last moment PULLS UP the heavy chain and HOOKS it \n               over the far post. Gabriel does something pointless with the \n               brakes and SLAMS forward into it. The whole rear of the car \n               STANDS UP on impact, PITCHING Gabriel through the windshield \n               into the dust.\n\n               Thomas steps out from behind the post armed with an iron \n               bar. The rambler hisses and belches a death rattle as he \n               cautiously walks toward the spot of gloom where Gabriel lies.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                              (breathless)\n                         Nice move.\n\n               Thomas's feet crunch softly closer.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         You ought to come work for us. \n                         Upstairs. We sneak the odd civilian \n                         in now and then, you know. You'd \n                         like it. Nobody tells you when to go \n                         to bed, can eat all the ice cream \n                         you want. And you get to kill. All \n                         day and all night. Just like an angel.\n\n               Thomas doesn't answer. Gabriel's body looks ravaged as he \n               carefully steps closer and closer.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Save yourself, friend. Why go to the \n                         wall with the bitch and her rug rat? \n                         It'll all turn out the same anyway. \n                         Here or in heaven, we're still gonna \n                         tear the kid apart.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         I'm not an angel, heaven or hell. \n                         I'm a man you eyeless puke, which \n                         means I have one thing you never \n                         will. A soul. And though I may, \n                         somewhere inside, believe in a God, \n                         I will never, never, believe in you.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         A little speechy today, aren't we?\n                              (sighs)\n                         Okay pal, have it your way.\n\n               Gabriel's legs suddenly SWING AROUND and SMACK Thomas, \n               sprawling him back into the dirt. The iron bar goes flying \n               as Gabriel in a flash is on top of him. Thomas thrashes but \n               Gabriel easily pins his shoulders and sits on his chest. \n               Without hurry he uncurls the fingers of his right hand.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         This is going to really, really hurt.\n\n               Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         ...You -- your war...\n\n               Gabriel's spread fingers lower themselves toward his face.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         C'mon, son, out with it.

He's \n                         just a son!\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         That's it. You're jealous.

Why didn't you just ask God?\n\n               A shudder passes through Gabriel. He straightens up and looks \n               down at Thomas as emotion racks his body.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Because He doesn't talk to us anymore!\n\n               The two stare at one another. Then Gabriel, lost in himself, \n               suddenly turns away from Thomas and walks into the darkness. \n               For the village.\n\n               Thomas climbs quickly to his feet, spins around --\n\n               -- And is HIT full-force by a rabid, SHRIEKING Rachael. Her \n               legs lock around his body vise-like as her teeth and nails \n               DIG into his skin. He cries out and stumbles to the ground. \n               The two grapple furiously in the dust, Rachel's crazed face \n               taking BITE after BITE out of his shoulder and neck.\n\n               Thomas manages a fistfull of her hair and YANKS the fangs \n               off his shoulder. With his other arm he CUFFS her hard, \n               BREAKING the grip and ROLLING her aside. He staggers to his \n               knees and begins to run. Shrieking, a mad porcelain banshee \n               out of the dusk, Rachael catches up and TACKLES him. On the \n               way down his head strikes a small stone wall and the pain is \n               white thunder. Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls \n               on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from \n               shoulder to elbow with her nails. As the blood tumbles like \n               ribbons, Rachael JUMPS onto his back, DIGGING her claws into \n               his scalp.\n\n               It's about all one human can take.\n\n               Mad with pain and anger and desperation, Thomas manages to \n               climb to a shaky crouch, Rachael still shrieking on his back. \n               Throwing all his weight backward, he JAMS her into the short \n               stone wall. The impact SNAPS her hold and PROPELS her over \n               the wall --\n\n               And two thousand feet down the side of the butte.\n\n               Thomas Daggett can only curl up into a ball, gulping shallow, \n               shuddering breaths.\n\n               IN THE VILLAGE\n\n               Gabriel walks resolutely up to the first hogan and KICKS \n               down the plank wood door. No one home. He walks to the second \n               and KICKS its door down. Nothing.\n\n               IN THE KIVA\n\n               Mary's ceremony is nearing a crescendo. Grey Horse has donned \n               the colorful mask of the yei god Monster Slayer as the \n               relatives now join in the guttural chants of the Enemy Ghost \n               Way. Through the thick, choking smoke of the ceremonial fire \n               we see Katherine, nervously watching the door.\n\n               IN THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE\n\n               Thomas tries hopelessly to make his way back. Stumbling every \n               few steps, he's beyond pain and into driven numbness. It's \n               hopeless though. We know it.\n\n               IN THE VILLAGE\n\n               Gabriel KICKS down another door to another empty hogan. \n               There's only one left. As he approaches, from within can be \n               heard the muffled sound of chanting.\n\n               THOMAS\n\n               Takes a few more fumbling steps and falls again. He reaches \n               out to something metal for support. It's Katherine's pickup.\n\n               GABRIEL\n\n               Steps up to the kiva door and KICKS it. The frame buckles \n               but holds. He steps back a few feet, puts all his weight \n               into a turn, and KICKS again. The door SHATTERS.\n\n               INSIDE\n\n               Wood splinters ROCKET through the smoke as Gabriel appears \n               in the doorway. Grey Horse, everyone, freezes.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Relax folks, it's just a soul.\n\n               From out of the smoke steps Katherine. She FIRES, one round, \n               into Gabriel's side. The archangel is pitched against the \n               kiva's wall, where he stays a moment before turning to \n               Katherine.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         I'm getting real tired of you.\n\n               She stands her ground between him and the child.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Go to hell.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Heaven, darling. Heaven. At least \n                         get the zip code right.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         It's all the same, isn't it?\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         No. In heaven we believe in love.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         And what do you love, Gabriel?\n\n               Once again, the shade of doubt holds him up. But it's quickly \n               pushed aside for a corrupted grin. He's given up all pretense.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         -- Cracking your skull.\n\n               He advances on her.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         That's all it is for you anymore, \n                         Gabriel, isn't it? Just the killing \n                         and the burning. You don't work for \n                         God anymore. You don't fight for \n                         love.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Shut up!\n\n               And he's on her. With his left arm he brutally forces her to \n               her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed, \n               clamp themselves over her face. Katherine's mouth opens in a \n               silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance, \n               flows through her body.\n\n               From somewhere outside, there's a sound.\n\n               Katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to \n               smolder around her.\n\n               We hear the sound once more, closer, before --\n\n               The entire kiva wall EXPLODES INWARD as Katherine's pickup \n               CRASHES through it. The mangled grill and hood SLAM into \n               Gabriel from the side and SMASH him to the ground like a \n               broken puppet. Katherine falls backward to the floor, gets \n               up, and runs to the truck's cab. Inside sits a near catatonic \n               Thomas. Katherine takes only a second to share a look with \n               him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tire \n               iron.\n\n               Gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to his \n               knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare \n               out at Mary, huddled in the corner. Bleeding from every pore, \n               one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the floor \n               toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         God loves you, Mary!\n\n               Katherine brings the tire iron down on his skull with all \n               her might, DRIVING him to the floor. She turns to Grey Horse, \n               her eyes wild.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Finish it.\n\n               He, everyone, just stare. Stunned to stone.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Finish it!\n\n               Grey Horse timidly picks up his prayer stick and with a voice \n               faltering and cracked, in the insane glare of the wrecked \n               pickup's headlights, resumes the Enemy Ghost Way chant.\n\n               Katherine turns back to Gabriel.\n\n                                     KATHERINE\n                         Go home.\n\n               She HITS him again with the tire iron. Then lifts it high \n               once more above her head. She's going to crush him, to implode \n               his skull.\n\n               When a hand stops her.\n\n               Sort of a hand. A claw. Lucifer's. He's standing behind her, \n               holding the raised bar still.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         No.\n\n               Katherine releases the bar and lets it clang to the floor. \n               Lucifer turns to the villagers, gazing fearfully at him as \n               they awkwardly try to finish the chant.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         Please. Go on.\n\n               Lucifer's gaze falls on a deeply fucked-up Gabriel who groans \n               at the sight of him.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Oh man, this just isn't my day.\n\n               Lucifer kneels down beside him. Katherine instinctively starts \n               to reach for the tire iron but the sycophant hisses a liquid, \n               chattering warning at her.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         Long time.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         The world's young, man.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         And full of ambition.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         This isn't your war.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         But I remember the last one. Michael's \n                         war.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         You lost.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         But lots of angels were with me. \n                         every one followed their leader out \n                         of heaven.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Yeah yeah, I was there, remember?\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         Except one. Oh, he was with me all \n                         right. He hated the Eagle Scout. \n                         Envied the power He gave to His Son. \n                         But this angel never came out front \n                         during the war. And when it ended he \n                         thought maybe, maybe the Eagle Scout \n                         didn't notice. So he laid low and \n                         towed the company line till he could \n                         start his own war. It was all just \n                         jealousy.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         You're dreaming.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         But maybe He did notice. Maybe that's \n                         why I'm here.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         -- Stay away from me.\n\n                                     LUCIFER\n                         You've always been a part of me, \n                         Gabriel. And now it's time to come \n                         home.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Fuck you!\n\n               Lucifer slams Gabriel's head against the floor and pins it. \n               As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into \n               Gabriel's chest. Gabriel cries out as Lucifer PULLS his arm \n               half out and FORCES it deeper. Again. And again. Soon \n               Gabriel's screams become giggles, then a crazed, hysterical \n               laughter.\n\n               The room goes insane. An impossible nightmare of chanting \n               Navahos, glaring headlights, and Gabriel's echoing laughter \n               as Lucifer pumps his chest. Laughter that rises to a kind of \n               orgasmic cry then instantly stops as Lucifer pulls out the \n               angel's heart,\n\n               And eats it.\n\n               At that instant Grey Horse places his hand on Mary's forehead, \n               speaks a last line, and the chant is completed.\n\n               Sticky, smoky, awful silence. Gabriel is a non-thing. A \n               battered, hollow shell.\n\n               Bartholomew Grey Horse, his voice cracked and finished, turns \n               to Katherine.\n\n                                     GREY HORSE\n                         The enemy spirit is gone.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                              (weak, faint)\n                         Where?\n\n               From outside the kiva suddenly comes the sound of a wounded, \n               savage GROWL. Katherine walks to the doorway. Just outside a \n               lone coyote is twisting in the dirt with furious agony. \n               Abruptly its thrashings cease. The animal stands and flashes \n               for an instant at Katherine cold yellow eyes more than animal. \n               Then it's gone into the blackness. Forever.\n\n               She turns and goes back to Thomas in the cab. Bleeding to \n               death is a real possibility for him. She pulls an old shirt \n               out of the back and tries to makeshift a wrap for his sliced \n               arm.\n\n                                     DAGGETT\n                         More will come...
