All in black, mostly elderly, they \n               kneel in prayer.\n\n               Before them, on the cramped altar, lies a man. Dressed in \n               the uniform of a general, surrounded by the silk softness of \n               his casket.\n\n               He's an old man, far from the crump of battles, consumed now \n               with stillness, listening to the prayers of old people. Of \n               desert wind, moaning through thin wood.\n\n               The candle beside his head flickers and wanes in the ceaseless \n               gusts, strains for life, then goes out.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NIGHT\n</b>\n               It's not the best part of town and probably never was. A \n               place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting \n               fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad \n               drainage. It's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure \n               enters.\n\n               Wearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he \n               pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the \n               flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing Mexican \n               radio stations. One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, \n               catches his gaze.\n\n               There's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long-coated \n               figure effortlessly pops up onto. Sunglasses focused on the \n               window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch, \n               on the railing with the ease of a crow. Or a gargoyle.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n               Dawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve \n               the alley. The figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle \n               perched on the railing. Watching the window.\n\n               The shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's \n               movement behind the window.\n\n               The sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up \n               to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing.\n\n<b>               BEHIND THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW\n</b>\n               Is a room as grim as we expect. Lumpy iron bed, sink that's \n               been pissed into one too many times, and SIMON; a man in a \n               tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets \n               on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary \n               column.\n\n               Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body \n               stifffening. He whips around to face the window just as it \n               EXPLODES into fragments.\n\n               The gargoyle LEAPS into the room on the trail of glass. Simon \n               spins and THROWS himself against the intruder. The two \n               STRUGGLE savagely across the room, SMASHING chairs.\n\n               Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the \n               back of his skull against the wall. The gargoyle gets his \n               locked fists up and SWINGS them like a war club, SMACKING \n               Simon's face and SPRAWLING him backwards onto the bed.\n\n               The two, across the room for each other, pause.\n\n<b>                                     GARGOYLE\n</b>                         Where is it?\n\n               Simon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now \n               walking slow circles around each other.\n\n<b>                                     SIMON\n</b>                         Leave me alone.\n\n<b>                                     GARGOYLE\n</b>                         You've found it, haven't you?\n\n<b>                                     SIMON\n</b>                         Fuck you.\n\n               The gargoyle drops his head and DRIVES himself into Simon, \n               who HAMMERS the gargoyle with his fists. Blood SMEARS.\n\n               The gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he JAMS into Simon's \n               leg. Pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle SLAMS Simon \n               up against the wall. He TEARS open Simon's shirt, digging \n               his fingers into the chest, RIPPING the skin aside, the first \n               plunging deep, CRACKING the sternum bone, pushing even \n               further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath --\n\n               -- Simon PLOWS his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. Over \n               and over. Till the grip loosens and Simon SHOVES him to one \n               side, using the momentum and drives to SWING the body around \n               and at the shattered window. The gargoyle SMACKS the frame \n               and COLLAPSES, his head CRACKING on the sill and FORCING a \n               shard of glass through his neck.\n\n               Simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's \n               sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. Pushing \n               his thumbs into them, Simon uses the leverage to lift the \n               gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window.\n\n               The gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread-\n               eagles thirty feet to the asphalt.\n\n               Somebody turns up their Mexican radio station.\n\n               The gargoyle's a wreck.\n\n               But he manages, slowly -- his shattered remains arguing every \n               inch -- to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his \n               feet. A bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to \n               stumble three or four feet before being HIT by a freeway-\n               speed firebird BOMBING down the alley.\n\n               The impact PINS the gargoyle to the grill and RAMS him into \n               a brick wall, CRUSHING a chest that BELCHES out a sickly, \n               bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's \n               windshield.\n\n<b>               THREE FLOORS ABOVE\n</b>\n               Simon leans against his splintered window and looks down at \n               the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. His own \n               shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing \n               is difficult. Pain flashes across his forehead as he checks \n               that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of \n               his nose.\n\n               At the sound of a distant siren Simon turns and quickly \n               finishes packing his duffle bag. Stiffly pulling on an \n               oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage \n               beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out.\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n               The gargoyle, still pinned to the wall by the firebird.\n\n               A FLASH bounces off his skin. Then another. He's being \n               photographed. Go wide and find him in the middle of a police \n               investigation. Bored blue uniforms, yellow barrier tape. The \n               usual.\n\n               A plain jane sedan pulls up and deposits THOMAS DAGGET, \n               thirties, tweed coat and steel notebook. He smiles at a couple \n               of cops, ducks under the yellow barrier, and nods a greeting \n               to an older uniform sergeant, BURROWS.\n\n<b>                                     THOMAS DAGGET\n</b>                         Hey.\n\n<b>                                     BURROWS\n</b>                         Hey.\n\n<b>                                     DAGGETT\n</b>                              (looks up at sky)\n                         Thought those clouds this morning \n                         spelled rain for sure, but it's turned \n                         into a beautiful day, wouldn't you \n                         say, Sergeant Burrows?\n\n               Thomas takes a deep, healthy breath.

Before the night swallows it all whole,\n\n               Come upon The Town.\n\n               It used to be something. But that's long gone.

Biding their time. Waiting \n               for The Town to surrender and slip beneath the waves of the \n               desert.\n\n               The wind slinks over the hills, creeps down past boarded-up \n               storefronts, skeletal ocitillo, and the rusting hulks of \n               abandoned mining equipment. The corpse of a summer's kite \n               twists slowly on a power line.\n\n<b>               ON THE EDGE OF TOWN\n</b>\n               From the inky oblivion of the road, comes a crunch of gravel.\n\n<b>               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN\n</b>\n               Stands a large, nineteenth century brick schoolhouse. An \n               icon from a more prosperous past, its dark massiveness was \n               meant for scores of ruddy-faced miner's kids. Now it seems \n               to be imploding, eating itself with creeping decay. On this \n               night it is silent and dark but for a small glow in one corner \n               and the faint sound of children's voices in song.\n\n               It is a hymn. An ancient, Latin one. The melancholy beauty \n               of voices rising and falling in choir.\n\n<b>               INSIDE THE BUILDING\n</b>\n               Is a school auditorium. On the stage, dwarfed by it, are \n               twenty five students from first grade to high school, singing \n               together as a choir. A young woman, KATHERINE, directs their \n               acapella voices as the small group of parents, lonely in the \n               huge room, look on.\n\n<b>               OUTSIDE\n</b>\n               The voices drift on the night, down the road, and lap against \n               the peeling facade of a storefront. A mortuary.\n\n<b>               INSIDE\n</b>\n               The rooms are dark but for one. There, bathed in the \n               flickering light of a tall candle, lies the body of the old \n               general we saw at the opening.\n\n<b>               THE FRONT DOOR\n</b>\n               Of the mortuary has a locked handle that jiggles from outside. \n               A small panes of glass beside it is BROKEN by a hand.\n\n<b>               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM\n</b>\n               Young voices struggle with the complicated hymn and its pain \n               of centuries. Faces white, Mexican, Navaho. Katherine guides \n               them with soft hands. She smiles in pride. They smile back. \n               Proud. Of her. Of themselves and the beauty coming from their \n               mouths.\n\n               One small, beautiful navaho girl, MARY, maybe eight, gets a \n               special smile of special friendship from Katherine.\n\n<b>               THE MORTUARY'S\n</b>\n               Front door now stands ajar in the darkness. Small shards of \n               glass glisten in the carpet.\n\n<b>               INSIDE\n</b>\n               Is the dead General. Even in the bleached ravages of age and \n               death, his face still holds a shadow of vigor and pride.\n\n               It takes a moment in the weak flicker of the candle to realize \n               someone is there with him. Simon in his oversized surplus \n               jacket. His arms are folded tightly across his middle, as if \n               in deep cold. But his gaunt face is moist with sweat and his \n               breath is shallow and uneven. He stares at the old man behind \n               sunglasses and takes slow, cautious steps forward into the \n               amber glow.\n\n               Holding out two blood-stained fingers, Simon touches the \n               General's forehead. A new strain crosses his perspiring face. \n               Concentration.\n\n               Placing his right palm on the General's chin and the left on \n               his forehead, Simon CRACKS OPEN the dead man's mouth.\n\n<b>               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM\n</b>\n               The hymn is reaching its aching climax of medieval longing.\n\n<b>               IN THE MORTUARY\n</b>\n               Simon leans down to the open mouth, and in a voice soft and \n               deeply weary,\n\n<b>                                     SIMON\n</b>                         Qui ex Patre Flioque procedit...\n\n               Then, with the school choir distant and faint in the night, \n               the living man places his mouth over that of the dead man...\n\n<b>               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM\n</b>\n               It's coffee and cake now as parents proudly hug their children \n               and congratulate their young teacher. Even in this gloomy, \n               crumbling building it's a warm, small town moment.\n\n<b>               OUTSIDE\n</b>\n               Simon has left the mortuary and now limps with difficulty \n               through the silent streets, leaning against shop walls for \n               support.\n\n<b>               AT THE SCHOOL BUILDING\n</b>\n               Through the doors out steps the eight year old Navaho girl, \n               Mary. Alone, she stands on the stone stairs and looks out \n               into the night with sensitive eyes. She concentrates.

His name \n               is GABRIEL and he wears jeans, a faded leather jacket, and \n               dark sunglasses, even inside.

At a corner Mary peels off from her friend, \n               runs down a new hall, turns a corner,\n\n               And comes on Simon.

The result \n                         was the Nicene Creed, which basically \n                         said that Christ was in fact the \n                         same as God and was owed the same \n                         power and respect as the Father. \n                         That they were the same.\n                              (smiles)\n                         But it's not exactly the sort of \n                         thing angels would fight over.\n\n<b>                                     DAGGETT\n</b>                         Why?\n\n<b>                                     BILL\n</b>                         Well, they could just ask God, right?\n\n<b>                                     DAGGETT\n</b>                         Do you think it's possible that John \n                         might have written that extra chapter?\n\n<b>                                     BILL\n</b>                         Who knows?

They follow the \n               light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into\n\n<b>               A CAVERN\n</b>\n               -- That could easily belong to a bum. It's Gabriel and Jerry's \n               digs. Just the moldy blanket, single oil lamp, piles of \n               twinkie wrappers,\n\n               And something else.\n\n               From outside the cave it's the same whine, the same blurryness \n               that drips off Gabriel like sweat. But once they step into \n               the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume. This \n               is where Gabriel sleeps, and it's thicker here, like honey \n               on the walls. Thomas has difficulty focusing his eyes.\n\n<b>                                     KATHERINE\n</b>                         Do you feel it?\n\n<b>                                     DAGGETT\n</b>                         ...Yes.\n\n<b>                                     KATHERINE\n</b>                         What is it?\n\n               But Thomas can't hear Katherine anymore, her voice has \n               disappeared beneath the whine. As it becomes too much he \n               leans his weight against the rock wall and shuts his eyes.\n\n               It's then they come. Flashes of images: Of screams and fire. \n               Of impossible vistas of emptiness and death. And shrieking \n               overhead, shrieking everywhere; grotesque, winged creatures \n               with no eyes. Some with faces we know; Gabriel, Simon, and \n               the gargoyle. All these images are being jammed into both \n               their minds by the cave.\n\n               Thomas forces his eyes open but the scenes playing all around \n               him won't go away. Tears are running down Katherine's face \n               as she stands there locked in the same images. Thomas stumbles \n               about the room as if drunk, the visions, incomprehendibly \n               black visions of war and destruction on an alien plateau, \n               eat his brain.

Oh God no...\n\n               Katherine's curled up on the floor like a child, weeping. \n               The images are driving them mad. Thomas, fighting the insanity \n               pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the \n               oil lamp. His fingers grasp it spasmotically as he rises to \n               his knees and leans back.\n\n<b>                                     DAGGETT\n</b>                         No!\n\n               He HEAVES the lamp against the cave wall, where it EXPLODES, \n               the oil erupting into a swirling blaze that CONSUMES the \n               corner.\n\n               The images break a second in the heat and light and sucking \n               wind. Just long enough for Thomas to grab Katherine's arm \n               and pull her out of the room.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Katherine rushes to Thomas, \n               who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above \n               his eye bleeding badly.

Well, let me tell \n                         you, the worst thing that can happen \n                         to you is to be called to something. \n                         Since I can remember a voice from \n                         somewhere deep in the Church called \n                         me. So loud and so often that by \n                         thirteen I knew I was going to be a \n                         priest. You know what that's like? \n                         My parents, friends, all of them \n                         thought I was crazy. But see, I had \n                         this voice. The voice that kept \n                         coaxing me along, telling me there \n                         was a reason. So I entered the \n                         seminary and was half way to my \n                         starched white collar when my mother, \n                         father, and my little brother were \n                         wiped out in a car crash.\n\n               He pauses, the old emotions creeping back up on him.\n\n<b>                                     DAGGETT\n</b>                         I had never asked anything of the \n                         voice. Not when the neighborhood \n                         kids made fun of me, not when my \n                         father looked down at me like some \n                         knock-kneed faggot. I never questioned \n                         a damn thing. But on the morning I \n                         spent looking down at three parallel \n                         graves, I asked it one question. \n                         Why. Why were these people taken \n                         from me? And the voice, that same \n                         voice that would wrench me out of my \n                         sleep some nights with its jabbering, \n                         it was suddenly stone silent. It was \n                         the only question I ever asked of it \n                         and it just left me hanging in the \n                         fucking wind...\n\n               He blinks back the tears welling in his eye.\n\n<b>                                     DAGGETT\n</b>                         So after that I traded in priest \n                         school for homicide school.

A few lanterns have \n               been lit, and from inside the kiva can be heard the chants \n               of the Navaho Enemy Ghost Way.\n\n               Katherine's eyes are still on a horizon dropping off into \n               shadow. She stiffens. There, at the end of the earth, appears \n               a silent plume of dust. It could be anybody's car, but it \n               can only be one car.

Through the choking \n               smoke can be seen Mary lying on a mat as Grey Horse chants \n               to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the growing \n               sand painting beside her. His voice rises and falls in \n               guttural syntax. He's coaxing.

Gabriel does something pointless with the \n               brakes and SLAMS forward into it.

Her \n               legs lock around his body vise-like as her teeth and nails \n               DIG into his skin. He cries out and stumbles to the ground. \n               The two grapple furiously in the dust, Rachel's crazed face \n               taking BITE after BITE out of his shoulder and neck.\n\n               Thomas manages a fistfull of her hair and YANKS the fangs \n               off his shoulder. With his other arm he CUFFS her hard, \n               BREAKING the grip and ROLLING her aside. He staggers to his \n               knees and begins to run. Shrieking, a mad porcelain banshee \n               out of the dusk, Rachael catches up and TACKLES him. On the \n               way down his head strikes a small stone wall and the pain is \n               white thunder. Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls \n               on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from \n               shoulder to elbow with her nails. As the blood tumbles like \n               ribbons, Rachael JUMPS onto his back, DIGGING her claws into \n               his scalp.\n\n               It's about all one human can take.\n\n               Mad with pain and anger and desperation, Thomas manages to \n               climb to a shaky crouch, Rachael still shrieking on his back. \n               Throwing all his weight backward, he JAMS her into the short \n               stone wall. The impact SNAPS her hold and PROPELS her over \n               the wall --\n\n               And two thousand feet down the side of the butte.\n\n               Thomas Daggett can only curl up into a ball, gulping shallow, \n               shuddering breaths.\n\n<b>               IN THE VILLAGE\n</b>\n               Gabriel walks resolutely up to the first hogan and KICKS \n               down the plank wood door.

Through the thick, choking smoke of the ceremonial fire \n               we see Katherine, nervously watching the door.\n\n<b>               IN THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE\n</b>\n               Thomas tries hopelessly to make his way back. Stumbling every \n               few steps, he's beyond pain and into driven numbness. It's \n               hopeless though. We know it.\n\n<b>               IN THE VILLAGE\n</b>\n               Gabriel KICKS down another door to another empty hogan. \n               There's only one left.

The archangel is pitched against the \n               kiva's wall, where he stays a moment before turning to \n               Katherine.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIEL\n</b>                         I'm getting real tired of you.\n\n               She stands her ground between him and the child.\n\n<b>                                     KATHERINE\n</b>                         Go to hell.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIEL\n</b>                         Heaven, darling.

But it's quickly \n               pushed aside for a corrupted grin. He's given up all pretense.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIEL\n</b>                         -- Cracking your skull.\n\n               He advances on her.\n\n<b>                                     KATHERINE\n</b>                         That's all it is for you anymore, \n                         Gabriel, isn't it? Just the killing \n                         and the burning. You don't work for \n                         God anymore. You don't fight for \n                         love.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIEL\n</b>                         Shut up!\n\n               And he's on her. With his left arm he brutally forces her to \n               her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed, \n               clamp themselves over her face. Katherine's mouth opens in a \n               silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance, \n               flows through her body.\n\n               From somewhere outside, there's a sound.\n\n               Katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to \n               smolder around her.\n\n               We hear the sound once more, closer, before --\n\n               The entire kiva wall EXPLODES INWARD as Katherine's pickup \n               CRASHES through it. The mangled grill and hood SLAM into \n               Gabriel from the side and SMASH him to the ground like a \n               broken puppet. Katherine falls backward to the floor, gets \n               up, and runs to the truck's cab. Inside sits a near catatonic \n               Thomas. Katherine takes only a second to share a look with \n               him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tire \n               iron.\n\n               Gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to his \n               knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare \n               out at Mary, huddled in the corner. Bleeding from every pore, \n               one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the floor \n               toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIEL\n</b>                         God loves you, Mary!\n\n               Katherine brings the tire iron down on his skull with all \n               her might, DRIVING him to the floor. She turns to Grey Horse, \n               her eyes wild.\n\n<b>                                     KATHERINE\n</b>                         Finish it.\n\n               He, everyone, just stare. Stunned to stone.\n\n<b>                                     KATHERINE\n</b>                         Finish it!\n\n               Grey Horse timidly picks up his prayer stick and with a voice \n               faltering and cracked, in the insane glare of the wrecked \n               pickup's headlights, resumes the Enemy Ghost Way chant.\n\n               Katherine turns back to Gabriel.\n\n<b>                                     KATHERINE\n</b>                         Go home.\n\n               She HITS him again with the tire iron. Then lifts it high \n               once more above her head. She's going to crush him, to implode \n               his skull.\n\n               When a hand stops her.\n\n               Sort of a hand. A claw. Lucifer's. He's standing behind her, \n               holding the raised bar still.\n\n<b>                                     LUCIFER\n</b>                         No.\n\n               Katherine releases the bar and lets it clang to the floor. \n               Lucifer turns to the villagers, gazing fearfully at him as \n               they awkwardly try to finish the chant.\n\n<b>                                     LUCIFER\n</b>                         Please. Go on.\n\n               Lucifer's gaze falls on a deeply fucked-up Gabriel who groans \n               at the sight of him.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIEL\n</b>                         Oh man, this just isn't my day.\n\n               Lucifer kneels down beside him. Katherine instinctively starts \n               to reach for the tire iron but the sycophant hisses a liquid, \n               chattering warning at her.\n\n<b>                                     LUCIFER\n</b>                         Long time.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIEL\n</b>                         The world's young, man.\n\n<b>                                     LUCIFER\n</b>                         And full of ambition.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIEL\n</b>                         This isn't your war.\n\n<b>                                     LUCIFER\n</b>                         But I remember the last one.

Oh, he was with me all \n                         right. He hated the Eagle Scout. \n                         Envied the power He gave to His Son. \n                         But this angel never came out front \n                         during the war. And when it ended he \n                         thought maybe, maybe the Eagle Scout \n                         didn't notice. So he laid low and \n                         towed the company line till he could \n                         start his own war. It was all just \n                         jealousy.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIEL\n</b>                         You're dreaming.\n\n<b>                                     LUCIFER\n</b>                         But maybe He did notice. Maybe that's \n                         why I'm here.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIEL\n</b>                         -- Stay away from me.\n\n<b>                                     LUCIFER\n</b>                         You've always been a part of me, \n                         Gabriel.

Gabriel cries out as Lucifer PULLS his arm \n               half out and FORCES it deeper. Again. And again. Soon \n               Gabriel's screams become giggles, then a crazed, hysterical \n               laughter.\n\n               The room goes insane. An impossible nightmare of chanting \n               Navahos, glaring headlights, and Gabriel's echoing laughter \n               as Lucifer pumps his chest. Laughter that rises to a kind of \n               orgasmic cry then instantly stops as Lucifer pulls out the \n               angel's heart,\n\n               And eats it.\n\n               At that instant Grey Horse places his hand on Mary's forehead, \n               speaks a last line, and the chant is completed.\n\n               Sticky, smoky, awful silence. Gabriel is a non-thing. A \n               battered, hollow shell.\n\n               Bartholomew Grey Horse, his voice cracked and finished, turns \n               to Katherine.\n\n<b>                                     GREY HORSE\n</b>                         The enemy spirit is gone.\n\n<b>                                     DAGGETT\n</b>                              (weak, faint)\n                         Where?\n\n               From outside the kiva suddenly comes the sound of a wounded, \n               savage GROWL. Katherine walks to the doorway. Just outside a \n               lone coyote is twisting in the dirt with furious agony. \n               Abruptly its thrashings cease. The animal stands and flashes \n               for an instant at Katherine cold yellow eyes more than animal. \n               Then it's gone into the blackness. Forever.\n\n               She turns and goes back to Thomas in the cab. Bleeding to \n               death is a real possibility for him. She pulls an old shirt \n               out of the back and tries to makeshift a wrap for his sliced \n               arm.\n\n<b>                                     DAGGETT\n</b>                         More will come...
