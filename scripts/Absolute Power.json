It is a study for\n    one of his paintings.\n\n<b>    PULL BACK TO REVEAL --\n</b>\n    A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,\n    the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so\n    brilliantly.\n\n    Most of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban\n    housewives are there too.\n\n    And one older man.\n\n    This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly\n    dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a\n    successful company executive.\n\n    As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great\n    concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss\n    nothing: He has pilot's eyes.\n\n    We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this\n    is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the\n    hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --\n\n    Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the\n    eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.\n\n    Luther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his\n    work a moment, shakes his head.\n\n<b>                                GIRL STUDENT\n</b>               Don't give up.\n\n<b>                                LUTHER\n</b>               I never do.\n\n<b>                                GIRL STUDENT\n</b>               May I?\n\n    She's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts\n    thumbing through.\n\n    The sketchbook as the pages turn.\n\n    Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The\n    hands are better.

The streets are clean, the\n      houses neat and well tended.\n\n      Luther, carrying his sketchbook, walks along. It's\n      afternoon now. Up ahead is a local bar: RED'S.\n\n\n<b>3     INT.

An overweight bald man\n      Luther's age works behind the bar. This is RED.

LUTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                          6\n</b>\n    as he enters. Neat, tidy. A Cuisinart, a cheese slicer,\n    lots of other nice equipment. As he begins putting food\n    away --\n\n\n<b>7   INT. LUTHER'S HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT                    7\n</b>\n    Evening now. Table set for one. A single candle.\n    Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther\n    himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it\n    down.\n\n    A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate, parsley\n    sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on\n    another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan\n    cheese. An expensive water pitcher, a lovely glass.\n    Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.\n\n    Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a\n    photograph nearby. The picture is old. A pretty little\n    girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands\n    alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at\n    them happily. It's Luther. When he was young.\n\n    Luther studies the photo a moment.    Then he turns, looks\n    out the window.\n\n\n<b>8   POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON                                    8\n</b>\n    is visible.     Lovely.

Wealth and\n     power.\n\n     We're in rolling hill country.     The mansion is dark.\n     Totally deserted. Silence.\n\n     Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL. A car comes rolling INTO\n     VIEW. The motor of the car has been turned off. The\n     lights of the car have been turned off. The car slides\n     to a stop. Again, silence...\n\n     HOLD ON mansion, a couple of hundred yards away.     There\n     is a small field between the car and the estate.     Now --\n\n\n<b>11   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION/INT. LUTHER'S CAR - NIGHT                11\n</b>\n     A man holds binoculars, studying the place. He wears\n     dark clothes, tennis shoes. He puts down the binoculars,\n     begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --\n\n     -- it's Luther, and he's been a  professional thief his\n     entire life. He's a three-time   loser, but his last\n     sentence was so long ago and his  skills are now so vast,\n     so refined, that it is unlikely  he will ever get caught\n     again.\n\n\n<b>12   EXT. SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT                        12\n</b>\n     The grounds as Luther glides through it.     He wears a\n     backpack.\n\n     The night is cool.\n\n     He stops. All that separates him from the mansion now is\n     a stretch of gorgeous lawn. Except for Luther, it isn't\n     gorgeous -- it's no-man's land.\n\n     One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off,\n     in graceful motion, long strides eating up the ground.\n     He makes no sound at all.\n\n\n<b>13   EXT.

He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer\n     of padding at the fingertips and palms. Now he takes a\n     key, inserts it in the front door, turns it, and the\n     instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO:\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                             5.\n</b>\n<b>14   INT.
