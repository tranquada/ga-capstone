Drawing closer, the SOUND of\n         powerful TURBINES, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes\n         dominant, overpowering.\n\n         Guided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS, the chopper\n         looms hard INTO VIEW, pitching forward and settling to\n         the ground, kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation\n\n\n\n<b>   2-A   INT.

Birds\n         are beginning to SING but otherwise, all is SILENT.\n\n         The dense growth seems impenetrable, but from a solid\n         wall of undergrowth, a HAND appears and signals in a\n         downward motion.\n\n         As if by magic, the assault team materializes, quietly,\n         cautiously.  Schaefer makes another gesture and the team\n         moves forward in perfect harmony in POINT-LOCK step,\n         taking their cue from Ramirez, the pointman.

A huge, jungle BOAR lies mutilated in a pool\n         of blood, still quivering in the final throes of death.\n\n         The flare dies out.\n\n         Mac, shaking from adrenalin, breathing heavily, looks\n         down at the dying animal.\n\n<b>                                 MAC\n</b>                         (incredulous)\n                  A pig...just a fucking pig...\n\n         Schaefer shines his TEKNA-LIGHT onto the boar, playing\n         the light along its massive hulk, its razor edges tusks\n         gleaming in the light.

She\n         turns, looking for an avenue of escape, running for\n         the jungle.\n\n         But the forest looks foreboding and sinister.  She\n         stops, staring at the jungle, the moonlight reflected\n         off leaves like a thousand eyes.
