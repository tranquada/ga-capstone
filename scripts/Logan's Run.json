Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly\nlit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant\nlies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters\nto the baby's every need.

The area in which they\nstand  is bathed in a violet glow. Logan grabs Francis firmly and\nstops him from  prying at the panel:\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOGAN\n\t\t\tNow you've done it...\n\nThe CHIMES STOP...but the glow continues, a metallic VOICE is heard:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVOICE \n\t\t\tBreak-in scanners report intrusion, \n\t\t\tidentify.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOGAN \n\t\t\tLogan-5...Francis-7, authorized duty\n\t\t\tquadrant.

They sink into seat forms which yield to them.\nThey   move off.\n \n22\t\tEXT. - MAZE- CAR\n\nMoving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the\ncity  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:\n\n23\t\tTHE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE\n\nBrightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car\ndisappears  into a tunnel.\n\n24\t\tMAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE\n\nAs the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a\ngathering  CROWD.\n\n25\t\tFULL SHOT - ARCADE\n\nGlittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some\nwalking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna\nPark --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every\ndelight -- too  much to take in at a glance.\n\n26\t\tWITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS\n\nAs they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it\nnotices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured\nargument continuing...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOGAN \n\t\t\tbut you don't know, you Just \n\t\t\tsay what everyone says.

DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!\nREFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!\n \nAs they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,\nfalling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the\nmen stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them.

There is a general air of\nanticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and\nFrancis entering,  waving to friends.

They embrace,  and as they break:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFRANCIS\n\t\t\tand that's my friend, Logan. \n\t\t\t\t\t(as she acknowledges \n\t\t\t\t\tthe introduction)\n\t\t\tWe're celebrating his next in line.\n\t\t\tCarousel - Arcade - who knows? \n\t\t\tWant to come along?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWOMAN (smiles, shakes her head)\n\t\t\tOnly if I make it to the top of\n\t\t\tCarousel.\n\t\t\t\t\t(she holds up her hand)\n\t\t\tThirty -- and the big spin.\n\nIn her palm the crystal blinks, red, black.

Logan reaches into a pocket and takes out a small,\ndark plastic box.\n\nLogan looks at the box. On it we see:\n\n\t\t\tMAN: RELIVE STORE 14\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \tLOGAN \n\t\t\t\t\t(to Francis)\t\n\t\t\tLooks like I'm working.\n\t\t\nFrancis stands.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOGAN\n\t\t\tWho invited you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFRANCIS\n\t\t\tI'm in my party mood.\n\t\t\nLogan smiles . . . and the CAMERA PANS them rushing out of the\nbleachers.\n\nThey make their way into the hall.\n\nLogan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face\nthat he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from\nthe box.\n\nFrancis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping\nstops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.\n\nAs Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.\nLogan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING\nGROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:\n\n59-\n59X11\t    WIDE ANGLE - A MAN \t\t\n\nrunning.\n\nCHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man\nin the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in\nCarousel offstage.\n\nA. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.\n\nB. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see\nhim.\n\nC. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and\nFIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.\n\nD.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp\nand Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.\t\n\n(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)\n\nE. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .\njust missing, too.\n\nF. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various\nlevels and areas.\n\nG. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again\nas they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.\n\nH. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going\nberserk as he has been chased to a high level.\n\nI. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony\nby the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis\nis across the hall.\n\nJ. The Runner\u00b9s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan\naims.\n\nK. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.\n\nL. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.\n\nM. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.\n\nN. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where\nhe teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.\nThe SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.\n\n59X12-\n63X1\t\t    OUT\n\n63X2\t\tWITH LOGAN\t\n\nAs he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns\nthe man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.\nLogan takes out his transceiver.\n\n63X3\t\tINSERT TRANSCEIVER\t\t\t\n\nA man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead\nman. They are not the same.\n\t\n63X4\t\tANOTHER ANGLE\t\n\nAs Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead\nman's face, rests it on his forehead.\n\n63X5\t\tINSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:\n\nThe words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION\n\n63X6\t\tLOGAN\n\nScowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch\nand methodically strips from the body its few personal things,\nstuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's\nright hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of\nchain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and\ncloses it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it\nsoftly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOGAN\n\t\t\tRunner terminated 0:31\n\t\t\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\t\tReady for cleanup.\n\nDone with his job, he rises to face Francis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOGAN \n\t\t\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\t\tThat was a great shot you made.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFRANCIS\n\t\t\tYes.\n\t\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tBut you look a little rusty to me --\n\t\t\twhat were you doing, wondering?\n\nLogan shrugs. He's not sure himself. Together they walk off down the\nhall, passing CAMERA\n\t\n63X7\t\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\nWe see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,\nriding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then\ndescending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a\nfew feet over the body.\n\n63X8\t\t1ST STICKMAN AND BODY\t\n\nThe driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one\nof the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the\nbottom which covers the corpse.\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n63X9\t\tCORPSE (INSERT)\n\nIt turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand\nsculpture erodes when it's dry.\n\n63X10\t\t1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS\n\nSatisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the\nSHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its\nplace.\n\t\t\n63X11\t\t2ND STICKMAN\n\nGlances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his\nbuttons.\n\t\t\t\n63X12\t\tCLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN\n\nSucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again\nbare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and\naway.\n\t\t\t\n63X13\t\tANOTHER ANGLE\t\n\nAs the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd\nbeginning to pour out of Carousel.\n\n63X14\t\tLOGAN AND FRANCIS - ARCADE\n\nDescending from the top level -- not much of a crowd. Francis is\ngesturing toward the Hallucimill.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\t\t\t...Well I think you're getting stale. \n\t\t\tYou need old Lucey--Go on.

He\nlooks and we see:\n\t\t\n63X18\t\tPOV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS\t\n\nThe people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for\nmore fun.\n\n63X19\t\tLOGAN\t\t\nNot with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards\nthe exit.\n\n63X20\t\tLOGAN'S APARTMENT\t\n\nAs he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes\nhimself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes\nanother. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is\nbeginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes\nover to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.\n\n63X21\t\tAT THE WALL RECESS\t\t\n\nAs Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a\nslow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the\nfigure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.\n\n63X22\t\tLOGAN AT THE CONSOLE\t\n\nBored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man\ndissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes\nshape. It is Jessica.\n\t\t\n63X23\t\tJESSICA AND LOGAN\n\nStill in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.\nAround her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's\neye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches\nout a hand and leads her out into the room.\n\n64\t\tLOGAN AND JESSICA\n\nAs Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-\nbut, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,\nis amused and surprised.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOGAN\n\t\t\tWhat's wrong, Available?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJESSICA \n\t\t\t\t\t(breaking away gently) \n\t\t\tPlease . . .No.\n\nShe backs away, almost apologetically.

The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the\nwhole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of\nthe surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.\n\nThe machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table\non an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and\nIntegral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady\nexhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring\nthe endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers\nWhich join in solid state circuitry so that any random or\ninvoluntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an\nequivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.\n\nAt one end -- where the halves of the Mark III join, is n console of\nswitches and dials -- lights nod servo-recorders which control the\t\noperation from the first injection of cold to the final healing\nvacuum drafts and scar burnishing. With the air of a magician\ndemonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly\nthe table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms\ndescending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash\nharmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole\napparatus subsides.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDOC\n\t\t\tI designed it myself.\n\t\t\t\t\t(slightest beat)\n\t\t\tWhat'll it be ...a face job or\n\t\t\ta full-body job?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOGAN \n\t\t\tJust the face.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDOC \n\t\t\tFine....Holly will get you ready. \n\t\t\tYou're in good hands, believe me.\n\nHolly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on Logan's tunic.\n\nAs Holly brushes her fingertips lightly down Logan's arms:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDOC \n\t\t\tHolly works here because she gets a \n\t\t\tlift out of watching the Table...\n\t\t\t\t\t(smiles)\n\t\t\tand other things.

Instant \n\t\t\thealing---before you feel a thing. \n\t\t\tWatch now...\n\nDoc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track,\nspraying healing fluid. Magically the blood vanishes and the skin is\nmoist and whole.\n\n144X2\t\tTHE SURGICAL TABLE - LOGAN \t\n\nHis face tense--he knows something's wrong. Over him Holly's bright\nface with its rapt look. She's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's\nhappening.\n\n144X3\t\tBACK TO DOC \n\nwho is playing the console as he speaks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDOC\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPerfect depth adjustment on this\t\t\t\n\t\t\tone, Sandman.

The\nSandman is smashed away, burning.\n\n209X2\tLOGAN \n\nSuddenly aware that he has killed a Sandman. Jessica pulls him down\nagain into the shadow.

She nods, she's okay. He leads\nher off down the tunnel.\n\n213\t\tWITH LOGAN AND JESSICA - TUNNEL\n\nfollowing the tracks. The way leads down, curves, recurves, but\nalways down.\n\n214\t\tANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING LOCK\n\t\nAs Logan and Jessica rush toward it. The corridor has widened into a\nkind of chamber which ends in a great metal door like an immense\nsubmarine hatch.\n\nThe tracks run straight to it and beneath it. The base of the door \ntands in a couple of inches of water.\n\t\nWith great urgency, Logan and Jessica examine the huge door.

Then it stops\tand the light goes out.\n\n214X1\tLOGAN AND JESSICA\t\n\nHearing a SOUND they turn and see:\n\t\n214X2\tANOTHER ANGLE - P.O.V.\n\nFar behind them, in the wet glisten of the tunnel, a bobbing light\nand shadow -- the SOUND of RUNNING\n\n215-216\tCLOSE ON - LOGAN AND JESSICA\n\nAs Jessica takes the ankh from her neck - fumbling with the chain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJESSICA (breathlessly) \n\t\t\tEvery key only works once...and only \n\t\t\ta Lastday key must open this door.... \n\t\t\tThey said it would fit - but....\n\nShe tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes.\nLogan tries to steady her - and in helping, she drops it into the\ndark pool of water. They fall to their knees, searching desperately.\nThen Logan remembers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLOGAN \n\t\t\tWait - I have the one I took from \n\t\t\tthe Runner.\n\nSOUND: The same as before as Logan searches his pockets for the\nRunner's ankh.\n\nLogan finds it just as the WHIRRING SOUND has STOPPED again...and\nthe light has gone out again in the center of the wheel.\n\nAs Logan and Jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again\nanother TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION is heard rocking everything.  In the\ndistance, Jessica can see the shadow of a FIGURE approaching.\n\nAs the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh\ninto the lighted center of the wheel. The ankh fuses and the lighted\ncenter becomes brighter as the door opens.\n\nThere is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...\nrealizes what he has done and is shaken.\n\nAs the shadowed FIGURE looms LARGER:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJESSICA\n\t\t\tThere's no turning back, is there?\n\nLogan turns and pushes Jessica through the door... following her...\nas the door closes and they are:\n\n217\t\tON THE OTHER SIDE\t\n\nnow, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.\n\nBeyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which\nfood was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy\nlabyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness\n-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting\nthe huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,\nrusted, rotted and wet.\n\nIn the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.\nThe machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to\nrust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and\ngear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.\n\nFooting is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into\nwater and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an\ninvisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted\nand smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.\n\n217X1\tWITH FRANCIS\t\n\nAs he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.\n\nBut Francis has a light.
