OUTSIDE THE SKYSCRAPER - FORTY FLOORS UP - DAY\n\n          Mr. X's momentum carries him from one building to the\n          next, over an alleyway, the wet-concrete shining below.\n          He lands on the...\n\n          ROOF OF THE NEXT BUILDING:\n          ...and rolls up quickly, guns ready.\n          His eyes spot FOUR MARKSMEN running and ducking for cover\n          on the neighboring rooftop..\n          .and on a dead sprint across the roof...\n          . he spots about a CENTIMETER OF FLESH sticking out from\n          around an air-conditioning vent. He fiKes the his\n          left band.\n          The bullet flies through the air and rockets into the\n          flesh... which happens to be one of the marksmen's ears.\n          The guy YELPS IN PAIN and falls back from the vent,\n          exposing himself. That's all Mr. X needs, and another\n          shot rings out while he's still on a dead run. THWAP!\n          The bullet finds its mark in the yelping man's forehead,\n          silencing him, just as...\n          .Mr. X ducks behind a stairwell door.\n          He pulls up his right hand and looks down the barrel of\n          this pistol: built into the barrel is thin c u r\n          screen. It actually shows the heat signatures of the\n          three remaining marksmen, one of which is directly in\n          front of him, hiding behind a small rooftop supply shed.\n          A second marksmen is just on the other side of the\n          stairwell. The third is on the far side of the rooftop.\n          Mr. X takes another look at the heat signature of the\n          marksman hiding behind the shed and he FIRES his gun...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5.\n\n          /~,\n          ...then does an amazing thing: in the split second that\n          the bullet travels forward, he jerks his gun to the\n          side... actually steering the bullet around the wall and\n          into the ksman's throat.\n          Before the guy's blood hits the ground, the assassin is\n          moving again: he dashes away from the stairwell then\n          makes two incredible shots; one knocks a piece of\n          aluminum off the top of the stairwell...\n          ..which causes it to flip up in the air above the head\n          of the hiding marksman...\n          . the second shot strikes the aluminum again, ,,..,sending\n          the bullet ricocheting down into the ton of the\n          marksman's heads As he falls...\n          THE CAMERA MOVES OVER TO WHERE... the FINAL MARKSMAN is\n          breathing hard, like an engine with a chronic misfire, as\n          he looks out at the dead bodies of his fallen comrades...\n          all chopped down in a matter of seconds.\n          He squeezes his eyes shut, trying to psyche himself up...\n\n          LAST MARKSMAN\n\n          (SOFTLY)\n          C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.\n          He looks out at the stairwell door... and all is quiet.\n          Maybe Mr. X didn't know he was there, maybe he left,\n          maybe the last marksman can sneak away after all.\n\n          LAST MARKSMEN\n\n          (SOFTLY)\n          Okay... okay...\n          He finally decides...\n          .and takes one step forward...\n          THWAP1!1 A bullet disintegrates his knee.\n          He falls, clutching the knee in agony, as Mr. X walks\n          toward him slowly until he stands right over him like a\n          hunter over his prey.\n          Mr. X's shoe comes down on the final marksman's wrist,\n          pinning it away from his dropped weapon.\n\n          MR.

But now, to find\n          out, that no, my father didn't give me up\n          because he had died... he gave me up\n          because he was Protecting me... well I\n          guess I want to give him something back.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          71.\n\n          FOX\n          Here we are.\n\n          EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT\n\n          They are surrounded by industrial looking warehouses, one\n          of which has the words Times-Herald on it.

But you're\n          the best I've ever seen.\n          Wesley nods and the two of them step out of the car.\n\n          IN THE STREET:\n          From a distance, Wesley approaches Cross from the back.\n          His steps become quicker, getting closer every passing\n          second. Wesley starts to reach in his coat for his\n          gun...\n          .and that's when Cross firesl Quick as lightning,\n          Cross has guns out and lets loose toward the roof of a\n          nearby warehouse.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          72.\n          His bullet has the instincts of a bird dog, and it curves\n          over the edge of the building and finds its mark, causing\n          a crouching ASSASSIN to plunge from the roof to the\n          street near Wesley!\n          The others on the rooftops hail down bullets as Cross\n          disappears into the nearest building, the Times-Herald.\n          Wesley and Fox run toward the building as three other\n          Fraternity members beat them there, the BELLMAN, the\n          WAITER, and the ELECTRICIAN.\n          Wesley sees them congregate on the loading dock and then\n          start inside the building...\n\n          WESLEY\n          No!\n          The minute Bellman exposes himself in the open loading\n          dock door he is cut down from inside, his bloody body\n          falling backwards into a newspaper truck parked at the\n          dock.\n          Wesley and Fox join the other two on the dock as\n          screaming WORKERS run from the place.\n\n          WAITER\n          We need a way in there.\n\n          ELECTRICIAN\n          Let's find another door.\n\n          WESLEY\n          He'll be long gone by then.\n\n          FOX\n          (shaking her head)\n          He's got the high ground.\n          Wesley sees an unmanned forklift on the dock.\n\n          WESLEY\n          On the pallet.\n          They all jump on the pallet held by the forks of the\n          lift. Wesley throws the machine in reverse and it backs\n          into the warehouse, the four assassins safely crouching\n          on the pallet on the front.\n\n          INSIDE THE NEWSPAPER BUILDING:\n          Once inside...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          73.\n\n          WESLEY\n          Separate.\n          The lowest level is the loading dock, where pallets of\n          newspapers and massive unused paper rolls await.\n\n          WITH THE ELECTRICIAN:\n          The Electrician hustles between the pallets and boxes,\n          eyes darting, guns drawn. He backs up to a pallet of\n          stacked newspapers, using it as cover. What he doesn't\n          realize is that between each stack of papers is a space,\n          just big enough for a --\n          THWAP! A bullet finds its way through the space and hits\n          the Electrician in the back of the shoulder, spinning him\n          around.\n          CLOSE ON: Cross' gun. Another shot and we follow the\n          bullet, across the dock and dipping low into the next\n          space in the paper stack -- right where Electrician is\n          now leaning...\n          .the bullet buries in his eye, sending him to the\n          flog.\n          Wesley sees Cross race for a set of stairs. Just as\n          Wesley is about to cut him down, Cross fires at a wooden\n          beam holding back some massive rolls of NEWSPAPER. The\n          rolls tumble over and Wesley has to dive out of the way,\n          allowing Cross to escape up the stairs.\n          Wesley, Fox and the Waiter all race for the stairs.\n\n          ON LEVEL TWO:\n          Giant printing machines are running full speed, printing\n          up the morning edition.\n          A group of NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES see the guns the\n          Fraternity members are toting and scramble for safety.\n          Wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring\n          machines...\n\n          WESLEY\n          (to the Waiter)\n          Stay here and cover us. There's no angle\n          for him to hit you if you stay here.\n          Wesley points at a scaffolding that runs above the\n          machines.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          74.\n\n          WESLEY (CONT'D)\n          Don't let him get up there.

Everything looks clear, until...\n          ...shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o\n          Waiter's head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans\n          of spray lubricant falling to the floor. No big deal,\n          until Cross shoots one of them out of the air, causing it\n          to explode!\n          The burning oil covers the Waiter, who SCREAMS and\n          stumbles nearer the printing press...\n\n          BAM BAM BAM!\n          More shots from Cross and one of the RESTRAINING ARMS on\n          the roll of paper feeding the machine breaks in half.\n          The paper roll spins wildly from the machine and like a.\n          saw, cuts the Waiter in hplf !\n          With a leap, Cross is on the scaffolding over the\n          presses. For just a second, Cross stops as he locks eyes\n          with Wesley...\n          ..but Fox is already firing at him so Cross has to keep\n          moving...\n          He heads up a second staircase, but not before he sends a\n          stream of bullets back at Fox, who athletically\n          cartwheels away...\n          .but one of Cross's bullets disintegrates a gear on the\n          press near her, sending flying metal everywhere. A piece\n          of shXapnel b ies into Fox's leg... making her break out\n          of her cartwheel and flop down, wounded.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          75.\n\n          FOX\n          Fuuuucckkk!\n          Cross races along the scaffolding and disappears into a\n          door.\n\n          FOX (CONT'D)\n          Keep goin', baby! Take him!\n          Wesley races for the stairs. He is the only one left to\n          chase Cross to level three.\n\n          ON LEVEL THREE:\n          Wesley bursts through the door, guns ready. The place is\n          already in pandemonium, with PEOPLE yelling and screaming\n          and running for cover. Quickly, Wesley realizes he's in\n          the business offices of the paper, and it looks\n          surprisingly similar to his old office. Lame-ass\n          cubicles and florescent lighting everywhere.\n          Wesley jumps up on a desk.\n\n          WESLEY\n          Cross!\n          Unafraid, Cross climbs up on a desk on the other side of\n          the office. Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at\n          Cross... who immediately returns fire...\n          .and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets\n          in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take out a\n          COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE.\n          The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving\n          over and in the cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the\n          Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each\n          other from sharp angles...\n          Strangely,. the first bullet collision was not blind luck,\n          but the pattern for the battle. They are fighting the\n          same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man\n          using the same techniques at the exact same time.\n          Wesley needs an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the\n          words \"Action Items\" written on it. He fires at it, and\n          his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them\n          strikes Cross in the shoulder... THWAP!!!\n          Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to\n          flinch... right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely\n          avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby\n          window, smashing the glass out,\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          76.\n          Wesley doesn't hesitate behind him... he sprints for the\n          same window and dives through it, guns at the ready\n          and...\n\n          OUTSIDE THE WINDOW:\n          .we stay with Wesley as he falls from the third floor,\n          firing his guns the whole time...\n          .until he lands top of an \"L\" train moving at ll\n          speed.\n\n          THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT:\n          Fox limps out of the newspaper building and hurries to\n          the Porsche. She ignores her wounds and rips the car out\n          of the alley, chasing after the fleeing L train.\n\n          ON THE L TRAIN:\n          Ahead of Wesley, Cross is also on the top of the train.\n          He manages to get up, spin around, and fire at Wesley...\n          .but they both have to duck as the L train whips under\n          an overpass, which misses smashing both of them by mere\n          inches.\n          Cross takes the opportunity to swing down between cars\n          and enter one of the L cars.\n\n          BEHIND HIM:\n          Wesley hurries across the top of the train, spying the\n          trail of blood that Cross is leaving behind from his\n          wound.\n          Wesley smiles, a shark on a wounded baby seal, as he also\n          swings down between the cars and enters...\n\n          THE FIRST L CAR:\n          .where he sees the trail of blood leading all the way\n          down the center of the empty car and out the back door.\n          Wesley hovers in the entry way, his guns up and ready.\n          He takes a step forward to follow the blood trail, and\n          immediately, he is decked from the side by an ambushing\n          Cross.\n          They tumble over the first row of seats, both losing\n          their guns.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          77.\n          Wesley kicks Cross off of him, but Cross-spins with two\n          new suns in his hand! Wesley is.on him quick though, and\n          SLAMS Cross into one of the train's windows hard enough\n          to crack it. With a quick twist of Cross' wrist, Wesley\n          takes a sun from him Just as Cross kicks h,m off...\n          .Wesley fires as he falls backwards. Cross falls\n          backwards too from the momentum...\n          ..and they both smash out opposite windows of the train\n          before landing on either side of it!\n\n          EXT. DIRTY ALLEY - NIGHT\n\n          But the amazing thing is... they stand up and keep\n          firing as the cars are whipping by at 80mph, and\n          realize they. are timing their shots to actually blast\n          between each car in the s it-second the opening passes.\n\n          ON THE TRAIN:\n          COMMUTERS ride along in blissful ignorance, reading their\n          papers, holding on to the handrails... completely unaware\n          of the gunfight raging outside the train.\n          A bullet whizzes through an open window, pierces a\n          BUSINESSMAN'S paper, and exits a window on the opposite\n          side of the car. The man sticks his finger through the\n          hole, unaware of the battle outside. What the hell?\n\n          IN THE ALLEY:\n          On opposite sides of the train, Wesley and Cross are both\n          sprinting and firing, trying to get to the end of the\n          last train, while dodging each other's bullets...\n          .as the last car passes, they each jump on the tracks,\n          ending u with guns tucked under each other's chin!\n\n          CROSS\n          Wesley!\n          This takes Wesley aback...\n\n          CROSS (CONT'D)\n          Look into my eyes!\n          Wesley's finger is starting to squeeze his trigger... as\n          is Cross's.\n\n          CROSS (CONT'D)\n          (growls, in pain)\n          Look into my eyes, goddammit!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          78.\n          Finally, Wesley does and his face goes slack as he sees\n          himself reflected in Cross's Dupils.\n          Just then, Fox pulls up in the Porsche about fifty yards\n          away, and her headlights illuminate them.\n          Cross shifts his eyes to her, then does a curious thing:\n          he lowers his gun, then drops it to the ground.

PEOPLE instinctively get\n          out of his way as he cuts a path down the sidewalk.\n          Then he pulls out what Cross slipped inside his pocket:\n          a beaten-up copy of COUNT OF ONTE CRISTO. In fact,\n          there's no mistake, it's the same copy he had as a kid.\n          Wesley tries to make sense of this as he opens up the\n          cover... printed on the inside in a steady hand are the\n          words: \"I left you something.\"\n          Wesley lowers the book and sees a cheesy guy park a\n          Harley at a curb.

SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING\n\n          The Harley pulls up to a lower-middle-class house, the\n          kind you might find in any run-down suburb. Kids run\n          around the neighborhood, playing.\n\n          ON THE BIKE:\n          Wesley sits and looks at one particular house. He climbs\n          off'and heads to the side of the house, still carrying\n          his book.\n\n          SIDE OF THE HOUSE:\n          He ducks through a broken chain-link fence and moves down\n          the side of the house...\n          .until he finds a familiar wooden BOARD. Familiar\n          because we've seen this place before: it's where he\n          lived when he was a foster kid.\n          He removes the board, then reaches into the hole. His\n          hand seizes on something. From the hole, he withdraws a\n          KEY attached to a note with an address on it: 1850 North\n          Highbury St.\n          Wesley's eyes move from the copy of MONTE CRISTO, to the\n          key, and back to the book.\n          Finally, he lowers his hands... revealing a little eight-\n          year-old kid, watching him curiously from the back yard.\n\n          WESLEY\n          Hey.\n\n          KID\n          Hey.\n\n          WESLEY\n          You live here?\n          The kid.nods .\n\n           WESLEY (CONT'D)\n           Foster home?\n          4014 The kid nods again.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          81.\n\n          WESLEY (CONT'D)\n          Read this.\n          He tosses the kid the book and heads off.\n\n          EXT.

If she's wounded, we\n          wouldn't know it.\n          Wesley does the same on a nearby table. They take shots\n          at each other as they leap from table to table, avoiding\n          the sizzling centers, but they're both so quick that no\n          bullets find their mark.\n          Then Fox takes a running leap at him, moving ferociously\n          fast. She's like the animal she's named after, and she\n          launches off one of the tables...\n          .and catches Wesley flush, kno in him backwards, a\n          form tackle on to a table...\n          ..where he lands Quare on the oven top...

With another kick, she\n          sends the hot table flying at him. It rips free from its\n          wiring, and the nozzle sprays gas out into the\n          restaurant... SSSSSSSSS...\n          Wesley knocks the flying table out of the way, but not\n          before it burns his arm as he blocks it.\n          Spotting his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a\n          hailstorm of bullets.\n          But he's too damn fast, and he dives across the floor\n          Pete Rose style, sliding to a stop at the precise moment\n          where his hands come u holSling his weapons.\n          In.one fluid motion, he flips back over and EAM!

This only seems to enrage her.\n          Pissed, she produces two S R GUNS out of the small of\n          her bac -- where she had them hidden we have no idea --\n          and charges Wesley like an unleashed Pit Bull...\n\n          FOX (CONT'D)\n\n          (SCREAMS)\n          Aaaaahhhh!\n          She's firing both muzzles and her bullets find the marks\n          this time, knocking Wesley's guns out of his hands from\n          where he lies flat on the floor.\n          She's disarmed him, and now he's defenseless...\n          .and Fox stands over him, breathing hard, her face\n          bleeding, both gun barrels pointed right at Wesley's\n          face...\n\n          FOX (CONT'D)\n          I gotta admit, baby...\n          She starts to squeeze both the triggers...\n\n          FOX (CONT'D)\n          I thought we might have a future...\n          But, Wesley drives a fist into her wounded leg and she\n          reels...\n          In the same motion, he grabs her wrists and pulls her\n          toward him... taking her guns right out of her hands like\n          a quick-change artist.\n          Flipping them over, Fox's face full of surprise is the\n          last expression she'll ever have because...\n\n          BAM!
