A bit of fluorescent light spills \n               in through the frosted glass door. Lila, thirties, sits at \n               the end of a long table. A reel-to-reel tape recorder whirs \n               in front of her. She is smoking. Three fat, mean-looking \n               cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table.

Puff \n               sits in front of a microphone, counsel at his side. He pours \n               himself a glass of water, drinks, clears his throat, then \n               speaks: stentorian, confident.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         I am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all \n                         of us.

Some \n                         would argue that the life I was living \n                         was not a human life at all.

LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM - DAY\n\n               Colors are still muted. It looks to be somewhere in the early \n               70's based on the preponderance of Bay City Rollers posters \n               on the wall. Twelve year old Lila enters the room, closes \n               the door, locks it, rattles the doorknob to make sure that \n               the door is really locked. She draws the shades. She pulls \n               some t-shirts from her dresser drawer and stuffs them into \n               the space between the bottom of the door and the floor.\n\n                                     KID BROTHER (O.S.)\n                              (muffled)\n                         Hey, no fair!\n\n                                     TWELVE YEAR OLD LILA\n                         Drop dead, Eric.\n\n               Lila stands nervously in front of the full-length mirror on \n               her closet door.

She pulls it open. She is \n               wearing a training bra over the very beginning of breast \n               buds. On the chest above the bra, and on her stomach below \n               it, is hair. Dark curly hair. She stares at it, touches it \n               cautiously. Then she starts to cry. She crouches into a ball \n               and weeps.\n\n                                     ADULT LILA (V.O.)\n                         The doctor said...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Everyone's head is bowed in prayer.\n\n                                     FATHER\n                         Lord, we thank you for this bountiful \n                         gift we are about to receive.\n\n                                     ALL\n                         Amen.\n\n               Eyes open, and young Nathan reaches for a fork to eat the \n               salad. He grabs the wrong fork. Mother's eyes widen in horror.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         My God, no!

THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Adult Nathan sits on the couch, dabbing at his eyes.\n\n               Wendall, his therapist sits across from him and writes \n               something in his notebook.\n\n                                     WENDALL\n                         And do you think maybe this early \n                         childhood indoctrination has something \n                         to do with your interest in table \n                         manners in the present.\n\n               Nathan thinks long and hard about this. He seems to be really \n               straining, squinting his eyes. Finally:\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         I don't think so. No.\n\n               Wendall nods and scribbles something on his pad.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Why do you ask?\n\n               Wendall looks up.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. LAB - DAY\n\n               Everything's white. People in lab coats hustle back and forth. \n               Nathan, also in a lab coat, is hovering over a Lucite \n               encasement. Inside we see two white mice, both attached to \n               electrodes. They sit in little chairs at a little table. In \n               front of each of them is a little plate of salad and three \n               forks of varying size under Lucite domes.\n\n               Nathan nods to his pretty French assistant, Gabrielle, who \n               presses a button. The Lucite domes over the salads lift.\n\n               Tentatively both mice reach for a fork. There is a tiny piece \n               of velcro on each mouse's paw and a tiny piece of velcro on \n               each of the forks. The first mouse picks the correct fork, \n               and stabs it into the salad and eats happily, relieved. The \n               second mouse picks the wrong fork. Nathan presses a button, \n               which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an electric \n               shock. The correct mouse keeps eating, unconcerned. Nathan \n               makes a note in his notebook.\n\n               Gabrielle watches Nathan as he writes, enchanted.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. NATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               The table is elegantly set, candlelit. Lila sits at it while \n               Nathan fusses in the kitchenette. Something classical wafts \n               over from the stereo in the living room. Nathan places a \n               salad in front of Lila and sits across from her with his own \n               salad.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         It looks wonderful.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         You look wonderful.

Nathan blinks. Lila tastes the salad.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         Um-mmm.

There \n               is no nowhere for Puff to leap. Lila is with him in the tree. \n               They are crouched, bloody, heaving, on separate branches, \n               staring at each other.

LAB - DAY\n\n               Nathan hovers over the Lucite case with the tiny dinner table \n               in it. His assistant, Gabrielle, presses a button, a door \n               opens, and two white mice scurry in. The male pulls out a \n               chair for the female. The female climbs up on the chair, and \n               the male pushes the chair in, then scurries around to the \n               other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair. The \n               Lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both \n               mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating. Nathan \n               scribbles in his notebook.\n\n                                     GABRIELLE\n                         Doctor...\n\n               Nathan looks up. Gabrielle jerks her head in the direction \n               of a very large Lucite case. Inside, Puff, now dressed in a \n               diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes, is stirring. \n               Nathan and Gabrielle hurry over.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Good morning.\n\n               Puff groggily takes in his surroundings. This is quite a lot \n               to take in. The white room, the strange apes in strange suits, \n               his own clothing, the wires. After surveying the scene for a \n               moment, Puff becomes frightened and agitated.\n\n               He tries to escape. Not understanding Lucite, he smashes \n               into it, again and again. He tears at his diaper. Nathan \n               gives a nod to Gabrielle, who presses a button on a panel.\n\n               An electric shock sends Puff flying. He lies on the floor \n               confused and dazed. After a moment, he gets up and again \n               crashes into the Lucite. Nathan gives the signal to Gabrielle \n               and once again she shocks Puff. He once again gets up and \n               crashes against the Lucite. Again he is shocked. He gets up \n               again, and is about to crash against the Lucite, but he thinks \n               better of it, and squats in place, immobilized.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                              (to Gabrielle)\n                         Only three shocks.

But there is a green glow from a couple of exit \n               signs.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         I don't get it. I don't get it.

Puff crawls over, tries to \n               touch her through the Lucite. Gabrielle sings a French \n               lullaby. It's very sweet. Nathan watches her, looks at her \n               thigh, her hair, the delicate way the tip of her nose moves \n               when she sings. Puff gets drowsy.

There is a mannequin woman sitting next to him \n               and a boom box pumping out Beethoven's Fidelio. Puff seems \n               attentive, refined, occasionally bringing a pair of opera \n               glasses up to his eyes, pinky extended. Outside the case, \n               Nathan and Lila look on. The opera is over. Puff stands, \n               applauds, yells \"Bravo\", and tosses a rose in the direction \n               of the imaginary stage. The rose hits the Lucite wall and \n               falls to the floor. Nathan and Lila stand and applaud Puff.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Bravo to you, Puff!\n\n                                     LILA\n                         That was wonderful!\n\n               Puff smiles and performs a foppish bow, almost a curtsy.

Puff, inside his \n               case, imitates it perfectly.\n\n               2) Nathan shows Puff a flashcard which reads: \"I'll start \n               tonight with the foie gras.\"\n\n               3) Puff is holding up a small hand mirror and trimming nose \n               hairs. Lila applauds.\n\n               4) Puff juggles three balls while riding a unicycle.\n\n               5) Puff, dressed as Peter Pan, stands with legs spread and \n               hands on hips. He is singing \"I Gotta Crow.\"\n\n               6) Puff, dressed in an apron and chef's hat, is tossing a \n               salad. There are two types of vinegar to choose from. He \n               hesitates, then chooses the balsamic. Nathan and Lila applaud.\n\n               7) Puff, in a smoking jacket and smoking a pipe, is sitting \n               in an easy chair, next to a fake fire and a fake sleeping \n               dog, and reading a book of poems by Yeats. Lila and Nathan, \n               outside the case, applaud and embrace.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         I think he's ready.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         Oh boy!\n\n                                     PUFF\n                              (jumping up)\n                         Oh boy!\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Now, Puff, we're leaving on the \n                         electronic collar.

That's fair.\n\n               Nathan unlocks the case. Puff tentatively steps out into the \n               world. He hugs Nathan. It's a grateful, obsequious, slightly \n               pathetic hug. Nathan hugs him back, but he's keeping him at \n               a distance. Puff pulls himself out of the hug, but still \n               rests his hands on Nathan's shoulders and looks him in the \n               eye, almost like a lover. Then he parts with Nathan and goes \n               over to embrace Lila. She graciously receives him. After a \n               moment in the embrace, Puff starts dry-humping Lila. Lila \n               can't get out of his clutches.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         No, Puff! Bad!\n\n               Nathan presses a button, which shocks Puff and sends him \n               flying. Puff appears disoriented, then gets up off the floor, \n               brushes himself off, and turns to Lila with a bow of his \n               head.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         My apologies, madam.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         It's okay, Puff.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         Shan't happen again.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

CAR - EVENING\n\n               Lila and Puff are driving in silence on a dirt road through \n               the woods. Lila pulls off the road, drives to a place where \n               the car will be camouflaged, and parks.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         Stay.\n\n               Puff stays in the car.

Then the male mouse pushes the door \n               open and holds it for the female mouse, who exits. The male \n               mouse follows her, and closes the door behind him. He turns \n               to Lila, nods, then extends his arm for the female mouse to \n               hold on to. She does, and they walk off together on their \n               hind legs into the woods. Lila sighs, and turns to Puff.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         Out.\n\n               Puff gets out casually, then makes a mad dash for the road.\n\n               Lila calmly presses the button on her black box.

So does Lila. She is covered with hair, except \n               for her face. But whereas Puff is now white and soft-looking, \n               Lila is tan and taut and muscular. This is a reversal of the \n               way both of them were when they first met.\n\n               Puff seems taken with her body.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         We're going back to nature, you and \n                         I.

WOODS - A BIT LATER\n\n               Puff and Lila have built makeshift shelter out of leaves and \n               twigs.

Puff looks at the roasting squirrel, \n               is repulsed.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         Nice night.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         Talking is to be kept to a minimum. \n                         Eventually, when we are ready, there \n                         will be none. Language was invented \n                         so that people could lie to each \n                         other and to themselves. There is no \n                         other reason.\n\n               Puff begins to disagree.

MAKESHIFT SHELTER - NIGHT\n\n               Puff and Lila lie seperately under blankets of moss. The \n               breathing is heavy. Both seem to be sleeping. Puff opens his \n               eyes and tries to extricate himself from the moss without \n               making any noise. Lila presses the button and Puff falls in \n               a quivering mess.\n\n                                     LILA\n                              (whisper)\n                         You'll thank me eventually, Puff. \n                         Well, you won't thank me, because we \n                         won't be speaking, but you'll sort \n                         of thank me with a special look, the \n                         look a dog gives you to let you know \n                         he loves you.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         What an enchanting picture you paint \n                         of our future together.\n\n               Lila shocks Puff once again.

But something else \n                         happened as well, something perhaps \n                         distinctly human...

He spasms \n               and falls on top of her, knocking her to the ground.\n\n               He regains his composure, finds himself on top of Lila.\n\n               They look at each other for a moment. Then they kiss. It's a \n               violent kiss. They grope each other. This is primal sex now. \n               In the dirt. Sweaty. Loud grunting. Lila even presses the \n               shock button at the right moment. Puff seems to like it in \n               this context.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Puff sighs and moves to Nathan.\n\n               Nathan prods Puff, and they head off through the trees.\n\n               Suddenly Puff elbows Nathan. Nathan grunts, doubles over.\n\n               Puff turns, lunges, and the two wrestle on the ground.\n\n               Puff pries the gun from Nathan's hand, and jumps up.

After you \n                         I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, \n                         anal, totally out of touch with my \n                         surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I \n                         became you. Lila has reintroduced me \n                         to myself. And, incidentally, what \n                         I'm about to do, kill you, is \n                         something that would never have \n                         occurred to me to do as a creature \n                         of the Earth. Before when I killed, \n                         it was for food or in self-defense. \n                         Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge \n                         is an abstract concept, Nathan. And \n                         I learned abstract thinking from \n                         you.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         No.\n\n                                     LILA\n                         Puff, don't.\n\n               Puff shoots.

I will live out \n                         my days naked and free.\n\n                                     CONGRESSMAN\n                         Thank you, sir. Your story has touched \n                         us all deeply. We will pass some \n                         legislation addressing this problem.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         Thank you. That is all I ask.\n                              (to camera)\n                         Good-bye, Lila. I take you with me \n                         in my untamed heart.\n\n               Puff stands and exits the auditorium. Flashbulbs flash.\n\n               In the prison common room, Lila wipes a tear from her eye.\n\n               She seems genuinely happy. She looks out a small barred window \n               and sees a bluebird light there, then fly away.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY\n\n               Puff walks along, a man on a mission. As he walks he sheds \n               articles of clothing. He is followed by reporters and \n               cameramen and celebrity hounds. Soon he is naked.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY\n\n               Puff walks along, naked.

He is still followed by reporters. Cows \n               watch the parade.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. FOREST - EVENING\n\n               Puff walks along a dirt road. He is about to disappear into \n               the forest. An older woman rushes out from the crowd.\n\n                                     OLDER WOMAN\n                         Wait!\n\n                                     PUFF\n                              (turning)\n                         Yes?\n\n                                     OLDER WOMAN\n                         I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking \n                         for you for thirty years. Then there \n                         you were, such a beautiful, beautiful \n                         grown man.\n\n               The older woman starts to cry.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         Mother?\n\n                                     OLDER WOMAN\n                         Yes... Derek.\n\n               Puff holds out his hand for her to shake. Flashbulbs flash.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                              (formally)\n                         It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. \n                         But I'm an ape like dad was...\n                              (checks watch)\n                         And I have to go back into the woods \n                         now... forever.\n\n                                     OLDER WOMAN\n                              (resigned)\n                         Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew \n                         that was going to be what you would \n                         say. It's good to see you again \n                         though.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     OLDER WOMAN\n                         I'm in the book, if you ever want to \n                         drop me a line or something.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And \n                         apes don't drop lines.\n\n               His mother weeps. Puff gently rests his hand on her shoulder \n               for a moment, then he turns and waves to the reporters. The \n               crowd bursts into applause. Flashbulbs flash. Puff jogs into \n               the woods. There is a collective sigh, and then everyone \n               turns and heads back in the direction from which they came. \n               We hold on the woods for a moment. A car pulls up. Puff \n               hurries out of the woods and jumps in the passenger side of \n               the car.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

She kisses him passionately. When \n               the kiss runs its course, Puff speaks.\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         Arf.\n\n               Gabrielle kisses him again, even more passionately this time\n\n                                     PUFF\n                         As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not \n                         sorry she killed him, if it means I \n                         can have you. Is that a terrible \n                         thing to say, my sweet?\n\n                                     GABRIELLE\n                              (putting her finger \n                              to his lips)\n                         Hush. No, it is never terrible to be \n                         in love. Nathan's memory lives on in \n                         our sacred union.\n                              (beat)\n                         I'm not sorry she killed him either. \n                         Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite \n                         and sophisticated and charming. You \n                         are all that, too. But you have \n                         something more. You have a bit of \n                         the animal in you.\n\n               They smile flirtatiously at each other.

When the dust clears, we see the two \n               white mice standing there on the side of the road, shivering \n               and emaciated. The male holds out his the thumb and the female \n               holds a tiny little sign which reads: New York.\n\n               There is a look of hopelessness in their beady black eyes.\n\n               FADE OUT.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nHuman Nature\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Charlie Kaufman\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:27:15.269322"}
