I don't even like his \n\t\tbooks that much. They're all so \t\n\t\taggressively confrontational.

LIVINGSTON HOME BACKYARD \u0096 DAY\n\t\n\tMarty talks to Toby poolside as he prepares a barbecue.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARTY\n\t\tI think Scooby's like a lot of \t\n\t\tkids. He just hit a\u0085a speed bump. \t\n\t\tNow he's gonna find his way, his \t\n\t\tpath is gonna be cleared, and I \t\n\t\tthink he's gonna continue his \t\n\t\teducation at a good college. And \t\n\t\teverybody else is gonna be happy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTOBY (O.S.)\n\t\t...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a \n\t\tbit fearful that Scooby will be \t\n\t\tconfronted with hollow values and \t\n\t\tsystemic conformism? \n\t\n\tPause.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARTY\n\t\tI don't know why this is so hard \t\n\t\tfor you to comprehend.

Now why \t\n\t\tare you trying to make college out \n\t\tto be a bad thing, a negative \t\n\t\texperience? You were unhappy? \t\n\t\tWell, to bad! Get over it! Stop \t\n\t\ttrying to impose your misery on \t\n\t\tothers by going around saying, \t\n\t\t'Life is bad, life is horrible.' \t\n\t\tLife is tough on you?
