As we\ndescend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:\nthe sounds of a Mass being sung.\n\n<b>A CATHOLIC CHURCH\n</b>\nThe big wooden doors open to release the parishioners\ninside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his\nGIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin.\nThey don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a\nfaucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes\n500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...\n\n<b>A GRAND MARQUIS\n</b>\nSqueals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside\nthe Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a\nmoment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff-\narming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the\ngossip among the parishioners begins...\n\nThe Grand Marquis pulls away.\n\n<b>INT.

Practiced hands slit the\nboy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels.\nEighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.\n\nDuct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.\n\n<b>EXT.   WOODED AREA - DAY\n</b>\nThe Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW\nGUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His\nclothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He\nstands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over\nfrom one group to the other.\n\n<b>INT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY\n</b>\nThe phone rings. A bomb going off.

One of them listens in, waves fingers\nat him as the negotiations begin.\n\n<b>INT.   VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAY\n</b>\nA wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing   it, Eighteen\nstands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his\nleg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK\nRUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf.\n\nA MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates\nby cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps\nhis thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear\nscratched.\n\nAt a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the\nground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in\ntape leaving one ear exposed.\n\nCUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA\nnewspaper, being interviewed, \"...organized crime\nsyndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last\ntwo years.\"\n\n<b>EXT.   UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nAs a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A\nglimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear\npartially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.\n\n<b>EXT.   CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT\n</b>\nA MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father\nwaving a white shirt out the window like a surrender\nflag.\n\n<b>EXT.   BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)\n</b>\nFootbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway.\nEmpty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown\nneighborhood. Looks more like \"war torn Beirut\", burnt\nout cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to\nthe waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the\nfootbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi-\nderelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of\nfabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He\nslams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves.\n\n<b>EXT.   DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nRUSH HOUR.

The misfire.     He\nempties the other cartridges from his gun.\n\nLisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional\noutburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood\nfrom his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms\nbeneath his.

Slivers of light illuminate her\nemotionally drained face.\n\n<b>                         LISA\n</b>                   (silence)\n            I don't believe you.\n\n<b>                         CREASY\n</b>            I want you to get into your car now and\n            meet me on the south end of the\n            footbridge between Reforma and the\n            freeway junction. In 45 minutes.\n\n<b>                            LISA\n</b>            You're lying.     I don't believe you.\n\n<b>                         CREASY\n</b>            Then don't come.\n\nHe disconnects.   He cannot waste his ebbing strength.\n\n<b>EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AZTECS - SUNSET\n</b>\nDarkness has fallen. Few people are on the street as\nCreasy pulls to the south end of the bridge. He parks...\nlooks around... it's deserted. She's not coming. Checks\nhis watch, turns and walks toward the bridge. The Ramos\nMercedes drives up the bridge. Headlights off. Lisa is\ndriving. She exits the car.\n\nShe runs to catch Creasy.\n\n<b>                         LISA\n</b>            Creasy... Wait.\n\n<b>                         CREASY\n</b>            Stay here. If you do something stupid,\n            we won't get her back.\n\nHe climbs the steps of the bridge trying to maintain his\ndignity through the pain. He can see cars parked on the\nother side.\n\nOTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - Creasy's POV\n\nCreasy's dreamlike POV (Is it real or a dream) A\ndriver exits a shadowed car and opens the passenger door.\nA SMALL FIGURE in a hooded sweat shirt and sweat pants\nexits the car. Confused. Disoriented.\n\n<b>CREST OF THE BRIDGE\n</b><b>\n</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     124.\n\n\nCreasy waits. Breathing labored breaths. He sees it all.\n\n<b>OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE\n</b>\nThe driver unties little hands. Removes a blindfold from\nunder the hood. He steps away. Offering no help.\n\nThe small figure is confused.\n\n<b>CREST OF THE BRIDGE\n</b>\nCreasy calls out:\n\n<b>                             CREASY\n</b>               Pinta.   Pinta.\n\nShe turns and looks. It looks remarkably like her even\nunder the hooded sweatshirt. She begins to run. Across\nthe street, up the steps toward Creasy. A screaming\ntrain flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the\nbridge.\n\nTime stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to\nnothing.\n\nShe runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the\nbridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face.\nIt's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into\nCreasy's arms. This is not the little girl we\nexperienced in the beginning of the movie. The\nexperience she just endured has been life changing. All\nof a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old\nbody.\n\nShe wraps herself around him. He picks her up.     We\nglimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk.     But we\ndo not hear the words.\n\nShe notices her mom on the far side of the bridge.\nCreasy maneuvers her toward Lisa.\n\nBefore she goes to her mother we hear:\n\n<b>                            PINTA\n</b>               I love you, Creasy... And you love me,\n               right?\n\nCreasy nods.    The inference is that he will see her in a\nfew minutes.\n\nWe start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully, quietly on the\nwind singing \"Blue Bayou.\" He continues to walk across\nto the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the\nkidnappers' car.\n<b>\n</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                          125.\n\n\nThere's a certain sort of calm of him.\nHe closes the door, he lays his head against the back\nwindow. He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the\nbridge, where she's screams for Creasy. \"Blue Bayou\"\ngets LOUDER. Pinta now knows it was a lie. Creasy is\nnot coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the\nback window. We se Mexico City reflected in the glass.\nAs the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay\nhis head back and close his eyes as the car descends down\ninto a dark tunnel.\n\nPinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing. He can\nhear her screams before being enveloped by the night. As\n\"Blue Bayou\" continues...\n\n<b>EXT.    MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY\n</b>\nDark spot in the road. Suddenly Police lights, on the\nroofs of four cars, flash simultaneously in front, in\nblocking position. The driver turns and looks back\nwanting to escape. He has a blacked out AFI armored van\nright on his rear bumper. Nowhere to go.\n\nSWAT at his door.    He's pulled and proned out onto the\nroad.\n\nManzano enters the driver's seat.       Reaching back to\nCreasy. Grabs his hand.\n\n<b>                           MANZANO\n</b>              I'm your chauffeur now, Creasy.\n\nManzano does a U-turn.    Heading away.     On his portable\nradio.\n\n<b>                          MANZANO\n</b>              All units. Commence the operation.\n              Repeat. Commence.\n\nHe reaches back again.\n\n<b>                            MANZANO\n</b>              Creasy?   Creasy?\n\nCLOSE UP - Two hands clasp.\n\nCreasy's left with Manzano's right. A strong grip.         Then\nno response. Manzano pulls to the curb.\n\nManzano reaches Creasy's wrist.       Takes his pulse.\nCreasy's gone.\n\nBeat.\n<b>\n</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     126.\n\n\nManzano kneels.   Still holding Creasy.   Unfolds Creasy's\nfingers.\n\nCLOSE UP - Pinta's medallion of St. Jude clutched in his\nhand.\n\nManzano punches the seat again again and again.\n\n<b>                           MANZANO\n</b>            Goddamn you.\n\n<b>EXT. GUARDIAN'S CAR - HIGH ANGLE U-TURN\n</b>\nManzano looks at Creasy and makes a decision.\n\n<b>                         MANZANO\n</b>                   (keys mic)\n            Hold at the perimeter.   Until I enter.\n\n<b>EXT. DANIEL'S COMPOUND\n</b>\nDark, suburban Cuernavaca street. Creasy's car rounds\nthe corner. Security outside the compound motions to\nopen the garage doors. The driver of the car is\nfaceless. Street light reflections across the\nwindshield.\n\nThe car enters the gates. A collection of armed bodies\nappear in the courtyard curious to see this national\nhero. \"Hombre en Fuego.\"\n\nThe car stops. Nothing. This beat seems interminable.\nA hand opens the rear door: His forehead explodes. The\ndriver door opens barely two shots, two more bodies drop.\n\nPanic and confusion. Everybody runs for cover. An\noverhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the\ncourtyard. An armored vehicle rams through the gates.\n\nManzano explodes out of the driver's door in slow motion.\nHe is clearly on a mission. He strides through the\nmayhem, Creasy's Sig Sauer in one hand, and a .45 auto in\nthe other.\n\nManzano's guide to his destination is the 'The Dreamer's'\nlittle Jack Russell running back to his master on\ninstinct.\n\nManzano moves purposefully. His surrounding environment\nis Chaplinesque in its chaos. He enters a long walkway\nto a patio, following the dog. Daniel Sanchez appears at\nthe end of the hall. We ramp him into slow motion. The\nMexican version of Gotti. He raises his arms, prepared\nfor the inevitable. The outcome is a given.\n<b>\n</b>Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  127.\n\n\nManzano unloads a magazine into him and we -\n\n<b>FREEZE FRAME\n</b>\n<b>SUPER TITLE:    \"HOMBRE EN FUEGO\"\n</b>\n<b>BLACKNESS.\n</b>\n<b>                            CREASY'S VOICE\n</b>               Ezekiel 25:17.
