MEXICO CITY - DAY\n\nHigh over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun\npounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we\ndescend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:\nthe sounds of a Mass being sung.\n\nA CATHOLIC CHURCH\n\nThe big wooden doors open to release the parishioners\ninside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his\nGIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin.\nThey don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a\nfaucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes\n500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...\n\nA GRAND MARQUIS\n\nSqueals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside\nthe Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a\nmoment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff-\narming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the\ngossip among the parishioners begins...\n\nThe Grand Marquis pulls away.\n\nINT.   GRAND MARQUIS - DAY\n\nThey shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat.\nThese guys are not the police.\n\nA switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the\nboy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels.\nEighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.\n\nDuct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.\n\nEXT.   WOODED AREA - DAY\n\nThe Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW\nGUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His\nclothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He\nstands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over\nfrom one group to the other.\n\nINT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY\n\nThe phone rings. A bomb going off.

Facing   it, Eighteen\nstands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his\nleg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK\nRUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf.\n\nA MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates\nby cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps\nhis thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear\nscratched.\n\nAt a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the\nground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in\ntape leaving one ear exposed.\n\nCUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA\nnewspaper, being interviewed, \"...organized crime\nsyndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last\ntwo years.\"\n\nEXT.   UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY\n\nAs a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A\nglimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear\npartially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.\n\nEXT.   CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT\n\nA MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father\nwaving a white shirt out the window like a surrender\nflag.\n\nEXT.   BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)\n\nFootbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway.\nEmpty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown\nneighborhood. Looks more like \"war torn Beirut\", burnt\nout cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to\nthe waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the\nfootbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi-\nderelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of\nfabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open.

SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT\n\nSamuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle\nrendering of 'Delibes'.     His American wife LISA stands\naway from him. Just the     sight of her back reveals a\npitch perfect petulance.    She tells him:\n\nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                       4.\n\n\n                          LISA\n             A man's worth can be judged by what he\n             has or what he owes.

A bodyguard's presence in the\n             car or outside the school was at least\n             some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I\n             feel totally exposed.\n\nShe just stares at him.    He melts.\n\n                                                  RETURN TO:\n\nINT.

Beheading two\ncigars, he passes one to Samuel.\n\nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                5.\n\n\n                         JORDAN\n            All my clients have kidnap and ransom\n            insurance.\n\n                         SAMUEL\n            I have a policy, AIG.

Suddenly the\nbarrel is at his forehead and the trigger has been\npulled. No gun shot. A click. Hammer against shell.\nCreasy is confused. He ejects the shell and catches it\nin the palm of his hand.

Even great marriages cannot\nsurvive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death.\n\nThe door opens and they expect to see Maria with the\ndeserts.

Last week he wired $2.5 million\n             into his U.S. bank account. Colonel\n             Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He\n             hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5\n             million. If my arithmetic is correct it\n             means $5 million remains.\n\nCreasy looks to Samuel.\n\n                          CREASY\n             Your husband magically had five million\n             deposited in a U.S. bank account last\n             Friday.\n\nLisa's eyes never leave Creasy's...trying to discern\nwhether this is true or not.\n\n                          CREASY\n             They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.\n\n                             LISA\n             Planned what?\n\nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     109.\n\n\n                         CREASY\n            An autosequestra.

It\n            didn't work out that way. Everything got\n            fucked up when I killed the cops and\n            Tazinari saw an opportunity.\n\nLisa screams.   Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips.\n\n                         CREASY\n            On the surface it was low risk and high\n            return.

The misfire.     He\nempties the other cartridges from his gun.\n\nLisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional\noutburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood\nfrom his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms\nbeneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the\nfirst time.\n\nCreasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the\nmagazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's\neyes.\n\n                         CREASY\n            A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells\n            the truth.

He can see cars parked on the\nother side.\n\nOTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - Creasy's POV\n\nCreasy's dreamlike POV (Is it real or a dream) A\ndriver exits a shadowed car and opens the passenger door.\nA SMALL FIGURE in a hooded sweat shirt and sweat pants\nexits the car.

He sees it all.\n\nOTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE\n\nThe driver unties little hands. Removes a blindfold from\nunder the hood. He steps away. Offering no help.\n\nThe small figure is confused.\n\nCREST OF THE BRIDGE\n\nCreasy calls out:\n\n                             CREASY\n               Pinta.   Pinta.\n\nShe turns and looks. It looks remarkably like her even\nunder the hooded sweatshirt. She begins to run. Across\nthe street, up the steps toward Creasy. A screaming\ntrain flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the\nbridge.\n\nTime stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to\nnothing.\n\nShe runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the\nbridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face.\nIt's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into\nCreasy's arms. This is not the little girl we\nexperienced in the beginning of the movie. The\nexperience she just endured has been life changing. All\nof a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old\nbody.\n\nShe wraps herself around him. He picks her up.     We\nglimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk.     But we\ndo not hear the words.\n\nShe notices her mom on the far side of the bridge.\nCreasy maneuvers her toward Lisa.\n\nBefore she goes to her mother we hear:\n\n                            PINTA\n               I love you, Creasy... And you love me,\n               right?\n\nCreasy nods.    The inference is that he will see her in a\nfew minutes.\n\nWe start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully, quietly on the\nwind singing \"Blue Bayou.\" He continues to walk across\nto the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the\nkidnappers' car.\n\nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                          125.\n\n\nThere's a certain sort of calm of him.\nHe closes the door, he lays his head against the back\nwindow. He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the\nbridge, where she's screams for Creasy. \"Blue Bayou\"\ngets LOUDER. Pinta now knows it was a lie. Creasy is\nnot coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the\nback window. We se Mexico City reflected in the glass.\nAs the car pulls out, time slows, and we see Creasy lay\nhis head back and close his eyes as the car descends down\ninto a dark tunnel.\n\nPinta can see Creasy's face, eyes slowly closing. He can\nhear her screams before being enveloped by the night. As\n\"Blue Bayou\" continues...\n\nEXT.    MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY\n\nDark spot in the road.

The driver of the car is\nfaceless. Street light reflections across the\nwindshield.\n\nThe car enters the gates. A collection of armed bodies\nappear in the courtyard curious to see this national\nhero. \"Hombre en Fuego.\"\n\nThe car stops. Nothing. This beat seems interminable.\nA hand opens the rear door: His forehead explodes. The\ndriver door opens barely two shots, two more bodies drop.\n\nPanic and confusion. Everybody runs for cover. An\noverhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the\ncourtyard. An armored vehicle rams through the gates.\n\nManzano explodes out of the driver's door in slow motion.\nHe is clearly on a mission. He strides through the\nmayhem, Creasy's Sig Sauer in one hand, and a .45 auto in\nthe other.\n\nManzano's guide to his destination is the 'The Dreamer's'\nlittle Jack Russell running back to his master on\ninstinct.\n\nManzano moves purposefully.
