Turning\nhis head slightly, Doc can see Carol standing at the entrance\nto the kitchen.

The big gun belches the full slip\nin a stuttering EXPLOSION... the slide remains back and in an\nejected position.\n\nBEYNON is driven back to the kitchen wall. He SHRIEKS aloud,\nthe noise strangely like laughter... his body flattens\nagainst the surface, slips downward^ riddled by the big bore\nslugs... Doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned\ntable. He looks up from Beynon's crumpled body. Carol takes\ntwo steps forward, then drops the automatic, sending it\nclattering and spinning away across the floor.\n\nDOC looks at Carol, their eyes find each other. He turns,\nmoves to the sink, splashes water across his face, then fills\na glass of water from the tap ... drinks it; he looks back at\nher.\n\nCAROL stands watching Doc, tears scream down her cheeks.\n\nDOC crosses to Carol, takes her arm, picks up the gun, spent\nshells and the suitcase, then leads her out of the kitchen\ntoward the back door. Beynon's body has slipped from sight,\nonly a few traces of blood show along the white wall.\n\n                                                             48.\n\n\n\nINT. PANEL TRUCK - DUSK\n\nRudy is driving along an open highway. Rudy mouths inane\nlyrics to the radio, one arm on the wheel, the other\nclutching his wound.

TRAIN STATION - MORNING\n\nCAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward.\nShe struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and\nher oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticket\nbuyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impractical\nto set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike.\nBaggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend\noff into clumped rows within the wings of the station.\n\nCAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase\nflush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in\nplace with one leg. Carol pops open her purse... a clumsy\nitem in itself... as she lifts her wallet and the elderly\nticket-seller looks across to her.\n\n                    CAROL\n          Two day coach tickets -- on the Flyer.\n\n                    TICKET-SELLER\n          Thirty-four fifty-six with tax leaves in\n          forty-five minutes, gate three.\n\nCarol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse\nalong with the change. Wearily, she labors the satchel back\ninto her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the\nseemingly acres-wide station promenade.\n\nNEAR A PORTICO WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY, Carol sits\nuncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests\non the floor pressed tightly between her ankles. She glances\nacross the promenade walls, her eyes finding:\n\nA CLOCK READING: 9:40\n\nON A LOBBY BENCH - LATER\n\nCAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers\nwaiting on the wooden seats opposite from her.\n\nCarol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap,\npretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins\nrubbing the cuticles. Carol finally rises impulsively from\nthe bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather\nsatchel.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            51.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\nCAROL WALKS BACK DOWN THE PROMENADE while carrying   the\nsuitcase. As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   around\nher, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding   a glass-\nwalled Cocktail Lounge. She hesitates, then begins   to trudge\nin that direction.\n\nA BANK OF LOCKERS STANDS NEAR THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE. As Carol\napproaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of the\nnumbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small\nsuitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman\nquickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than\ntired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps\nto the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then\nstudies the time scarred operating instructions on the face\nof the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens\nthe locker door. As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the\nlocker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the\ndoor has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her\npredicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter\nout of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered\ndirections, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder.\n\nTHE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher\nfeatures are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap\ncorduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie. The\nMan's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness.\n\n                    DAPPER MAN\n          Kind of tricky, isn't it?\n\nShe turns, startled by his sudden proximity. In one smooth\nmovement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand,\ndeposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open.\nSetting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests\nit to show that it\n\nhas been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and\nputs it into Carol's hand. She is intimidated momentarily by\nthe Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as his\nintentions.\n\n                       CAROL\n          Thank you.\n\n                    DAPPER MAN\n              (toothy grin)\n          No trouble lady.\n\nStepping backward, his canine features disappear into a\nwelter of station activity. Carol watches his receding figure\nfor a moment, then simultaneously placing the key into her\npurse, she turns and begins moving towards the Cocktail\nLounge.\n\n                                                            52.\n\n\n\nINT.

He stands near another bank of\nlockers, the black suitcase at his feet.\n\nTHE THIEF LOOKS UP AT CAROL - virtually within the same\nmoment that she spots him. His expression never changes. He\ntakes a step towards her, smiling... Then, with a movement\nthat is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag\nand disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons.\n\nDOC HAS SEEN THE THIEF. Recognizing the suitcase he moves\nimmediately after him. Carol follows Doc but is unable to\nkeep up.

TRAIN STATION - A SERIES OF ANGLES - DAY\n\nDOC MOVING LIKE A GUN DOG ON THE HUNT between the rows of\nlockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes\nin.\n\nAfter a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked\nlocker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the\nslender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse.\nDoc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station\nis unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move\ncarefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make\nthemselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference.\n\nTHE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between\nthe incoming and departing passengers that dot the long\ncorridor.\n\nDOC IN PURSUIT DOWN THE CONCOURSE, he passes several sealed\noff departure/arrival gates.\n\nTHE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open\nstairway winding downward.\n\nDOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area\nwhere he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the\nloading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't\nsurprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps\nbehind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or\ntwo, the Thief edges out from behind another column and\nstarts back up the platform towards the concourse.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             60.\nCONTINUED:\n\nDoc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief\nspots his approach, he turns and Joins several passengers\nscurrying toward the awaiting train...\n\nTHE FLYER STANDS GLEAMING AT TRACKSIDE, perpendicular to the\nboarding gate. Two doors to the train stand open, one in the\npullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach\npassengers.\n\nCAROL - ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE - MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW of\nabout-to-depart passengers... the Flyer comes into sight,\nvisible on the next level below.\n\nTHE CONDUCTOR - AT TRACKSIDE - STANDS SMILING BROADLY by the\ncoach entrance. He grins at the boarding PASSENGERS as he\nspeaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a\nbaggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and\ninto the rail car passageway.\n\nDOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the\nconductor and into the train.\n\nTHE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the\nforward compartments.\n\nDOC EXPERTLY SQUIRMS THROUGH THE BOARDING THRONG and\ndisappears past the conductor up into the passenger car\nvestibule.\n\nON THE CONCOURSE\n\nCAROL WATCHES AS A BLONDISH MAN in a grey suit skips aboard\nthe Flyer standing below. She is unable to get a clear look\nat the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc.\nShe hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will\ntake her down to trackside...\n\nCarol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd\nhaving already passed through. She hesitates again, staring\ndown at the shining train.\n\nINT. FLYER - DAY COACH\n\nTHE AISLE IS CLOGGED WITH PASSENGERS. People hesitate over\ntheir selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks,\nclumsily remove their overcoats...

He is\none car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact\nthat Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he\npasses. Doc is further delayed by a WOMAN blocking the aisle.\nShe struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an\noverhead carriage.\n\nDoc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her.\n\n30? THE THIEF MOVES THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE and into an 30?\nempty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a\nrun.\n\nDOC LOOKING, MOVING NIMBLY INTO ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND CAR.\nThe passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the\nfront of the train.\n\nTHE THIEF RUNS THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND INTO A SMOKER.\nThis car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace,\nswinging the heavy suitcase as he goes... reaching the end of\nthe smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move\ninto the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by\nthe sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds\nonly baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car.\nThe Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door,\nhoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are\ntightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps.\n\nDOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, still\nunknowingly two cars behind the Thief.\n\nTHE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THE\nSMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge. He tries\nthe door -- locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks\nthe lock with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind\nhim as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the\nsmoker. None of them notes his activity. The restroom door\nswings open.\n\nINT. MEN'S LOUNGE\n\nThe Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him,\ncrosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window.\nHe strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly\njammed...\n\nDOC ENTERS THE FINAL PASSENGER CAR, notes the half 313 dozen\ntravelers and continues moving forward, going next into the\nsmoker.\n\n\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               62.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\nTHE SMOKING CAR IS EMPTY, although several Passengers and a\nPORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes\nthrough the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and,\nlike the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage\nblocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and\nbegins going back in the opposite direction.\n\nDOC STOPS AT THE MEN'S LOUNGE -- staring hard at the door for\na moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut.\n\n                       PORTER\n                 (appearing suddenly at Doc's\n                  shoulder)\n             Be open five minutes out of the station.\n\nDoc nods and moves away, continuing to retrace his steps\ntoward his point of entrance onto the train.\n\nTHE THIEF, HAVING ABANDONED THE JAMMED WINDOW, is now undoing\nthe snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed. The lid\npulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands. The\nThief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves\nthe stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket.\n\nDOC MOVES WITH DETERMINATION back through the passenger cars.\n\nINT.

TRACK\n\nMETAL WHEELS GRIND AGAINST THE RAILS, the train SHUDDERS,\nthen begins to move forward.\n\nTHE THIEF IS WATCHING THROUGH THE MEN'S ROOM WINDOW as the\ntrain edges forward.

As the\n             Flyer continues to move slowly forward,\n             Doc disappears from view.\n\nTHE THIEF ALLOWS HIMSELF A QUICK SMILE. Turning away from the\nwindow he picks up the suitcase, unbolts the lock and steps\nback out into the vestibule.\n\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             63.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\nAT THE BACK OF THE SMOKER, the Thief seats himself next to a\nwindow and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair\nopposite from him. In the forward position of the car, well\nbehind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered\nabout the lounge chairs. A Conductor appears at the end of\nthe smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch\ntickets.\n\nAs the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an\nabandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him.\nHe glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the\npaper. As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief\nrests one foot against the suitcase. All seems secure. Then,\nDoc sits down next to the Thief.\n\nDOC COMPANIONABLY SLIDES AN ARM BEHIND THE BACK OP THE\nTHIEF'S NECK, pulling him close.\n\n                    DOC\n              (softly almost gently)\n          When you pop a lock don't mark it.\n\nThe Thief's knife instantly flashes into his hand, but before\nhe can bring it into play, Doc catches his arms.\n\nTHE KNIFE IS TIGHTLY WEDGED INTO THE THIEF'S HAND. Doc's\nfingers are vise-like at his wrist.\n\nTHE OTHER PASSENGERS REMAIN PRE-OCCUPIED AT THE OTHER end of\nthe car, taking no note of the quiet encounter.\n\nTHE CONDUCTOR IS STILL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CAR from\nDoc and the Thief.

Carol continues to hold the suitcase up in\nfront of herself, almost like a shield. The distance between\nDoc and Carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut\noff by the four opponents standing near the reception desk.\nCarol edges backward a few steps, toward the massive wooden\nstaircase.\n\n                    ACCOUNTANT\n          Just have her set it down.\n\nDoc's hand comes out of his coat pocket, a slow gesture\nrevealing that his palm is empty.\n\n                    DOC\n          You want it?

HE DUCKS TO   THE RIGHT, levels the\ndisguised shotgun and fires in the   same movement. The\nreception desk near the Accountant   splinters from the blast\nand he is hit painfully. The other   three men duck away from\nthe sudden burst of fire power.\n\nDOC AND CAROL JUMP FOR THE STAIRS\n\nHAYHOE LEVELS HIS PISTOL AT THE RETREATING COUPLE Another\nshot from Doc's riot gun... this one breaking open the floor\nat Hayhoe's feet and cutting him down at the knees.

They\nmiss their shots, digging up walls, stairs and flooring.\n\nON THE WINDING STAIRWAY DOC AND CAROL FLEE UPWARD She\nstruggles with the heavy suitcase, Doc transfers the riot gun\nto his left hand, pulls out the more accurate .45 to use with\nhis right.\n\n                                                         102.\n\n\n\nWITHIN THE LOBBY THE SIX MEN SPLIT FORCES\n\nCully and the Accountant run to the elevator, enter it, pull\nthe door shut.

Still below the\nfirst level landing, their eyes search overhead. The SOUND of\nDoc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard.\n\nHAYHOE LEANS OUT OVER THE BANISTER, points his gun directly\nup and fires.\n\nDOC AND CAROL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR landings as\nHayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister\nsupports.\n\nINSIDE THE ELEVATOR THE ACCOUNTANT AND CULLY WATCH the arrow\nindicator pass \"Two.\"\n\nDOC AIMING HIS .45 RESTING IT ON THE BANISTER He fires two\nshots back down the stairwell.\n\nSWAIN AND HAYHOE MOVING UP THE STEPS TWO AT A TIME Suddenly\nHayhoe's leg buckles as a .45 slug tears through his hip, the\nother bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder.\n\nSWAIN IS NOW BESIDE THE BANISTER, he points his 54l revolver\nstraight up... empties it.\n\nDOC AND CAROL AS SWAIN'S BULLETS BREAK AROUND THEM. Doc pulls\nCarol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell\nwith a huge roar.\n\nTHE STAIRCASE TEN FEET IN FRONT OF SWAIN IS SMASHED by Doc's\nblast. Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to\ncontinue moving upward. Cannon following.\n\nTHE ELEVATOR INDICATOR STOPPING AT \"THREE\"\n\nCULLY PULLS OPEN THE DOOR, MOVES OUT INTO THE corridor. The\nAccountant remains within the elevator.\n\nSWAIN ON THE STAIRWAY FIRES HIS PISTOL UPWARD\n\nCAROL, ON THE STAIRWAY ABOVE, AS THE SHOTS SMASH PAST, runs\nahead of Doc by three steps.

He knows that he and\nCarol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware\nof the fact that the gunsels have split their forces.\n\nRUDY ON THE THIRD FLOOR AGAIN RISES LIKE LAZARUS FROM THE\nDEAD. His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly\nwobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran... she sobs\nviolently, her back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up\nhis .44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's\nroom. He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door.\n\nCAROL FRANTICALLY MOVING UPWARD, DOC HAS NOW FALLEN five\nsteps behind.\n\nDOC FIRES THE .45 DOWN THE STAIRWELL AT\n\nSWAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR\n\nCully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised. He\nmoves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the\ndistance from the elevator. The Accountant is still within\nthe elevator.\n\nCarol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The\nSOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses\na movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As\nCarol screams:\n\nDoc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane\nof movement knee high.,, the riot gun in his left hand, .45\nin his right.\n\nCULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds\nfling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed\nby the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of\ntheir mark.\n\nDOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLE\n\nTHE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the\nriot gun's jumbo shots, as is the top of the elevator. The\nplaster flies away revealing further damage. The cables are\nsmashed, the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward.\n\nTHE EMERGENCY CABLE, INSIDE THE SHAFT\n\nTHE MECHANISM TRANSFERS OVER, line catching within the pulley\nhousing.

The Accountant bounces from the floor\nof the car to the ceiling, then back to the floor.\n\nLaughlin leans across the reception desk in great pain. He\nsees the suspended car through the iron grill door.\n\nThe Accountant lies completely still on the floor of the\nelevator. His head and neck twisted at an oblique angle.\n\nDOC ON THE THIRD FLOOR LANDING\n\nHE JAMS SEVERAL SHELLS INTO HIS RIOT GUN WHILE HOLDING his\n.45 ready for an appearance by Swain. Reloading completed, he\nstands, with Carol. He again begins to move upward.\n\nSWAIN FIRES FROM THE STAIRWELL\n\nDOC STOPS, SETS BOTH THE RIOT GUN AND THE .45 on 562 the\nbanister... He waits... on the winding staircase below him\nthere is a dark movement.\n\nDOC FIRES BOTH GUNS\n\nTHE STAIRWELL AROUND SWAIN DISINTEGRATES.

Carol's underwear is still present.\nRudy's pistol lies on the soap tray.\n\nTHE LANDING AS DOC AND CAROL COME POUNDING INTO VIEW. No\nfurther avenues open, they turn down the corridor. Doc grabs\nCarol and pushes her into the room, past Fran; he kicks the\ndoor shut.\n\nINT. THE ROOM\n\nDOC GRABS THE SUITCASE, RUNS TO THE WINDOW, TEARS off the\nshade, lifts the frame, looks.
