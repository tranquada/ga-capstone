RAIN falls.\n          \n          A PATCH OF MUD stirs-- something below is moving.       The MUD\n          roils, seeming to assume a HUMAN SHAPE...\n          \n          EYES OPEN, looking around in shock, the naked FIGURE is so\n          drenched in mud we can't recognize it at first. The figure\n          rises, looks up at the sky, and FALLING RAIN washes away mud\n          from his face... it's MARCUS WRIGHT.

PLATEAU - EVENING\n          \n          BARE FEET trudge through the dirt. MARCUS moves along a\n          slight rise, wrapped in torn and filthy RAGS, mud caked on\n          his body. Eerie silence. Reaching the edge of a rise, he\n          sees in the distance--\n          \n          A DECIMATED CITY, buildings collapsed into rubble.\n          \n          \n          EXT.   DEAD CITY - NIGHT\n          \n          MOONLIGHT. THE SKELETON of a large DOG lies on the ground,\n          partially covered by a dusting of SNOW. It still bears a\n          rotting COLLAR attached to a CHAIN.\n          \n          MOVE to a CHAIN-LINK FENCE, partially collapsed, a singed,\n          faded sign: \"BEWARE OF DOG.\"\n          \n          WIDER, we're in the low-rent district of this CITY IN RUINS--\n          rubble, random walls still stand. Hulks of cars, rusted,\n          windowless. It's been over a decade since the bombs fell.\n          \n          MARCUS is the only thing alive here. He moves down this\n          block, picks up a handful of SNOW, brings it to his lips.\n          \n          A COLLAPSED NEWSSTAND. MARCUS walks past the racks, picks up\n          a MAGAZINE which crumbles in his hands.\n          \n          A HUMAN SKELETON, clothes in tatters, is half-buried behind\n          the collapsed counter. There's a bulge in its shirt pocket.\n          \n          MARCUS gingerly reaches into the pocket and fishes out a\n          cellophane-wrapped PACK OF CIGARETTES and a butane LIGHTER.\n          \n          MARCUS sits on a piece of rubble by the skeleton. He tears\n          open the packet and puts a dried-out, stale cigarette to his\n          lips, tries the lighter a few times, finally gets a flame.\n          He lights the cig, inhales deeply-- he waits for a rush,\n          feels nothing. He takes a few more drags, increasingly\n          disappointed, then flicks the cigarette away.\n          \n          He rises, looks toward a caved-in STOREFRONT, makes out a\n          clothing store's TATTERED SIGN on the ground, amidst broken\n          glass: \"SALE!

RUINED CLOTHING STORE - NIGHT\n          \n          FALLEN RACKS, CLOTHES and SHOES covered in years of dust and\n          rubble. MARCUS, grateful to be rid of the rags, has pulled\n          on jeans and sneakers, using the CIGARETTE LIGHTER for\n          illumination. He kicks away some FALLEN CEILING TILES from a\n          RACK OF ARMY JACKETS. He holds one up-- looks good.\n          \n          \n          INT.   RUINED BAR - NIGHT\n          \n          Partially collapsed, a downscale watering hole. Broken\n          stools, booths, a dead pinball machine. MARCUS, dressed now,\n          again using the LIGHTER to find his way, sorts through the\n          broken glass and rubble behind the bar, comes up with--\n          \n          A DUSTY BOTTLE OF WHISKY.\n          \n                               MARCUS\n                     Hallelujah.\n          \n          He unscrews the cap, raises the bottle to a SKELETON on the\n          floor nearby. Marcus takes a long pull-- and CHOKES,\n          instantly dizzy. He sinks to the floor, passing out.\n          \n                                                      CUT TO BLACK.\n          \n          MEMORY MONTAGE: quick, fragmentary, impressionistic POVs,\n          blurred, altered.

TILT DOWN to find MARCUS, who plods on through the\n          dead city's outskirts. He pauses near a collapsed BUS KIOSK.\n          A SMILING WOMAN stares out at him from a faded ADVERTISEMENT.\n          \n          MARCUS studies the woman. She's nothing like Serena, but her\n          expression recalls the beckoning vision.\n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                           10.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          He runs his hand over the image of her face, pulls away a\n          chunk of cracked, graffitied GLASS over the poster.

HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n          \n          Deserted, CAR HULKS about, crumbling SKELETONS at the wheels.\n          MARCUS moves down the center of the freeway on this MOONLIT\n          NIGHT, paying little attention to anything around him. We're\n          in mostly flat, treeless plains.\n          \n          From the opposite direction, FIGURES approach, moving through\n          the darkness.

These aren't humans. They're T-\n          400s-- PLASTIC-SKINNED TERMINATORS-- armed with PLASMA\n          RIFLES. They wear a motley collection of found CLOTHING, but\n          their male humanoid faces are identical, unnatural and\n          motionless, like masks. Their EYES FLICKER RED as they scan\n          him.\n          \n                                   MARCUS (cont'd)\n                       Oh God...\n          \n          Marcus backs away, runs.

Got\n                       any food?\n          \n          Marcus raises his hands, shakes his head.

As soon as it\n          does, MUSIC BLARES from the tape deck-- raucous HEAVY METAL,\n          the aged cassette SPEEDS and SLOWS.

A STEEL LID in the top of the container OPENS\n          hydraulically, the Harvester DEPOSITS the HUMAN CAPTIVES\n          inside, and the LID SLAMS SHUT.\n          \n          MARCUS has emerged from the garage, still carrying the AXE.\n          He stays low, hidden behind the tanker, watching as--\n          \n          --PIG and BULL flee through a back entrance to the garage,\n          immediately attracting the attention of--\n          \n          --the Harvester, which sets off in pursuit.\n          \n          Marcus comes to a decision.    He SPRINTS into the open, toward\n          the TRANSPORT, and--\n          \n          --CLAMBERS up the side, hitting the thing at full speed,\n          using an engine pod to boost himself higher. He's still\n          short but swings the AXE and--\n          \n          --hooks the AXE HEAD over the top of the container, like a\n          grappling hook. He pulls himself up and--\n          \n          \n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                          32.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          --crawls across the roof, to the LID. There's a barred,\n          reinforced MESH PANEL here, through which he can see--\n          \n          ANGLE IN TRANSPORT\n          \n          --about TWENTY HUMAN PRISONERS, unconscious on the steel\n          floor. Among them are KYLE and STAR. Star MOANS, opens her\n          eyes briefly and sees--\n          \n          --MARCUS' SILHOUETTE above her.\n          \n          Her eyes flutter shut again.\n          \n          MARCUS struggles to raise the sealed lid, but there's no\n          purchase available, just a smooth seam. Suddenly--\n          \n          --the TRANSPORT JERKS. MARCUS nearly loses his footing as\n          the TRANSPORT STARTS ROLLING forward. He drops to his belly,\n          seeing that the transport is approaching--\n          \n          --the HARVESTER, which now carries PIG and BULL, both\n          unconscious. THE LID OPENS and the Harvester DROPS the two\n          men INSIDE-- but its camera eyes fail to register Marcus, who\n          crouches behind the open lid. As the lid BEGINS TO CLOSE,\n          the Harvester attaches to the armature at the front of the\n          transport, making itself an aerodynamic part of the machine.\n          \n          MARCUS THRUSTS THE HEAD OF THE AXE under the closing LID in\n          order to prevent it from sealing. THE LID grinds against it,\n          but remains ajar. A moment later--\n          \n          --THE ENGINE PODS ROTATE DOWNWARD, FIRE and--\n          \n          --THE TRANSPORT LIFTS OFF THE GROUND. Within moments, the\n          airborne dumpster has risen hundreds of feet in the air.\n          \n          \n          EXT.   AERIAL - DAY\n          \n          MARCUS moves to the edge, looks down in astonishment at the\n          fallow plains far below. Looking to the side, he sees--\n          \n          --A PAIR OF HUNTER KILLERS, swooping in quickly to provide an\n          escort for the slower moving transport.\n          \n          WIND buffets Marcus, he hangs on for dear life. Clinging to\n          the top of the transport, he slowly makes his way back toward\n          the LID. As the transport BANKS, he almost loses his grasp,\n          dangling for a moment before the craft rights itself.\n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                          33.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          MARCUS reaches under the jammed lid and pulls with all his\n          might. This thing is really heavy, plus he's fighting the\n          WIND BLAST. MARCUS hears something behind him--\n          \n          THE HARVESTER has spotted him and is now prying itself loose\n          from the armature. Also buffeted by the wind, it starts to\n          move gingerly down the length of the transport toward Marcus.\n          \n          MARCUS must let the LID CLOSE. He snatches up the AXE, takes\n          a couple of WHACKS at the thing, DENTING the metal, but doing\n          no serious damage. The Harvester KNOCKS the weapon out of\n          his hand, Marcus has no choice but to keep backing away.\n          \n          MARCUS is driven to the back of the transport. Struggling\n          for handholds, he lowers himself out of sight, down the\n          framework along the side, getting out of the wind. Suddenly--\n          \n          --STEEL CLAWS WRAP around him FROM BELOW, YANK him downward.\n          \n          THE HARVESTER has crawled around the SIDE of the TRANSPORT,\n          and under the BOTTOM, in order to GRAB HIM. The hideous\n          machine now holds him in its clutches, hundreds of feet in\n          the air, its CAMERA EYES fixed on him.\n          \n          THE HARVESTER produces its needle, it's coming at his face--\n          but MARCUS frees one hand, grabs the syringe, managing to\n          hold it back, inches from his skin. His strength is\n          weakening, but as the Harvester makes its final thrust--\n          \n          --he JERKS the NEEDLE to one side and it BENDS against one of\n          the Harvester's own steel limbs.\n          \n          Undaunted, the creature crawls up the side of the transport,\n          Marcus still in its clutches. It moves to the lid, which\n          OPENS. It lets go of Marcus to drop him inside when--\n          \n          --MARCUS seizes two of its appendages and swings up onto the\n          harvester's back, where he--\n          \n          --GRABS a couple of EYE STALKS, trying to RIP them from the\n          harvester's thorax, LOOSE WIRES SPARK. The Harvester twists\n          and thrashes, it's like he's a rodeo rider. A LIMB wraps\n          around him, starting to CRUSH him in a vise-like grip, when\n          SUDDENLY--\n          \n          --CANNON FIRE RIPS through the towering HARVESTER, blowing\n          its thorax to PIECES, barely MISSING MARCUS.\n          \n          \n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                          34.\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n          \n          A PAIR OF A-10 WARTHOGS-- the same colorful ground attack\n          aircraft we saw in the first battle-- ROAR PAST on either\n          side of the transport.\n          \n          THE CRIPPLED HARVESTER topples off the side of the transport,\n          still clutching MARCUS and--\n          \n          --CATCHES on an ENGINE POD, the creature and Marcus both\n          suspended in the air. THE HARVESTER ROASTS in the ENGINE\n          BLAST, its CPU finally dies. Marcus is suspended below the\n          engine, the steel limb RELEASES HIM, he has to cling to it\n          now, to keep from falling.\n          \n          The HUNTER-KILLERS peel out in pursuit of the two Resistance\n          planes.\n          \n          A DOGFIGHT ensues between the much larger, more heavily\n          armored H-Ks, and the smaller, more maneuverable WARTHOGS.\n          CANNON FIRE CATCHES an H-K but has no effect. The H-Ks' BLUE\n          PLASMA PULSES barely miss the planes, which loop and bank.\n          \n          An AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE STREAKS from a WARTHOG and BLASTS the\n          ENGINE of an H-K. AN EXPLOSION, the thing starts flying\n          erratically, heading downward and--\n          \n          --CRASHING to earth in a glorious FIREBALL.\n          \n          \n          EXT.   AERIAL & RIVER - DAY\n          \n          The planes are nearing a RIVER, bordered by sickly TREES.

Suddenly--\n          \n          --the BLACKHAWK CHOPPER drops down directly in front of\n          Marcus, hovering a few feet above the water, the GUNNER\n          pointing his weapon directly at Marcus (he's one of the two\n          soldiers we saw before). The BLADE WASH swirls the water in\n          a whirlpool and beats back the FIRE behind Marcus. As the\n          GUNNER OPENS FIRE--\n          \n          --MARCUS DIVES below the surface, BULLETS ZINGING through the\n          murky water.\n          \n          UNDERWATER - MARCUS is winged by a couple of shots, his\n          thermoplastic flesh getting torn apart--\n          \n          WITH THE GUNNER - He pauses a moment, squinting into the\n          WATER for a glimpse of Marcus, but failing to register that--\n          \n          --BELOW THE CHOPPER, right beneath him, the WATER ROILS as if\n          teeming with piranha. Suddenly--\n          \n          --HYDROBOTS ERUPT from the RIVER with a hideous BUZZING\n          SOUND. Hydrobots resemble segmented serpents, eyeless, but\n          with razor-sharp heads that DRILL into their victims-- they\n          respond to sound and vibrations. About a dozen of these four-\n          foot long, glistening steel snakes shoot from the water to\n          attack the chopper.\n          \n          INSIDE THE CHOPPER - HYDROBOTS PIERCE the aluminum FLOOR, and\n          shoot into the cabin, the PILOT and the two SOLDIERS CRY OUT.\n          \n          The GUNNER tumbles out of the chopper and FALLS in the water.\n          \n          THE PILOT attempts to maintain control, but the hydraulics\n          are damaged and the steel serpents thrash about in the cabin.\n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                          68.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          THE GUNNER surfaces, trying frantically to swim to shore.\n          But the hydrobots are upon him, he SHRIEKS and disappears\n          beneath the bubbling surface, which now boils with BLOOD.\n          \n          IN THE CHOPPER - A WHIRRING HYDROBOT penetrates the other\n          soldier's leg. He SCREAMS and wrenches the thing back out,\n          tossing it from the chopper just before--\n          \n          --THE CHOPPER CRASHES INTO THE SHALLOWS.\n          \n          THE PILOT leaps from the cabin and makes it to shore, where\n          he collapses. But the remaining, wounded SOLDIER can't get\n          out of the hip-deep water before the HYDROBOTS are upon him.\n          \n          Suddenly, HANDS BURST from the water, grabbing the soldier.\n          A second later, MARCUS SURFACES, slinging the man over his\n          shoulder. He strides to shore, as if rescuing the man from\n          enemy fire, hydrobots thrashing and bubbling at his waist.\n          \n          MARCUS reaches the amazed pilot, lays the wounded soldier\n          down beside him, then tears a whirring, writhing HYDROBOT\n          from the soldier's belly and WHIPS its head against a ROCK--\n          it SPARKS, micro-machine parts fly. The pilot and wounded\n          soldier stare at him, astonished.\n          \n                                 MARCUS\n                       Don't mention it.\n          \n          He tosses the dead robo-snake aside, then turns and moves\n          back into the water, quickly vanishing below the surface.\n          \n          UNDERWATER - MARCUS moves steadily across the silty river\n          bottom. He doesn't need air. HYDROBOTS come at him, he\n          swats them away as if they were mosquitoes, CRUSHING in his\n          hand those that linger too long. Those which make contact\n          with his artificial skin can't get far, turn and swim off.\n          \n          \n          EXT.   FAR RIVERBANK - DAY\n          \n          MARCUS emerges, the FLAMES still visible on the other side of\n          the river, behind him. He doesn't look back, as he moves\n          into Skynet turf. This side of the river isn't wooded,\n          everything has a concrete, industrial feel. Marcus is a\n          mess, both clothing and skin are shredded and charred.\n          \n          He nearly bumps into a SKELETAL STEEL TERMINATOR, which\n          emerges from behind a concrete wall. The terminator trains\n          its PLASMA RIFLE on MARCUS, scans him, RED EYES glowing...\n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                         69.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          TERMINATOR'S POV - RED FILTER, MARCUS' FORM is TARGETED.\n          READ-OUTS on the side, the HIGHLIGHTED WORDS \"NON-ORGANIC -\n          DO NOT TERMINATE.\"\n          \n          THE TERMINATOR turns from MARCUS, no longer interested,\n          moving off on its preprogrammed patrol.\n          \n          MARCUS moves up a sloping, CONCRETE EMBANKMENT.   At the top\n          of the rise, he sees, spread out before him--\n          \n          \n          EXT.   SKYNET TERRITORY - DAY\n          \n          --a hideous industrial sprawl, OPEN GAS FLAMES, SMOKING\n          FACTORIES, rumbling VEHICLES, H-Ks, TERMINATOR TROOPS on\n          patrol. Nothing green, a GREY HAZE hangs over the landscape.\n          \n          After a moment, MARCUS shakes his head and gamely soldiers\n          on, moving along the edge of the elevated embankment.\n          \n          \n          EXT.   SKYNET PERIPHERY - DAY\n          \n          MARCUS moves past banks of ANTI-AIRCRAFT guns and MISSILE\n          LAUNCHERS, interspersed with slowly rotating RADAR TRACKING\n          DISHES-- the first line of defense. From this fortress-like\n          wall he descends into the nightmarish environment beyond.\n          \n          MARCUS reacts to a CAWING SOUND above, looks up to see--\n          \n          --A CROW perching on an overhead WIRE.   A second later--\n          \n          ZAP! A BLUE PLASMA PULSE blasts the thing to smithereens, a\n          few BLACK FEATHERS drift down as--\n          \n          --a T-400 (same mask-like face we saw earlier) lowers its\n          plasma weapon and strolls on. Target practice.\n          \n          MARCUS stays out of the way of the TERMINATOR LEGIONS\n          patrolling near the riverside.\n          \n          \n          EXT.   DEMOLITION SITE - DAY\n          \n          MARCUS heads inland, past the ruins of a CHURCH-- WALLS with\n          the remains of stained glass WINDOWS, STATUES OF SAINTS.\n          Hearing RUMBLING NOISES, Marcus hurries out of the way as--\n          \n          \n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                          70.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          A WALL collapses, pushed down by an automated SKYNET\n          BULLDOZER. This gigantic, self-operated construction machine\n          has a swivelling CAMERA HEAD instead of a cab. Its giant\n          TREADS roll over the STONE STATUES, crushing them to dust.\n          \n          \n          EXT.   CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY\n          \n          MARCUS keeps moving into Skynet's turf. The demolition gives\n          way to massive CONSTRUCTION, as the robots remake the human\n          world in their own image.\n          \n          CONSTRUCTION ROBOTS erect a low-slung STEEL FRAME structure,\n          automated CRANES and SUPPLY TRUCKS about. These robots are\n          oversized versions of the steel terminators we know, but with\n          multiple limbs bearing WELDING TOOLS, and TREADS instead of\n          legs. Marcus watches as BEAMS are quickly welded into place\n          by telescoping steel arms.\n          \n          \n          EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY\n          \n          MARCUS continues into the completed robot city. Skynet's\n          ARCHITECTURE is featureless, bland, purely practical: single-\n          story, windowless CONCRETE or STEEL structures with massive\n          open DOORWAYS to accommodate their largest machines. A RED\n          GLOW emanates from the interiors, the robots' preferred\n          lighting scheme. No sidewalks or signs, just thick GRIDS of\n          POWER LINES and PIPES overhead. Constant NOISE of BUZZING\n          POWER, RATTLING MACHINES, etc.\n          \n          MARCUS steps inside one of these buildings--\n          \n          \n          INT.   TERMINATOR FACTORY - DAY\n          \n          This TERMINATOR ASSEMBLY PLANT is an intricate, multi-leveled\n          clockwork maze of moving CONVEYORS and INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS.\n          \n          ELECTRONICS and HYDRAULICS are ROBOTICALLY SOLDERED in place.\n          STEEL PRESSES stamp out TERMINATOR PARTS-- TORSOS, FACE\n          PLATES, SPINAL COLUMNS, LIMBS.\n          \n          Partially-completed PARTS are moved by CONVEYOR to ASSEMBLY\n          STATIONS, where LIMBS and HEADS are JOINED to TORSOS,\n          elaborate OPERATIONS carried out by INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS, like\n          the ones in present-day factories.\n          \n          \n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                          71.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          SYNTHETIC SKIN is SPRAYED OVER a METAL ENDOSKELETON in\n          precise amounts, building up to create human features... this\n          is a T-400.\n          \n          An INDUSTRIAL ROBOT ARM picks up a CPU from a DRY-ICE\n          CONTAINER. The CPU features the distinctive, linked\n          rectangles familiar from the earlier films. The arm lifts\n          this gingerly to a TERMINATOR SKELETON and INSERTS IT into\n          the STEEL SKULL, SCREWING A SEAL over the hole.\n          \n          THE RED EYES flicker to life, and THE ARMATURE releases the\n          TERMINATOR, which moves away under its own power. It removes\n          a PLASMA WEAPON from a WALL RACK, moving past--\n          \n          --the dumbfounded MARCUS.\n          \n          THE TERMINATOR joins a dozen identical robots, who ride on a\n          treaded SKYNET TANK with a PLASMA CANNON and FLAMETHROWER.\n          There are numerous TANKS here, awaiting deployment.\n          \n          \n          EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY\n          \n          Rounding a corner on a straight, narrow street, MARCUS sees\n          all the ROBOTS and SMALL VEHICLES clearing into small NICHES\n          built into the walls on either side, as if clearing a path\n          for him. It takes him a moment to realize it's not him\n          they're responding to-- a RUMBLE BUILDS...\n          \n          A convoy of GIGANTIC SKYNET TRUCKS-- a half-dozen modified\n          SEMIS now driven by CPUS-- bear down on MARCUS at extremely\n          high speed. They carry construction supplies: massive STEEL\n          BEAMS, CONCRETE PIPES, etc. And there's barely inches of\n          clearance on either side.\n          \n          These things aren't slowing down. There's nowhere for Marcus\n          to duck out of the way. He has no choice but to RUN, as fast\n          as he can, the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly.\n          \n          MARCUS THROWS HIMSELF to the concrete in the middle of the\n          street, pressing his body flat as the LEAD TRUCK passes over\n          him, the wheels missing him by inches.\n          \n          But he has only a moment's respite. THE NEXT TRUCK has a\n          lower undercarriage, a steel CROSSMEMBER catches his back--\n          \n          --and DRAGS MARCUS beneath the vehicle, ripping off chunks of\n          flesh.\n          \n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                               72.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          Marcus CRIES OUT, crawls ahead and clings to a forward\n          portion of the undercarriage, keeping himself just above the\n          pavement. His LEFT LEG, twisted and damaged, still drags on\n          the asphalt, throwing up SPARKS.\n          \n          OVERHEAD ANGLE ON THE TRUCK - CAMERA PULLS BACK straight\n          above the MOVING VEHICLE, amidst the convoy speeding down\n          this sunken artery. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING UPWARD to reveal an\n          AERIAL VIEW of Skynet's city. Seen from above, the\n          rectilinear STRUCTURES, criss-crossing POWER LINES and\n          SPEEDING VEHICLES strongly resemble a PULSING CIRCUIT BOARD.\n          \n                                                               CUT TO:\n          \n          \n          INT.

In\n          the distance is a COMPLEX OF BUILDINGS, clearly the\n          destination.\n          \n          Marcus begins moving along the edge of the freeway, heading\n          for the complex. He reaches the edge of a plateau, looks\n          down, his expression changing. This is the last thing he\n          expected to see.

But Jeremy\n          simply seems eager to help, as he guides him to the passenger\n          seat, then gets behind the wheel.

CONNOR can\n          barely speak above a whisper.\n          \n                                CONNOR\n                     Her name was Sarah... she was...\n                     amazing...\n          \n                               KYLE\n                     I don't remember my mother.\n          \n          KYLE starts to hand the photo back, CONNOR waves it away.\n          \n                                CONNOR\n                     Keep it.\n          \n          KYLE is a bit puzzled, but obediently keeps the snapshot.\n          KATE enters with MARCUS, touches the boy's shoulder.\n          \n                               KATE\n                     Kyle, could you give us a minute?\n          \n          KYLE reluctantly leaves, still looking at the photo, with a\n          nod to MARCUS on the way out. He joins STAR in the doorway,\n          they go off together.\n          \n          KATE, CONNOR and MARCUS are alone now. Throughout scene,\n          Kate fights to maintain a steely control-- but she's clearly\n          not far from tears.\n          \n                               KATE (cont'd)\n                     Marcus... you're going to need to\n                     be rebuilt. Your face, your body,\n                     your voice...\n                         (off his shrug)\n                     We have people who can do it.\n          \n          She pulls some MEDICAL DIAGRAMS out of a drawer, lays them\n          before Marcus. He examines--\n          \n          --a SCANNED IMAGE of his FACE, various elements HIGHLIGHTED.\n          \n                               KATE (cont'd)\n                     But you won't be the same...\n          \n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                         112.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          MARCUS moves to the NEXT IMAGE-- it shows his features\n          TRANSFORMED into another's-- something closer to JOHN\n          CONNOR'S FACE, with a JAGGED SCAR over part of his features.\n          \n                                 KATE (cont'd)\n                       The scar will help hide the change.\n          \n          Marcus lowers the papers, absorbing this.\n          \n                                  MARCUS\n                       You're asking me to become...\n                            (gesturing at Connor)\n                       Him?\n          \n          Connor can barely speak above a whisper:\n          \n                                   CONNOR\n                       You must.\n          \n                                 KATE\n                           (QUIETLY)\n                       We can't keep him alive much longer.\n                           (shakes her head, swallows)\n                       Very few people know what John\n                       actually looks like. Only the\n                       technicians and our closest advisors\n                       need ever know the truth.\n          \n                                   MARCUS\n                       Why me?\n          \n                                 KATE\n                       Who else?

You liberated a\n                       Skynet camp... you're a hero.\n          \n          Connor gestures for Marcus to move closer, he speaks with\n          great effort:\n          \n                                 CONNOR\n                       I never knew how I was supposed to\n                       win this war. But I finally\n                       understand: the idea of John Connor\n                       is more important than the person.\n                           (sinks back, spent)\n                       I can die.

We need you.\n          \n          MARCUS bows his head for a long beat, as if seeking an answer\n          from within. Then he looks up again with resolve.\n          \n          He lifts his hand-- the SKIN TATTERED, METAL exposed at\n          finger joints-- and moves to take CONNOR'S TREMBLING HAND.\n          \n                                                             CUT TO:\n          \n          \n          EXT.
