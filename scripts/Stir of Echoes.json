Racially mixed.\n          Two story brick houses jammed side by side, barely room for a\n          raised voice across the narrow driveways.

The DRIVER honks the horn and a\n          SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KID runs out of another house and jumps\n          into the moving vehicle. They take off. The Homeless Guy\n          berates them, shaking his fist.\n          They reach the steps of the house next door. PARTY NOISE\n          comes from within, shadows move in the windows.

Realizing, Tom turns hurriedly\n          toward the TV and hits the mute switch. When he turns back --\n          -- the woman is gone. He stands in the middle of the room,\n          looking all around him. But he's alone.\n\n<b>          INT BEDROOM NIGHT\n</b>          Tom crawls back into bed and pulls the blankets up tight\n          around him.

When Tom s\\ares\n          directly into the dozen large globes, the BUZZING souni\n          overwhelms him, nearly deafening. His hands shoot up to his\n          ears --\n          -- and he leaps to his feet.\n\n<b>          TOM\n</b>          Sf\"S TAXING BIM AWWAY!\n\n<b>          MAGGIE\n</b>\n<b>          WHAT?!\n</b>          Tom fights his way out of the row, climbing right over people.\n          They SHOUT their objections.\n\n<b>          INT TUNNEL NIGHT\n</b>          Tom races down the now-empty tunnel.

He doesn't hesitate,\n          just takes off toward it.\n\n<b>          TWO BLOCKS AHEAD,\n</b>          Tom is running as hard as he can. He stops, abruptly. The\n          buzzing sound is gone. He looks to his right. Behind a wall,\n          there is a large parking lot filled with buses.\n          He turns around. A dull white glow comes from the windows of\n          the place on the corner. He looks up, at the sign.\n          It's a Greyhound bus station.\n          Tom hurries back toward it, reaching the door just as Maggie\n          comes running up from the opposite direction.\n\n<b>          TOM\n</b>          Wait right here, keep your eyes open!\n          He opens the door and goes inside.\n\n<b>          INT BUS STATION NIGHT\n</b>          Tom steps into the station, still breathing hard.

Tom\n          walks slowly across the place to the figure. It's Dorothy.\n          As he draws closer, he sees Jake's face, over Dorothy's\n          shoulder. Jake's eyes are open, and he's staring up at the\n          ceiling.\n          Tom follows his son's gaze. Jake is staring up at the lights,\n          the old-style fluorescent tubes that give the place its\n          cancerous look. The tubes BUZZ loudly. It's the sound Tom's\n          been hearing.\n          Jake sees his father and smiles. Tom puts a finger to his\n          lips -- \"Shhhh.\" Jake yawns, closes his eyes, and drops his\n          head onto Dorothy's shoulder. He goes back to sleep.\n          Tom walks slowly around the end of the bench. Dorothy is\n          SINGING softly, an old nursery rhyme.\n          She looks up suddenly and sees Tom. She starts to jerk to her\n          feet. Tom puts a hand out -- take it easy. Dorothy sits\n          back, caught. Tom steps closer to her, carefully. He holds\n          both his hands out, palms up.\n\n<b>          (CONTINUED)\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          40. \n</b>\n<b>          CONTINUED:\n</b>\n<b>          TOM\n</b>          Give him to me.\n          She shakes her head no.

An\n          instinctive tie to our environment.\n          But then our brains began to focus.\n          We sacrificed the intuitions we first\n          had so our thoughts could be directed,\n          so we could master specific functions.\n          That's where we are at the moment.\n          We're brilliant with technique, but\n          we've given up instinct. So the next\n          evolutionary step, the step yet to\n          come, or perhaps it's already in the\n          making, is actually backward. To\n          maintain our higher functions, but\n          reawaken the part of our brain that\n          was pure intuition. That was\n          receptive to anything, because it\n          didn't know enough not to believe.\n          You're a freak of nature, pal, an\n          evolutionary step.

Harry SLUGS Tom in the face with the butt end of the\n          gun.\n          Tom falls to the floor, moaning. They step inside, quickly\n          closing the door behind them.

Now the house is totally\n          black inside.\n          Remembering something, she pulls her purse around and feels\n          inside it.

Gently,\n          he reaches out with one hand and puts his fingertips on the\n          baby's forehead, the same way he did to Tom's forehead that\n          first night.\n          The baby and Jake stare at each other for a long moment.
