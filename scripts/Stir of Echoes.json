I\n          was deep within the woods when,\n          suddenly, I spied them. I saw a pair\n          of pale green pants with nobody inside\n          them! I wasn't scared. But, yet, I\n          stopped. What could those pants be\n          there for? What could a pair of pants\n          at night be standing in the air for?\n          Maggie leans in the doorway and whispers.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          Is he asleep?

Tom closes the book, turns\n          off the light, and covers his son. He kisses him on the\n          forehead. Tom goes to a dresser and turns on the baby monitor\n          (the transmitter). Its red light glows.\n          After Tom leaves, Jake opens his eyes and stares.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          EXT STREET DAY\n          The Chicago skyline looms over the street they live on. Not\n          the suburbs, but not quite downtown either. Racially mixed.\n          Two story brick houses jammed side by side, barely room for a\n          raised voice across the narrow driveways. Bar on the corner,\n          neon sign -- \"BERNIE'S TAP.\" A HOMELESS GUY rants his way\n          down the opposite sidewalk.\n          Tom, Maggie, and PHILIP, early twenties, come out of the house\n          and head down the steps. Tom carries the baby monitor (the\n          receiver) in one hand. Jake's breathing is clearly audible on\n          the speaker.\n          Tom's on the sidewalk. Maggie, still three steps up, stops\n          and puts her arms wide. Tom turns around and Maggie lets\n          herself go, falling straight forward. Tom catches her on his\n          back and carries her piggy-back. She leans around and bites\n          his ear.\n\n          PHILIP\n          What are the odds of a single woman\n          being at this thing?\n\n          TOM\n          `Bout a million to one.\n\n          PHILIP\n          Any hot mommies?\n\n          TOM\n          Depends. How big you like `em?\n          The hot engine of a Yellow Trans-Am fires up in the driveway\n          of the house across the street. It backs into the street, its\n          passenger door hanging open. The DRIVER honks the horn and a\n          SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD KID runs out of another house and jumps\n          into the moving vehicle. They take off. The Homeless Guy\n          berates them, shaking his fist.\n          They reach the steps of the house next door. PARTY NOISE\n          comes from within, shadows move in the windows. Tom swings\n          Maggie around, puts her on the step, wraps his arms around\n          her, and kisses her. Great kiss.

Not just awake, but standing next\n          to his bed, perfectly straight, staring at the open doorway.\n          Tom steps in. He can see by the light of the nightlight.\n\n          TOM\n\n          (WHISPERS)\n          Jake?\n          The little boy doesn't answer. Tom walks slowly over to the\n          boy and squats down in front of him, putting his arms on the\n          boy's shoulders.\n          TOM (cont' d)\n          Are you okay?\n          Jake just looks at Tom, straight into his father's eyes. The\n          boy's face lights up in a wide smile. He reaches out with one\n          hand and rests his fingertips on Tom's forehead.\n\n          JAKE\n          Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.\n          The hell does that mean?\n          But before Tom can respond, Jake turns, climbs back in bed,\n          rolls over to face the wall, and goes back to sleep.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          INT BATHROOM NIGHT\n          Tom shakes some Advil into his palm; washes three down with a\n          glass of water. He runs water in the sink, splashes some on\n          his face. He straigltens, looks in the mirror as he wipes his\n          dripping face. He stares at himself for a moment, then\n          summons his nerve and closes his eyes.\n\n          IMMEDIATELY,\n          more images come.\n          -- The front of Tom's own house, from a distance. A MAN IN AN\n          OVERCOAT stands on the porch, waving to us to come in.\n          -- Rough hands attack us, covering our eyes and face.\n          -- A face, close to ours but blurry and distorted, as if seen\n          through dirty, blue-tinted eyeglasses.\n          -- Wooden floorboards as we race down toward them. We hit,\n          hard, and our blood sprays out onto the wood.\n\n          IN THE BATHROOM,\n          Tom's eyes pop open. That was disturbing.\n\n          INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT\n          Tom strides into the living room. Their house is small,\n          crowded with kids' toys and furniture they got for their\n          wedding. Tom paces back and forth, holding his head in his\n          hands. He turns and bolts into the kitchen.\n\n          IN THE KITCHEN,\n          Tom rips the refrigerator open and searches the top shelf. He\n          finds what he's looking for, a large carton of orange juice.\n          He opens a cabinet, takes out a glass and fills it.\n          He upends the glass, drains it in one gulp. Still\n          unsatisfied, he picks up the carton. He drinks the rest.\n          Juice runs down his chin.\n\n          BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM,\n          Tom drops onto the sofa. He sits for a moment, trying to\n          regain himself. His breathing returns to normal. He sits\n          forward, picks up the remote off the coffee table, points it\n          at the TV and turns it on. When he sits back --\n          -- there's a woman sitting next to him.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          22. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          She's eighteen or nineteen years old, so pale her skin's\n          almost luminous. She's attractive but odd, she wears a\n          billowy black dress with a diamond pattern, bangles up and\n          down each wrist. Her lips are light blue, her eyes red-\n          rimmed. Steam rises softly from her hair and skin; when she\n          speaks, her breath comes out of her mouth in clouds of vapor.\n\n          WOMA I\n          You can kiss me if you want to.\n          Tom bolts to his feet and staggers away from the couch. The\n          woman stares intently at him and says something else, but her\n          words are lost under the rising sound of static on the\n          television.\n\n          TOM\n          What?!\n          She repeats, but he can only see her lips moving, the words\n          are lost under the static. Realizing, Tom turns hurriedly\n          toward the TV and hits the mute switch. When he turns back --\n          -- the woman is gone. He stands in the middle of the room,\n          looking all around him. But he's alone.\n\n          INT BEDROOM NIGHT\n          Tom crawls back into bed and pulls the blankets up tight\n          around him. He's shivering.\n\n          A HAND\n          drops over him and he nearly jumps out of his skin. It's\n          Maggie, rolling over to embrace him in her sleep. He takes\n          her hand in his and lies still, eyes wide open.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          INT KITCHEN DAY\n          Morning. Tom and Maggie sit at the kitchen table. From the\n          living room, we can hear a-kids' morning show on the\n          television. Tom is wearing jeans and a phone company uniform\n          shirt. Maggie is staring at him. They keep their voices low.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          What do you mean, like... You mean\n          like a hallucination?\n\n          TOM\n          Maybe. I was awake, I know that.\n          She nods, thinking, no idea how to deal with this.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          23. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          MAGGIE\n          Did you, uh, get her name?\n\n          TOM\n          You know, she didn't menti. -in it.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          You sure you weren't dreami.g?\n\n          TOM\n          Positive. I had this headache like\n          you wouldn't believe, and I was\n          thirsty as hell.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          What should we do? You want to call\n          Philip?\n\n          TOM\n          Yeah, I'll call him. But I don't\n          think he's got a fuckin' clue in life.\n          From the living room, Jake laughs uproariously at something on\n          the TV.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          How about my cousin Elizabeth?\n\n          TOM\n          I don't need brain surgery, I just had\n          a weird thing happen, that's all.\n          Like a hypnosis hangover. One-time\n          deal, don't worry about it.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          Well, if anything like this happens\n          again, we should go talk to Elizabeth.\n\n          TOM\n          Maggie...\n\n          MAGGIE\n          Promise me.\n\n          TOM\n          I promise.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT HOUSE DAY\n          There's a pickup football game in the street, a half a dozen\n          sixteen and seventeen year olds timing their plays to coincide\n          with the red lights.\n          Tom gets into a pickup truck with a phone compaty logo on the\n          door, starts it up, and pulls forward to the neat house. He\n          hits the horn. While he waits, he turns and loo--s back up at\n          the front of his own house.\n\n          HE REMEMBERS\n          one of the images that blasted through his mind last night.\n          It's his own house, on a wintry day. A man in an overcoat is\n          standing on the porch, waving an arm in a friendly way --\n          \"C'mon in.\" But the image is silent, slow and eerie. We move\n          slowly toward the porch, toward the man in the overcoat.\n\n          BACK IN THE PICKUP,\n          Tom turns slowly away from his house, just as\n\n          THE FOOTBALL\n          BANGS off his windshield, nearly breaking it. TWO BODIES\n          hurtle through the air and land on his hood with a loud metal\n\n          CLANG.\n          Tom jumps a foot. He gets out of the car. ADAM McCARTHY,\n          seventeen, climbs off the hood, embarrassed.\n\n          TOM\n          Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of\n          me!\n          The kid with Adam doesn't seem embarrassed, he just reaches\n          for the football. Tom beats him to it.\n          TOM (cont' d)\n          You gotta play right here in the\n          middle of the street?\n          Frank is out of his house now, approaching the truck. He\n          wears the same uniform shirt as Tom, carries a tool belt over\n          his shoulder.\n\n          FRANK\n          Lighten up, Tommy, you sound like your\n          own grandfather .\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          25. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          TOM\n          (looking at his hood)\n          Aw man, it's dented. This ain't even\n          my truck. They're gonna dock me for\n          this.\n\n          FRANK\n          That'll pop right out. Use one of\n          them plunger things. Adam, say you're\n          sorry.\n\n          ADAM\n          I'm really sorry, Mr. Witzky.\n\n          FRANK\n          There you go, he said he's sorry,\n          whaddya want from a kid. Let's go.\n          Frank gets in the truck. The other football players walk\n          toward Tom, calling for the ball. KURT DAMON, a great-looking\n          seventeen year old, stares pointedly at the ball in Tom's\n          hand. Tom looks at him.\n\n          TOM\n          Hell of an arm ya got there.\n          Kurt smiles and shrugs. Tom tosses the ball back to him.\n          Kurt turns and catches it behind his back as he walks away.\n\n          IN THE TRUCK,\n          Tom gets back in and closes the door.\n\n          FRANK\n          That Damon kid, he's gonna break your\n          old passing records this Friday.\n\n          TOM\n          Bound to happen some time.\n\n          FRANK\n          Comin' to the game?\n\n          TOM\n          (starts the car)\n          Yeah, I'm comin', I'm comin'\n          HARRY (o.s.)\n          Hey, Tom!\n          Tom turns. Harry Damon, the guy from across the street, is\n          headed toward him. But Tom notices something behind Harry. A\n          police car has turned onto the block and is rolling to a stop.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          26. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          The UNIFORMED COP behind the wheel is staring out the window,\n          looking right at Tom.\n          Harry comes up to the open window and starts talking, but Tom\n          is looking past him, at the Cop, who has stopped now.\n          HARRY (cont' d)\n          Thought I'd stop by and pick up the\n          rent. Save you the trip across the\n          street.\n\n          TOM\n          It's still two days yet, isn't it?\n          Tom looks more closely at the Cop. He realizes the Cop isn't\n          looking at him, he's looking past him, toward Tom's house.\n\n          HARRY\n          Yeah, just thought you'd want to get\n          it out of your hair.\n\n          TOM\n\n          (DISTRACTED)\n          Well, my checkbook's inside.\n\n          HARRY\n          I can wait. Hey, Frank, some game we\n          picked to miss last night, huh? How\n          many yards Adam end up with?\n          Tom turns in his seat, following the Cop's line of vision.\n\n          FRANK\n          Two hundred eleven and two touchdowns.\n          Harry lets out a low whistle. Tom sees what the Cop is\n          looking at so intently -- it's Jake, who's playing on the\n          sidewalk in front of their house while Maggie watches. Tom\n          turns back, but as he does the police car is just pulling\n          away.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          INT SIGNAL DIVISION DAY\n          The signal division of the local phone company has a large\n          main floor. A twenty-foot wall on one side of the room shows\n          a forest of jagged, blinking lines.\n\n          IN THE TOWERS,\n          Tom is wedged between giant walls of circuit boards. He pulls\n          a red circuit clip from his belt and picks a line at random.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          27. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          He pulls up the test handset unit that hangs from'his belt and\n          listens, hoping from a dial tone. Instead, he cuts in on a\n\n          WOMAN'S VOICE.\n          VOICE (o.s.)\n          (on phone line)\n          -which was okay, I guess, but then he\n          told me he loves me, and it was just\n          like, oh my God, can you please make\n          yourself any less attractive?\n          Tom pulls off the clip and picks another line. Now it's a\n\n          SNEAKY MAN'S VOICE.\n          VOICE (o.s.)\n          -unless they find out we already\n          locked in with Cooper at eighty, so\n          it's imperative we lead them to\n          believe we're honestly trying to-,\n          Tom clips to another line.

He doesn't hesitate,\n          just takes off toward it.\n\n          TWO BLOCKS AHEAD,\n          Tom is running as hard as he can. He stops, abruptly. The\n          buzzing sound is gone. He looks to his right. Behind a wall,\n          there is a large parking lot filled with buses.\n          He turns around. A dull white glow comes from the windows of\n          the place on the corner. He looks up, at the sign.\n          It's a Greyhound bus station.\n          Tom hurries back toward it, reaching the door just as Maggie\n          comes running up from the opposite direction.\n\n          TOM\n          Wait right here, keep your eyes open!\n          He opens the door and goes inside.\n\n          INT BUS STATION NIGHT\n          Tom steps into the station, still breathing hard. The BUZZING\n          sound returns. But from where? Is it in his mind this time,\n          or really here, in the bus station?\n          The place is empty except for one person, sitting on a wooden\n          bench with their back to him, near the departure doors. Tom\n          walks slowly across the place to the figure. It's Dorothy.\n          As he draws closer, he sees Jake's face, over Dorothy's\n          shoulder. Jake's eyes are open, and he's staring up at the\n          ceiling.\n          Tom follows his son's gaze. Jake is staring up at the lights,\n          the old-style fluorescent tubes that give the place its\n          cancerous look. The tubes BUZZ loudly. It's the sound Tom's\n          been hearing.\n          Jake sees his father and smiles. Tom puts a finger to his\n          lips -- \"Shhhh.\" Jake yawns, closes his eyes, and drops his\n          head onto Dorothy's shoulder. He goes back to sleep.\n          Tom walks slowly around the end of the bench. Dorothy is\n          SINGING softly, an old nursery rhyme.\n          She looks up suddenly and sees Tom. She starts to jerk to her\n          feet. Tom puts a hand out -- take it easy. Dorothy sits\n          back, caught. Tom steps closer to her, carefully. He holds\n          both his hands out, palms up.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          40. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          TOM\n          Give him to me.\n          She shakes her head no. Outside, a SIREN WHINES and a police\n          car flashes past the window, its red lights spinning. They\n          both hear it and glance over, then look back at each other.\n          Tom raises an eyebrow. She knows what he means.\n          TOM (cont'd)\n          Give him to me, Dorothy.\n          Trembling, Dorothy reaches out, Jake in her arms. Tom gently\n          takes the boy from her and holds him tight.\n          The front door flies open and Maggie races inside. Tom gives\n          Jake over to her.\n\n          JAKE\n          (half asleep)\n          Oh, hi, Mommy.\n          She's relieved, but livid.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          (to Dorothy)\n          What the hell is the matter with you?!\n          Dorothy jumps to her feet and races through the door that\n          leads to the back, where the buses leave from.\n\n          TOM\n          (to Maggie)\n          Take him home! I'll be there as soon\n          as I can!\n          He runs after Dorothy.\n\n          EXT PARKING LOT NIGHT\n          Dorothy races out of the bus station and into the forest of\n          parked buses. Tom comes out a few seconds later, giving\n          chase.\n          Dorothy cuts between two parked buses --\n          -- and is nearly hit by a third that's just arriving. Its\n          horn BLARES as she trips and falls to the ground, the bus just\n          missing as it ROARS past her.\n          Tom reaches her. Dorothy writhes on the ground, sobbing,\n          raking her hands through the gravel, hysterical.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          TOM\n          Sit up. Sit up, I want to talk to\n          you.\n          She manages to drag herself into a sitting position. She\n          shoves back, against the wheel of a bus. Beyond them, the bus\n          that nearly hit her stops on the far side of the lot.\n          Dorothy is quivering, still crying. Tom squats in front of\n          her, a few feet away.\n          TOM (cant' d)\n          Why were you taking my son?\n\n          DOROTHY\n          Go away.\n\n          TOM\n          Do you want me to call the police?\n          (shakes her head no)\n          Then tell me why you took him.\n\n          DOROTHY\n          He isn't safe in your house.\n\n          TOM\n          Why do you say that?\n\n          DOROTHY\n          He told me!

Blood flows over Tom's knuckles as he tightens\n          his grip on the knife. He twists it around, holding it by the\n          butt.

For a long moment, they just stare at\n          each other. Steam rises lightly from her as she breathes.\n          Tom is shaking, barely finds his voice.\n\n          TOM\n          Samantha?\n          She speaks, but when her voice comes out it's horrible and\n          distorted -- muffled in a strange way.\n          He takes a few trembling steps down the stairs, closer to her.\n          She walks forward a step or two. She speaks again, louder,\n          but the voice is still unintelligible and bizarre.\n          Tom reaches the bottom of the stairs. She reaches out a hand.\n          He stares, terrified. The hand draws closer.\n          Almost beyond his own control, Tom raises his own hand.\n          She comes closer.\n          Tom is frozen at the bottom of the stairs.

His mouth drops open, his chest twitches. He can't\n          breathe.\n          They stand there, frozen in that position.

He's panicked, but unable to move. With\n          every twitch of his chest clouds of steam burst from his\n          mouth, all the air going out, none coming in.\n          From the top of the stairs, Maggie can see him, standing\n          there, hand outstretched into the darkness, touching nothing.\n          But from Tom's point of view, he's touching fingertips with\n          Samantha. He's frozen, breathless, and now his cheeks start\n          to turn pale, unnaturally white. Another few seconds of this\n          and he'll pass out.\n          MAGGIE (con t' d)\n          Tom!?\n          She races down the stairs.\n          MAGGIE (cont' d)\n\n          TOM?!\n          Tom can't look at her, can't move.

As soon as Maggie makes contact, Tom\n          collapses. He sees Samantha break away from him with a SHRIEK\n          of irritation. She moves, not quite walking, but a herky-\n          jerky kind of lateral movement toward the dining room, fast,\n          like someone on a dozen espressos, an angry thing that has to\n          slow itself down to a crawl just to talk to us.\n          In the dining room, she flops over onto the floor, like a\n          reflection appearing suddenly on the surface of a pond. Into\n          the floor, she disappears.\n          Maggie grabs Tom's face and turns it toward her.

His face is sad.\n\n          FRANK\n          They're going to kill you, Tommy.

He opens it, walks\n          outside, and sits on the top step of the porch, looking out at\n          the street.\n          Tom follows him.\n\n          EXT FRONT PORCH DAY\n          It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a m..ss\n          from the party yesterday. Tom comes out and looks down at\n          Frank, who's just sitting there, staring out at the litter.\n\n          TOM\n          Why did you say that, Frank?\n\n          FRANK\n          (in his own world)\n          This is a decent neighborhood.\n          On the street, TWO KIDS ride their bikes straight at each\n          other, full tilt, SCREAMING. At the last second, one of the\n          kids swerves, the other taunts him with cries of \"Chicken!\"\n          A bird swoops over Tom's head, too low, and Tom flinches. He\n          walks across the driveway, toward Frank's house. The MAILMAN\n          waves to him, headed down the block. Tom waves back.\n          Tom walks up the steps to Frank's front door and knocks. A\n          VOICE calls from inside.\n          ADAM (o.s.)\n          Come in!\n\n          INT FRANK'S HOUSE DAY\n          Tom opens the door and comes in. Adam, Frank's son, is\n          standing in the middle of the living room floor, a big smile\n          on his face and one arm behind his back.\n\n          ADAM\n          Hi!\n\n          TOM\n          Hi.\n\n          ADAM\n          Want to see what I've got?\n\n          TOM\n          Sure.\n          Adam pulls his arm around from behind his back.

His body convulses --\n\n          INT BEDROOM DAY\n          -- and Tom's eyes pop open, in bed. That was weird.\n          Tom blinks, exhausted. Sunlight streams through the window,\n          right into his face. He squints, looks at the clock. It's\n\n          10:26.\n\n          TOM\n          Oh, man...\n          He sits up, painfully. A beam of sunlight cuts him right\n          across the eyes.\n\n          A MINUTE LATER,\n          Tom pulls on a pair of jeans. He sits down, puts on a shoe.\n          But the other one's gone. He feels under the chair. Not\n          there.\n          He opens the closet door. Not there. Tom blinks, unsettled.\n          This is kinda familiar.\n          He turns and looks at the bed.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          72. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          TOM\n          Please don't be under there.\n          He bends down, lifts the blanket, and looks under the bed.\n          There's his shoe.\n          TOM (cont' d)\n          Shit.\n          He grabs it.\n\n          INT BATHROOM DAY\n          A note is taped to the bathroom mirror -- \"WENT TO THE PARK\n\n          WITH JAKE.

Again.\n\n          INT LIVING ROOM DAY\n          Shod, Tom comes down the stairs and into the living room.\n          Frank's not there, thank God.\n          Tom goes to the front door and opens it.\n\n          TOM\n          Uh...

Tom steps outside.\n\n          EXT FRONT PORCH DAY\n          It's a beautiful day, but the street is still kind of a mess\n          from the party yesterday. A SHOUT draws Tom's attention.\n          Those same two kids ride their bikes at each other, full tilt.\n          Tom walks down the steps of the porch, staring at them as they\n          SCREAM. At the last second, one of the kids turns away. The\n          other taunts him with cries of \"Chicken!\"\n          Tom stands frozen on the sidewalk. A bird swoops low over his\n          head; he really flinches this time. The Mailman waves to him,\n          headed down the block. Too stunned, Tom doesn't wave back.\n          He turns, panicked, and looks at Frank's house. He starts to\n          walk toward it, slowly at first, then picking up speed,\n          jogging across the driveway. He's halfway there --\n          -- when a GUNSHOT rings out from inside.\n\n          TOM\n          Oh, God...\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          73. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          He races the rest of the way, bounds up the steps to the\n          house, rips open the screen door. But the front door is\n          locked. He POUNDS on it.\n          TOM (coast' d)\n\n          ADAM?! ADAM, OPEN THE DOOR!!\n          He POUNDS harder, but there's no answer. He goes to the\n          window beside the door and peers through it.\n\n          THROUGH THE WINDOW,\n          he sees Adam lying on the floor in the middle of the living\n          room.\n\n          ON THE PORCH,\n\n          TOM\n          Oh, God, no!\n          Tom picks up a porch chair and heaves it through the window.\n\n          INT FRANK'S HOUSE DAY\n          Glass SHATTERS and sprays all over the floor. Tom knocks the\n          rest out of the frame with his elbow and climbs into the\n          house.\n          He races over to Adam's body. There is a pool of blood around\n          his chest and his body is convulsing. In his right hand, he\n          clutches a 38 with a carved white handle.\n\n          TOM\n          Oh, God, no, Jesus, no, please...\n          He grabs a blanket off a chair nearby, presses it to Adam's\n          chest, trying to stop the bleeding.\n          TOM (cont' d)\n          This is really happening.., it's\n          really happening...\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          EXT OUR BLOCK DAY\n          Tom sits on his front steps, shell shocked, red light flashing\n          off his face. An ambulance and two police cars are parked in\n          front of the house next door, radios SQUAWKING with official\n          activity.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          74. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          Tom just stares. A car comes barreling around the corner and\n          SQUEALS to a halt in front of the house. Frank and Sheila\n          leap out of the car and race toward the house.\n          Tom watches as they're intercepted-by a COP who tries to\n          restrain them for a second. But they're hysterical, they've\n          obviously been told something serious has happened and they're\n          desperate to get inside.\n          They blow past the Cop and hurry up the stairs, just as THREE\n          PARAMEDICS wheel a stretcher out of the house, headed for the\n          ambulance. The sheet isn't over Adam's head, at least, but\n          that's about the only good sign, they're working on him\n          frantically.\n          Tom buries his head in his lap as he hears the cries of Adam's\n          parents -- Frank's anguished, disbelieving BELLOW, Sheila's\n          horrified SCREAM.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT\n          CLOSE ON a torn off piece of notebook paper with an address\n          and a time scribbled on it. The word \"Cacophony\" is legible.\n          Maggie picks it up, stares at it for a moment, then hands it\n          to Tom, who is by the front door, zipping his jacket. He\n          takes it and shoves it in his pocket. He's nervous. They\n          both are. She smooths his jacket. He turns to go, but she\n          tightens her grip on his jacket. Doesn't want to let him go.\n\n          TOM\n          We need some answers, right? Maybe\n          they're the only ones who have any.\n          She nods. Thinking of something, she picks up her car keys\n          from the table by the door and pulls something off the ring.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          I'm sure they're very nice people, but\n          in case they aren't --\n          She hands a thin black cannister to him.\n          MAGGIE (coat' d)\n          Mace the shit out of `em.\n          He smiles and shoves it in his pocket.

He stops and looks up, at an old,\n          formerly grand apartment building that's fallen on hard times.\n\n          INT BUILDING - CORRIDOR NIGHT\n          The corridor is even creepier. And massive. Tom reaches a\n          door all the way at the end and knocks. A moment later, the\n          door opens. A very heavy-set woman in a floral print dress\n          (VIVIAN) smiles at him.\n\n          VIVIAN\n          I hope you like fondue!\n\n          INT VIVIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT\n          Vivian sets a plate down on a TV tray in front of Tom. There\n          is a pile of chunks of various hard-to-identify meats, a\n          silver fondue spear, and a chocolate cupcake with an American\n          flag stuck in it. Tom sits on an overstuffed couch that's\n          leaking stuffing.\n\n          VIVIAN\n          Dip away!\n\n          TOM\n          Thank you.

Beverly serves two\n          people on the far couch, one a THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, the\n          other a HOMEY in his early twenties.\n          Tom picks up a ham chunk and looks at the steaming fondue pot,\n          full of cheese. Beverly dips and eats, winks at him, and\n          flits off across the room.\n          Herman turns to Tom and asks something in a raspy voice.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          76. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          TOM\n          Excuse me?\n          Irritated, Herman gestures for him to lean closer.

Our first thoughts\n          were formless. Struggling\n          consciousness. Sensation. An\n          instinctive tie to our environment.\n          But then our brains began to focus.\n          We sacrificed the intuitions we first\n          had so our thoughts could be directed,\n          so we could master specific functions.\n          That's where we are at the moment.\n          We're brilliant with technique, but\n          we've given up instinct. So the next\n          evolutionary step, the step yet to\n          come, or perhaps it's already in the\n          making, is actually backward. To\n          maintain our higher functions, but\n          reawaken the part of our brain that\n          was pure intuition. That was\n          receptive to anything, because it\n          didn't know enough not to believe.\n          You're a freak of nature, pal, an\n          evolutionary step.

When it flickers on,\n          you get a glimpse of something, but\n          not enough of a glimpse to know what\n          it is.

She holds her ground.\n\n          MAGGIE\n\n          (QUIETLY)\n          I've known you since I'm nineteen\n          years old, you never talked to me like\n          that before. Not one time.\n          He stares at her, furious --\n          -- and then jumps in the hole and starts digging again.\n          Maggie turns and stalks across the yard and into the house.\n          Tom keeps digging for a moment, then hurls the shovel across\n          the yard.\n\n          TOM\n          InterRUPtions!\n          He picks up his tee shirt, snakes angrily into it, and marches\n          across the yard toward the house.\n          TOM (cant' d)\n          (to the Neighbors)\n          What are YOU lookin' at?\n\n          INT KITCHEN DAY\n          Maggie site at the kitchen table, reading the letter that came\n          in on the fax. Tom comes into the room behind her, pauses in\n          the doorway, composing himself. She keeps reading. He sighs,\n          heavily. She doesn't turn around.\n          He goes to the refrigerator and takes out a carton of orange\n          juice. He takes two glasses from a cupboard and sits down at\n          the table opposite her. He fills both glasses and puts one in\n          front of her. She looks up at him as he drains his. He\n          pauses, staring at her.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          91. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          TOM\n          You gonna drink that?\n          She doesn't answer.

Tom's face is pale. Maggie is\n          concerned.\n          The phone RINGS. Maggie stares at Tom. The phone RINGS\n          again. She lowers her voice, pleading.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          What is it?\n          Tom can't look at her. The phone RINGS again. Tom gets up,\n          opens the door that leads to the back yard, and goes outside.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT BACK YARD DAY\n          Tom takes a few steps out of the house, putting his hands to\n          his head in pain. Whatever it is, he knows. In the house,\n          the phone rings a fourth time. Maggie's voice drifts through\n          the open doorway as she answers i;.\n\n          MAGGIE ( - 9.)\n          Hello?\n          Tom closes his eyes.\n          MAGGIE (o.s.)\n          Steve, I was just going to-\n          She stops. There is a long silence. Tom opens his eyes. A\n          tear runs down his cheek. He wipes it away.\n          He turns and walks back toward the house, slowly. There is\n          dead silence inside. As he nears the doorway, he hears the\n          sound of the telephone being placed back in its cradle.\n          Maggie reaches the doorway at the same time Tom does. She\n          looks up at him, her eyes filled with tears. He puts his arms\n          around her and she breaks down. He holds her.\n          He holds her for a long moment.\n          MAGGIE (cont' d)\n          You knew.\n          (no answer)\n          You knew, didn't you?\n\n          TOM\n          When's the funeral?\n\n          MAGGIE\n          Sunday.

Then enraged. She pushes him\n          away from her, hard. He stumbles back into the yard.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          93. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          TOM (cont' d)\n          Hey, I just thought, maybe, you\n          know... your family might want...\n\n          MAGGIE\n          Do I WANT you to come with me:!

He waves back.\n          The car pulls out of the driveway, fast, and ROARS off down\n          the block. Jake and Maggie are gone.\n\n          EXT BACK YARD DAY\n          There are now five large holes in the back yard, and Tom is\n          running out of places to dig. Nevertheless, he drags the hose\n          across the yard to an untouched patch of grass in the far\n          corner.\n          He stops short. Hose won't reach.\n\n          AT THE SPIGOT,\n          he unscrews the hose and carries it across the yard.\n\n          AT ANOTHER SPIGOT,\n          this one in the far corner, he reconnects the hose and turns\n          on the water.

He opens the door and tosses aside a carpet flap\n          that covers the floor. He shoves the screwdriver into a crack\n          in the floor and pries up a trap door, two feet square, in the\n          middle of the closet floor.\n          Through the hole, he can see a ladder resting up against the\n          wall below. He feels for the rungs with his feet and starts\n          to climb down.\n\n          INT BASEMENT DAY\n          As Tom climbs down, he reaches out for a chain that hangs from\n          a bare bulb in the ceiling and turns it on. They have only a\n          partial basement, a ten by ten foot space about eight feet\n          deep. The rest of the area under the house is just crawl\n          space, barely enough to wriggle through.\n          Tom reaches the bottom and goes to the far side, where a mess\n          of water pipes all converge. He picks through them, finds the\n          valves that lead outside, turns one off and another one on.\n          WATER surges through the pipes, headed out to the far spigot.\n          He turns to climb back up the ladder.\n          And stops.\n          He looks down, at the floor. It's dirt.\n          He kicks at the dirt with his shoe, thinking.\n\n          A FEW MINUTES LATER,\n          the pick axe falls. Tom has brought all his tools into the\n          basement and is now digging in the middle of the basement\n          floor. The bare bulb throws his exaggerated shadow on the\n          earthen walls.\n          He works.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT OUR BLOCK DAY\n          It's quiet in the neighborhood. The CRUNCHING sound of Tom's\n          pick axe falling echoes over the block.\n\n          INT BASEMENT DAY\n          Tom digs. The hole is almost four feet across, five feet\n          deep. He's uncovered a large rock, a major chunk of stone,\n          right in the middle of where he wants to dig. He's excavated\n          all around the edges of the thing and is trying to wedge it\n          loose with a pry bar, but it won't budge.\n          Tom collapses onto the floor, leaning against the pile of mud\n          and stone he's already hauled out. He thinks.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          INT YARD SUPPLY WAREHOUSE DAY\n          Tom walks down an aisle along one wall in a huge yard supply\n          warehouse. Tools are mounted on the wall for sale -- shovels,\n          picks, post hole diggers. Got all that. Tom keeps walking.\n          The tools get bigger. Huge shovels. Tractor blades. Hand\n          pile drivers. Almost, but not quite. Tom keeps walking.\n          At the end of the row, underneath a sign that says \"FOR RENTAL\n          ONLY\" is an industrial-size jackhammer, the kind road crews\n          use to bust through whatever's in their way.\n          Tom's face lights up.\n\n          EXT STREET DAY\n          The jackhammer rides in the back of Tom's pickup truck,\n          rattling along as the truck bounces over potholes. Tom pulls\n          into his driveway, comes around, and drops the gate.\n          Using all his strength, he wrestles the jackhammer out of the\n          back of the truck. It's incredibly heavy, it takes all his\n          strength to haul it up the stairs, kick open his door, and\n          bring it into the house.\n\n          IN THE STREET,\n          Lenny, the neighborhood crank, is washing his car. He hears a\n          CRASH from over at Tom's place and turns. He sees Tom at his\n          pickup, lugging a huge air compressor out of it.\n          Tom fights his way into the house with the compressor.\n          Lenny stares at him.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          96. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          Sheila, carrying flowers and looking like didn't sleep last\n          night, comes out of her house and heads for her car. She\n          stops and stares too.\n\n          INT BASEMENT DAY\n          In Tom's basement, the compressor descends through the trap\n          door above, seemingly of its own accord -- than we see it's at\n          the end of a rope and Tom is up in the trap door space,\n          sweating and straining, lowering the thing down.\n          It settles on the floor next to the jackhammer.\n\n          A BIT LATER,\n          Tom reaches up to the hanging light bulb, which also has an\n          electrical outlet in its fixture, and plugs in a yellow safety\n          cord.\n          He flicks a switch on the compressor and it RATTLES to life.\n          He follows a hose over to where it plugs into the side of the\n          jackhammer, which now quivers with unleashed power.\n          Tom picks up the jackhammer. He hauls it over to the rock\n          that's been in his way. He positions the jackhammer's spike\n          on the top of the rock. He lowers a pair of goggles over his\n          eyes. He swings his weight up, onto the jackhammer, and\n          squeezes the handles.\n          The jackhammer ROARS to life. It's deafening. Tom's whole\n          body quivers. It's like riding a bull, but the rock begins to\n          split in half.\n          Tom WHOOPS with joy, barely heard over the din that echoes in\n          his basement.\n\n          EXT STREET DUSK\n          As the sun goes down, the sound of the ROARING jackhammer is\n          plainly audible on the block. The familiar Homeless Guy stops\n          and SHOUTS something at Tom's house.\n          Across the street, Kurt Damon comes out his front door and\n          stares at Tom's house. What the hell is that guy up to?\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          INT UNCLE STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT\n          A group of PEOPLE IN DARK CLOTHES mill around a living room,\n          muttering in the soft tones of those at a wake.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          97. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          There's a lot of big Irish guys drinking beer, guts stuffed\n          into sweat-stained white shirts. Maggie excuses herself from\n          the group and steps into another room.\n\n          INT STEVE'S BEDROOM NIGHT\n          The door is ajar, people visible through it as Maggie dials a\n          nu-rber on a bedside telephone. The phone rings on the other\n          enc. And rings. And rings.

He's standing in the dining room,\n          which is now so mud-spattered it looks like the inside of a\n          cave. The table has been shoved against the wall, legs\n          sticking out into the room. One corner is filled with a pile\n          of broken-up chunks of rock. Tom strides across the room in\n          two steps, lowers himself, and drops his legs through the open\n          trap door.\n\n          INT BASEMENT NIGHT\n          Tom sails down into the basement and lands nimbly on the\n          floor. Doesn't even use the ladder anymore.\n          The rock is gone, broken apart by the jackhammer, and the hole\n          is now eight feet long and as many wide, and about four feet\n          deep. Tom leaps down into it and goes back to work.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          INT STEVE'S HOUSE NIGHT\n          In the front hall of the house, Maggie is putting on her coat.\n          Jake sits on the steps, his coat on the carpet next to him.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          Jake, come on, we have to go.\n\n          JAKE\n          I'm staying here.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          100. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          MAGGIE\n          What?\n\n          JAKE\n          I want to stay at Uncle Steve's, I\n          don't want to go home.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          Why not?\n\n          JAKE\n          Because I'm not safe there. Because\n          of the feathers.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          What does that mean, Jake?\n          He shrugs. Philip, Maggie's brother, stands in the doorway to\n          the other room.\n\n          PHILIP\n          It's okay, I can watch him.\n          Maggie, in a hurry, agrees. She bends over and kisses Jake on\n          the forehead.\n\n          MAGGIE\n          Be good.\n          She opens the door and heads out.

She\n           misses a step, thinking about it, then starts walking to her\n          car.\n          She walks faster.\n          Then she runs.\n\n           CUT TO:\n\n          INT BASEMENT NIGHT\n          In the basement, Tom abruptly stops digging, staring at the\n          dirt. The corner of something shiny is sticking out from the\n          pile. He bends down and pulls it out.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          101. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          It's a piece of clear blue plastic sheeting, about two inches\n          square. Tom's hand starts to shake as he holds it.\n\n          AN IMAGE\n          flas.es through his mind again, the one he's seen twice\n          befoi-. A FACE, too close to his, sting at him through that\n          blurr blue, like through bad eyeglasses.\n\n          IN THE BASEMENT,\n          Tom turns and leaps into the hole, shovel in hand. He begins\n          to dig, wildly, flinging dirt in all directions. At one end\n          of the hole, his shovel slips, the dirt spilling off it as it\n          sticks on something. Something buried.\n          Tom drops the shovel. He falls to his knees and uses his\n          hands to rake the dirt away from whatever it was.\n          More blue plastic.\n          Tom tugs out about eight inches of the plastic, gets a good\n          grip on it with both hands. He pulls it up.\n          Like a rope pulled out of the sand, the edge of the blue\n          plastic rises up, unearthing itself in a line down the middle\n          of the pit.\n          Breathing hard, Tom grabs the shovel again.\n\n          THE DIRT,\n          flies away from the plastic as Tom works furiously.\n\n          TOM'S FACE\n          is of a man possessed. He digs as fast as he can.\n\n          FINALLY,\n          Tom stands back, staring down at what he has unearthed.\n          Above him, we see what it is. A long piece of blue plastic,\n          wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and\n          two and a half feet wide.\n          Tom bends down and lays one hand on the plastic. He flinches.\n\n          AN IMAGE\n          pops into his mind, another familiar one. A FIGURE IN Afl\n          OVERCOAT, standing on the front porch of Tom's own house in\n          winter, waving to us to come up.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          102. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          IN THE BASEMENT,\n          Tom jerks his hand off the plastic. He swallows.\n          He goes to hi= toolbox and pulls out a utility knife. He\n          slides the ra or blade forward.\n          He goes to one and of the plastic, bends down, and jams the\n          knife through the sheeting. He walks the length of it, making\n          a slit down the middle. He reaches out with shaking hands and\n          pulls part of the plastic back.\n          The first thing he sees is a partially decomposed human hand.\n          Around the withered wrist, there are a half dozen multi-\n          colored bracelets.\n          Tom yanks the rest of the plastic away, revealing the half-\n          decomposed body of Samantha Muller, still in the black dress\n          with the diamond pattern. Tom stands there, his chest\n          heaving.\n          He looks at her hand, thinking.\n          He sits down next to her.\n          He reaches out for her hand, then pulls his own back.\n          Can't do it.\n          But he's gotta. He opens his hand, reaching out for hers. He\n          slides his hand underneath --\n          takes a deep breath --\n          -- and closes his living fingers around her skeletal ones.\n          He GASPS.\n          His face turns a horrible shade of pale, his lips go ice blue,\n          and STEAM comes out of his mouth, the way it did hers when he\n          first saw her in his living room.\n\n          EXT TOM'S HOUSE DAY\n          It's a wintry day. That same steam rises up in front of us,\n          coming from our own mouth. We're looking at the front porch\n          of Tom's house as we walk past it. The house is being\n          remodeled, it's surrounded by scaffolding, its windows covered\n          with plastic Duvateen.\n          The Figure in the Overcoat waves to us.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          103. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          FIGURE\n          Hi!\n\n          SAMANTHA\n          (off screen, we're in her point\n          of vie sr)\n          Hi.\n\n          FIGURE\n          C'mare a sec!\n\n          SAMANTHA\n          What?\n\n          FIGURE\n          I want to show you something!\n          We look back, over our shoulder, then back at the Figure.

This close now, we see the Figure is Kurt Damon.\n\n          SAMANTHA\n          You want to show me something?\n          Her manner of speech is childish, like a grade-schooler's.\n\n          KURT\n\n          (CHARMING)\n          Well, of course! I don't see anybody\n          else around!\n          We start up the steps of the porch.

The windows are covered\n           with tinted plastic, casting an eerie blue light through the\n          place.\n          Adam McCarthy is in the living - loom too, drinking from a\n           bottle of schnapps. He's drunk, slurring. He sees us.\n\n          ADAM\n          Happy St. Patrick's Day.\n\n          SAMANTHA\n          What's the surprise?\n\n          ADAM\n          Uh... don't you have it?\n          He giggles.\n\n          KURT\n          Oh yeah, the surprise.\n\n          ADAM\n          The surprise.\n          They laugh and look at each other.

Half of it runs\n          down Adam's chin.\n\n          SAMANTHA\n          I don't think there is a surprise.\n          We turn and start for the door. Kurt hurries around,\n          intercepts us.\n\n          KURT\n          Yeah there is, yeah there is.\n          He puts his arm around us, leads us back into the room.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          105. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          KURT (cont' d)\n          The surprise is... we decided we want\n          to be your friends.\n\n          SAMANTHA\n          You do?\n\n          ADAM\n          Oh, yeah, so bad.\n          He laughs.\n\n          SAMANTHA\n          Why do you want to be my friend?\n\n          KURT\n          Are you kidding? Look at yourself!\n          Kurt turns Samantha toward an old mirror that hangs over the\n          fireplace. She's good-looking, if she knew it. Terribly\n          insecure, doesn't even like looking at herself. We turn away,\n          embarrassed.\n          KURT (coast' d)\n          Ah ah ah, look!\n          He makes us look in the mirror again.\n          KURT (cont' d)\n          Mama, you are hot.\n          He turns her toward him, looks at her, closely.\n          KURT (coast' d)\n\n          (SOFT)\n          Come on, let's be friends.\n\n          SAMANTHA\n          Well.., you can kiss me if you want\n          to.\n          Kurt leans in close, kisses us. After a moment, we force our\n          head away, looking down. Kurt's hand is on Samantha's breast.\n          We push him back.\n          SAMANTHA (cont'd)\n          Not like that!\n          But Kurt pulls us closer, roughly. We struggle.\n\n          KURT\n          Come on, Samantha, I'll be your\n          friend, I swear I will.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           106. \n\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n           KURT (cont' d)\n          Just be nice to me.

He gets his powerful hanis on our\n          shoulders and starts to push us down.\n\n          KURT\n          Come on, baby, how `bout a little\n          helmet wash?\n          His belt buckle comes into our view, and his hands on it. We\n          tear away, get up and run for the door.\n          From behind, something hits us very hard. The floorboards\n          race up at us, all of a sudden. We land on them, hard, bounce\n          off, our own blood spraying out on the unfinished wood.\n          Our head lands sideways on the floor. We see Adam McCarthy,\n          vomiting in the corner.\n          Abruptly, we're rolled over and are staring at the ceiling.\n          Kurt Damon is on top of us, his face too close. Her hands\n          rise up, try to push him off, but he's stronger.\n          Samantha starts to SCREAM. Hands close over our face. She\n          bites, and the hands are pulled away. She SCREAMS again.\n          KURT (cont' d)\n\n          SHUT UP! SHUT UP!\n          Kurt holds her down, begins to try to undress her. She\n          writhes and SCREAMS. She gets one hand into Kurt's hair and\n          pulls as hard as she can. He SHOUTS in pain.\n          In the corner, Adam McCarthy has his hands over his ears.\n\n          ADAM\n\n          MAKE HER STOP! MAKE HER STOP\n\n          SCREAMIN', MAN, MAKE HER STOP!\n          But she keeps screaming. Adam staggers to a boom box that's\n          sitting on the fireplace mantle and flicks a switch. A SONG\n          comes on, loud. It's a haunting tune, we recognize it.\n          St's the song Jake has been humming.\n          Kurt continues his fumbling, drunken attempts at rape, tearing\n          her hand out of his hair.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           107. \n\n          CONTINUED: (3)\n\n          KURT\n\n          SHUT HER UP! USE YOUR JACKET OR\n\n          SOMETHING'\n          Adam lunges to the wall and tears down a sheet of the blts\n          plastic Duvateen. He races over to us with the sheet --\n          -- and everything turns blue. Now our sights and sounds aye\n          muffled and distorted through the blue plastic. We see the\n          image that has haunted Tom, the face of Kurt Damon, a blue\n          demon as he grapples on top of us.\n\n          IN TOM'S BASEMENT,\n          Tom is sprawled out beside the corpse, their hands locked\n          together. His color is cadaverous. He's suffocating. He\n          thrashes.\n\n          IN THE HOUSE,\n          back in Samantha's point of view, we struggle, we thrash, it\n          seems to go on forever. Slowly, the sounds become fainter and\n          fainter and fainter...\n          and everything stops. We hear the muffled voices of Kurt\n          and Adam SCREAMING at each other.\n          The sheet is ripped off. We stare up at them as Kurt and Adam\n          stand above us, chests heaving, revolted looks on their faces,\n          looking at us like we're a dog they just killed with their\n          car.\n\n          ADAM\n          Oh, my God.\n\n          KURT\n          What the fuck did you do that for?\n\n          ADAM\n          Is she dead?\n\n          KURT\n          No shit she's dead.\n\n          ADAM\n          Oh, my God.\n\n          KURT\n          Look at her tongue, man.\n\n          ADAM\n          I'm not here.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          108. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          KURT\n          I never saw nobody dead before.\n          We start to fall back, and down, as if sinking into the floor.\n          Kurt and Adam grow taller, further away. Their voices fade.\n\n          ADAM\n          I wish I wasn't here.\n\n          KURT\n          It's fuckin' gross.\n\n          ADAM\n          This isn't happening.\n\n          KURT\n          Fuckin' plastic over her face. Good\n          thinkin', Adam.\n\n          ADAM\n          What do we do now?\n          Kurt and Adam are very far away, blobs of light at the end of\n          a black tunnel that's closing in around us. Just before\n          everything goes completely black --\n\n          INT BASEMENT NIGHT\n          Tom's fingers twitch open and his hand pulls free of\n          Samantha's. He opens his eyes and gulps air. The color\n          returns to his face as he pulls his hand away from hers.\n          But as he does so, he stops, staring intently at something in\n          her fingers. We don't see what it is.\n          Tom draws himself to his feet and climbs the ladder that leads\n          upstairs.\n          As he goes, we pause, looking between two rungs near the top\n          of the ladder. In the darkened crawl space under the rest of\n          the house --\n          -- a pair of eyes stare at us.\n          It's Kurt Damon. He twists around quickly and scoots back out\n          under the house, the way he came in.\n\n          EXT TOM'S HOUSE NIGHT\n          Under the front porch, a wood frame access panel lies on the\n          grass next to the foundation of Tom's house, where it has been\n          removed. Kurt Damon wriggles out from under the house and\n          comes onto the grass.\n\n          (CONTINUED)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          109. \n\n          CONTINUED:\n          But the sound of the front door of Tom's house opening sends\n          him scurrying back into the shadows. TOM'S FEET come down the\n          steps and head off across the driveway.\n          A moment later, Kurt darts out from'his hiding place and\n          hurries across the street, toward his own house.\n          \"om, nearing the front steps of Frank's house next door,\n          thought he heard something. He turns back, but Kurt is gone.\n          Tom climbs the steps to Frank's house. Bouquets of flowers\n          have been left here and there on the steps, along with a few\n          candles and handwritten signs -- \"Hang in there, Adam,\" \"We\n          Love You,\" that sort of thing.\n\n          ON FRANK'S FRONT PORCH,\n          Tom knocks on the front door. A moment later, Frank opens it.\n          He looks devastated, shell-shocked, his eyes sunken from\n          crying. He's wearing a red shirt we've seen before.\n\n          TOM\n          How's he doin'?\n          Frank shrugs. Can't talk much.\n\n          FRANK\n          He might make it.

Gently,\n          he reaches out with one hand and puts his fingertips on the\n          baby's forehead, the same way he did to Tom's forehead that\n          first night.\n          The baby and Jake stare at each other for a long moment. So\n          long, in fact, that the adults become uncomfortable.\n\n          NURSE\n          Well, they... certainly get along,\n          don't they?\n          Suddenly, Jake breaks into a wide grin and looks up at his\n          parents, thrilled. Then he looks back at his sister. He\n          leans down and whispers softly in her ear.\n\n          JAKE\n          Don't be afraid of s t.\n          Tom and Maggie look at each other.\n\n\n          FADE OUT          \n \n\n\n\n\n\nStir of Echoes\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David Koepp\u00a0\u00a0Richard Matheson\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Thriller\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:31.887310"}
