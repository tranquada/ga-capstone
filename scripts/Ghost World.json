Eventually we find ourselves \n               moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings. Many \n               of the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT. \n               As we track past at window-level we see:\n\n               A glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER \n               runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays..\n\n               An empty room...\n\n               A large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts, \n               watching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed \n               potatoes with his fingers...\n\n               A dazed old woman staring out the window.\n\n               The silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself.\n\n               We enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the \n               THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production \n               number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of \n               clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted \n               back as she dances along to the video while trying on a \n               GRADUATION CAP AND GOWN.\n\n               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION - AFTERNOON NEXT DAY.\n\n               A modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner \n               with a \"Coca Cola\" logo reads: \"GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM.\"\n\n               INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SAME DAY\n\n               A graduation ceremony is in progress. We DOLLY PAST the bland \n               faces of teary-eyed graduates until we stop on ENID. At first, \n               we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her \n               head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh.\n\n               She makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is \n               also trying to stifle her laughter. The SPEAKER is in an \n               elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction devices.\n\n                                     SPEAKER\n                         High school is like the training \n                         wheels for the bicycle of real life.  \n                         It is a time for young people to \n                         explore different fields of interest \n                         and to hopefully grow from their \n                         experiences.  After all, that which \n                         we learn from our mistakes can be as \n                         valuable as what we learn from our \n                         textbooks, and often we can turn the \n                         negative experiences that are common \n                         to all high-schoolers into positive \n                         steps toward personal growth and \n                         achievement. In coming to terms with \n                         my own personal setback, which I'm \n                         sure you've all heard about, I've \n                         been able to learn a lot about myself. \n                         I've learned for one thing that I \n                         don't need to rely on drugs and \n                         alcohol\n                              (APPLAUSE)\n                         and that I'm very lucky-that more \n                         people besides Carrie and myself \n                         weren't hurt in the accident; I've \n                         learned that I'm blessed with \n                         wonderful parents, teachers and above \n                         all the best classmates in the world -- \n                         I love each and every one of you \n                         guys!!\n                              (APPLAUSE)\n                         and I've learned that to get through \n                         life's obstacles you need faith, \n                         hope and, most of all, a sense of \n                         humor.\n                              (BIG APPLAUSE)\n\n               A trio of TEENAGE GIRLS (one white, one Asian, one black) \n               come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping. \n               The audience loves them.\n\n                                     EBONY\n                         No more eduCATION...\n\n                                     VANILLA\n                         It's time for celeBRATION...\n\n                                     JADE\n                         'cause this is the day of our high \n                         school GraduATION...\n\n                                     EBONY\n                         We've stayed for the durATION...\n\n                                     VANILLA\n                         Achieved matricuLATION...\n\n                                     JADE\n                         Now we're the newest members of the \n                         general popuLATION...\n\n               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The auditorium door opens and GRADUATES emerge. Enid & Rebecca \n               run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up \n               diplomas. They run toward the school playground, nearly \n               bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release.\n\n               Enid stops and looks back at the school.

Enid and Rebecca \n               hunch down in their seats.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         It's obviously him!\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                         I can't believe it!\n\n               Seymour sits down and looks around. Weird Al brings a menu.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE ON: WEIRD AL bringing his milkshake.

His date is 30 MINUTES LATE. Seymour gets \n               up and walks sadly towards the cashier (Weird Al).\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                         Do you think he knows?\n\n                                     ENID\n                         I dunno...\n\n               They watch him leave. Enid goes up to pay the bill while \n               Josh and Rebecca go outside.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         Hey Weird Al, did that guy say \n                         anything to you before he left?\n\n                                     AL\n                         Not a thing.\n\n               Enid goes back to the table to leave a tip, two dollars. Al \n               passes behind her.\n\n                                     AL\n                              (cheerfully \n                              professional despite \n                              her abuse)\n                         Thank you and come again.\n\n               Enid hesitates, overcome with guilt. She glances back at Al, \n               then digs every penny out of her pocket (about seven dollars \n               in coins and wadded up bills) and adds it to his tip.\n\n               EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY\n\n               The trio drive in silence. Suddenly, an extra-wide pick-up \n               vrooms past Josh, cutting off the driver (SEYMOUR) next to \n               him. SEYMOUR bobs violently as he screams silent obscenities.\n\n                                     JOSH\n                         Jesus, look at this guy.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         Oh my God, that's HIM!\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                         Are you sure?\n\n                                     ENID\n                         Totally! Look!\n\n               ANGLE ON: SEYMOUR really having a fit now. Once it's out of \n               his system, he reverts to an amiable poker-face.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         He's insane!\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                         We should follow him home.\n\n                                     JOSH\n                         Forget it.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         Come on, Josh... don't you want to \n                         see where he lives?\n\n                                     JOSH\n                         No.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         But this guy is like a one-of-kind, \n                         rare butterfly, and we have to follow \n                         him back to his natural habitat...\n\n                                     JOSH\n                         You need counseling.\n\n               EXT.

EXPERIMENTAL FILM - DAY\n\n               FULL SCREEN: grainy B&W video footage. The CAMERA travels up \n               a shadowy flight of stairs. We hear FOOTSTEPS, a rhythmic \n               POUNDING, and a deranged CHILDREN'S CHOIR (\"LALALALALALA\").\n\n                                     WOMAN'S VOICE\n                              (cheap echo effect)\n                         Returning to the house of my \n                         Fatherfatherfatherfather...\n\n               The CAMERA reaches the top of the stairs, we see a door that \n               slowly CREAKS open. We move into the room beyond, it's \n               decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix. We \n               HEAR a televangelist's sermon. We MOVE CLOSE on a little \n               girl's doll. Very slowly a MAN'S HAND reaches for the doll \n               and drags it into the shadows. The hand throws the now \n               mutilated doll into a toilet; water and blood swirl around.\n\n               We see grainy footage (shot off of TV) of Christians angrily \n               picketing an abortion clinic. CREDITS come up: THE END.  A \n               FILM BY ROBERTA ALLSWORTH.\n\n               INT.

The teacher, ROBERTA ALLSWORTH, addresses the class.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         That piece is entitled \n                         \"Mirror/Father/Mirror.\" I like to \n                         show it to people I'm meeting for \n                         the first time because it says so \n                         much about who I am and what it feels \n                         like to inhabit my specific skin.  \n                         And this is exactly what I'm hoping \n                         to get from each of you over the \n                         course of this Summer: a picture of \n                         your own self-exploration. My own \n                         background is in video and performance \n                         art, but I'm hoping that doesn't \n                         influence you and that you'll find \n                         your own ways of externalizing the \n                         internal. At the end of the Summer, \n                         this class has been invited, along \n                         with several others in the area, to \n                         participate in a show of High-School \n                         art at the Neighborhood Activity \n                         Center.

ENID'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - EVENING\n\n               Enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom.  \n               She rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box \n               (black hair dye). She wets her hair, then goes into the \n               bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box. The punk \n               rock song we heard earlier plays. She yanks out the tape and \n               flings it away. She skims through her records and CDs, \n               dismissing them all. She notices Seymour's bag in the corner.\n\n               She takes out the record and puts it on. The first tune is \n               an upbeat instrumental number. She returns to the bathroom.\n\n               Several minutes pass. TRACK TWO begins on the LP. She (and \n               we) slowly begin to take notice. It's a strange, haunting \n               old BLUES RECORD. We see that the tune has struck a nerve.\n\n               INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n               The song continues. Enid sits in her bean-bag chair. Her \n               hair is now dyed back to black. As the song ends, she picks \n               up the needle and starts it again.\n\n               INT.

COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING\n\n               A homemade banner reads: \"HIGH SCHOOL ART SHOW - BROTHERHOOD \n               AND COMMUNITY: ART AS DIALOGUE.\" Along one wall is all the \n               work from Roberta's class: a collection of eccentric abstract \n               bric-a-brac and Enid's large painting. The painting has drawn \n               a small crowd. We see a chain of events beginning with three \n               PARENTS talking to a matronly DIRECTOR/CURATOR who in turn \n               seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for \n               the first time).\n\n                                     DIRECTOR\n                         I'm afraid you're simply going to \n                         have to take that painting down.  \n                         Several of the parents have \n                         complained.\n\n                                     ROBERTA\n                         I will do no such thing.\n\n                                     DIRECTOR\n                         Then you leave me no other choice \n                         than to remove it myself!\n\n               She marches towards it.

A \n               college-age news-hack-type with a FREE WEEKLY T-SHIRT snaps \n               a photo of the DIRECTOR removing Enid's painting.\n\n               EXT. SEYMOUR'S APT.

Seymour is \n               wearing designer stone-washed denim jeans that look ridiculous \n               on him.

A door opens and a Tony Robbins-\n               ish, 35 year-old MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE sticks his head out.\n\n                                     EXECUTIVE\n                         Seymour!

ENID'S ROOM - LATE EVENING\n\n               Enid is sorting her stuff into boxes. Digging through her \n               closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize. Inside \n               are her old children's records (45's). She excitedly takes \n               one out and plays it. She folds her clothes while listening \n               to this song, which clearly is getting to her. She grabs \n               mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. It's \n               the uniform from her job at \"Computer Station.\" She folds \n               it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange \n               fabric.\n\n               INT. ENID AND REBECCA'S APT. - THE NEXT DAY\n\n               Rebecca is nervously arranging and re-arranging her stuff.\n\n               She puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the \n               time to 12:45. She goes to the phone and calls Enid. The \n               machine picks up and Rebecca hangs up. She does another \n               tedious, pointless task. IT'S NOW 3:30. She's pissed off and \n               goes to the phone to call again. As it rings there's a knock \n               on the door. Relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                              (as she opens the \n                              door)\n                         What's wrong with you, retard - it's \n                         three-thirty!\n\n               It's Seymour standing there, not Enid.\n\n                                     SEYMOUR\n                         Uh... hi.

Read it and weep.\n\n               We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR \n               in Wowsville.

SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON\n\n               Seymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into \n               the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.\n\n               INT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON\n\n               Josh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine, \n               with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in. Doug is \n               over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine.\n\n                                     SEYMOUR\n                         I hope you had a good laugh at my \n                         expense.\n\n               Josh turns around - what's going on?

Then he tries to flip over a BIG DISPLAY CASE in front \n               of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying \n               and gets more and more frustrated.\n\n                                     JOSH\n                         HEY!\n\n               Josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he \n               creates a huge mess. He tries to grab Seymour and they get \n               into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. Seymour starts yelling.  \n               Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with \n               his nunchucks. Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. Josh is freaked \n               out. Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry.\n\n               The Boss comes out of the back room...\n\n                                     BOSS\n                         Josh!

Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, \n               exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud \n               radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she \n               checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one \n               last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP \n               of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up.\n\n               She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a \n               cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over \n               her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.\n\n                                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n                            TITLE CARD: \"SEVERAL MONTHS LATER\"\n\n               INT.

Re gets up and she walks him \n               slowly toward the door.\n\n                                     SEYMOUR\n                         Thank you, doctor.\n\n                                     THERAPIST\n                              (as she opens the \n                              door)\n                         Don't thank me. You're doing all the \n                         work.\n\n               A pause. They stand facing each other.\n\n                                     THERAPIST\n                         Seymour?\n\n                                     SEYMOUR\n                         Yes?\n\n                                     THERAPIST\n                         Do you have a check for me?\n\n               Seymour takes a filled-out check from his shirt pocket. In \n               the waiting room, we see SEYMOUR'S MOTHER.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Seymour? Are you done? Did you have \n                         a chance to think about what you \n                         might want for dinner while you were \n                         in there?\n\n                                     SEYMOUR\n                         We can talk about it in the car, \n                         Ma...\n\n               As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the \n               doctor.\n\n               INT. QUALITY CAFE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles Wowsville \n               more than the old Quality Cafe. There are no neighborhood \n               \"characters\" anymore, only well-heeled twenty-somethings. We \n               see that Rebecca is now a waitress here. She tears off a \n               check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted \n               EUROPEAN HIPSTER, who is too busy tapping away at his \n               POWERBOOK to notice.\n\n               She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her \n               receipts. She looks up and sees Enid, wearing tasteful 1930's \n               style clothes, sitting across from her.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         Hi.\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                         Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize \n                         you -- I think I need to get glasses; \n                         you're all blurry!\n\n                                     ENID\n                              (nodding toward \n                              muscular HIPSTER)\n                         You're lucky then, you can't see the \n                         veins on that guy's biceps.\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                         Actually, he's a really nice guy.\n\n               We see at this point that Rebecca & Enid are no longer \n               friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident.\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                         Do you want anything?\n\n                                     ENID\n                         Maybe an orange juice.\n\n               Rebecca goes to get it. Enid looks around, bemused and \n               saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         Hey, look what I got...\n\n               She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out \n               her DIPLOMA.\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                         Wow... finally.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         It just came yesterday...\n\n               Pause. Josh enters. Enid turns around.\n\n                                     JOSH\n                         Hi Enid.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         Hey Josh.\n\n                                     JOSH\n                         Are you ready to go?\n\n               For a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then:\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                              (still counting \n                              receipts)\n                         Yeah, just one second...\n\n               She finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind \n               the counter. She kisses Josh perfunctorily.\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                              (to Josh)\n                         Did you remember to pay the phone \n                         bill?\n\n                                     JOSH\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     REBECCA\n                              (to Enid)\n                         Call me sometime.\n\n                                     ENID\n                         Definitely. We still have to go to \n                         that shoe store sometime.\n\n               Rebecca & Josh leave. Enid is totally alone in the now-alien \n               world of the Quality Cafe. A momentary pause as she calmly \n               stares into her orange juice. We see a small, round TRAVEL \n               BAG at her feet.\n\n               EXT. CITY STREETS/ACME SHOES - EVENING\n\n               We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.\n\n               It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.\n\n               She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It \n               looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands \n               right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered \n               over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures: \n               a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a \n               FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: \"Coming \n               Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.\n\n               EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING\n\n               She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm \n               stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by \n               her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She \n               stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect \n               for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the \n               glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.\n\n               She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she \n               has the street all to herself.\n\n               EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - NIGHT\n\n               We see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She \n               looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman \n               who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing \n               her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing \n               happens in another window down the street... then another...  \n               Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the \n               corner and heads toward her.\n\n               From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus \n               as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment \n               later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves \n               upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the \n               credits roll.\n\n               EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING\n\n               The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost World\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Daniel Clowes\u00a0\u00a0Terry Zwigoff\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:56.042253"}
