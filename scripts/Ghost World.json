Eventually we find ourselves \n               moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings.

The source of the \n               THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production \n               number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of \n               clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks.

After all, that which \n                         we learn from our mistakes can be as \n                         valuable as what we learn from our \n                         textbooks, and often we can turn the \n                         negative experiences that are common \n                         to all high-schoolers into positive \n                         steps toward personal growth and \n                         achievement.

ENID &amp; REBECCA'S APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHT\n</b>\n               The apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying \n               streetlight. Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, \n               exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud \n               radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she \n               checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one \n               last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP \n               of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up.\n\n               She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a \n               cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over \n               her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.\n\n<b>                                                              FADE TO BLACK\n</b>\n<b>                            TITLE CARD: \"SEVERAL MONTHS LATER\"\n</b>\n<b>               INT.

She nods toward the large wall clock behind \n               her: thirty seconds after five. Re gets up and she walks him \n               slowly toward the door.\n\n<b>                                     SEYMOUR\n</b>                         Thank you, doctor.\n\n<b>                                     THERAPIST\n</b>                              (as she opens the \n                              door)\n                         Don't thank me.

QUALITY CAFE - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               The Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles Wowsville \n               more than the old Quality Cafe. There are no neighborhood \n               \"characters\" anymore, only well-heeled twenty-somethings. We \n               see that Rebecca is now a waitress here. She tears off a \n               check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted \n               EUROPEAN HIPSTER, who is too busy tapping away at his \n               POWERBOOK to notice.\n\n               She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her \n               receipts. She looks up and sees Enid, wearing tasteful 1930's \n               style clothes, sitting across from her.\n\n<b>                                     ENID\n</b>                         Hi.\n\n<b>                                     REBECCA\n</b>                         Oh, hi...

Enid looks around, bemused and \n               saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become.\n\n<b>                                     ENID\n</b>                         Hey, look what I got...\n\n               She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out \n               her DIPLOMA.\n\n<b>                                     REBECCA\n</b>                         Wow... finally.\n\n<b>                                     ENID\n</b>                         It just came yesterday...\n\n               Pause.

We still have to go to \n                         that shoe store sometime.\n\n               Rebecca &amp; Josh leave. Enid is totally alone in the now-alien \n               world of the Quality Cafe. A momentary pause as she calmly \n               stares into her orange juice. We see a small, round TRAVEL \n               BAG at her feet.\n\n<b>               EXT. CITY STREETS/ACME SHOES - EVENING\n</b>\n               We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.\n\n               It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.\n\n               She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It \n               looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands \n               right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered \n               over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures: \n               a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a \n               FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: \"Coming \n               Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.\n\n<b>               EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING\n</b>\n               She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm \n               stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by \n               her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She \n               stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect \n               for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the \n               glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.\n\n               She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she \n               has the street all to herself.\n\n<b>               EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - NIGHT\n</b>\n               We see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She \n               looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman \n               who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing \n               her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing \n               happens in another window down the street... then another...  \n               Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the \n               corner and heads toward her.\n\n               From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus \n               as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment \n               later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves \n               upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the \n               credits roll.\n\n<b>               EXT.
