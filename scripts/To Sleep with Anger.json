ROOM - DAY  (EFX)\n</b>\nGIDEON, a strongly built elderly black man, is sitting at a\ntable. On the table is a large bowl of fruit. A crocheted\ntablecloth hangs over the side of the table. Gideon is\ndressed in a white suit and wearing a pair of well-polished\nwing-tip shoes. His hat almost covers his eyes, which are two\npoints of greenish coals. The fruit in the bowl is engulfed\nin flames.\n\nThe flames look as if they are DRIPPING from the tablecloth\nto the floor. Gideon's shoes start to SMOULDER. His shoes\nBURST INTO FLAMES which spread up his pants leg. His head\nfalls forward as if he had suddenly fallen to sleep. He\ntwiddles his thumbs very slowly in a circle. He crosses his\nlegs as if to get comfortable.\n\nThe camera moves to a CLOSE UP of his burning shoes. The\nimage of his feet begins to appear through his shoes; the\nflames fade; the background changes as we\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT. GIDEON'S BACKYARD - DAY\n</b>\nGideon's bare feet are resting on reddish dry earth. Gideon\nis sitting in his backyard under a fruit tree with a Bible\nresting in his hands.\n\nHis house is a small, neatly painted bungalow in South\nCentral Los Angeles. Corn, tomatoes, other vegetables grow in\nthe yard. Chickens scratch around.\n\nHe slowly awakens; his hands are trembling. He looks around\nand sees the chickens. He looks up at the sky and sighs, with\nsome relief.\n\nSUNNY, Gideon's grandson, five years old, has been watching\nhim from the back window of the house. He leaves the window.\n\n<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\n<b>DOLLY SHOT OF SUNNY\n</b>\nSunny peeps in the workroom. Through the crack in the door, a\nWoman waves to Sunny. \n\n<b>INT. WORKROOM - DAY\n</b>\nThe room is nearly filled with pregnant women and their\nhusbands. SUZIE, Gideon's wife, late 60's or early 70's, a\npicture of health, is giving a last bit of instruction before\nthe class ends. Some of the people are already preparing to\nleave.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tRemember, especially you men, that\n\tworking together now will already\n\thave formed a bond before the child\n\tarrives. The woman is very\n\tsensitive.\n\nSomewhere in the room a Male Voice booms out.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.) \n</b>\tTell me about it.\n\nThere is a bit of LAUGHTER as all start putting away their\nthings.\n\n<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY\n</b>\nGideon looks over at the chickens, scratching around in the\ngarden. He calls to them, but they don't respond. He puts his\nshoes on and walks towards the back door of the house.\nEntering the house, he stops and waits inside the door\npeeping out. In a sort of devilish manner he talks to\nhimself.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tSpoiling the little foxes that\n\tspoil my vines.\n\n<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY \n</b>\nShot of the backyard. Nothing. Suddenly, with the grace and\nsuspicion of alley cats, kids jump over Gideon's back fence,\nlook around timidly, and start climbing up his fruit tree.\n\nGideon walks down the steps slowly while humming in a deep\nvoice. He turns the water on and walks over to the tree,\ntrapping the kids. Dangling legs, hanging from the tree, try\nto scurry up the tree to safety. Gideon sprays the tree with\nwater. Wet kids fall out of the tree and in one motion leap\nthe fence. Gideon cuts the water off and slaps the dirt off\nhis hands. He is quite pleased with himself.\n\n<b>EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY\n</b>\nOne of the wet kids is watching Gideon as he goes back inside\nthe house. The boy signals the others who slowly follow in\nsingle file. They jump the fence and climb back up the tree.\nThey let their half-eaten fruit fall to the ground.\n\n<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\nSuzie opens a letter and a picture of a baby falls out. Suzie\nlooks at the picture before reading the letter.\nShe tries to find a place for it among the other baby\npictures that cover the entire mirror on the dresser. Gideon\ncomes in and starts to undress.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tMy mind plays tricks on me. Is it\n\tokay if I take a bath now?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tEveryone is gone. Rhonda is in the\n\tbathroom.\n\nRHONDA, Gideon's granddaughter, 13 years old, comes out of\nthe bathroom.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI was looking through my trunk and\n\tI can't find my toby.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRHONDA \n</b>\tWhat's that?\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tIt is a charm that my great\n\tgrandmother made me.\n\nEveryone notices the worried look on Gideon's face.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tIt will show up.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRHONDA \n</b>\tIf my daddy calls, tell him I\n\twalked home.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tYou be careful and thank you for\n\tlooking after Sunny.\n\nSunny is asleep on the sofa with a half-eaten apple ready to\nfall out of his hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tBabe Brother and his wife are\n\ttaking advantage of a situation. I\n\thate to be mean to people but\n\tpicking Sunny up when they feel\n\tlike it has to come to an end. Now\n\tI'm going to ask him how come he\n\tcouldn't be at your birthday.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tDon't bother the poor boy. It just\n\ttakes some people a little longer\n\tto figure out who they are.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI don't know how two brothers can\n\tbe so different.\n\n<b>EXT. MRS. BAKER'S BACKYARD - DAY\n</b>\nSKIP BAKER, who is thirteen, crawls out of his pigeon cage,\nholding two birds that he throws up in the air. He climbs\nupon the garage roof and throws rocks at the birds to keep\nthem flying. He WHISTLES and YELLS at them.\n\n<b>CLOSE UP OF BIRDS FLYING\n</b>\nAs the birds circle Skip's house, they do backward rolls and\ndeath grips. Skip throws more rocks to keep them flying. The\nrocks land on Gideon's roof.\n\nThe SOUND of a person trying to learn how to play a TRUMPET\nbreaks the pleasant SOUNDS of the pigeons popping their wings\nand flying in circles over the house.\n\n<b>INT. MRS. BAKER'S HOUSE, RODNEY'S BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\nRODNEY BAKER is about nine. He stands next to a shaded\nwindow, trying to finger the right valves on his trumpet. He\ntries to hit a high note, but only succeeds in making an\nawful screeching sound.\n\n<b>EXT. MRS. BAKER'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nA group of kids walking by Rodney's window shout insulting\nthings about his horn playing.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKIDS \n</b>\tShut up! Go help your mama wash\n\tdishes!\n\n<b>INT. GIDEON'S KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\nSuzie is standing over an egg that just fell on the floor.\nThe SCREECHING SOUND of the trumpet from next door is\ninterrupted by the doorbell. Suzie cannot decide on what to\ndo, to clean the egg up or answer the door. The doorbell\nkeeps RINGING.\n\n<b>EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY\n</b>\nTwo uniformed Police Officers stand impatiently at the door.\n\n<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nSuzie invites OFFICER SCOTT and OFFICER DAVIS in. Both men\nare white and are in their mid-twenties. Officer Davis does\nmost of the questioning.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAVIS \n</b>\tWe have a complaint from one of\n\tyour neighbors about a rooster\n\tcrowing in the mornings.\n\n<b>INT. BATHROOM - DAY\n</b>\nGideon is shaving with a straight razor and humming to\nhimself, obviously in a good mood. Suzie sticks her head in.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tThe police are here to talk to you\n\tabout the chickens.\n\nThe good mood that Gideon was in dissolves quickly. Gideon\nwipes the soap off his face and throws the towel down. Suzie\nleaves. Gideon brushes his hair and adjusts his bathrobe.\n\n<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nGideon comes in, still adjusting his bathrobe.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tWhat can I do for you, Officer?\n\nSuzie returns to the kitchen to clean the egg on the floor.\nOfficer Scott keeps her in view.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAVIS \n</b>\tYou know it is against the city\n\tordinance to keep chickens or live\n\tstock.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI always had chickens, ducks and\n\twhatnots.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAVIS \n</b>\tNot anymore, not in the city.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tWe grow most of our own food. The\n\tmoney I get from social security,\n\tmy pension and my wife's work,\n\tkeeps us living on the edge. What\n\tchoice do people like us have.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAVIS \n</b>\tWell, you just have to move further\n\tout.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tNow how far would further out be?\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAVIS \n</b>\tI'm not here to argue, sir.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSCOTT \n</b>\tYou guys don't make anything\n\tillegal, do you?\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tLike what may I ask?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSCOTT \n</b>\tYou might have a distillery pumping\n\tout barrels of moonshine.\n\nSuzie looks at Scott for a moment and goes into the kitchen.\nGideon is about to lose control. Davis heads off the\nconfrontation.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDAVIS \n</b>\tLook, just get rid of the chickens\n\tand you all have a nice day.\n\nGideon stands in the doorway watching the Police go down the\nsteps.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI'll be damned if I get rid of my\n\tchickens. I ought to get some hogs\n\tand put them out there.\n\n<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nThere is soft knocking on the door. Suzie enter frame wearing\na robe.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tWho is it?\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER (V.O.) \n</b>\tBabe Brother.\n\nSuzie opens the door. BABE BROTHER, Gideon's youngest son,\nabout 31, handsome, wearing an expensive suit, comes in,\nbeating the cold off of him and blowing in his hands.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tI was hoping you came to the door\n\tinstead of him. It gets cold at\n\tnight.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tThis doesn't make any sense; you\n\tare going to drag that poor boy out\n\tin the cold air.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tHe will be alright.\n\nThe camera follows Babe Brother. He passes Gideon's room\nwhere Gideon is asleep, snoring loudly.\n\n<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nSuzie and Babe Brother enter the bedroom where Sunny is\nsleeping. Suzie gives Babe Brother a blanket to wrap Sunny up\nin.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tThanks for taking care of him. I\n\twill try not to be so long next\n\ttime.\n\nBabe Brother gives his mother a good-night kiss. Gideon comes\nto the door.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tWhat time is it? Do you think you\n\tcan just treat us like your slave?\n\tIt's after one.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tI tried to call to let you know I\n\twas going to be late.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tThat's a lie.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tLet us settle this tomorrow.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tLook! Don't try to get ahead by\n\triding our backs.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\t\t(shouts)\n\tI pay my own way.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tSince when?\n\nHe reaches for Babe Brother but Suzie comes between them.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tTake Sunny home, please.\n\nShe pushes Babe Brother away. Babe Brother walks away,\nstaring back at his father.\n\n<b>INT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT\n</b>\nGideon is lying in bed. Suzie gets in beside him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tYour feet are cold.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tGo back to sleep.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI asked you to wake me when Babe\n\tBrother comes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tYou all act like two roosters.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI'm not going to let him get away\n\twith murder.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tYou and Babe Brother are so much\n\talike...\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tHe ain't nothing like me. How come\n\ta man has to have sons that are day\n\tand night apart? You ought to stop\n\tprotecting him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tHush.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tYou're always taking his side.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tHush.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI'm trying to make him a man but\n\tyou keep babying him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tYou're going to find yourself on\n\tthe floor.\n\n<b>INT. BABE BROTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING\n</b>\nThe bedroom is tastefully furnished with modern art and\npaintings by Barns.\n\nBabe Brother wakes up with Sunny standing in the doorway\nlooking at him. It takes Babe Brother some time to fully wake\nup.\n\nFinally he sits reluctantly on the side of the bed and Sunny\ncomes over and sits next to him, trying to get his weary\nfather interested in his remote-control racing car.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tI want you to be the richest man in\n\tthe world so I can be the richest\n\tfather in the world.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUNNY \n</b>\tI don't want to be rich. I want to\n\twork on the railroad like\n\tgrandfather.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tSon, if you are going to have a\n\tfamily, you can't always choose a\n\tjob just because you like it. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tI don't want you to shine anybody's\n\tshoes or be a porter. You let\n\tsomebody else carry your bags.\n\nSunny quietly gets up and follows his car out of the room.\n\n<b>INT. BABE BROTHER'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nBabe Brother, having showered but still wearing his pajamas,\ndrags himself to the kitchen table where his wife LINDA has a\nhuge coffee mug with the inscription, \"I'm the boss\", waiting\nfor him.\n\nLinda is about thirty years old and materially oriented like\nher husband. She is wearing a conservatively cut business\ndress.\n\nSunny stops playing with his car and gets himself an empty\ncup. Babe Brother is about to pour him some of his coffee\nwhen Linda objects.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b><b>\tNO.\n</b>\nSunny pleads with her in silence but Linda refuses to yield.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tHe wouldn't want any if you didn't\n\ttry to keep it away from him.\n\nLinda leaves the table but stops for a moment and looks down\nat her husband.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tBecause you were spoiled, don't try\n\tto spoil Sunny.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tMy daddy never gave me anything\n\twithout my having to sweat for it.\n\tEvery summer, the way they kept me\n\tand Junior out of trouble was to\n\tsend us to Big Daddy's farm. We\n\twould get up with the chickens.\n\tEvery summer the fence had to be\n\trepaired. The barn needed a coat of\n\tpaint. We had to pip all of Big\n\tMama's hundred laying hens and go\n\tto church all day on Sunday. For\n\tBig Daddy, calluses and sweat were\n\tthe mark of a man. Sunny will never\n\thave to bust his knuckles like we\n\tdid.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tI want Sunny to have an advantage\n\tthat you and I never had, but he\n\tneeds discipline, and you are not\n\thelping when I tell him to do\n\tsomething and you allow him to get\n\tout of it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tWhat is a sip of coffee going to\n\tdo?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tCoffee is bad for anybody,\n\tespecially for a child.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tI don't see you crying about my\n\tdrinking it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tHow old are you?\n\n<b>EXT.

He puts the rake down\nand walks over to the garden and watches Suzie plant seeds\nfor a while.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tInstead of standing here doing\n\tnothing, I better give those\n\tchickens some scratch before they\n\tstart cackling.\n\n<b>EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY\n</b>\nOLD JOHN is pushing his cart up the alley. Old John's face is\nwashed so clean that it shines. His pants are dirty and his\ncart is full of odds and ends of no value.

If you\n\tcouldn't outwork his mule, you\n\twasn't worth the salt you put in\n\tgreens. You had to wake up looking\n\tfor something to do. I was raised\n\tas a mule and now I'm a rolling\n\tstone.\n\nSuzie sticks her head over the fence and hands a bag of red\ntomatoes to Old John.\n\n<b>\t\t\tOLD JOHN (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI didn't mean for you to pay me for\n\tthat.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tI know you didn't but you have been\n\tso thoughtful.\n\n<b>\t\t\tOLD JOHN \n</b>\tBut when your sunflowers come up,\n\tI'll pay you for them.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tI planted a row just for you and\n\tyou don't owe me anything.\n\n<b>EXT.

Suzie brings her plants and puts\nthem on the counter.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWhen are you going to have a sale\n\ton weed killer?\n\n<b>\t\t\tCASHIER \n</b>\tYou missed it. We had a two-day\n\tsale last week.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tWhat kind of a sale is a two-day\n\tsale? I thought sales last a week\n\tor two.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCASHIER \n</b>\tEvery day we have something\n\tdifferent. Today's sale is hay. 25%\n\toff. If you have a horse or cow,\n\tyou're in business.\n\n<b>INT. CAR - DAY\n</b>\nSunny looks at the Little Girl in the next car; she has her\nmouth pressed against the window. She is missing a tooth.\nGideon is behind the wheel while Suzie holds her new plants\nup to the sun, carefully looking at them.\n\nSunny, seated in the back, pokes a hole in the sack of feed.\nThe mash trickles to the floor as if from an hour glass.\n\n<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\nSuzie is sitting in front of a table full of jars. Each jar\nhas a shoot and is half-filled with water. Gideon is on his\nknees trying to fix the hinge to a cabinet. Sunny is sitting\nalmost under him listening to him tell stories. Sunny has a\ncoffee can full of marbles.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tAll of the preachers were down in\n\tthe basement of the church\n\tconfessing their sins to one\n\tanother. They were way down in the\n\tbasement 'cause they figured no one\n\twould hear them. One of the\n\tpreachers said, it makes me feel\n\ttoo shame to tell how bad I have\n\tbeen. You know them young gals that\n\tsit up in the first row. I can look\n\tat them and forget my text. I'm\n\tjust lost when it comes to women,\n\teven them middle age sisters. Then\n\tanother preacher said, I don't\n\tthink I can tell you what my sin is\n\t'cause it's bad. Another preacher\n\tsaid, Brother, we all amongst\n\tfriends. Tell us what's troubling\n\tyour soul. Clear your conscience.\n\nGideon takes a sip of water.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON (CONT'D)\n</b>\tSo the preacher said, we all got a\n\tbond 'cause we confessed to one\n\tanother. So let me tell you, my sin\n\tis corn liquor. I just acts a fool\n\tbehind that spirit water. I loves\n\tit more than preaching. Now ain't\n\tthat a sin, lord. So all the\n\tpreachers went on confessing, each\n\tone worst than the last. Finally\n\tthey came to the last preacher who\n\thad been very quiet and listening\n\tto every word that fell. One of the\n\tpreachers said to him, it's your\n\tturn. Confessing will lift you\n\tburden, Brother. Bare us your soul.\n\tWe did. The last preacher said, no,\n\tmy sin is the worst among all of\n\tyou. One of the preachers said, ah\n\tgo on man and stop all this\n\tsuspense. So the last preacher\n\tsaid, like I told you my sin is the\n\tlowest. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tMy sin is gossiping and I can't\n\twait to get out and tell what I\n\theard.\n\nSunny does not get the humor of the story. He is more\ninterested in picking up his marbles that Gideon's foot\nkicked over.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tYou oughtn't tell him stories like\n\tthat.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUNNY \n</b>\tTell me another story.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI'll you a story about the terrapin\n\tand the rabbit. No, you tell me a\n\tstory. Come on.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUNNY \n</b>\tOnce upon a time, my mommy and\n\tdaddy lived in this big house that\n\tI bought for them. I got them this\n\tbig car.\n\nA strong wind causes the broom handle to knock against the\nchina teapot, KNOCKING IT TO THE FLOOR. Suzie stops Sunny\nfrom trying to help pick up the pieces.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tYou stay back. You might cut your\n\tfingers.\n\nSuzie looks down sadly at her broken tea pot.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI looked everywhere for my toby.\n\n<b>EXT. APPLE ORCHARD - DAY\n</b>\nThe trees are barren, which gives them an unfriendly look. As\nwe LOOK at the ground, a man's distorted shadow stops in the\nframe.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY\n</b>\nA shadow of a man appears on Gideon's porch. The camera tilts\nup to HARRY MENTION, a very dark-looking, ageless old man\ncarrying several boxes held together by a cord. He looks\nexhausted from his journey. He looks in his address book and,\nsatisfied that he reached the right house, he rings the\ndoorbell.\n\n<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nSuzie comes to the front door; she recognizes Harry right\naway. She invites him in. Harry stumps his feet on the porch\nseveral times and then enters.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tHarry, I can't believe it is you.\n\tGideon, look who is here.\n\nGideon comes in, wiping his hands. Sunny, carrying the broom,\nfollows behind.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tHarry, good God Almighty, man! It's\n\tbeen, what, thirty years or more.\n\tSuzie, we haven't seen Harry since\n\twe left home.\n\nHarry is more interested in the boy, but Sunny doesn't want\nto come near Harry. It is Gideon's arm that is keeping him\nwithin close range of Harry.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON (CONT'D)\n</b>\tThis is my grandson, Sunny. He is\n\tmy youngest son's child.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tHe kind of favors one of my boys\n\twhen he was about his age.\n\nSunny, playing with the broom, accidentally touches Harry's\nshoe with it. Harry hides his anger about being touched with\nthe broom. Harry takes the broom from Sunny and spits on the\nbottom of it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n</b>\tBoy, that is bad luck to touch a\n\tfellow with a broom.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tHe knows better.

We have empty\n\trooms since the boys got their own\n\tfamilies and moved out.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tWell if you're sure, I won't be a\n\tbother. Oh, I don't sleep on no\n\tspring mattress. I always make\n\tmyself a pallet on the floor.\n\n<b>INT. BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\nThe bedroom door to Harry's room is cracked open. Peering\nthrough the cracked door, we SEE Harry asleep on his pallet.\nHis back is turned to the camera. It is dead silent. There\ndoes not seem to be any sign of life. On the floor is a plate\nthat has water in it. It looks like it is for a dog.\n\n<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\nSuzie is peeling potatoes and Gideon is ironing.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tPoor old Harry, he really must have\n\tbeen worn out. He has been asleep\n\tall day.\n\nWithout anyone being aware, Harry has been standing in the\ndoorway for some time.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY\n</b>\tGood evening. It must be all the\n\tdifferent time zones I crossed that\n\tmakes me feel this weary.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tYou should go back and rest.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tNo, if I rest any longer, I won't\n\tsleep tonight. May I use your\n\tbathroom to wash up a bit?\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tMan, act like this is your home.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tThat's awful generous of you. I\n\talways ask to keep from wearing out\n\twelcome.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tOne can tell you are from back\n\thome. These people nowadays don't\n\tknow what manners are.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tWhere we come from, you had to know\n\thow to act right. You had to know\n\thow to say yes sir and no sir. You\n\thad to know your place.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tYou had to tread softly.\n\nThe doorbell rings and Gideon goes to answer it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tThose days you could always find\n\tsomething redeeming about even the\n\tworst person.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tYou remember that boy who lost his\n\tmind, Joe? You could hear him\n\tpitching horseshoes at night in the\n\tdark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make\n\thim mad and call yourself running\n\tin the house to be safe. He would\n\tpick up a brick and say \"go on in\n\tthere brick and hit somebody\" and\n\tit would find its mark.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tI was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom\n\tbecause of him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tAll those places that us coloreds\n\tlived, that we used to call\n\tBottoms, have all been changed to\n\tDrives and Heights. Everything is\n\tin what you call it, not in what it\n\tis.\n\nGideon comes back with Junior, Pal and Rhonda.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tHarry, I would like for you to meet\n\tmy oldest son, his wife and\n\tdaughter.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR \n</b>\tPleased to meet you. So you're from\n\tback home, too.\n\nHarry and Junior shake hands, but Rhonda gives Harry only a\nnod of her head and a smile.\n\nPat, who is pregnant, attempts to shake hands with Harry, but\nis forced to withdraw her hand because of a sudden pain in\nher stomach.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAT \n</b>\tThis boy must be turning over. Oh,\n\the just kicked me again.\n\nJunior feels her stomach. Pat again tries to shake Harry's\nhand and again gets a jolt from her stomach. She finds a\nchair to sit down in.\n\nThe SOUND of rocks hitting the roof causes everyone to look\nup.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tIt's the boy next door throwing at\n\this birds. I'm just waiting on him\n\tto hit a pane in the window\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tI'm going to wash up now. You all\n\tplease excuse me.\n\n<b>INT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY\n</b>\nHarry is wiping off his face with a washcloth. He stares at\nhimself in the mirror for a long time. The sudden sound of\nthe boy next door starting to play his trumpet startles him.\nHe smiles at the trumpeter's efforts.\n\nHe wrings the wash cloth out. A reddish oil-like liquid DRIPS\ninto the face bowl.\n\n<b>EXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\nA few of the houses have lights on. Suddenly, Gideon's\nrooster starts to CROW. A dog starts to bark and a garbage\ncan is knocked over. Bedroom lights in almost all the houses\nin the neighborhood pop on. The voices of neighbors\ncomplaining are heard.\n\n<b>INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\nHarry is just waking up. He listens to the voices of Suzie\nand Gideon as they get ready for church.\n\n<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - MORNING\n</b>\nGideon is paging through the Bible as he stands by the door,\nwaiting for Suzie who is watering her plants. Harry comes in.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tGood morning.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tYou ought to come hear our\n\tpreacher. Remember old Cat Iron?\n\tWell, our preacher is just as\n\tstrong.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tNext time when I feel a little\n\tbetter perhaps.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI was going to get up and get a hen\n\tout there for dinner, but time got\n\taway.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tOh, I would feel much at home if\n\tyou let me get one for you. I\n\thaven't wrung a chicken's neck in a\n\tmonth of Sundays. You know, folks\n\twould call my daddy to kill their\n\thogs. That used to be my trade from\n\ttime to time.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tWell, I would appreciate that.\n\n<b>EXT. HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nGideon and Suzie are stepping off the porch. Harry is\nstanding behind the screen door.\n\nGideon and Suzie get in Junior's car. Junior, Pat and Rhonda\nwave to Harry as the car pulls away.\n\n<b>INT. LIVING HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n<b>IT IS A TRACKING SHOT, FOLLOWING HARRY THROUGH THE HOUSE.\n</b>\nHarry looks through Gideon's and Suzie's private things. He\nlooks at the baby pictures that fill the mirror. He reads\nSuzie's letters that are dated years ago. In one of the\nletters, he finds a picture of a man standing behind a\nplough. \"Uncle Joe after Ella's death\" is written on the\nback. A picture of a mule holds his interest. He looks at it\nfor a long time and carries it with him as he continues his\nsearch.\n\n<b>EXT. BACKYARD - DAY\n</b>\nHarry slowly walks along the rows in Suzie's garden. He\nstands by the chicken cage. Suddenly, the chickens start to\nrun about and CACKLE as if a dog had gotten in.\n\nHarry turns from the chicken coop. He stands still. Sunny is\nhiding behind a bush.\n\nSunny steps around the bush. Harry looks at Sunny with such\nconcentration that Sunny takes a step backward as if getting\nready to defend himself.\n\nMRS. BAKER, a black woman in her early thirties, comes out on\nthe back porch. She shakes out a rug. She stops shaking the\nrug and stares at Harry.\n\nHarry becomes aware of Mrs. Baker's stare. He comes to\nhimself and smiles at her.\n\n<b>INT. GIDEON'S KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\nHarry and Babe Brother are playing cards while Linda watches\nand Sunny plays by himself on the floor. In the sink is a\nnewspaper full of bloody feathers. A small flame is under a\npot on the stove. Harry looks at the chicken in the pot and\nsits back down.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tYou don't act like the rest of\n\tGideon's friends. They believe if\n\tyou are not hard at work, you are\n\thard at sin.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tOh, I'm more modern in my ways. I\n\tdon't believe in sin, though there\n\tis good and evil. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tAnd evil is a thing you work at.\n\nHarry takes his knife, a crab apple switch, out. It has a\nrabbit foot attached to it. Harry cleans his fingernail with\nthe knife. Sunny is interested in the rabbit foot. He reaches\nfor the knife.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n</b>\tNot you mustn't touch. Your mama\n\tmight not like you handling knives.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tI think he wants to see your rabbit\n\tfoot.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tI let this rabbit foot do in place\n\tof my toby that I lost years ago.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tWhat's a toby?\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tYou don't want to be at crossroads\n\twithout one. It's a charm that old\n\tpeople teach you how to make. I had\n\tone for a long time that belonged\n\tto my grandmother who had it ever\n\tsince she was a child. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tIn my travels I misplaced it.

When we were\n\tchildren, there used to be an old\n\tman that came around and would\n\tsnatch your soul if you didn't have\n\tsomething on you that didn't make a\n<b>\tX.\n</b>\nHarry is aware that Babe Brother is interested in the knife.\nAfter cleaning his last fingernail, he hands the knife to\nBabe Brother.\n\nHarry looks at the cards in his hand. He smiles to himself.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tDid you have your child at home?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tNo. No. No. No. I had my Child at\n\tCedars and Sinai. And that ain't no\n\tcounty hospital. You have to have\n\tcash or check before you come in\n\tthe door.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tSome folks take that natural stuff\n\ttoo far.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tJunior's wife kept her afterbirth'\n\tin the refrigerator. That's why I\n\tdo not eat over there now.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tCountry people got so many strange\n\tways,\n\nHarry looks again at the chicken that he is boiling.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tDid you ever have to use this\n\tthing?\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tThat is called a crab apple switch.\n\tIt's for those bad acting monkeys\n\tand just the thing for a mean dog.\n\tNow I don't know if I actually did\n\twhat I did or got my life and story\n\tmixed in with other folk's stories\n\tbut I seem to recall that I had to\n\tuse my crab apple on a boy from\n\tback home. I was up in Memphis\n\tworking on the railroad, like your\n\tdaddy who had an easy job. He would\n\tsing a song that had a cadence and\n\twe would lay track. Anyway I was\n\tcoming down Beale Street and I\n\theard this music coming from a\n\tsaloon. Sure enough it was Emory.\n\tMy daddy taught both of us to play\n\tbut Emory was natural at it. Got in\n\ta blues band and what not. He and\n\tanother boy had killed a boy named\n\tHocker sometime back and they\n\tballed the Jack leaving town. Emory\n\thad lost one eye and had a scar\n\trunning down his face. Bad luck I\n\twould say. He got to drinking that\n\tcorn liquor. We went to his girl's\n\troom and he wouldn't stop drinking.\n\tHe started talking about the old\n\tdays and he went mad. He pulled his\n\tknife and I got to mine first. The\n\tlights went out.\n\nLinda picks up a card and looks at it. There is a naked woman\non the back.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER\n</b>\tDon't pick up the cards if you are\n\tnot in the game. Did he die?\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARRY \n</b>\tI don't know what happened to him.\n\tHe just ran out into the streets. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tI got some old records I want you\n\tto hear. I like the blues sung\n\tsimply, man and a guitar. Or sung\n\tby a woman who had bad luck all her\n\tlife. Don't ever let anyone tell\n\tyou his life's story if it is of a\n\tweary life full of sadness. When I\n\twas a boy, a man told me a story of\n\thow he lost all of his sons and\n\tI'll be damned if the same thing\n\tdidn't happen to me.\n\nSunny is busy playing in the curtains.\n\nThe SOUND of Gideon and Suzie arriving makes them scurry to\nget the cards put away. Harry puts his knife away just as\nSuzie and Gideon enter. Linda feels a little embarrassed.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tHow was church?\n\nGideon and Suzie are surprised to see Linda. They don't know\nwhat to say.\n\n<b>EXT. MRS. BAKER'S BACKYARD - DAY\n</b>\nRodney walks around in the yard BLOWING his trumpet as loud\nas he can.

Suzie\nis cutting the dead leaves off of a small potted plant.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tIt feels like a storm has passed...\n\tHattie read some of Harry's letters\n\tto a woman he had a child by. The\n\tchild had died and he was writing\n\tto give her some comfort. Hattie\n\tdidn't know that deep down at the\n\tbottom of Harry's hate, there was\n\tsome love.\n\nThe SOUND of Rodney's trumpet is heard but is no longer\nirritating.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tDid I ever tell you the story about\n\tthe man who wanted to make his own\n\tmind up about heaven and hell? He\n\tdidn't want nobody's opinion but\n\this own.\n\nSuzie doesn't pay any attention; she is involved with her\npotted plant. Gideon looks over at the Preacher, who is still\nasleep.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON (CONT'D)\n</b>\tHe's going to check out heaven\n\tfirst. He gets a round trip ticket\n\tto heaven. He gets in heaven and\n\tfinds it just like back home.\n\tPeople dripping with sweat, working\n\tin the fields, hardly surviving. He\n\tasked a man who was getting a drink\n\tof water, \"I thought the streets\n\twere paved with gold.\" \"They are\n\tbut you won't see them,\" he said.\n\t\"Boy, you got to work day and night\n\tcause idleness is sinfulness.\" So\n\the takes the other half of his\n\tticket and takes the express to\n\thell. He sees people stretched out\n\ton their backs kicking back,\n\tpicking their teeth. \"Man, this is\n\ta dream.\" He asked, \"What's you'll\n\tdoing?\" They all hollered back,\n\t\"Sinning.\" The devil was shaking\n\thands with everyone and came up to\n\thim and said, \"Please to meet you.\"\n\tHe asked, \"I thought you'll was\n\tsupposed to be burning in fire.\"\n\tSomeone said, \"Man, ain't no fire\n\tdown here except under that pot of\n\tchitlins.\" The man was going go ask\n\tthe preacher back on earth...\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tI don't want to hear any joke about\n\tcolored people being in hell.\n\tYou're being irreverent.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tI'm almost finished. I'm about to\n\tcome to the punch line.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tI don't want to hear any tales\n\tabout colored people...\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tBut these are white people,\n\tanybody. The punch...\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tI don't care to hear any jokes\n\tabout people being in hell. This\n\tcut on my hand reminds me that it\n\tis nothing to laugh at.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGIDEON \n</b>\tIt's only a tale.\n\nThe RATTLING of pots and dishes starts suddenly. Harry's body\nstarts to sway gently as if he were about to get up.\nEveryone is frozen. Babe Brother and Linda remain asleep. The\nrocking caused by the earthquake doesn't wake them.\n\nM.C., Herman, Okra and Hattie and Marsh enters the dining\nroom. Harry's feet are seen in the kitchen still swaying.\n\n<b>\t\t\tM.C \n</b>\tIs that an earthquake?\n\n<b>\t\t\tHERMAN \n</b>\tIt's something.\n\nBabe Brother wakes in a sweat and sits next to Linda like a\nchild needing protection.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n</b>\tI'm cold. I need to get out into\n\tthe sunlight.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJUNIOR \n</b>\tWhat is it, noontime?\n\n<b>\t\t\tPREACHER\n</b>\tI wonder how they going to bury\n\tthis man.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHATTIE \n</b>\tPlant him in Potter's Field. He\n\tdoesn't need a marked grave.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHERMAN\n</b>\tHattie, your true colors are\n\tunbearable. You got some mean ways.\n\tDon't worry about the boy getting a\n\tburial. He still has some friends\n\tleft on this earth.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHATTIE \n</b>\tHis winter has come and gone and I\n\tknow right now he is answering for\n\ta lot of things.\n\nM.C., Okra and Herman move away from Hattie.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPREACHER \n</b>\tIt is my job to pray for his soul\n\tand I would like to do that.\n\n<b>EXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nRhonda is sitting next to Sunny on the front porch. She has\nan angry expression. Sunny is trying to please her by\noffering her his airplane.\nHe pushes the airplane near her and she pushes it back with a\nviolent shove. He persists in offering her his airplane.\n\nA crowd of people is still standing around in front of\nGideon's house.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMAN \n</b>\tHey boy, you still got that dead\n\tman in your house.\n\nSunny and Rhonda don't respond. A middle-aged woman,\nVIRGINIA, one of Gideon's neighbors, passes Sunny and Rhonda,\nknocks on the screen door and goes in.\n\n<b>INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tVIRGINIA \n</b>\tI know you all haven't had a chance\n\tto cook or do anything with that\n\tdead man in your kitchen. You must\n\tbe starved to death. Some of your\n\tneighbors have got together and we\n\tset up a picnic table in my\n\tbackyard with food and everything\n\tto feed all you all.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSUZIE \n</b>\tVirginia, that is so wonderful of\n\tyou all!\n\n<b>\t\t\tMARSH \n</b>\tIf the dead wagon comes, we ought\n\tto leave a note telling them we'll\n\tbe down the street at a picnic.\n\nGideon comes back in with Suzie, who is helping tie his tie.\nThey all line up and file out the front door with Suzie and\nGideon leading the way. Pat is holding her stomach with a\nthoughtful look on her face.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAT \n</b>\tI think we better be ready.\n\nJunior looks concerned as he follows Pat out the door. Sunny\nfollows Rhonda, who is still mad at him. Babe Brother and\nLinda are the last ones out. Babe Brother takes a long look\nin the direction of Harry as Linda pulls him out. She slams\nthe door.\n\n<b>INT. KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\nHarry's body lies on the floor. On the kitchen sink are\nSuzie's jars of cuttings, which have developed a maze of\nroots.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t THE END\n</b>\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>To Sleep with Anger</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Charles Burnett\" title=\"Scripts by Charles Burnett\">Charles Burnett</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/To Sleep with Anger Script.html#comments\" title=\"To Sleep with Anger comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:18:30.060823"}
