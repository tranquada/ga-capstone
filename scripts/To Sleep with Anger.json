ROOM - DAY  (EFX)\n\nGIDEON, a strongly built elderly black man, is sitting at a\ntable. On the table is a large bowl of fruit. A crocheted\ntablecloth hangs over the side of the table. Gideon is\ndressed in a white suit and wearing a pair of well-polished\nwing-tip shoes. His hat almost covers his eyes, which are two\npoints of greenish coals. The fruit in the bowl is engulfed\nin flames.\n\nThe flames look as if they are DRIPPING from the tablecloth\nto the floor. Gideon's shoes start to SMOULDER. His shoes\nBURST INTO FLAMES which spread up his pants leg. His head\nfalls forward as if he had suddenly fallen to sleep. He\ntwiddles his thumbs very slowly in a circle. He crosses his\nlegs as if to get comfortable.\n\nThe camera moves to a CLOSE UP of his burning shoes. The\nimage of his feet begins to appear through his shoes; the\nflames fade; the background changes as we\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. GIDEON'S BACKYARD - DAY\n\nGideon's bare feet are resting on reddish dry earth. Gideon\nis sitting in his backyard under a fruit tree with a Bible\nresting in his hands.\n\nHis house is a small, neatly painted bungalow in South\nCentral Los Angeles. Corn, tomatoes, other vegetables grow in\nthe yard. Chickens scratch around.\n\nHe slowly awakens; his hands are trembling. He looks around\nand sees the chickens. He looks up at the sky and sighs, with\nsome relief.\n\nSUNNY, Gideon's grandson, five years old, has been watching\nhim from the back window of the house. He leaves the window.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\nDOLLY SHOT OF SUNNY\n\nSunny peeps in the workroom. Through the crack in the door, a\nWoman waves to Sunny. \n\nINT. WORKROOM - DAY\n\nThe room is nearly filled with pregnant women and their\nhusbands. SUZIE, Gideon's wife, late 60's or early 70's, a\npicture of health, is giving a last bit of instruction before\nthe class ends. Some of the people are already preparing to\nleave.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tRemember, especially you men, that\n\tworking together now will already\n\thave formed a bond before the child\n\tarrives. The woman is very\n\tsensitive.\n\nSomewhere in the room a Male Voice booms out.\n\n\t\t\tVOICE (O.S.) \n\tTell me about it.\n\nThere is a bit of LAUGHTER as all start putting away their\nthings.\n\nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY\n\nGideon looks over at the chickens, scratching around in the\ngarden. He calls to them, but they don't respond. He puts his\nshoes on and walks towards the back door of the house.\nEntering the house, he stops and waits inside the door\npeeping out. In a sort of devilish manner he talks to\nhimself.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tSpoiling the little foxes that\n\tspoil my vines.\n\nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY \n\nShot of the backyard. Nothing. Suddenly, with the grace and\nsuspicion of alley cats, kids jump over Gideon's back fence,\nlook around timidly, and start climbing up his fruit tree.\n\nGideon walks down the steps slowly while humming in a deep\nvoice. He turns the water on and walks over to the tree,\ntrapping the kids. Dangling legs, hanging from the tree, try\nto scurry up the tree to safety. Gideon sprays the tree with\nwater. Wet kids fall out of the tree and in one motion leap\nthe fence. Gideon cuts the water off and slaps the dirt off\nhis hands. He is quite pleased with himself.\n\nEXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY\n\nOne of the wet kids is watching Gideon as he goes back inside\nthe house. The boy signals the others who slowly follow in\nsingle file. They jump the fence and climb back up the tree.\nThey let their half-eaten fruit fall to the ground.\n\nINT. BEDROOM - DAY\n\nSuzie opens a letter and a picture of a baby falls out. Suzie\nlooks at the picture before reading the letter.\nShe tries to find a place for it among the other baby\npictures that cover the entire mirror on the dresser. Gideon\ncomes in and starts to undress.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tMy mind plays tricks on me. Is it\n\tokay if I take a bath now?\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tEveryone is gone. Rhonda is in the\n\tbathroom.\n\nRHONDA, Gideon's granddaughter, 13 years old, comes out of\nthe bathroom.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI was looking through my trunk and\n\tI can't find my toby.\n\n\t\t\tRHONDA \n\tWhat's that?\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tIt is a charm that my great\n\tgrandmother made me.\n\nEveryone notices the worried look on Gideon's face.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tIt will show up.\n\n\t\t\tRHONDA \n\tIf my daddy calls, tell him I\n\twalked home.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tYou be careful and thank you for\n\tlooking after Sunny.\n\nSunny is asleep on the sofa with a half-eaten apple ready to\nfall out of his hand.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tBabe Brother and his wife are\n\ttaking advantage of a situation. I\n\thate to be mean to people but\n\tpicking Sunny up when they feel\n\tlike it has to come to an end. Now\n\tI'm going to ask him how come he\n\tcouldn't be at your birthday.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tDon't bother the poor boy. It just\n\ttakes some people a little longer\n\tto figure out who they are.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI don't know how two brothers can\n\tbe so different.\n\nEXT. MRS. BAKER'S BACKYARD - DAY\n\nSKIP BAKER, who is thirteen, crawls out of his pigeon cage,\nholding two birds that he throws up in the air. He climbs\nupon the garage roof and throws rocks at the birds to keep\nthem flying. He WHISTLES and YELLS at them.\n\nCLOSE UP OF BIRDS FLYING\n\nAs the birds circle Skip's house, they do backward rolls and\ndeath grips. Skip throws more rocks to keep them flying. The\nrocks land on Gideon's roof.\n\nThe SOUND of a person trying to learn how to play a TRUMPET\nbreaks the pleasant SOUNDS of the pigeons popping their wings\nand flying in circles over the house.\n\nINT. MRS. BAKER'S HOUSE, RODNEY'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\nRODNEY BAKER is about nine. He stands next to a shaded\nwindow, trying to finger the right valves on his trumpet. He\ntries to hit a high note, but only succeeds in making an\nawful screeching sound.\n\nEXT. MRS. BAKER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nA group of kids walking by Rodney's window shout insulting\nthings about his horn playing.\n\n\t\t\tKIDS \n\tShut up! Go help your mama wash\n\tdishes!\n\nINT. GIDEON'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\nSuzie is standing over an egg that just fell on the floor.\nThe SCREECHING SOUND of the trumpet from next door is\ninterrupted by the doorbell. Suzie cannot decide on what to\ndo, to clean the egg up or answer the door. The doorbell\nkeeps RINGING.\n\nEXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY\n\nTwo uniformed Police Officers stand impatiently at the door.\n\nINT. FRONT ROOM - DAY\n\nSuzie invites OFFICER SCOTT and OFFICER DAVIS in. Both men\nare white and are in their mid-twenties. Officer Davis does\nmost of the questioning.\n\n\t\t\tDAVIS \n\tWe have a complaint from one of\n\tyour neighbors about a rooster\n\tcrowing in the mornings.\n\nINT. BATHROOM - DAY\n\nGideon is shaving with a straight razor and humming to\nhimself, obviously in a good mood. Suzie sticks her head in.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tThe police are here to talk to you\n\tabout the chickens.\n\nThe good mood that Gideon was in dissolves quickly. Gideon\nwipes the soap off his face and throws the towel down. Suzie\nleaves. Gideon brushes his hair and adjusts his bathrobe.\n\nINT. FRONT ROOM - DAY\n\nGideon comes in, still adjusting his bathrobe.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tWhat can I do for you, Officer?\n\nSuzie returns to the kitchen to clean the egg on the floor.\nOfficer Scott keeps her in view.\n\n\t\t\tDAVIS \n\tYou know it is against the city\n\tordinance to keep chickens or live\n\tstock.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI always had chickens, ducks and\n\twhatnots.\n\n\t\t\tDAVIS \n\tNot anymore, not in the city.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tWe grow most of our own food. The\n\tmoney I get from social security,\n\tmy pension and my wife's work,\n\tkeeps us living on the edge. What\n\tchoice do people like us have.\n\n\t\t\tDAVIS \n\tWell, you just have to move further\n\tout.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tNow how far would further out be?\n\n\t\t\tDAVIS \n\tI'm not here to argue, sir.\n\n\t\t\tSCOTT \n\tYou guys don't make anything\n\tillegal, do you?\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tLike what may I ask?\n\n\t\t\tSCOTT \n\tYou might have a distillery pumping\n\tout barrels of moonshine.\n\nSuzie looks at Scott for a moment and goes into the kitchen.\nGideon is about to lose control. Davis heads off the\nconfrontation.\n\n\t\t\tDAVIS \n\tLook, just get rid of the chickens\n\tand you all have a nice day.\n\nGideon stands in the doorway watching the Police go down the\nsteps.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI'll be damned if I get rid of my\n\tchickens. I ought to get some hogs\n\tand put them out there.\n\nINT. FRONT ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThere is soft knocking on the door. Suzie enter frame wearing\na robe.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tWho is it?\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER (V.O.) \n\tBabe Brother.\n\nSuzie opens the door. BABE BROTHER, Gideon's youngest son,\nabout 31, handsome, wearing an expensive suit, comes in,\nbeating the cold off of him and blowing in his hands.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tI was hoping you came to the door\n\tinstead of him. It gets cold at\n\tnight.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tThis doesn't make any sense; you\n\tare going to drag that poor boy out\n\tin the cold air.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tHe will be alright.\n\nThe camera follows Babe Brother. He passes Gideon's room\nwhere Gideon is asleep, snoring loudly.\n\nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nSuzie and Babe Brother enter the bedroom where Sunny is\nsleeping. Suzie gives Babe Brother a blanket to wrap Sunny up\nin.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tThanks for taking care of him. I\n\twill try not to be so long next\n\ttime.\n\nBabe Brother gives his mother a good-night kiss. Gideon comes\nto the door.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tWhat time is it? Do you think you\n\tcan just treat us like your slave?\n\tIt's after one.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tI tried to call to let you know I\n\twas going to be late.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tThat's a lie.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tLet us settle this tomorrow.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tLook! Don't try to get ahead by\n\triding our backs.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\t\t(shouts)\n\tI pay my own way.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tSince when?\n\nHe reaches for Babe Brother but Suzie comes between them.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tTake Sunny home, please.\n\nShe pushes Babe Brother away. Babe Brother walks away,\nstaring back at his father.\n\nINT. GIDEON'S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT\n\nGideon is lying in bed. Suzie gets in beside him.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tYour feet are cold.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tGo back to sleep.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI asked you to wake me when Babe\n\tBrother comes.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tYou all act like two roosters.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI'm not going to let him get away\n\twith murder.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tYou and Babe Brother are so much\n\talike...\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tHe ain't nothing like me. How come\n\ta man has to have sons that are day\n\tand night apart? You ought to stop\n\tprotecting him.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tHush.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tYou're always taking his side.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tHush.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI'm trying to make him a man but\n\tyou keep babying him.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tYou're going to find yourself on\n\tthe floor.\n\nINT. BABE BROTHER'S BEDROOM - MORNING\n\nThe bedroom is tastefully furnished with modern art and\npaintings by Barns.\n\nBabe Brother wakes up with Sunny standing in the doorway\nlooking at him. It takes Babe Brother some time to fully wake\nup.\n\nFinally he sits reluctantly on the side of the bed and Sunny\ncomes over and sits next to him, trying to get his weary\nfather interested in his remote-control racing car.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tI want you to be the richest man in\n\tthe world so I can be the richest\n\tfather in the world.\n\n\t\t\tSUNNY \n\tI don't want to be rich. I want to\n\twork on the railroad like\n\tgrandfather.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tSon, if you are going to have a\n\tfamily, you can't always choose a\n\tjob just because you like it. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tI don't want you to shine anybody's\n\tshoes or be a porter.

She is wearing a conservatively cut business\ndress.\n\nSunny stops playing with his car and gets himself an empty\ncup. Babe Brother is about to pour him some of his coffee\nwhen Linda objects.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tNO.\n\nSunny pleads with her in silence but Linda refuses to yield.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tHe wouldn't want any if you didn't\n\ttry to keep it away from him.\n\nLinda leaves the table but stops for a moment and looks down\nat her husband.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tBecause you were spoiled, don't try\n\tto spoil Sunny.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tMy daddy never gave me anything\n\twithout my having to sweat for it.\n\tEvery summer, the way they kept me\n\tand Junior out of trouble was to\n\tsend us to Big Daddy's farm. We\n\twould get up with the chickens.\n\tEvery summer the fence had to be\n\trepaired. The barn needed a coat of\n\tpaint. We had to pip all of Big\n\tMama's hundred laying hens and go\n\tto church all day on Sunday. For\n\tBig Daddy, calluses and sweat were\n\tthe mark of a man. Sunny will never\n\thave to bust his knuckles like we\n\tdid.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI want Sunny to have an advantage\n\tthat you and I never had, but he\n\tneeds discipline, and you are not\n\thelping when I tell him to do\n\tsomething and you allow him to get\n\tout of it.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tWhat is a sip of coffee going to\n\tdo?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tCoffee is bad for anybody,\n\tespecially for a child.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tI don't see you crying about my\n\tdrinking it.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tHow old are you?\n\nEXT.

He puts the rake down\nand walks over to the garden and watches Suzie plant seeds\nfor a while.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tInstead of standing here doing\n\tnothing, I better give those\n\tchickens some scratch before they\n\tstart cackling.\n\nEXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY\n\nOLD JOHN is pushing his cart up the alley. Old John's face is\nwashed so clean that it shines. His pants are dirty and his\ncart is full of odds and ends of no value. He looks to be\nabout seventy and fit. Old John throws a sack on Gideon's\nfence.\n\nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY\n\nSuzie,is bent over a plant that she is tying to a stick.

I brought you some\n\tmore rabbit manure for your roses.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tIt is so considerate of you.\n\nGideon sticks his head over the fence.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tWell, well, look who is taking up\n\tall the sunshine. Brother John, how\n\tare you doing?\n\n\t\t\tOLD JOHN \n\tI'm still here.\n\nSuzie leaves the two men talking.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tTell me something. How do you get\n\tenergy to stay on the move all day?\n\n\t\t\tOLD JOHN \n\tYou couldn't sit on your rump under\n\tmy daddy's roof. No sir. If you\n\tcouldn't outwork his mule, you\n\twasn't worth the salt you put in\n\tgreens. You had to wake up looking\n\tfor something to do. I was raised\n\tas a mule and now I'm a rolling\n\tstone.\n\nSuzie sticks her head over the fence and hands a bag of red\ntomatoes to Old John.\n\n\t\t\tOLD JOHN (CONT'D)\n\tI didn't mean for you to pay me for\n\tthat.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tI know you didn't but you have been\n\tso thoughtful.\n\n\t\t\tOLD JOHN \n\tBut when your sunflowers come up,\n\tI'll pay you for them.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tI planted a row just for you and\n\tyou don't owe me anything.\n\nEXT.

You can see the\n\ttop of the head.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tIt hurts.

They were way down in the\n\tbasement 'cause they figured no one\n\twould hear them. One of the\n\tpreachers said, it makes me feel\n\ttoo shame to tell how bad I have\n\tbeen. You know them young gals that\n\tsit up in the first row. I can look\n\tat them and forget my text. I'm\n\tjust lost when it comes to women,\n\teven them middle age sisters. Then\n\tanother preacher said, I don't\n\tthink I can tell you what my sin is\n\t'cause it's bad. Another preacher\n\tsaid, Brother, we all amongst\n\tfriends. Tell us what's troubling\n\tyour soul. Clear your conscience.\n\nGideon takes a sip of water.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON (CONT'D)\n\tSo the preacher said, we all got a\n\tbond 'cause we confessed to one\n\tanother. So let me tell you, my sin\n\tis corn liquor. I just acts a fool\n\tbehind that spirit water. I loves\n\tit more than preaching. Now ain't\n\tthat a sin, lord. So all the\n\tpreachers went on confessing, each\n\tone worst than the last. Finally\n\tthey came to the last preacher who\n\thad been very quiet and listening\n\tto every word that fell. One of the\n\tpreachers said to him, it's your\n\tturn. Confessing will lift you\n\tburden, Brother. Bare us your soul.\n\tWe did. The last preacher said, no,\n\tmy sin is the worst among all of\n\tyou. One of the preachers said, ah\n\tgo on man and stop all this\n\tsuspense. So the last preacher\n\tsaid, like I told you my sin is the\n\tlowest. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tMy sin is gossiping and I can't\n\twait to get out and tell what I\n\theard.\n\nSunny does not get the humor of the story. He is more\ninterested in picking up his marbles that Gideon's foot\nkicked over.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tYou oughtn't tell him stories like\n\tthat.\n\n\t\t\tSUNNY \n\tTell me another story.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI'll you a story about the terrapin\n\tand the rabbit. No, you tell me a\n\tstory. Come on.\n\n\t\t\tSUNNY \n\tOnce upon a time, my mommy and\n\tdaddy lived in this big house that\n\tI bought for them. I got them this\n\tbig car.\n\nA strong wind causes the broom handle to knock against the\nchina teapot, KNOCKING IT TO THE FLOOR. Suzie stops Sunny\nfrom trying to help pick up the pieces.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tYou stay back. You might cut your\n\tfingers.\n\nSuzie looks down sadly at her broken tea pot.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI looked everywhere for my toby.\n\nEXT. APPLE ORCHARD - DAY\n\nThe trees are barren, which gives them an unfriendly look. As\nwe LOOK at the ground, a man's distorted shadow stops in the\nframe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY\n\nA shadow of a man appears on Gideon's porch. The camera tilts\nup to HARRY MENTION, a very dark-looking, ageless old man\ncarrying several boxes held together by a cord. He looks\nexhausted from his journey. He looks in his address book and,\nsatisfied that he reached the right house, he rings the\ndoorbell.\n\nINT. FRONT ROOM - DAY\n\nSuzie comes to the front door; she recognizes Harry right\naway. She invites him in. Harry stumps his feet on the porch\nseveral times and then enters.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tHarry, I can't believe it is you.\n\tGideon, look who is here.\n\nGideon comes in, wiping his hands. Sunny, carrying the broom,\nfollows behind.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tHarry, good God Almighty, man! It's\n\tbeen, what, thirty years or more.\n\tSuzie, we haven't seen Harry since\n\twe left home.\n\nHarry is more interested in the boy, but Sunny doesn't want\nto come near Harry. It is Gideon's arm that is keeping him\nwithin close range of Harry.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON (CONT'D)\n\tThis is my grandson, Sunny. He is\n\tmy youngest son's child.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tHe kind of favors one of my boys\n\twhen he was about his age.\n\nSunny, playing with the broom, accidentally touches Harry's\nshoe with it. Harry hides his anger about being touched with\nthe broom. Harry takes the broom from Sunny and spits on the\nbottom of it.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n\tBoy, that is bad luck to touch a\n\tfellow with a broom.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tHe knows better. Sunny, apologize\n\tto Harry.\n\n\t\t\tSUNNY \n\tI'm sorry.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tWhat are you doing in these parts?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tI came all the way from Detroit by\n\tbus going to Oakland. The bus\n\tstopped in Los Angeles. I had to\n\tget off and take a rest. I'll catch\n\tthe last bus leaving at midnight.\n\tI'm just too tired to go on.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tWhy didn't you catch a plane?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tMy feet have never been on anything\n\tthat wasn't directly attached to\n\tthe ground.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tStay until you feel better? I would\n\tlike to hear all the news.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tI'm worn out but won't you feel\n\tlike you are taking in a stranger?\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tStranger my foot, it was my\n\tgrandmother who helped you into\n\tthis world.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tWell, I don't want to put you out.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tMan, put your boxes down and stay\n\tas long as you like. We have empty\n\trooms since the boys got their own\n\tfamilies and moved out.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tWell if you're sure, I won't be a\n\tbother. Oh, I don't sleep on no\n\tspring mattress. I always make\n\tmyself a pallet on the floor.\n\nINT. BEDROOM - DAY\n\nThe bedroom door to Harry's room is cracked open. Peering\nthrough the cracked door, we SEE Harry asleep on his pallet.\nHis back is turned to the camera. It is dead silent. There\ndoes not seem to be any sign of life. On the floor is a plate\nthat has water in it. It looks like it is for a dog.\n\nINT. KITCHEN - DAY\n\nSuzie is peeling potatoes and Gideon is ironing.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tPoor old Harry, he really must have\n\tbeen worn out. He has been asleep\n\tall day.\n\nWithout anyone being aware, Harry has been standing in the\ndoorway for some time.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tGood evening. It must be all the\n\tdifferent time zones I crossed that\n\tmakes me feel this weary.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tYou should go back and rest.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tNo, if I rest any longer, I won't\n\tsleep tonight. May I use your\n\tbathroom to wash up a bit?\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tMan, act like this is your home.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tThat's awful generous of you. I\n\talways ask to keep from wearing out\n\twelcome.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tOne can tell you are from back\n\thome. These people nowadays don't\n\tknow what manners are.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tWhere we come from, you had to know\n\thow to act right. You had to know\n\thow to say yes sir and no sir. You\n\thad to know your place.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tYou had to tread softly.\n\nThe doorbell rings and Gideon goes to answer it.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tThose days you could always find\n\tsomething redeeming about even the\n\tworst person.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tYou remember that boy who lost his\n\tmind, Joe? You could hear him\n\tpitching horseshoes at night in the\n\tdark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make\n\thim mad and call yourself running\n\tin the house to be safe. He would\n\tpick up a brick and say \"go on in\n\tthere brick and hit somebody\" and\n\tit would find its mark.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tI was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom\n\tbecause of him.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tAll those places that us coloreds\n\tlived, that we used to call\n\tBottoms, have all been changed to\n\tDrives and Heights. Everything is\n\tin what you call it, not in what it\n\tis.\n\nGideon comes back with Junior, Pal and Rhonda.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tHarry, I would like for you to meet\n\tmy oldest son, his wife and\n\tdaughter.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR \n\tPleased to meet you. So you're from\n\tback home, too.\n\nHarry and Junior shake hands, but Rhonda gives Harry only a\nnod of her head and a smile.\n\nPat, who is pregnant, attempts to shake hands with Harry, but\nis forced to withdraw her hand because of a sudden pain in\nher stomach.\n\n\t\t\tPAT \n\tThis boy must be turning over. Oh,\n\the just kicked me again.\n\nJunior feels her stomach. Pat again tries to shake Harry's\nhand and again gets a jolt from her stomach. She finds a\nchair to sit down in.\n\nThe SOUND of rocks hitting the roof causes everyone to look\nup.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tIt's the boy next door throwing at\n\this birds. I'm just waiting on him\n\tto hit a pane in the window\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tI'm going to wash up now. You all\n\tplease excuse me.\n\nINT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY\n\nHarry is wiping off his face with a washcloth. He stares at\nhimself in the mirror for a long time. The sudden sound of\nthe boy next door starting to play his trumpet startles him.\nHe smiles at the trumpeter's efforts.\n\nHe wrings the wash cloth out. A reddish oil-like liquid DRIPS\ninto the face bowl.\n\nEXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING\n\nA few of the houses have lights on. Suddenly, Gideon's\nrooster starts to CROW. A dog starts to bark and a garbage\ncan is knocked over. Bedroom lights in almost all the houses\nin the neighborhood pop on. The voices of neighbors\ncomplaining are heard.\n\nINT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\nHarry is just waking up. He listens to the voices of Suzie\nand Gideon as they get ready for church.\n\nINT. FRONT ROOM - MORNING\n\nGideon is paging through the Bible as he stands by the door,\nwaiting for Suzie who is watering her plants. Harry comes in.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tGood morning.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tYou ought to come hear our\n\tpreacher. Remember old Cat Iron?\n\tWell, our preacher is just as\n\tstrong.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tNext time when I feel a little\n\tbetter perhaps.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI was going to get up and get a hen\n\tout there for dinner, but time got\n\taway.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tOh, I would feel much at home if\n\tyou let me get one for you. I\n\thaven't wrung a chicken's neck in a\n\tmonth of Sundays. You know, folks\n\twould call my daddy to kill their\n\thogs. That used to be my trade from\n\ttime to time.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tWell, I would appreciate that.\n\nEXT. HOUSE - DAY\n\nGideon and Suzie are stepping off the porch. Harry is\nstanding behind the screen door.\n\nGideon and Suzie get in Junior's car. Junior, Pat and Rhonda\nwave to Harry as the car pulls away.\n\nINT. LIVING HOUSE - DAY\n\nIT IS A TRACKING SHOT, FOLLOWING HARRY THROUGH THE HOUSE.\n\nHarry looks through Gideon's and Suzie's private things. He\nlooks at the baby pictures that fill the mirror. He reads\nSuzie's letters that are dated years ago. In one of the\nletters, he finds a picture of a man standing behind a\nplough. \"Uncle Joe after Ella's death\" is written on the\nback. A picture of a mule holds his interest. He looks at it\nfor a long time and carries it with him as he continues his\nsearch.\n\nEXT. BACKYARD - DAY\n\nHarry slowly walks along the rows in Suzie's garden. He\nstands by the chicken cage. Suddenly, the chickens start to\nrun about and CACKLE as if a dog had gotten in.\n\nHarry turns from the chicken coop. He stands still. Sunny is\nhiding behind a bush.\n\nSunny steps around the bush. Harry looks at Sunny with such\nconcentration that Sunny takes a step backward as if getting\nready to defend himself.\n\nMRS. BAKER, a black woman in her early thirties, comes out on\nthe back porch. She shakes out a rug. She stops shaking the\nrug and stares at Harry.\n\nHarry becomes aware of Mrs. Baker's stare. He comes to\nhimself and smiles at her.\n\nINT. GIDEON'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\nHarry and Babe Brother are playing cards while Linda watches\nand Sunny plays by himself on the floor. In the sink is a\nnewspaper full of bloody feathers. A small flame is under a\npot on the stove. Harry looks at the chicken in the pot and\nsits back down.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tYou don't act like the rest of\n\tGideon's friends. They believe if\n\tyou are not hard at work, you are\n\thard at sin.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tOh, I'm more modern in my ways. I\n\tdon't believe in sin, though there\n\tis good and evil. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tAnd evil is a thing you work at.\n\nHarry takes his knife, a crab apple switch, out. It has a\nrabbit foot attached to it. Harry cleans his fingernail with\nthe knife. Sunny is interested in the rabbit foot. He reaches\nfor the knife.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n\tNot you mustn't touch. Your mama\n\tmight not like you handling knives.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI think he wants to see your rabbit\n\tfoot.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tI let this rabbit foot do in place\n\tof my toby that I lost years ago.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tWhat's a toby?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tYou don't want to be at crossroads\n\twithout one. It's a charm that old\n\tpeople teach you how to make. I had\n\tone for a long time that belonged\n\tto my grandmother who had it ever\n\tsince she was a child. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tIn my travels I misplaced it. I\n\thave been looking over my shoulder\n\tever since.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI thought you weren't old\n\tfashioned.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tIn some things. When we were\n\tchildren, there used to be an old\n\tman that came around and would\n\tsnatch your soul if you didn't have\n\tsomething on you that didn't make a\n\tX.\n\nHarry is aware that Babe Brother is interested in the knife.\nAfter cleaning his last fingernail, he hands the knife to\nBabe Brother.\n\nHarry looks at the cards in his hand. He smiles to himself.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tDid you have your child at home?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tNo. No. No. No. I had my Child at\n\tCedars and Sinai. And that ain't no\n\tcounty hospital. You have to have\n\tcash or check before you come in\n\tthe door.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tSome folks take that natural stuff\n\ttoo far.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tJunior's wife kept her afterbirth'\n\tin the refrigerator. That's why I\n\tdo not eat over there now.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tCountry people got so many strange\n\tways,\n\nHarry looks again at the chicken that he is boiling.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tDid you ever have to use this\n\tthing?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tThat is called a crab apple switch.\n\tIt's for those bad acting monkeys\n\tand just the thing for a mean dog.\n\tNow I don't know if I actually did\n\twhat I did or got my life and story\n\tmixed in with other folk's stories\n\tbut I seem to recall that I had to\n\tuse my crab apple on a boy from\n\tback home. I was up in Memphis\n\tworking on the railroad, like your\n\tdaddy who had an easy job. He would\n\tsing a song that had a cadence and\n\twe would lay track. Anyway I was\n\tcoming down Beale Street and I\n\theard this music coming from a\n\tsaloon. Sure enough it was Emory.\n\tMy daddy taught both of us to play\n\tbut Emory was natural at it. Got in\n\ta blues band and what not. He and\n\tanother boy had killed a boy named\n\tHocker sometime back and they\n\tballed the Jack leaving town. Emory\n\thad lost one eye and had a scar\n\trunning down his face. Bad luck I\n\twould say. He got to drinking that\n\tcorn liquor. We went to his girl's\n\troom and he wouldn't stop drinking.\n\tHe started talking about the old\n\tdays and he went mad. He pulled his\n\tknife and I got to mine first. The\n\tlights went out.\n\nLinda picks up a card and looks at it. There is a naked woman\non the back.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER\n\tDon't pick up the cards if you are\n\tnot in the game. Did he die?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tI don't know what happened to him.\n\tHe just ran out into the streets. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tI got some old records I want you\n\tto hear. I like the blues sung\n\tsimply, man and a guitar. Or sung\n\tby a woman who had bad luck all her\n\tlife. Don't ever let anyone tell\n\tyou his life's story if it is of a\n\tweary life full of sadness. When I\n\twas a boy, a man told me a story of\n\thow he lost all of his sons and\n\tI'll be damned if the same thing\n\tdidn't happen to me.\n\nSunny is busy playing in the curtains.\n\nThe SOUND of Gideon and Suzie arriving makes them scurry to\nget the cards put away. Harry puts his knife away just as\nSuzie and Gideon enter. Linda feels a little embarrassed.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tHow was church?\n\nGideon and Suzie are surprised to see Linda. They don't know\nwhat to say.\n\nEXT. MRS. BAKER'S BACKYARD - DAY\n\nRodney walks around in the yard BLOWING his trumpet as loud\nas he can. The SOUND of the trumpet frightens Skip's birds.\n\nINT. BATHROOM - DAY\n\nGideon is repairing the pipes under the face bowl. Harry is\nleaning against the door.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tHow often is your wife called to\n\thelp delivery?\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tIt was slow. Now it seems like\n\teveryone is having births at home.\n\nGideon takes the pipe off. It has rotted. Gideon cannot\nbelieve it.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON (CONT'D)\n\tWhat could have caused this? I just\n\tchanged this damn thing.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tEverything these days is made\n\toverseas.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tYou and Babe Brother hit it off so\n\twell.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tCourse, it is your business, but I\n\tfeel obliged to tell you that maybe\n\tyou have not been fair with the\n\tboy.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tI tried to teach him right from\n\twrong just like I did his Junior.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tEveryone has to follow his own\n\tplough. A man doesn't have to know\n\thow to cut a wick and clean a\n\tchimney nowadays. City people don't\n\tgive a hoot and a holler about the\n\tshape of the moon nowadays. You\n\tdon't plant old ways...\n\t\t(beat)\n\t... but, at the end, you find\n\tyourself doing what your father did\n\tbut you have to have the land in\n\tyou.\n\t\t(beat)\n\tIt's when you want to give the\n\thouse or farm to the kids and they\n\tdon't want it. You sell it to a\n\tstranger. You worked your whole\n\tlife, for what?\n\t\t(beat)\n\tI doubt if people nowadays have\n\tknowledge of a victory garden or\n\tseen an inch worm. All what we've\n\texperienced has no meaning.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tYou're suppose to teach your\n\tchildren what you know. Junior, I\n\tdon't have to worry about. Babe\n\tBrother is a different story.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tYou still call him boy. You call\n\tBabe Brother boy in front of his\n\twife and son.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tMy daddy called me boy up to the\n\ttime he died. I was always boy to\n\thim.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\t'Course, you could be right. Your\n\tsons are alive. All my sons are\n\tdead.\n\nOff-screen, Rodney starts to practice on his HORN.\n\nINT. BABE BROTHER'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING\n\nBabe Brother is sitting with Sunny by the screen door blowing\ngiant bubbles. The bubbles drift past Linda, who is sitting\nat the table with real estate papers all over the table. She\nis talking on the phone with a client and signals them to\nstop disturbing her.\n\nBabe Brother sends more bubbles floating by, causing her to\nshake the water off her papers while she talks to a first\ntime buyer.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tIt has three bedrooms, one and a\n\thalf baths. Well, yes, that means\n\ttwo toilets and one bath. Well...\n\tYes, by appointment... Call me back\n\tif you decide.\n\nShe hangs up the phone.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tYou would think people never lived\n\tin a house if they have to ask what\n\tdoes 1 1/2 baths mean.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tWill you still get the money from\n\tyour father?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI told him we might not need it, if\n\tyou can talk your parents into\n\tgiving you your share of the\n\tproperty.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tPops put Big Daddy's farm in\n\tRhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed\n\tit so no one can borrow on it.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tWe could borrow on that land and\n\tput the money to work.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tI preached to Mom and Dad about it\n\tbut they are stuck in their ways,\n\tit's like talking to a brick. But\n\tif there is a way...\n\nBabe Brother is lost in his thoughts. He stares down at his\nhands resting on his knees. He picks up the telephone.\n\nINT. JUNIOR'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nJunior is on the phone with Babe Brother. Pat crosses in\nfront of the camera shaking her head in a negative manner.\nBabe Brother's voice is just audible.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR \n\tYou want me to mortgage my house to\n\tinvest in a scheme of yours? You\n\tknow the last time we went into\n\tsomething together Daddy had to go\n\tin his savings to keep us from\n\tending on the street.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER (O.S.) \n\tWhy are you always afraid to get\n\tsomewhere?\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR \n\tThis is not a good time to take\n\tchances. Your best friend, Robert,\n\tan accountant, lost his home and is\n\tout on the street. We see him from\n\ttime to time. He comes down to\n\tchurch for a free meal.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER (O.S.) \n\tThis is what it is all about,\n\ttrying to keep from being out on\n\tthe street.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR \n\tRobert asks about you. When are you\n\tgoing to do something to help him?\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER (O.S.) \n\tMaybe I can get down there next\n\tweek.\n\nJunior turns to his wife, who is off-camera.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR \n\tBabe Brother always acts like a\n\tgambler who is in the biggest game\n\tof his life and don't know about\n\tplaying cards.\n\nEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON\n\nHarry and Gideon are walking along a railroad track. The sun\nis blinding. The heat makes the asphalt Appear to turn into a\nlake off in the distance. Gideon appears exhausted; beads of\nsweat continually form on his forehead. He fans himself with\nhis hat. Harry is unaffected by the hot temperature.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tI can sit here and look at train\n\ttracks all day. We laid enough of\n\tthem, didn't we? So many memories\n\tare stretched along tracks like\n\tthese.\n\nGideon looks down the tracks. A bowl of dust stirs off in the\ndistance. The hot temperature makes the tracks appear liquid.\n\nEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON (EFFECT)\n\nThe tracks begin to twist and bend. Off in the distance,\nfaint images of men laying track to a song.\n\nEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - HOT AFTERNOON\n\nGideon is standing with his hat in his hand. His posture is\nthat of an extremely old man.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tIn weather like this, you cannot\n\twalk around bare-headed.\n\nHe wipes the sweat from his hat band.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tWe'll go a little farther. The walk\n\twill do us some good.\n\nINT. KITCHEN - DAY\n\nSuzie is peeling apples while Sunny, standing next to her,\ncatches peelings in his mouth. Pat is sitting next to the\nwindow. She is uncomfortable. She loosens her pants, giving\nher stomach more room. Rhonda is leaning over the back of the\nchair with her arms around Pat's neck. They are in\nsilhouette.\n\n\t\t\tPAT \n\tDid you do your homework?\n\n\t\t\tRHONDA \n\tYes.\n\t\t(beat)\n\tMama?\n\n\t\t\tPAT \n\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tRHONDA \n\tCan I name the baby?\n\nINT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\nSuzie knocks on the door. Harry comes to the door still\nbuttoning his shirt.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tI have someone I want you to meet.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tI'll be right there.\n\nINT. FRONT ROOM - DAY\n\nGideon in the background in the kitchen washing off the\nvegetables. Suzie and HATTIE are sitting at the table. Harry\ncomes in and is surprised to see Hat tie. Hattie is in her\nlate sixties but looks well. She makes a conscious effort to\ndress plainly.\n\n\t\t\tHATTIE \n\tI couldn't believe it when Suzie\n\tcalled and said you were staying\n\there. How have you been?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tGirl, do you still sing and dance?\n\n\t\t\tHATTIE \n\tNo, I'm a different person now,\n\tHarry.\n\nHattie has a nervous condition that causes her to squint from\ntime to time.

I see you are still a pile of\n\twet chicken feathers.\n\n\t\t\tHERMAN \n\tOh Lord.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tMy sister, women can get away with\n\tso much. I don't have any enemies\n\t'cause I don't live in the past. As\n\tPushkin, you don't know him, said,\n\t\"In the hope of glory and good, I\n\tlook without fear ahead.\"\n\n\t\t\tM.C. \n\tHarry has got your number.\n\n\t\t\tHATTIE \n\tAn empty wagon makes a lot of noise\n\tand you, tappy head, you ain't\n\tworth the salt you put in greens.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tSpeaking of tappy heads, we ought\n\tto have an old fashion fish fry.\n\n\t\t\tHERMAN \n\tI don't have too many fish fries\n\tleft.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tWe can have it here next week.\n\n\t\t\tHATTIE \n\tIs this your house?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tOh.

Have you ever heard\n\tof a man jumping in the river to\n\tsave five hundred drowning people?\n\tNo you ain't.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tYou have to take just one and\n\tfatten him up. When you spread help\n\ttoo thin, you , you just nickel and\n\tdime the situation. If you try to\n\tsave all, all die but if you save\n\tone life, life goes on. You just\n\thave to remember, medicine that\n\tworks leaves a bitter taste.\n\nHarry looks at the baby picture pasted over the mirror. He\ntakes the picture of his children from his old black dusty\nwallet and compares the faces of his kids with those on the\nmirror. He talks to himself more than to Pat.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n\tYou just take one; you thaw out the\n\tcold and hunger in his bones from\n\tsleeping on the bare ground.\n\nPat watches him and loses herself in what he is doing.

Don't take\n\tme wrong but you can't judge people\n\tby how you act. You're a caring\n\tperson.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR \n\tHe should be caring. That is not\n\ttoo much to ask.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tYa, but you can't do the shuffle\n\twith one leg. You and your wife, in\n\tyour spare time, work with the less\n\tfortunate. Now I'm not talking\n\tabout you and what you do but some\n\tfolks that always run to help the\n\tvictim, deep down are attracted to\n\tpain and suffering and love to be\n\tnear the dying.\n\n\t\t\tJUNIOR \n\tAll the people working with us are\n\treally doing it 'cause they hate to\n\tsee suffering.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tYou never know what's in the heart\n\tand just because you can cry\n\tdoesn't make you human.\n\nINT.

BALDWIN HILLS LAKE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nGideon is sitting on a rock by the lake. His image is\nreflected in the lake. He is asleep. Sunny is putting new\nbait on one of the reels and with a whip of the pole, he\ncasts to the center of the lake. He leans against a tree.\nSunny looks at his sleeping grandfather. Gideon has his pant\nlegs rolled up. His socks have lost their elastic. His head\nis resting on his chest.\n\nSunny goes near the water.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tBe careful of the water.\n\nSunny looks back at his grandfather, who appears to be\nasleep.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nThere is one fish in the bucket.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

Linda looks as though she is about to fall asleep\nstanding up. She awakes and looks at Harry. There is dislike\nin her stare. Suzie and Gideon notice Linda fading away.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tAre you feeling well?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI've never been so tired in my\n\tlife. Where is Sunny?\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tHe is getting his things together.\n\tBabe Brother, you ought to take\n\tyour wife home so she can get some\n\trest.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tIn a minute.\n\nSunny comes in carrying his night-clothes folded neatly. He\nstands next to Linda. Harry, in a mild but demanding way,\nushers Babe Brother out of the door.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tTake your wife and child home, boy.\n\nBabe Brother seems all too happy to obey Harry. After Harry\ncloses the door behind Babe Brother, he turns with a wide\nsmile.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n\tI got a surprise for you tonight.\n\nHarry flops down on the couch and kicks his shoes off.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n\tThis old buffalo has been in the\n\tsun too long.\n\nINT.

The Twins and Howard are the center\nof attention.\n\nOkra comes over and whispers into Harry's ear. Okra leaves\nthrough the front door. Okra comes back in with a bag. Harry,\nBabe Brother, M.C. and Herman follow Okra to the kitchen.\n\nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nOkra sets the bag on the table and steps back to allow Harry\nto unveil the bottle of corn liquor.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER\n\tWhat is that?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tBoy, that is the real South.

If you\n\thad any good times in your life,\n\tyou remember Hattie. She use to\n\tkeep those juke joints steaming. If\n\tMa Rainey and Bessie Smith were the\n\tstars, she was the sun. Let's get\n\tHattie to sing something from the\n\told days.\n\nHattie has started her nervous twitch again. She is so mad\nthat she bites her lip to keep from exploding.\n\n\t\t\tHATTIE \n\tHarry always tries to be the king\n\tfish.

Marsh tries to get Harry's\nattention.\n\n\t\t\tMARSH \n\tHarry, you will not remember me but\n\twe go back quite a ways.

The drink spills on him. She turns\nand walks away. He follows her.\n\nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nMarsh sits in a chair opposite Harry. Babe Brother stands\nbehind Harry. Harry, knowing that Marsh is going to bring up\nunpleasant things of the past, feels the need to get rid of\nBabe Brother.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tSon, you haven't danced with your\n\twife all night.\n\nBabe Brother is reluctant to leave, but Harry gives him a\nnudge. He goes looking for Linda.\n\n\t\t\tMARSH \n\tThere is something that I always\n\twanted to know.

You never take the boy to\n\tthe park, circus or anything. If we\n\tdid not take him to church, he\n\twouldn't have any sense of\n\treligion.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI think forcing him to go to church\n\twhen he really doesn't understand\n\tis not saving his soul. When he\n\tgets old enough to make up his own\n\tmind about religion, that will be\n\tbetter. It will be his intellectual\n\tdecision.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tIs that the way your parents raised\n\tyou?\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tWhy, you don't want us to bring him\n\tover?\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tNo, it's that when do you have time\n\tto be parents to him? You guys\n\tdon't pick him up until nine, ten\n\tat night. You are into yourselves,\n\tas the saying goes. Spend some time\n\ttrying to be parents. Take him to\n\tthe mountains, fishing. You ought\n\tto let him get to know nature.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tWell, you are his grandfather. He\n\tis supposed to spend some time with\n\tyou.

If you really\n\tcare about me, just tell me how I\n\tcan make money.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tBabe Brother, I'm going to take my\n\thand and hit you across your mouth.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tHe doesn't mean what he says.\n\n\t\t\tGIDEON \n\tLet us go back in before the night\n\tof celebration becomes a night of\n\tme killing my son.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tNo. Before anyone moves, you two\n\tshake hands and don't carry it any\n\tfurther.\n\nLinda gives Babe Brother a jab with her elbow.

It\nhas become a kind of controlled anger.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tI think if anybody had a hand in\n\tkilling Hocker, you ought to ask or\n\tyou should have asked Emory and\n\tChick.\n\n\t\t\tMARSH \n\tChick was outright killed by a mob.\n\tHe killed a white man that owed him\n\tsome money and when they caught up\n\twith him, they tied him behind a\n\tcar and dragged him from out of the\n\thills back to town.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tThose boys never did have good\n\tluck.\n\n\t\t\tMARSH \n\tYou damn right they didn't,\n\tespecially Emory, my cousin.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tEmory had made a lot of enemies.

Herman flops\ndown in the empty chair and starts to COUGH.\n\nSuddenly Suzie and Gideon burst into the kitchen holding up\none of the twins, Loviray. They carry the twin towards\nHerman's seat.

Finally, they are able to seat the twin.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n\tWhat's the problem here?\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tShe has a fish bone caught in her\n\tthroat. Could all of you go in the\n\tother room? Gideon, get some bread\n\tand toast it quickly and find me\n\tthe cod liver oil.\n\nThe twin is holding her throat and PANTING like a fish out of\nwater. She is in a lot of pain.

She opens the window and pulls back the\ncover. The cold air makes him draw up. On walking out, Linda\nsays in a rather hurt voice:\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tRemember, you promised to take\n\tSunny to Magic Mountain today.\n\nBabe Brother slowly gets up holding his chest as if his heart\nis bothering him.\n\nINT.

How is Gideon today?\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tHe wasn't able to get out of bed\n\ttoday.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tI hope that it's nothing serious.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tHe has never gotten rid of the\n\tmalaria.

BACKYARD - EVENING\n\nThe pigeons take to the air like an explosion. The chickens\nstart to CACKLE and run about as Harry reaches for one with\nhis cane. The SOUND of the boy next door practicing with his\ntrumpet adds to the bedlam.\n\nSuzie is standing on the steps, shouting to Harry. The noise\nof the panicked chickens and the boy playing the trumpet next\ndoor drown out Suzie's voice. Not getting Harry's attention,\nshe hurries down the steps.\n\nHarry has caught a hen that is SCREAMING her head off. He\nlooks around and finds Suzie hurrying towards him.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tCan you watch Gideon for a while?\n\tOne of the girls is going into\n\tlabor.

BACKYARD - DAY\n\nHarry, Okra and Herman are trying to catch another chicken.\nHerman is COUGHING badly and Okra is out of breath.\n\n\t\t\tOKRA \n\tYou think old Gideon is going to\n\tlive to see this month out?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tWhen I came upon the valley of\n\tbones, the serpent said, \"Make this\n\tyour home. Dry as my soul be,\n\theaven is lost to thee.\" We all got\n\tto make way.\n\nHarry puts the rooster face to the ground and draws a\nstraight line.

Harry is poised over the chicken\nwith the ax, appreciating the moment. Harry raises the ax.\nThe SOUND of Rodney starting to practice his trumpet brings\nthe rooster out of the trance.\n\nBefore Harry can react, the rooster jumps away.\n\n\t\t\tOKRA \n\tHerman, you will have to catch the\n\tnext one 'cause I'm out of breath.\n\n\t\t\tHERMAN \n\tIf I have to chase after one, we\n\twon't eat.\n\nA sack drops over the fence.

I have\n\talways been wild and you know that.\n\tIf you are made to feel half a man,\n\twhat do you think the other half\n\tis?\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tI'm glad you brought that up as to\n\twho you are. I have to know who is\n\tin my house.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tYou invited me.\n\n\t\t\tSUZIE \n\tOnly if you are a good man, a\n\tfriend. Are you a friend?\n\nHarry takes his time in looking for an answer.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tLike that boy next door playing\n\tthat his horn.

I'll come back to get my\n\tthings. Well, I hope Gideon\n\trecovers. You know I have an extra\n\tpicture of one of my sons that I\n\twould like for you to put with\n\tthose baby pictures over your\n\tdresser. It's better than being in\n\tmy dusty wallet with addresses and\n\tnames of people who are no longer\n\ton this earth.\n\nSuzie takes the picture. She seems as if she has doubts about\nhaving asked Harry to leave.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n\tI'll say my so-longs to Gideon\n\tbefore I leave and I truly wish\n\tthat he will get well.\n\nSuzie continues to look at the picture.\n\nINT.

They didn't pay me.\n\nHarry picks up an old cigar box that falls opens. Dice,\nshotgun shells, some spent .38 slugs and an old rusty knife,\na crab apple switch, land on the floor. Harry picks up the\nknife.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tWhose old piece of knife is this?\n\n\t\t\tHERMAN \n\tThat was my brother's knife.\n\nHarry gives the knife to Babe Brother and signals him to put\nit in his pocket.\n\nThe SOUND of the thunder has an unreal violence to it.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tI don't want to wear out welcome,\n\tbut you can stay in someone's heart\n\tlonger than you can stay in their\n\thouse. Come with us, boy. We are\n\tgoing to have a good time.\n\n\t\t\tBABE BROTHER \n\tThis would be a bad time for me to\n\tleave.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tWe are going where the action is.\n\tAin't that right, Okra?\n\t\t(then back to Babe\n\t\tBrother)\n\tLet's play for a couple of bucks\n\tunless you want to start off with\n\ttwo bits and work our way up.\n\t\t(beat)\n\tWhat would you give to be rich?\n\nBabe Brother humps his shoulder.

Linda and I had it all\n\tworked out.\n\nHarry wins the first hand.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tI know your mind is on your wife\n\tbut you should never treat a woman\n\tas an equal.

M.C. and Okra are still packing\nwhile Herman is eating Argo Starch.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n\tDouble the stakes?\n\nBabe Brother agrees but his thoughts are obviously somewhere\nelse. Harry studies his hand and looks at Babe Brother; he\nputs down his hand. Babe Brother wins and is quite pleased.\nThe next series of hands are won by Babe Brother.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n\tM.C., you ever heard of a real man\n\thaving one woman?\n\n\t\t\tM.C. \n\tNo, lord!\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tWhen one woman puts you out, you\n\thave another to take you in. You\n\tdon't drive around without a spare\n\ttire, do you? The more mules you\n\thave hitched, the easier it is to\n\tplough.\n\nHarry loses another hand and Babe Brother suddenly has a pile\nof money.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY \n\tHerman, let me borrow a few bucks.\n\nHerman stand over him with a roll of bills and peels off\nseveral.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY (CONT'D)\n\tBless you.

I got to get my things from\n\tyour mother's house.\n\nBabe Brother hurries out. M.C., Herman and Okra flop down in\nchairs and on the bed and look at their watches.\n\nHarry sits at the table tapping out a rhythm on the table and\nWHISTLING very softly to himself. Suddenly Harry sees that\nBabe Brother left the pile of money on the table. A look of\nconcern comes over his face.\n\nEXT. GIDEON'S HOUSE - NIGHT (RAIN)\n\nIt is raining hard.
