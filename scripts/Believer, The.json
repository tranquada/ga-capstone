He hears\n          a RUMBLING, looks up at an ELEVATED TRAIN entering a station.\n          He runs up the steps toward the SHRIEKING train....\n<b>          \n</b><b>          INT. 7 TRAIN -- 1998 -- DAY\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          TITLE: 13 YEARS LATER\n</b><b>          \n</b>          The train passes above used car lots, discount furniture\n          stores, residential side streets...finally pulls into a\n          station. The doors open. People file on, the CAMERA letting\n          them go by until it spots a tall, thin COLLEGE STUDENT in a\n          YARMULKE. Danny grown up?\n<b>          \n</b>          PAN with him as he sits, opens an organic chemistry text. The\n          doors close. The train starts up, but the Jewish boy hardly\n          notices; he is already reading. He sways with the motion of\n          the car, half-hidden by other passengers. We realize he is\n          being watched.\n<b>          \n</b>          REVERSE ANGLE: another YOUNG MAN, standing -- a \"SUEDE-HEAD\"\n          (his hair cut so short it's like a fine fabric).\n<b>          \n</b>          SUEDE-HEAD'S POV: THE JEWISH BOY pushes his glasses back up\n          his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the\n          handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left\n          the page. Suede-head steps between passengers and stands\n          directly over the Jewish boy. He looks down at the yarmulke\n          pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at the oversized shirt\n          collar, scrawny neck, prominent Adam's apple, pimples,\n          dandruff, ingrown facial hair...\n<b>          \n</b>          He steps closer, crowding the boy's knees. The boy shifts a\n          little without looking up. Subtly but relentlessly, Suede-\n          head pursues him along the bench until, unable to slide\n          farther, the boy flattens his legs against the seat. Suede-\n          head presses into the boy's knees.\n<b>          \n</b>          The boy accidentally bumps a BUSINESSMAN to Suede-head's\n          left. The man (late 30s, Wall Street Journal, African-\n          American) looks from the boy to Suede-head and understands\n          at once what is going on.\n<b>          \n</b>          Suede-head stares right back -- and the BUSINESSMAN returns\n          to his paper.

And\n          the boy not only never stops reading the chemistry text, he\n          keeps highlighting relevant passages.\n<b>          \n</b>          The train slows. The boy closes the book, caps the\n          highlighter, gathers his things and manages to stand up,\n          wriggling awkwardly around Suede-head.

They no longer need\n                    Judaism because they have soil. The\n                    real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He\n                    has no roots, no attachments. So he\n                    \"universalizes\" everything. He can't\n                    hammer a nail, plow a field. He can\n                    only buy and sell, invest capital,\n                    manipulate markets. He takes the life\n                    of a people rooted in soil and turns\n                    it into a cosmopolitan culture based\n                    on books, ideas, numbers.

Why? Because it is the\n                    deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to\n                    unravel the very fabric of life until\n                    nothing is left but thread, nothing\n                    but nothingness.

Love the Jews?\n                    It sounds strange, I know, but with\n                    these people nothing is simple. The\n                    Jew says that all he wants is to be\n                    left alone to study his Torah, do a\n                    little business and fornicate with\n                    his over-sexed wife....

He clings to it as if\n                    it were the very core and mystery of\n                    his being. If Hitler had not existed,\n                    the Jews would have invented him. For\n                    without such hatred, the so-called\n                    Chosen People would vanish from the\n                    earth....\n<b>          \n</b>          People react with confusion, uncertainty, suspicion.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              DANNY\n</b>                    ...And this reveals a terrible truth,\n                    the crux of our problem as Nazis: the\n                    worse the Jews are treated, the\n                    stronger they become. Egyptian\n                    slavery made them a nation; the\n                    pogroms hardened them, Auschwitz gave\n                    birth to the State of Israel.\n                    Suffering, it seems, is the very\n                    crucible of their genius. If the Jews\n                    are, as one of their own has said, a\n                    people who will not take yes for an\n                    answer, then let us say yes to them.\n                    If they thrive on opposition, let us\n                    cease to oppose them. The way to\n                    annihilate them, utterly and\n                    completely, is to open our arms, take\n                    them into our homes and embrace them.\n                    Only then will they vanish into\n                    assimilation, dilution...and love.\n                        (a warning finger)\n                    But we cannot pretend.

He looks at the\n          clock: 7:21.\n<b>          \n</b>          Suddenly it seems impossible to go through with this. He\n          stops praying, but no one notices....\n<b>          \n</b><b>          EXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- TWILIGHT\n</b><b>          \n</b>          As Kyle, Drake and Billings approach, the place seems to\n          glow with an inner radiance. Drake and Billings hold weapons\n          at their sides.\n<b>          \n</b>          The stocky security guard sees them coming and gets up,\n          reaching for his gun. Billings and Drake stop. Kyle wishes\n          he weren't here.\n<b>          \n</b>          Everything suspends for a moment as, within the building,\n          three distinct GROUPS OF VOICES can be heard, each chanting\n          the AVINU MALKENU at a slightly different point in the prayer.\n<b>          \n</b>          Drake raises his gun and fires.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT\n</b><b>          \n</b>          People are chanting AVINU MALKENU so fervently that the\n          GUNFIRE outside seems only a faint POPPING. No one\n          particularly notices. Danny, freaking, doesn't hear the\n          gunshots. He tries to address the people in the front rows....\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              DANNY\n</b>                    Wait a minute...\n<b>          \n</b>          But the praying is too loud, too strong. No one stops or\n          listens. He steps down off the bema....\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              DANNY\n</b>                    Stop praying.

Stuart comes up to Danny....\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              STUART\n</b>                    You wanted to daven. Now daven....\n<b>          \n</b>          Danny glances over people's heads at the clock: 7:25. He\n          doesn't notice...\n<b>          \n</b><b>          THE DOOR\n</b><b>          \n</b>          BANGS open. DRAKE stands there, .357, bleeding profusely\n          from the head, the swastika on his lips. At first, only a\n          few people notice, they stop praying.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              PEOPLE\n</b>                        (panic, confusion)\n                    Who's that?... What is he...oh, my God...\n<b>          \n</b>          Avi is the first one out of his chair, walks right at Drake.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              AVI\n</b>                        (calm, forceful)\n                    Put down the weapon. Put it down....\n<b>          \n</b>          Drake shoots him. Avi goes down, writhing in pain. Screams,\n          panic. People come at Drake, but he grabs an 11-year-old\n          girl, puts the gun to her head.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              DANNY\n</b>                    Drake!

The Nazi bastard...\n<b>          \n</b>          Drake moves unsteadily toward the front, pulling the girl\n          with him. A WOMAN (a doctor) goes to tend Avi, who is still\n          conscious. People begin to slip out the back, taking\n          children. Others stay, looking to jump Drake, but he keeps\n          the .357 on the little girl.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              DANNY\n</b>                        (to Carla, Miriam, Stuart)\n                    Get everybody out of here. Fast.\n<b>          \n</b>          He steps back onto the bema, separating himself from the\n          others and drawing Drake's attention. The clock reads 7:28.\n          Outside we begin to hear SIRENS....\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              DANNY\n</b>                    Drake...\n<b>          \n</b>          Drake refocuses, pulls the girl on.... From the hall, we\n          hear OTHER GROUPS in the building, chanting....\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              VOICES\n</b>                    Avinu malkenu, choney-nu v'aneyenu...\n                    Avinu malkenu, choney-nu v'aneyenu,\n                    ki eyn banu ma-asim...\n                    (Our father, out king, graciously\n                    answer us though we are undeserving...)\n                    -- nu va-aneynu...\n<b>          \n</b>          At the front, Drake wobbles. People start forward. He cocks\n          the gun against the little girl's head. She's weeping silently.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              DANNY\n</b>                    Drake, I'm right here....\n<b>          \n</b>          Drake looks. Danny reaches out a hand. Drake points the .357\n          at him and FIRES, missing. A HAND grabs the little girl,\n          pulls her to safety.\n<b>          \n</b>          The room is nearly empty now, save Miriam, Carla, Stuart, a\n          few others.

Nearly drops the .357.\n<b>          \n</b>          Danny glances at the clock: 7:30. What is it, another dud??\n<b>          \n</b>          Drake FIRES again, hits Danny in the shoulder....\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              CARLA\n</b>                    Danny!\n<b>          \n</b>          She runs forward.
