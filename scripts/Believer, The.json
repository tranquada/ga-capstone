These are not Hasidim, but Orthodox Jews:\n          normal American kids in yarmulkes.

It's\n                    about God's power. God says, \"You\n                    know how powerful I am? I can make\n                    you do anything I want, no matter how\n                    stupid.

Two kids in back furtively read the\n          racing form under their desks. He hates them for their\n          indifference as much as he despises Stuart's piety or Avi's\n          ass-kissing.\n          \n                              RAV ZINGESSER\n                    But, Danny, if HaShem is everything,\n                    and we are nothing how are we to\n                    judge His actions?\n          \n                              12-YEAR-OLD DANNY\n                    We have free will and intelligence --\n                    which God allegedly gave us....\n          \n                              AVI\n                    Anyway, God never lets Abraham kill\n                    Isaac. He provides the ram so that --\n          \n                              12-YEAR-OLD DANNY\n                    Personally, I think that's a lie. I\n                    think he did kill him.\n          \n                              RAV ZINGESSER\n                    You think?! Based on what?\n          \n                              12-YEAR-OLD DANNY\n                    There's midrash supporting this. My\n                    father read a book by Shalom Spiegel\n                    that -- Isaac actually died and was\n                    reborn.\n          \n                              RAV ZINGESSER\n                    No one follows that midrash.\n          \n                              12-YEAR-OLD DANNY\n                    I do; I follow it. But okay, say God\n                    provided the ram. So what? Once\n                    Abraham raised the knife, in his\n                    heart it was as if he'd killed him.\n                    He could never forget that. And\n                    neither could Isaac. Look at him:\n                    he's traumatized, he's a putz for the\n                    rest of his life. By the end he can't\n                    tell Jacob from Esau....\n          \n          The kids laugh.

Even the guys with the sports\n          pages are shocked by that one.\n          \n                              12-YEAR-OLD STUART\n                    Don't you believe in God?\n          \n                              12-YEAR-OLD DANNY\n                    I'm the only one here who does\n                    believe. You say he's mysterious, yet\n                    merciful. I see him for the power-\n                    drunk madman He is. And we're\n                    supposed to worship such a Deity?? I\n                    say Never! I say...fight him. I say --\n          \n          The ruler has been CRACKING from \"power-drunk\" on.... Now\n          Zingesser grabs Danny, yanks him out of his chair.\n          \n                              RAV ZINGESSER\n                    Avi -- ask Rabbi Springer to come\n                    remove Danny from the class....\n          \n          Avi rises, grinning, as...Danny struggles wildly to get free.\n          \n                              RAV ZINGESSER\n                    And you, if you had come out of Egypt,\n                    you would have been destroyed in the\n                    desert with those who worshipped the\n                    Golden Calf.\n          \n                              12-YEAR-OLD DANNY\n                    Then let Him destroy me now.

Do it!!\n          \n          The class sits frozen in terror, waiting for God to kill\n          Danny. But nothing happens.\n          \n          INT. YESHIVA STAIRWELL -- NIGHT\n          \n          Danny runs down the steps alone.\n          \n          EXT. RUN-DOWN COMMERCIAL AREA -- TWILIGHT\n          \n          Danny walking home alone. He sees TWO KIDS (older, tougher,\n          blonder) coming toward him. He slips off his yarmulke and\n          slants across the street. The kids slant that way. He hears\n          a RUMBLING, looks up at an ELEVATED TRAIN entering a station.\n          He runs up the steps toward the SHRIEKING train....\n          \n          INT. 7 TRAIN -- 1998 -- DAY\n          \n          TITLE: 13 YEARS LATER\n          \n          The train passes above used car lots, discount furniture\n          stores, residential side streets...finally pulls into a\n          station. The doors open. People file on, the CAMERA letting\n          them go by until it spots a tall, thin COLLEGE STUDENT in a\n          YARMULKE. Danny grown up?\n          \n          PAN with him as he sits, opens an organic chemistry text. The\n          doors close. The train starts up, but the Jewish boy hardly\n          notices; he is already reading. He sways with the motion of\n          the car, half-hidden by other passengers. We realize he is\n          being watched.\n          \n          REVERSE ANGLE: another YOUNG MAN, standing -- a \"SUEDE-HEAD\"\n          (his hair cut so short it's like a fine fabric).\n          \n          SUEDE-HEAD'S POV: THE JEWISH BOY pushes his glasses back up\n          his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the\n          handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left\n          the page. Suede-head steps between passengers and stands\n          directly over the Jewish boy. He looks down at the yarmulke\n          pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at the oversized shirt\n          collar, scrawny neck, prominent Adam's apple, pimples,\n          dandruff, ingrown facial hair...\n          \n          He steps closer, crowding the boy's knees. The boy shifts a\n          little without looking up. Subtly but relentlessly, Suede-\n          head pursues him along the bench until, unable to slide\n          farther, the boy flattens his legs against the seat. Suede-\n          head presses into the boy's knees.\n          \n          The boy accidentally bumps a BUSINESSMAN to Suede-head's\n          left. The man (late 30s, Wall Street Journal, African-\n          American) looks from the boy to Suede-head and understands\n          at once what is going on.\n          \n          Suede-head stares right back -- and the BUSINESSMAN returns\n          to his paper. Suede-head eases him aside and steps on the\n          boy's shoe.\n          \n          SHOES -- A HEAVY BLACK BOOT PINS A BROWN WINGTIP TO THE FLOOR\n          \n          The wingtip wiggles back and forth, finally working free.\n          The boy still hasn't looked up.\n          \n          SUEDE-HEAD & THE JEWISH BOY\n          \n          swaying, locked in a strange, silent intimacy. Suede-head\n          forces the boy into ever more contorted postures,\n          increasingly ridiculous denials of what is happening. And\n          the boy not only never stops reading the chemistry text, he\n          keeps highlighting relevant passages.\n          \n          The train slows. The boy closes the book, caps the\n          highlighter, gathers his things and manages to stand up,\n          wriggling awkwardly around Suede-head. The doors open, he\n          gets off.\n          \n          INT. STATION -- DAY\n          \n          Looking up a long escalator, the Jewish boy riding down\n          toward us.\n          \n          Suede-head arrives on the run at the top, races down a\n          flight of stairs, vaults the bannister, slides down a metal\n          slope....\n          \n          Lands on his feet and comes to stand at the foot of the\n          escalator.\n          \n          The boy rides inexorably down. At the bottom, he tries to go\n          around Suede-head who blocks this way, then another, driving\n          him into a corner.\n          \n          The boy realizes he has nowhere to go -- finally turns to\n          face his tormentor. Their eyes meet for the first time. He\n          is actually bigger than Suede-head, but not nearly as strong.\n          He won't fight, is simply acknowledging what he can no\n          longer deny. There is even an odd relief that disgusts\n          Suede-head more than all the rest.\n          \n                              SUEDE-HEAD\n                    Fucking kike.\n          \n          He slaps him in the face. He stumbles backward. As Suede-\n          head goes to hit him again, the boy holds his books in front\n          of him. Suede-head punches the books straight into his face.\n          The boy falls, curls into a fetal position. Suede-head kicks\n          him....\n          \n                              SUEDE-HEAD\n                    Get up.... Get the fuck up....\n          \n          He won't budge. Suede-head punches him repeatedly until he\n          hears VOICES approaching. He runs back up the stairs to the\n          train and only as we FOLLOW him do we realize that he is our\n          protagonist. This is Danny grown up.\n          \n                                                      CUT TO:\n          \n          INT. DANNY'S STUDIO APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n          \n          Like his brain, the room is at once crowded and tidy and has,\n          so far as we can see, neither windows nor doors. Shelves of\n          books, CDs, magazines, videotapes loom over a neatly made bed.\n          \n          Danny, in briefs and boots, is lifting weights. The phone\n          rings. A machine picks up: no outgoing message, only a BEEP.\n          Then:\n          \n                              WOMAN'S VOICE\n                    Is this working?

A moment later Danny finishes the set, gasping\n          for air, heart pounding, muscles throbbing.\n          \n          INT. SAME -- NIGHT\n          \n          A radio is playing the news.

Investment banks, not\n                    the commercial ones. But the point is\n                    they carry out in those realms the\n                    same principles they display in\n                    sexuality. They undermine traditional\n                    life; they deracinate society.\n          \n          Danny leans over to make sure Guy's getting it right.\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    Deracinate...

This is how they\n                    know themselves.

They no longer need\n                    Judaism because they have soil. The\n                    real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He\n                    has no roots, no attachments. So he\n                    \"universalizes\" everything. He can't\n                    hammer a nail, plow a field. He can\n                    only buy and sell, invest capital,\n                    manipulate markets. He takes the life\n                    of a people rooted in soil and turns\n                    it into a cosmopolitan culture based\n                    on books, ideas, numbers. This is his\n                    strength....\n                        (pumped; this is what\n                         he loves)\n                    Take the great Jewish minds: Marx,\n                    Freud, Einstein. What have they given\n                    us: communism, infantile sexuality\n                    and the atom bomb. In a mere three\n                    centuries since these guys emerged\n                    from the ghettos of Europe, they've\n                    taken us from a world built on order\n                    and reason and hurled us into a chaos\n                    of class warfare, irrational urges\n                    and relativity, a world where the\n                    very existence of matter and meaning\n                    is in doubt. Why? Because it is the\n                    deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to\n                    unravel the very fabric of life until\n                    nothing is left but thread, nothing\n                    but nothingness.

For the Jew, his\n                    Jewishness dominates everything. Even\n                    the ones who renounce it, who hate it,\n                    who want to cut it out of their\n                    hearts a knife...can't escape.\n                    They're still just Jews.\n          \n          Guy finishes writing that and looks up.\n          \n                              GUY\n                    Danny, this is great.

She holds out a prayer book stuffed with flyers.\n          \n                              LARGE WOMAN\n                    Shabbat shalom.\n          \n          She speaks quietly, not wanting to disturb the service, yet\n          even so her voice is huge, and her flashing eyes clearly\n          expect some kind of enthusiastic response. Within we hear\n          the ALENU being chanted.\n          \n          Danny ignores her and the proffered siddur. A basket of\n          yarmulkes seems to infuriate him, but he snatches one anyway\n          and, conveying a helpless disgust, puts it on his head.

She is looking right at Danny. Curtis, unaware of him,\n          keeps thrusting into her from below.\n          \n          Danny starts to leave, but on second thought stays. Carla\n          stares expressionless, yet more attentive to him than to\n          Curtis. Indeed, their eyes never leave each other, so that\n          when she becomes aroused, we understand that it is Danny she\n          is responding to, Danny she is really making love to.\n          \n          Gradually her face loses its aloofness and seems to reach\n          out to him, to reveal feelings that she can no longer deny.\n          She holds her gaze until, at the final instant, she shudders\n          out a series of stifled cries.\n          \n          When she looks again, the window is empty.\n          \n          INT.

No one wants that.\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    Then you know what you have to do?...\n                    You have to love them.\n          \n          Puzzled mutterings: \"What?... What's he talking about?...\"\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    Did he say love them? Love the Jews?\n                    It sounds strange, I know, but with\n                    these people nothing is simple. The\n                    Jew says that all he wants is to be\n                    left alone to study his Torah, do a\n                    little business and fornicate with\n                    his over-sexed wife.... But it isn't\n                    true. He wants to be hated. He longs\n                    for our scorn. He clings to it as if\n                    it were the very core and mystery of\n                    his being. If Hitler had not existed,\n                    the Jews would have invented him. For\n                    without such hatred, the so-called\n                    Chosen People would vanish from the\n                    earth....\n          \n          People react with confusion, uncertainty, suspicion.\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    ...And this reveals a terrible truth,\n                    the crux of our problem as Nazis: the\n                    worse the Jews are treated, the\n                    stronger they become. Egyptian\n                    slavery made them a nation; the\n                    pogroms hardened them, Auschwitz gave\n                    birth to the State of Israel.\n                    Suffering, it seems, is the very\n                    crucible of their genius. If the Jews\n                    are, as one of their own has said, a\n                    people who will not take yes for an\n                    answer, then let us say yes to them.\n                    If they thrive on opposition, let us\n                    cease to oppose them. The way to\n                    annihilate them, utterly and\n                    completely, is to open our arms, take\n                    them into our homes and embrace them.\n                    Only then will they vanish into\n                    assimilation, dilution...and love.\n                        (a warning finger)\n                    But we cannot pretend. The Jew is\n                    nothing if not clever. He will see\n                    through condescension and hypocrisy.\n                    To destroy him, we will have to love\n                    him sincerely.\n          \n          ON THE AUDIENCE, befuddled. A HAND goes up. Danny nods to it.\n          The man steps forward, and we see that it's Guy Danielsen of\n          the Times.

If you'd had any idea\n                    somebody would take it seriously, you\n                    never would have said it.\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    I can't say that.\n          \n                              MIRIAM\n                    Think about your father.

Still, she\n          gets a small tape recorder out of her purse, hands it to him.\n          \n                              MIRIAM\n                    Try to get Lina Moebius on tape,\n                    telling you to do something.\n                    Something violent... That's right, I\n                    don't care about truth. I care about\n                    you.\n                        (looks at her watch)\n                    Kol Nidre's at six-thirty.

He watches it, then looks down at the\n          current moving past. He reaches a decision, throws the tape\n          recorder into the water, turns and walks away....\n          \n          INT. DANNY'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON\n          \n          Danny stops just inside the door. The place is spotless. The\n          desk has been pulled out from the wall, covered with a snowy\n          cloth and set for a Sabbath meal: brass candelabrum, challah\n          under a satin cover...and two place settings.\n          \n          Carla is pouring wine into the kiddush cup.

SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT\n          \n          The windows have darkened. The congregation is on its feet\n          chanting the AVINU MALKENU, the climactic prayer of the day.\n          \n          Danny, leading the prayers, looks up at Carla, Stuart,\n          Miriam...near the front, chanting with him. He looks at the\n          clock: 7:21.\n          \n          Suddenly it seems impossible to go through with this. He\n          stops praying, but no one notices....\n          \n          EXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- TWILIGHT\n          \n          As Kyle, Drake and Billings approach, the place seems to\n          glow with an inner radiance. Drake and Billings hold weapons\n          at their sides.\n          \n          The stocky security guard sees them coming and gets up,\n          reaching for his gun. Billings and Drake stop. Kyle wishes\n          he weren't here.\n          \n          Everything suspends for a moment as, within the building,\n          three distinct GROUPS OF VOICES can be heard, each chanting\n          the AVINU MALKENU at a slightly different point in the prayer.\n          \n          Drake raises his gun and fires.\n          \n          INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT\n          \n          People are chanting AVINU MALKENU so fervently that the\n          GUNFIRE outside seems only a faint POPPING. No one\n          particularly notices. Danny, freaking, doesn't hear the\n          gunshots. He tries to address the people in the front rows....\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    Wait a minute...\n          \n          But the praying is too loud, too strong. No one stops or\n          listens. He steps down off the bema....\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    Stop praying. You've got to get out\n                    of here.... All of you...\n          \n          A few people in front are puzzled by his strange behavior,\n          but the rest keep chanting. Stuart comes up to Danny....\n          \n                              STUART\n                    You wanted to daven. Now daven....\n          \n          Danny glances over people's heads at the clock: 7:25. He\n          doesn't notice...\n          \n          THE DOOR\n          \n          BANGS open. DRAKE stands there, .357, bleeding profusely\n          from the head, the swastika on his lips. At first, only a\n          few people notice, they stop praying.\n          \n                              PEOPLE\n                        (panic, confusion)\n                    Who's that?... What is he...oh, my God...\n          \n          Avi is the first one out of his chair, walks right at Drake.\n          \n                              AVI\n                        (calm, forceful)\n                    Put down the weapon. Put it down....\n          \n          Drake shoots him. Avi goes down, writhing in pain. Screams,\n          panic. People come at Drake, but he grabs an 11-year-old\n          girl, puts the gun to her head.\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    Drake! Up here...\n          \n          Everyone turns, including Drake -- who's blinded by the\n          blood in his eyes, but recognizes the voice.\n          \n                              ENRAGED MAN\n                    See, he knows him. The Nazi bastard...\n          \n          Drake moves unsteadily toward the front, pulling the girl\n          with him. A WOMAN (a doctor) goes to tend Avi, who is still\n          conscious. People begin to slip out the back, taking\n          children. Others stay, looking to jump Drake, but he keeps\n          the .357 on the little girl.\n          \n                              DANNY\n                        (to Carla, Miriam, Stuart)\n                    Get everybody out of here. Fast.\n          \n          He steps back onto the bema, separating himself from the\n          others and drawing Drake's attention. The clock reads 7:28.\n          Outside we begin to hear SIRENS....\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    Drake...\n          \n          Drake refocuses, pulls the girl on.... From the hall, we\n          hear OTHER GROUPS in the building, chanting....\n          \n                              VOICES\n                    Avinu malkenu, choney-nu v'aneyenu...\n                    Avinu malkenu, choney-nu v'aneyenu,\n                    ki eyn banu ma-asim...\n                    (Our father, out king, graciously\n                    answer us though we are undeserving...)\n                    -- nu va-aneynu...\n          \n          At the front, Drake wobbles. People start forward. He cocks\n          the gun against the little girl's head. She's weeping silently.\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    Drake, I'm right here....\n          \n          Drake looks. Danny reaches out a hand. Drake points the .357\n          at him and FIRES, missing. A HAND grabs the little girl,\n          pulls her to safety.\n          \n          The room is nearly empty now, save Miriam, Carla, Stuart, a\n          few others. The AVINU MALKENU can still be heard from the\n          hall....\n          \n                              ENRAGED MAN\n                        (from the door)\n                    Let them kill each other.

Nearly drops the .357.\n          \n          Danny glances at the clock: 7:30. What is it, another dud??\n          \n          Drake FIRES again, hits Danny in the shoulder....\n          \n                              CARLA\n                    Danny!\n          \n          She runs forward. The shoulder hurts; he calls to the others....\n          \n                              DANNY\n                    GET HER OUT OF HERE!\n          \n          Miriam, others, grab Carla, pull Carla toward the door.\n          \n          Drake comes toward Danny, trying to lift the .357 for the kill.\n          \n                              VOICES\n                    Cha'nainu v'anainu, ki ain baw-nu\n                    ma'ah-seem...\n          \n          Danny grabs Drake's gun hand, forces it up in the air. The\n          gun goes off. Plaster rains down on them.\n          \n          Drake dies. Danny catches him under the arms.\n          \n          He looks at the watch: 7:32.
