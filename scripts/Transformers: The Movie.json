Then, like pulling the pin on a hand\ngrenade, he unleashes the spiritual equivalent of a bomb!\n\nASSORTED SHOTS -   INVASION OF THE MATRIX\n\nThe matrix rips through Unicron's body, blowing up wires\ncausing floods and generally causing havoc.\n\nEXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE\n\nUnicron suddenly lets out a scream and lets go of the Junkion\nship, sending it hurtling.\n\n                                                             108.\n\n\n\nINT. THE JUNKION SHIP\n\nIt tumbles through space.\n\nAUTOBOTS AND JUNKIONS\n\n(THEY SCREAM WITH EXHILARATION)\n\nANGLE ON UNICRON\n\nSuddenly,    he starts tearing into his body.\n\nEXT. SPACE\n\nUnicron writhes in space, tearing himself apart, ripping off\na leg, and sending out sparks like a roman candle.\n\n                                                          CUT TO:\n\nINT. THE CORRIDOR WHERE KUP ET.AL ARE TRAPPED\n\nThey are overrun by the antibodies. One takes a whopper bite\nout of Springer's chest.\n\n                       SPRINGER\n             I'm almost out of energy. Suddenly, he\n             looks up and sees one of the creatures\n             explode above\n\nHIM.\n\nThen another explodes, then another.\n\nSPRINGER'S POV - A WALL OF ANTIBODIES\n\nSuddenly, every antibody in the wall begins exploding, and\nthrough the carnage, we see Bumblebee, Spike, Daniel,\nCliffjumper and Jazz.\n\nANGLE ON THE BATTLE\n\nThe last of the antibodies is blown away, and Kup, Arcee and\nSpringer sit up amidst a pile of antibody bodies.\n\n                       SPRINGER\n             That's what I call the nick of time.\n\nANGLE ON ALL\n\nSuddenly, an entire wall vanishes as Unicron's hand tears at\nthings.\n\n\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            109.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                    JAZZ\n          Let's burn rubber!\n\nANGLE ON THE TUNNEL\n\nThey transform. The humans jump in.\n\nTHE CHASE - TRACKING\n\nThey race up the tunnel, one step ahead    of Unicron's hand\nwhich shoots after them, pulling apart    what we know must be\npieces of his brain... Then, they reach    what seems like a\ndead end. In fact, it is the back side     of Unicron's good\neye. The hand comes in after them!\n\nANGLE DOWN THE CORRIDOR\n\nAn unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the\nAutobots. When it gets there, we realize that it is Rodimus\nPrime.\n\n                    KUP\n          I knew you had potential, lad!\n\nANGLE ON RODIMUS PRIME\n\n                    RODIMUS PRIME\n          Autobots, transform and roll out. Rodimus\n          Prime transforms into truck mode as the\n          other Autobots also transform. Daniel\n          and Spike jump into him. Then, in a\n          continuous line, he shoots off, the other\n          Autobots racing behind him.\n\n                                                      SMASH CUT:\n\nEXT. UNICRON\n\nRodimus Prime shoots out the second eye...    Followed by the\nothers.\n\nANGLE ON UNICRON\n\nAn arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the Autobot essence\nspreads throughout the body, blowing circuits. Suddenly,\nUnicron lets out a loud agonized ROAR. SPARKS seem to shoot\nout of every part of his body. Then, he spins in space like\nsome kind of a fireworks display, shooting off sparks. And\nthen...\n\n                                                         110.\n\n\n\nBANG!\n\nWe get the big visual explosion.\n\n                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.
