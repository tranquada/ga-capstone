Hunters\n\thot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle.\n\n\n\tThe sidewalk is crowded with people. So is the street. Too\n\tmany people, not enough cement. Los Angeles, 1997.\n\n\n\tSummer, probably August. 103 degrees. Heat shimmers off the\n\thorizon. Making the sky look peculiar.\n\n\n\tThe men keep running. Passed a GUY sitting at a bus stop,\n\twatching a television in his lap. YOU HEAR the NEWSCASTER.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEWSCASTER (V. 0.) \n</b>\t\tAs L. A. P. D. officers gather\n\t\tevidence at this grisly crime\n\t\tscene, you can only ask yourselves\n\t\t\u0097\u0097 what kind of lunatic would\n\t\tcommit such unthinkable crimes?\n\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tThe three adjectives which best\n\t\tdescribe this killer are sadistic,\n\t\tintelligent, and dangerous...\n\n\tThe guy pays little attention to the broadcast. He seems\n\talmost bored by it. Like this kind of news is commonplace. Or\n\the's got more important things on his mind.\n\n\tEverybody is sweating. Including the two men struggling to\n\tswim upstream in the river of pedestrians.\n\n\tTheir uniforms are freshly pressed. Their shoes just recently\n\tshined. Hair tightly cropped. Faces perfectly shaved. Clearly\n\tmen proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police\n\tDepartment. The guy in the lead is\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER BARNES\n</b>\t\tHis body is a running back's. His\n\t\tendurance a marathoner's. His face\n\t\tone you'd want for your own. He's\n\t\tin his 30s. If he was in his 20s,\n\t\tyou'd still be jealous.\n\n\tHis partner is JOHN DONLEY, late 20s, eager to prove himself.\n\tHe struggles to keep up with Parker. John accidently knocks\n\tover several pedestrians. They give no reaction, except to\n\tpick themselves up and continue on their way.\n\n\tParker and John keep charging. Their conversation breathless:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\tI can't get over how different you\n\t\tlook.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER\n</b>\t\t\t(ruefully)\n\t\tFive years can be a bitch, huh?\n\n\tThey split-up. The Maitre D', still facing the front doors,\n\trepeats his greeting to no one in particular.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAITRE D'\n</b>\t\tGood afternoon. May I help you?\n\n\tParker spots Sid 6.7 across the room. Without hesitation the\n\thunter chases his prey.  Gun out and firing. NOT what you\n\twould call Standard Police Procedure.\n\n\tBullets riddle Sid 6.7's table as he dives from his chair. He\n\tlands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath his\n\ttable.\n\n\tJohn charges from the other direction until a WOMAN gets up\n\tfrom her chair, standing directly in John's line of fire.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJOHN\n</b>\t\t\t(to the Woman)\n\t\tLady, move!\n\n\tBefore she can do so, Sid 6.7 stands behind the Woman,\n\tgrabbing her and throwing her across the table into Parker.\n\tCRASH! They tumble to the floor.\n\n\tIn the same movement, Sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his\n\tjacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire.\n\tJohn's gun flies from his hand. Sid 6.7 advances toward him.\n\n\tParker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does\n\tthe same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet\n\tthrough his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's.\n\tParker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp.\n\n\tParker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in\n\tthe stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in\n\tthe background. Parker doubles over, gasping for breath.\n\tAnother kick drops Parker to his knees.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSID 6.7\n</b>\t\t\t(to Parker)\n\t\tI'm going to rehearse with your\n\t\tfriend a while, then I'll be back\n\t\tto perform a new piece with you.\n\n\tHe grabs his bowling bag and SLAMS it into John's head,\n\tknocking him out. Sid 6.7 puts John's unconscious body over\n\this shoulder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSID 6.7 (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tIf you get hungry, I'd recommend\n\t\tthe escargot. They're delicious.\n\n\tHe carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen.\n\tParker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6.7.\n\n<b>\tINSIDE THE RESTAURANT KITCHEN\n</b>\n\tParker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables, who\n\twork undistracted. The Vegetables look plastic.\n\n\tParker turns a corner, stopping fast. At the other end of the\n\taisle stands Sid 6.7, who presses his gun against the head of\n\ta frightened BUSBOY. Sid 6.7 holds the Busboy's body in front\n\tof his own as a shield.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER\n</b>\t\t\t(to Sid 6.7)\n\t\tWhere's John?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSID 6.7\n</b>\t\tPerforming solo.\n\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tEnjoying the concert so far?\n\n\tAdvancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6.7 with\n\this good arm. Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs\n\twatch the showdown.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER\n</b>\t\tRecital's over, asshole.\n\n\tHe fires directly through the chest of the innocent Busboy\n\thitting Sid 6.7.\n\n\tThe Sous Chefs gasp in horror as the Busboy drops through Sid\n\t6.7's grasp to the floor. Dead.\n\n\tSid 6.7 stares at Parker in disbelief. Blood is now visible\n\tflowing from a bullet hole in Sid 6.7's shoulder, which was\n\tcaused by the same bullet. Sid 6.7's arm dangles uselessly.\n\tHis gun lies on the floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSID 6.7\n</b>\t\t(surprised, but pleased).\n\t\tYou and me aren't so different,\n\t\tafter all...\n\n\tParker again pulls the trigger. Click. Click, click. No\n\tbullets.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSID 6.7 (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tLike a violin without strings...\n\n\tHe takes off around the corner. Grabbing another clip from\n\tinside his uniform, Parker goes after him. Only to stumble\n\tover something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through\n\tits zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a\n\tbowling ball.\n\n\tBeside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing.\n\tHis hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is\n\tbeing electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in\n\ttime.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER\n</b><b>\t\tSHIT!\n</b>\n\tHe scans the room for Sid 6.7. Parker has no idea Sid 6.7 is\n\tstanding directly behind him. Sid 6.7 grabs Parker by the\n\tthroat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSID 6.7\n</b>\t\tI told you I was going to perform a\n\t\tnew piece with you. It's called,\n\t\t\"First You Suffer, Then You Die.\"\n\t\tHope you like it.\n\n\tParker gags, unable to breathe. He then starts to DE\u0097\n\tMATERIALIZE from within Sid 6.7's grasp.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSID 6.7 (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t\t(as if to God)\n\t\tNOOOH! You can't take him, yet. I'm\n\t\tnot finished!\n\n\tJohn's body also de\u0097materializes as Parker disappears\n\tentirely.\n\n\tThe blood seeping from Sid 6.7's wound stops flowing and\n\tstarts retracting into his body. Along with his bone\n\tfragments. His shoulder is healing itself. Right before your\n\tvery eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is\n\n<b>\tON A MONITOR\n</b>\n\tThe scene continues seamlessly. Sid 6.7's skin heals over his\n\tshoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their\n\tproper places. No scar whatsoever.\n\n\tHis clothing also returns to perfect condition. Literally, as\n\tgood as new. This is known as AUTOMATIC RESETTING.\n\n\tThe previously dead Busboy also Auto Resets. His wound\n\thealing by itself. We PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal the monitor\n\tis one of several\n\n<b>\tINSIDE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT CENTER\n</b>\n\ta/k/a LETAC. The facility is a converted aerospace research\n\tbuilding in Pacoima. Funded by government black book dollars.\n\n\tThe look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech\n\tsparkle. Banks upon banks of computer equipment. Wires,\n\tcables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look.\n\n\tIn complete disarray to the uninitiated. But to those in the\n\tknow, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the\n\tworld.\n\n\tThe building is partitioned into dozens of stations. At each\n\tstation, a leading engineer in his field is frantically\n\treadying a prototype for demonstration. Each new technology\n\tdesigned to help fight the new Cold War... the War on Crime.\n\n\tThe atmosphere is competitive. Voices are loud. Tension,\n\tanticipation in the air. Only a lucky few will have their\n\tinventions approved for production.\n\n\tLETAC is, quite simply, Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from\n<b>\t1994.\n</b>\n\tAt a station in the middle of the room, TWO UNCONSCIOUS\n\tBODIES lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps\n\tmade of polyurethane.\n\n\tEach skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it\n\tat points designated as neural primes. Each needle is\n\tdirectly connected to the participant's nervous system.\n\n\tThe tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic\n\twire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers\n\tsurrounding the beds.\n\n\tEach of these components isn't much to look at on its own.\n\tBut together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of\n\tsomething very new \u0097\u0097 a revolutionary law enforcement\n\ttraining device whose name you read:\n\n<b>\tVIRTUAL REALITY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SIMULATOR\n</b>\n\tTo be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed\n\tinvolving Parker, John, and Sid 6.7 took place within virtual\n\treality, not the real world.\n\n\tDozens of small character modules, similar to today's\n\tNintendo game cartridges, are plugged into .the system's main\n\tconsole.\n\n\tEach of the modules bares a name and number, such as MAITRE\n\tD' 1.7 and SHEILA 3.2. There is no character version number\n\tgreater than 4.0. Until you see the module labelled SID 6.7.\n\n\tThe simulation timer stops at: 17 hours, 52 minutes, 11\n\tseconds. A clock reads: 3:04:32 PM.\n\n\tFour observers, two men and two women, watch virtual reality\n\tmonitors positioned around the station. One of the men wears\n\tan L. A. P. D. uniform. His name is WILLIAM COX, 40S. His\n\tnameplate reads CHIEF OF POLICE.\n\n\tOne of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor.\n\tIntently following the action on screen. Studying it\n\tclinically. Her name is DR. MADISON CARTER, late 30s.\n\n\tShe is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take a\n\tback seat to her intelligence. She is one of the country's\n\tforemost authorities on criminal psychology. Her concerns are\n\tempirical. Her quest is knowledge. She has little in common\n\twith the other observers.\n\n\tThe other man is FREDERICK WALLACE, 5Os, Chairman/CEO of\n\tLETAC. Expensive suit. Commanding, powerful. But not as\n\tcommanding, or powerful, as ELIZABETH DEANE, 605, the\n\tPresidentially\u0097appointed Crime Czars\n\n\tElizabeth Deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated\n\tto LETAC. As well as which prototypes will move on to\n\tproduction.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEANE\n</b>\t\t\t(quietly to Wallace)\n\t\tWhat did Cox pull him out early\n\t\tfor?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWALLACE\n</b>\t\tBarnes used to work for him when he\n\t\twas still a cop in the field,\n\t\tremember?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEANE\n</b>\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tDon't remind me.\n\n\tLAB ASSISTANTS remove the polyurethane skull caps from the\n\ttwo unconscious bodies. The acupuncture needles remain in the\n\tcaps. You can now see the faces of the participants:\n\n\tParker and John.\n\n\tParker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually\n\treturns to consciousness. He looks very different than his\n\tvirtual rendering:\n\n\tHis hair is long and ragged. His face is unshaven. A scar\n\tacross his cheek. A hoop earring in one ear. His outfit a\n\tfilthy prison uniform.\n\n\tJohn's outfit matches Parker's. Physically, he looks as\n\tclean\u0097cut as his virtual rendering. Except that he is\n\tconvulsing. Violently.\n\n\tHis flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around\n\thim. Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. It's ugly.\n\tFrightening.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER\n</b>\t\t\t(barely conscious)\n<b>\t\tSOMEBODY.. .DO SOMETHING!\n</b>\n\tTWO PARAMEDICS burst through the doors and rush to John. The\n\tparamedics inject him. Fibrillate him. Repeatedly.\n\n\tThe simulator's designer, DARYL LINDENMEYER, 40s, high\u0097\n\tstrung, intense, and brilliant beyond words, stands by the\n\tequipment protectively. He is far more concerned for the\n\tsafety of his machines than he is for John's life.\n\n\tJohn's body goes limp. His vital signs flat. The Paramedics\n\trecord the time of death and cover the body with a sheet.\n\tThey begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEANE\n</b>\t\t\t(annoyed to Wallace)\n\t\tWhat the hell happened?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWALLACE\n</b>\t\t\t(pointing to needles)\n\t\tLindenmeyer developed neural\n\t\tconnectors that tap directly into\n\t\tthe nervous system. If the\n\t\tsimulator isn't calibrated\n\t\tproperly, experiencing death in\n\t\tthis level of VR is like\n\t\texperiencing death within a dream.\n\t\tThe experience becomes real.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEANE\n</b>\t\t\t(angrily)\n\t\tSimulations are supposed to give\n\t\tparticipants practice in realistic,\n\t\tdangerous scenarios while\n\t\tprotecting them from the risks they\n\t\tare exposed to in the real world.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWALLACE\n</b>\t\t\t(annoyed, to Lindenmeyer)\n\t\tI was assured the problem was\n\t\tcorrected.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLINDENMEYER\n</b>\t\tI did fix it.. I told you I did. I\n\t\tdon't know why it happened again.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEANE\n</b>\t\tAgain?!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOX\n</b>\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tMy first two pairs of convicts\n\t\tsuffered the same fate.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDEANE\n</b>\t\t\t(coldly, to Wallace)\n\t\tWhy wasn't I told?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWALLACE\n</b>\t\tBlack book dollars, black book\n\t\toperation.

Wallace follows after her quickly. You\n\tnow notice that the chair Dr. Madison Carter had occupied is\n\tnow empty. She left a while ago.\n\n\tCox remains. Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as\n\tif it were his child. There are several scratches, but no\n\tmajor damage. He looks relieved.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER\n</b>\t\t\t(struggling to sit up)\n\t\tHe...only had a year left on his\n\t\tsentence.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLINDENMEYER\n</b>\t\t\t(annoyed)\n\t\tHow much do you think I care?\n\n\tParker, still not fully conscious, hurls himself at\n\tLindenmeyer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLINDENMEYER (CONT' D)\n</b>\t\t\t(hysterical)\n\t\tDon't touch me!...DON'T TOUCH ME!!!\n\n\tHe flails his arms wildly. Nearly spasming. This is clearly a\n\tman who should never drink coffee. TWO armed GUARDS, who've\n\tbeen standing in the background, pull Parker off Lindenmeyer\n\tand throw him to the ground.\n\n\tLindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put\n\tParker in handcuffs and leg chains.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOX\n</b>\t\tI'll walk him out.\n\n\tThe Guards back off as Cox helps Parker to his feet.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOX (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t\t(to Parker)\n\t\tYou all right?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER\n</b>\t\t\t(still clearing his head)\n\t\tWhy'd.. .you pull me out?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOX\n</b>\t\tDonley started experiencing the\n\t\tattack for real.

Razor wire, land mines,\n\tarmed sentries. Nobody who shouldn't be here gets anywhere\n\tnear here.\n\n\tCox leads Parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport.\n\tThe two guards walk behind at a distance. Two more by the\n\ttransport. The chain between Parker's legs keeps his steps\n\tshort.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOX\n</b>\t\tWhat the hell did you have to shoot\n\t\tthe busboy for?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER\n</b>\t\tHe was a computer program for\n\t\tcrissake.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOX\n</b>\t\tYou were supposed to act as if\n\t\teverything was real.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER\n</b>\t\tReal, my ass.

Cox follows. Two armed\n\tGUARDS open the back doors for Parker, then stand poised with\n\tweapons out and ready.\n\n<b>\tINSIDE THE PRISON TRANSPORT -- REAR\n</b>\n\tCold metal benches. No windows. Parker climbs in, the only\n\tpassenger. He looks out the open doors to Cox.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPARKER\n</b>\t\t\t(half-heartedly)\n\t\tBut with the six months off I get\n\t\tfor being your guinea pig, I've\n\t\tonly got to survive another 17\n\t\tyears, 5 months, and 23 days.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOX\n</b>\t\tDon't give up, Parker.
