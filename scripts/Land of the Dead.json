The Dead Thing's\n     head recoils, but lowers again toward Cholo, the Swastika        \n     looming, drooling teeth baring for a bite. Cholo's eyes          \n     flash.

A bullet ricochets off a brick wall. Big Daddy is\n     startled at first. Then, he relaxes, realizing the rifle's      \n     power. With surprising dexterity, he slings the weapon's        \n     strap over his head and across his chest, patting the strap     \n     as if comforted by it. Turning, he looks toward...              \n     ...THE DISTANT GLOW OF A SKYSCRAPER that can be seen ON THE     \n     HORIZON. That's the direction the convoy is headed.

They look up to see...\n\n\n\n      BIG DADDY leading his army into the atrium. Kaufman aims and\n      FIRES. A BULLET HITS BIG DADDY in the upper chest, blowing       \n      DEAD FLESH out of his back. The Dead Man feels no pain, but      \n      it focuses on Kaufman and starts after him with purpose.\n\n\n\n      Kaufman sees something in Big Daddy's eyes. Something that's\n      not dead.

From upstairs.      \nIt's the man who shot him.                                      \nThe Dead Thing looks up. Sees the gasoline pump.
