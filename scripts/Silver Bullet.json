Aboard is\nARNIE WESTRUM, a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino\npants. He is drinking beer.\n\n\t\tARNIE (sings)\n\tMy beer is Rheingold the dry beer...\n\tThink of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...\n\nHe drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses\nit to one side. Up ahead we see a switching point.\n\nARNIE throws the rail-rider into neutral, opens the toolbox\non the back, and brings out a big five-cell flashlight. He\nshines it on the switch.\n\nHe gets a crowbar from the toolbox, plus a big wrench, a\npair of pliers, a hammer, and a pair of work gloves. He also\ngets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back\npocket.\n\nARNIE jumps down and approaches the switch.\n\n<b>CREDITS CONTINUE.\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT. ARNIE, AT THE SWITCHING POINT  NIGHT\n</b>\nHe drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the\nlight on the switch for a moment. During this:\n\n\t\tARNIE (sings)\n\tIt's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real\n\tfrosty treat, won't you try, won't you\n\tbuy Rheingold beer...\n\nHe tries the switch. No go. It's frozen.\n\n<b>\t\tARNIE\n</b>\tStuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze!\n\nHe takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes\na churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and\ndrinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty\nbottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then\nhe picks up his crowbar.\n\n<b>CREDITS CONTINUE.\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT\n</b>\nThere's a SOUND of bushes shaking. Something comes out -\nsomething huge. It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider. It is\na werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes. Tatters of clothes\nstill hang from it.\n\nWhat kind of monster, exactly? It is humanoid as well as\nwolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, we\nshould be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kick\nourselves for not knowing earlier.\n\nIt crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on\nthe whole rail-rider.\n\n<b>CREDITS CONCLUDE.\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.

ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT\n</b>\nHe comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan, the kind with the\nlong spout.

His eyes widen.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE CINDERS BY THE TRACK, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT\n</b>\nWe can see the hole where ARNIE put his beer, but it is of\ncourse empty. Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders,\nhalf wolf, half human.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT\n</b>\nHe's beginning to be afraid. Beginning to look around to see\nwhat might be out here with him. Beginning to realize he is\nin extremely deep shit.\n\n<b>SOUND: A SHATTERING, SNARLING ROAR\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WEREWOLF  NIGHT\n</b>\nIt rises up on its hind legs, eyes glaring an ugly yellow\ngreen. Its snout wrinkles back, revealing those teeth.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT\n</b>\nHe's craning back to look at the thing, his face a grue of\nhorror.\n\n<b>\t\tARNIE\n</b>\tOh n-\n\nA huge clawed hand/paw comes sweeping down. ARNIE's head is\ngranted an immediate Reno-style divorce from the rest of his\nbody.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT\n</b>\nSOUND of the beast approaching. A hairy arm and taloned hand\nreaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages.\nThe hand is dripping blood.\n\nIt comes up with a bottle of Rheingold.\n\nThe WEREWOLF begins to sing. It is a bizarre funny-horrible\ngrunting, the words hellishly recognizable.\n\n\t\tWEREWOLF (gutteral; subhuman)\n\tMy beer is Rheingold the dry beer...\n\nNo bottle opener for this thing; it brings the neck of the\nbottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox. Beer foams\nout.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, IN DEEP SHADOW  NIGHT\n</b>\nHe/It rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth\nand drinks. Foam drizzles down its pelt. It's grinning.\n\n\t\tWEREWOLF (snarling voice)\n\tThink of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU  NIGHT\n</b>\nThe bottle is empty. There are CRUNCHING SOUNDS as it begins\nto eat the bottle.\n\nBlood begins to run out of its mouth; its face wrinkles in\npain and fury. It spits out broken, bloody jags of glass.\n\nLooks up. It HOWLS.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS  NIGHT - MOONLIGHT\n</b>\nWe're looking at Main Street of a small country town - might\nbe New England, might be mid-South. Might be 1984, might be\n1981. This is Tarker's Mills, and in places like this, time\nmoves more slowly. Cars - not too many - move back and\nforth. No one is in a hurry.\n\nWe see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door);\nAndy's Sporting Goods; Owen's Pub, with its Narragansett\nneon sign. We see a barber shop with a striped pole; we see\nthe Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door.\nWe see the Gem Theater, which is showing a revival of Sophia\nLoren in \"Two Women.\"\nIt's Our Town, U.S.A.\n\n\t\tJANE (voice-over)\n\tThis place is Tarker's Mills, where I\n\tgrew up... and this is how it was when I\n\twas fourteen - a place where people cared\n\tabout each other as much as they cared\n\tabout themselves. This is how my town\n\tlooked as, all unknowing, it approached the\n\trim of the nightmare. The killing had begun.\n\nSOUND: The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant, a bit dreamy.\n\n\n<b>EXT./INT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  NIGHT\n</b>\na.) VIRGIL CUTTS, owner of Virgil's Texaco, is filling up a\ncar. We hear the HOWl... and VIRGIL looks up uneasily.\nb.) In the barber shop, BILLY McCLAREN, the barber, is just\ntaking the apron off the Methodist minister, REV. O'BANION.\nThey both look around.\nc.) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater. They pause at\nthe sound of that HOWL and look toward the edge of town.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE SETTING MOON, CU  NIGHT\n</b>\nAs JANE speaks, we see the moon sink below the horizon.\n\n\t\tJANE (v-o)\n\tThe killing had begun, but at first no\n\tone knew it. Arnie Westrum was a chronic\n\tdrunk, and what happened seemed like an\n\taccident.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER AND ARNIE'S HEADLESS BODY  NIGHT\n</b>\nSlowly the view improves, grows lighter, as we TIME-LAPSE TO\n<b>DAWN.\n</b>\nSOUND: A train is approaching. We hear its horn.\n\nCAMERA MOVES IN. Here is a shattered Rheingold bottle. There\nis a litter of ARNIE'S tools. And here, on the cheek of\nARNIE'S severed head, a few ants are checking things out.\n\nSOUND: The train's horn, MUCH CLOSER.\n\n\t\tJANE (v-o)\n\tThe county coroner concluded that Arnie\n\tpassed out on the tracks. There wasn't\n\tenough evidence to conclude anything else.\n\nAnd suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame, horn\nblaring. The rail-rider goes flying. ARNIE'S body disappears\nunderneath. We see something flopping and moving under\nthere. It could be a bundle of rags. Could be... but isn't.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS TOWN COMMON  DAY\n</b>\nThe common is more or less in the center of town, either\nsurrounded by Main Street commerce or backed by it. THE\nCAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on a big tent that's been erected on\nthe Common - looks like a revival meeting tent, almost, but\nthe banner draped over the entrance reads: SUPPORT THE\n<b>TARKER'S MILLS MEDCU DRIVE!\n</b>\nBehind or to the side, on the grass, picnic tables have been\nset out end-to-end. Women are putting salads and home-baked\nbreads on these - just about the whole town is going to sit\ndown to a meal when the meeting's over. Further off, men are\ntending barbecues, roasting corn, etc.\n\n\t\tJOE HALLER (amplified voice)\n\tI'd like to give you Father Lester Lowe,\n\tof Holy Family Catholic Church!\n\nEnthusiastic applause greets this.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE CROWD  DAY\n</b>\nMost of the town is here, seated on folding chairs. We're\nlooking particularly at three people - NAN COSLAW, her\nhusband BOB, and their fourteen-year-old daughter, JANE. It\nis JANE - a slightly older JANE - who we have heard\nspeaking. She is now a bit bored with the meeting, which has\nbeen going on for some time. As the APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she\nleans toward her mother.\n\n<b>\t\tJANE\n</b>\tI'm going out for a while, 'kay?\n\n<b>\t\tNAN\n</b>\tAll right. Stay close. And make sure your\n\tbrother's all right.\n\nAs JANE gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit.\n\nNOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue\nto wear it through the whole movie.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE PODIUM  DAY\n</b>\nTo one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel.\nIt shows a van which has been customized into an emergency\nmedical unit.\n\nBehind the podium are four chairs. REV. TOM O'BANION sits in\none of them. ANDY FAIRTON sits in another, red-faced and\nbeaming. JOE HALLER, the town constable, is just returning\nto his; LESTER LOWE is just approaching the mike as the\napplause dies. LOWE'S face shines with love and goodwill.\n\n<b>\t\tLOWE\n</b>\tFor the last ten years...\n\nNo amplification. He taps the mike.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JANE\n</b>\nShe is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people\nshould be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL of\nabout her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot.\n\n\t\tGIRL (mocking)\n\t\"Make sure your brother's all right.\"\n\n\t\tJANE (low)\n\tMarty's a booger.\n\nShe reaches the aisle and starts out.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE PODIUM, FEATURING FATHER LOWE\n</b>\nHe taps the mike again.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING BOB AND NAN COSLAW\n</b>\n\t\tBOB (good-natured)\n\tJust pretend you're in your own church\n\taskin' for money, father! It'll work fine!\n\nGood-natured laughter greets this.\n\n\n<b>INT.  LOWE AT THE PODIUM\n</b>\nA bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF\n<b>SCREAM OF FEEDBACK.\n</b>\n<b>\t\tLOWE\n</b>\tFor the last ten years, I have had a\n\tdream. A dream of a time when modern\n\tmedical care would come to this small\n\tcommunity, which sometimes seems so far\n\tfrom Durham, with her lifesaving\n\thospitals. I hope that this meeting, at\n\twhich I see so many of my friends\n\tgathered, will be the start of making my\n\tdream come true.\n\nSOUND: Enthusiastic applause.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  A SNAKE IN THE GRASS, CU\n</b>\nIt's a blacksnake... harmless, but big. It goes wriggling\nthrough the grass toward a stream. In the b.g. - SOUND OF\n<b>APPLAUSE.\n</b>\n\t\tMARTY (voice)\n\tHoly...! Brady, are you sure they're\n\tnot poisonous?\n\n\t\tBRADY (voice)\n\tLittle old blacksnake? Hell, no!\n\nHands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief -\ngrab the blacksnake.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY, CU\n</b>\nBRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with\nrespectful wonder.\n\nNOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion,\nand will through the whole movie.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tLemme hold him!\n\nBRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY\nsees:\n\n\n<b>EXT.  JANE, COMING OUT OF THE TENT  DAY\n</b>\n\t\tJANE (v-o)\n\tI was almost fifteen that summer. My\n\tbrother Marty was eleven. Marty and his\n\tfriend Brady Kincaid were the crosses I\n\thad to bear. Brady was actually the worse\n\tof the two, but I was rarely disposed to\n\tsee that. Not when my younger brother was\n\tso constantly thrown in my face by my\n\tparents.\n\n\t\tLOWE (v-o from the tent)\n\t$32,000 is a lot of money. But when you\n\tthink of the lives this unit might save, it\n\tseems very inexpensive indeed.\n\nApplause greets this.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY\n</b>\nAgain we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from\nwaist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake.\n\n<b>\t\tBRADY\n</b>\tI got an idea.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tWhat?\n\nBRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes\nwiden.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tYou wouldn't.\n\nBRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tYou would.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH LOWE\n</b>\n<b>\t\tLOWE\n</b>\tAn endeavor like this seems to me to be\n\tthe very definition of community - all\n\tof us pulling together as one, farmers\n\tand merchants... Protestants and Catholics...\n\n\n<b>EXT.  JANE\n</b>\nShe is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing\nunder a tree. There's more applause from the tent.\n\n\t\tBRADY (teasing voice)\n\tJane... Jane...\n\nShe looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost\ntouching her upturned face.\n\nJANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips over\nher own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was a\nnice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hose\nshredded at the knees.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY\n</b>\nHe's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughing\nwildly.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  JANE\n</b>\nShe gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees. She's\nnear tears.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY, AT ONE SIDE OF THE TREE, FAIRLY TIGHT\n</b>\nThe shot's from the chest up. He looks sorry he was a part\nof this little stunt, as he ought to be.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tIt was just a blacksnake, Jane-\n\n\n<b>EXT.  JANE\n</b>\nShe looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment and\nsomething very close to hate.\n\n<b>\t\tJANE\n</b>\tLook at my knees! Look at my dress!\n\tI hate you!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE\n</b>\n<b>\t\tBRADY\n</b>\tDid wittle Janie make wee-wee in her\n\tteddies?\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tStop it, Brady.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE\n</b>\nHe throws the snake.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  JANE\n</b>\nShe dodges the snake with a little scream. She's beginning\nto cry, but she flips BRADY the bird just the same.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BRADY, IN THE TREE\n</b>\n<b>\t\tBRADY\n</b>\tOoooh, naughty!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe moves toward JANE - there is something queerly unnatural\nin this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but for\nthe time being we must be puzzled.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tJane, I'm sorry. It was just a joke. We\n\tdidn't mean-\n\nHe's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical.\n\n<b>\t\tJANE\n</b>\tOh, no! You never mean to! I hate you,\n\tyou booger!\n\nShe runs away.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY\n</b>\nHe swings down and comes over to MARTY.\n\n\t\tBRADY (with satisfaction)\n\tReally got her goat that time.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe's in a wheelchair, looking glumly after JANE.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tOh, shut up, Brady. You're warped.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  NEAR THE BANDSTAND, FEATURING JANE  DAY\n</b>\nShe's walking slowly along, still crying a little. Now she\nsteps behind some bushes, looks around, hikes up the skirt\nof her jumper, and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose.\n\n\t\tSTELLA RANDOLPH (voice)\n\tWait! Don't go!\n\nStartled, JANE looks around, instinctively yanking her dress\ndown. No one in sight.\n\n\t\tMAN (voice; rough)\n\tJust leave me alone!\n\nNow she looks toward:\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, JANE'S POV\n</b>\nA man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who\nhas just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about\nthe farmer's daughter comes striding down from the\nbandstand.\n\nSTELLA RANDOLPH, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes to\nthe stairs but does not descend them. She is also crying -\nbut these are real tears, folks. STELLA is a human Niagara\nFalls.\n\n\t\tSTELLA (calls)\n\tPlease! You have to help me!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE GAY DECEIVER\n</b>\n\t\tDECEIVER (keeps walking)\n\tIt's your oven, but it ain't my bun\n\tyou're baking in there. Sorry, babe.\n\nB.g. SOUNDS: More applause.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  JANE\n</b>\nWe can hear STELLA sobbing as JANE walks slowly toward the\nbandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand.\nJANE looks suddenly aware that she's not the only one in\nthis sad world who has troubles. She reaches the foot of the\nstairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose\nabsently in a litter can.\n\nJANE mounts the steps timidly.\n\n<b>\t\tJANE\n</b>\tStella? Is that you?\n\n\n<b>EXT.  ON THE BANDSTAND\n</b>\nSTELLA has retreated to one of the benches, where she is\nbawling into a handful of Kleenex. Pudgy and twenty-two, she\nis both funny and terribly sad. She looks around at the\nsound of JANE's voice.\n\n\t\tSTELLA (alarmed)\n\tWho - ?\n\n\t\tJANE (approaching closer)\n\tIt's Jane, Stella. Jane Coslaw.\n\nSTELLA sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping.\nJANE stands, uncertain what to do next. After a moment she\napproaches closer and touches STELLA'S turned back timidly.\n\n\t\tJANE (tenderly)\n\tWhat's wrong?\n\n\t\tSTELLA (weeping)\n\tHe's going away. I know he is.\n\n<b>\t\tJANE\n</b>\tWho's going away?\n\nSTELLA turns to her, weeping still and distracted.\n\n<b>\t\tSTELLA\n</b>\tWhat am I going to tell my mother?

Just leave me\n\talone, you stupid thing!\n\nSTELLA lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps. JANE\nstares after her, bewildered and perhaps even a little\nfrightened.\n\n\n<b>INT.

THE STATION WAGON  DAY\n</b>\nBOB and NAN COSLAW are sitting up front. MARTY and JANE are\nin the backseat. JANE is as far from MARTY as she can get.\nShe's still mad as hell.

He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how\nto make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it.\n\n<b>\t\tJANE\n</b>\tYou always take his side because he's a\n\tcripple!

It's the end of the first day of school, and they\nare excited. They range from Grade 1 to Grade 8.

A BUNCH OF KIDS, WITH BRADY KINCAID AND TAMMY\n</b><b>STURMFULLER\n</b>\nBRADY and TAMMY are riding bikes. Now there is the SOUND of\na gasoline engine, and MARTY catches up. He's got the Silver\nBullet's motor running for the first time in the movie.\nLater on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing\ncar, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with\na muffler on it. It's pretty cool, though - a bright\nmetallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing.\nLooks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have\nthought up. On the back is a license plate which says SILVER\n<b>BULLET.\n</b>\n<b>\t\tBRADY\n</b>\tLook out! Look out!

An ashtray beside him overflows with\nbutts.\n\nHe and MARTY are playing draw poker for MARTY'S baseball\ncards. Each has a pile in front of him.\n\nMARTY really loves UNCLE AL... his eyes just glow when he\nlooks at him.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tOkay, okay.

UNCLE AL looks after\nher, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering\nashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire\nbut creating something that looks even worse.

HERB KINCAID\n</b>\nHe clears his throat.

He makes it down\ntwo steps and then sits heavily by the remains of BRADY'S\nsmiling, bloody kite. He looks straight ahead. He looks at\nnothing.\n\n\t\tHALLER (low)\n\t...and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb.\n\tJesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for\n\tus sinners now...now...\n\nHe looks at the kite, then looks away.

MARTY looks at him\nquestioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at\nTAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking\naway. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers\nher the flask. Her eyes widen.\n\n\t\tJANE (v-o continues)\n\t...I now believe that was best kept between\n\tthe two of them...\n\nAfter a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask\nand has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY,\nwho hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her\nmother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL\nsmiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as\nif to say, \"Isn't it a terrible thing?\" MRS.

A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT, FEATURING ANDY AND HALLER\n</b>\nANDY hops off the bar to face HALLER directly. In the b.g.\nwe see HERB KINCAID (KINCAID, by the way, should be wearing\na black armband- he's come directly from his son's funeral).\n\n\t\tHALLER (without much force)\n\tWe'll catch him.\n\n<b>\t\tANDY\n</b>\tYou couldn't catch a cold.\n\nHALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the\ncrowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we\nsee an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLER\nspeaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation.\n\n<b>\t\tHALLER\n</b>\tThe law has a name for what you men are\n\tplanning. It's private justice, and private\n\tjustice is about a step and a half away\n\tfrom lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no\n\tJ. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's\n\tMills, and I want you men to go home.\n\nThey shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down. He is\ngetting to them.\n\n<b>\t\tANDY\n</b>\tDon't let this guy scare you! What's he done\n\tsince this thing started but hang his face out?\n\nIt's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with both\nANDY and themselves.\n\n\t\tANDY (louder)\n\tHe ain't got so much as a fingerprint!\n\n<b>\t\tOWEN KNOPFLER\n</b>\tAh, shut up, Andy.\n\n<b>\t\tANDY\n</b>\tDon't tell me to-\n\nHERB KINCAID steps forward.\n\n<b>\t\tHERB\n</b>\tYes. Correct. Shut up.\n\nANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looks\ngrimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze.\n\n\t\tHERB (quietly)\n\tI just came from my boy's funeral.\n\n<b>\t\tHALLER\n</b>\tHerb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken\n\tyou must be...but-\n\n\t\tHERB (quietly)\n\tHe was torn apart.\n\nUtter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring,\nrapt.\n\n<b>\t\tHALLER\n</b>\tYes. Yes, but-\n\n\t\tHERB (still quiet)\n\tUpset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say.\n\tConstable, you don't know what those words\n\tmean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces!\n\nHERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his\nface.\n\n<b>\t\tHERB\n</b>\tMy son was torn to pieces!\n\t\t(turning back to HALLER)\n\tYou come in here and talk to these men\n\tabout private justice. You dare to do that.\n\tConstable Haller, why don't you go out to\n\tHarmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady\n\tand explain to him about private justice.\n\tWould you want to do that?\n\nHALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet.\n\n<b>\t\tHERB\n</b>\tNo. I thought not.\n\t\t(to the others)\n\tYou folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't\n\task anyone to do anything that runs counter\n\tto his conscience. As for me... I'm going out\n\tand hunt up a little private justice.\n\nANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously at\nthe slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Other\nmen start to follow.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  OWEN'S PUB\n</b>\nMen are streaming out, getting into station wagons and\npickup trucks. Engines roar into life. They begin backing\nout even as more men come out of the pub. We even hear some\nhigh-spirited yells; they are on their way and their blood\nis up.\n\n\n<b>INT.  OWEN'S PUB\n</b>\nLESTER LOWE, looking more distressed than ever, pushes his\nway through the men toward the door, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS.\nHe grabs BILLY McCLAREN.\n\n<b>\t\tLOWE\n</b>\tBilly... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can...\n\n\t\tBILLY (not looking at LOWE)\n\tJoe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be.\n\nHe pushes outside. LOWE looks around wildly; his face says\nhe can't believe this is happening. He grabs PORTER\nZINNEMAN, then, as PORTER shoves by him, at a couple of\nothers with mounting desperation.\n\nHALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd and\ndraws him aside.\n\n<b>\t\tHALLER\n</b>\tLet them go.\n\n<b>\t\tLOWE\n</b>\tBut-\n\n<b>\t\tHALLER\n</b>\tThis is that spirit of community you were\n\ttalking about.

To benefit\n\tthe Medcu van, of course.\n\nHALLER laughs.\n\n<b>\t\tLOWE\n</b>\tBut can't we do anything?\n\nOWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over one\nshoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries the\npeacemaker bat.\n\n<b>\t\tHALLER\n</b>\tSure. We can pray to Christ that none of them\n\tget killed.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  OUTSIDE OWEN'S\n</b>\nMore cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford\n\"woody\" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standing\nimpatiently by the driver's side door.

ELMER screams.\n\n<b>\t\tELMER\n</b>\tDon't pull me!

The bottom is\nfilled with a still ground mist. A few bushes poke out of\nit. There are woods on the far side.\n\n\t\tANDY (pointing across)\n\tIt came from over there.\n\n<b>\t\tBOBBY ROBERTSON\n</b>\tAs far as I could tell, it could have come\n\tfrom anywhere.\n\n<b>\t\tANDY\n</b>\tWe'll spread out in a skirmish line.

EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSE\n</b>\nHe's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION,\nthat's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap.\nHe tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. He\ngoes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, and\nthen it disappears.\n\n<b>SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING.\n</b>\nROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of a\ndrowning man. Then it's gone. ROUNDS is gone.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

Come on!\n\nThe WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist.\n\nUncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his\nhands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The\npeacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down.\nBonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN\nshrieks.\n\n\t\tOWEN (voice)\n\tCome on, you bastard!\n\nThe peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands\nholding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends.\nBonk!

We hear the\nCLANG of a wrench on the cement inside.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE GARAGE  DAY\n</b>\nUNCLE AL and MARTY are working on the engine of the Silver\nBullet. UNCLE AL has a six-pack of beer that he's working\nthrough. He and MARTY sit on the floor. As they talk, UNCLE\nAL unscrews the last bolt holding the Bullet's carburetor\nand pulls it off.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tIt isn't enough that the monster killed all\n\tthose people- that he killed Brady. Now he's\n\tgot them to cancel the fair.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tAnd the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.\n\nMARTY hands him a medium-sized carton with the words \"Speed\nShop\" printed on it.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tYeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's\n\tall I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing\n\tthat is just a... a...\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tIt's just an outward symbol of everything\n\tthat's inwardly wrong in this town.

Hand me that\n\tadjustable.\n\nMARTY does. UNCLE AL slides the carb onto the gasket and\nstarts attaching bolts.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tThe guy killed your best friend, drove your\n\tgirl out of town, and stole the second-best\n\tholiday in the year.

Go for it.\n\nMARTY pushes the starter. The engine starts at once, but the\ntone is entirely different. Before, MARTY'S wheelchair was a\npoppety-popping pussycat. Now the engine rumbles like a\nhood's street rod idling at a traffic light.\n\nMARTY looks startled.\n\n\t\tUNCLE AL (grinning)\n\tGun it.\n\nMARTY guns it. The engine roars.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tJesus!

Take it down the\n\troad a ways and back. Be careful.\n\nMARTY puts the Bullet in gear and pulls away.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET\n</b>\nCAMERA TRACKS HIM up the road. He goes slowly at first, but\nhe lets it out a little after a while. He's really moving\nalong- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour. The wind blows the\nhair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying\nthis.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  UNCLE AL, WATCHING\n</b>\nHe drinks some beer. He's grinning, happy for MARTY.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET\n</b>\nHe slows down, turns, stops. He revs the engine. VROOM!\n<b>VRROOM!\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S MOTOR, CU\n</b>\nA lot of changes back here. It looks almost like a motorcyle\nengine now. That chromed-silver carb predominates.\n\n<b>SOUND: VAROOOOOOOM!\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY, CU\n</b>\nGrinning. Looking at:\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, MARTY'S POV\n</b>\nIt's about a quarter of a mile away.\n\n\n<b>EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET\n</b>\nHe winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver\nBullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts\nback on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that\nof an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a\nmotorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on\nhis face.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, MEDIUM-LONG\n</b>\nRoaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke\njetting from the exhaust. MARTY is plastered back in the\nseat with the footrest pointing up at an angle. He's\nlaughing like a lunatic.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  UNCLE AL, PEEKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS\n</b>\n\t\tUNCLE AL (to himself)\n\tThe kid's dead meat. What have I done?\n\t\t(shouts)\n\tPut a rock in it, Marty!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY IN THE BULLET\n</b>\nHe uses the hand brakes. SOUND of braking and squealing\nrubber.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY AND UNCLE AL\n</b>\nThe Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near\nUNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns\nthe engine once and then lets it idle.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tYou gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm\n\tdying. I hope you're happy, because you\n\tare looking at a dying man.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tIt really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tIt goes fast, all right- and if your mother\n\tfinds out just how fast, Marty, I will have\n\ta new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna\n\tBoys' Choir.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tI don't get you.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tI know you don't. But I want this to be our\n\tsecret. You get that, don't you?\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tSure.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tGood.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON\n</b>\nThe last bit of daylight is just filtering away.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD\n</b>\nThe barbecue is over. BOB and JANE are putting lawn chairs\non the back porch. MARTY, NAN, and UNCLE AL are all in the\nf.g.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tI've got to go, Nan- I had a wonderful time.\n\nHe kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him.\n\n<b>\t\tNAN\n</b>\tSo have I, actually... I wish it could always\n\tbe like this.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tSee me around to my car, Marty, and make sure\n\tI stay out of trouble at least that long.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tOkay.\n\nHe and UNCLE AL go around to the driveway. NAN looks at them\nwith troubled love.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL\n</b>\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tNow I said I had something for you, as\n\tI believe you will recall.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tYeah! What is it?\n\nAL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper\nshopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens\nthe bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches\nin and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers,\nRoman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc.\n\nAn expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he\ninventories these goodies.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tYou're gonna have the Fourth of July in\n\tOctober, Marty. Just don't blow your head\n\toff. (Pause) And remember that it isn't\n\tjust the fireworks. It's because no crazy\n\tshithead should be able to stop the good\n\tguys, if you can dig that.\n\n\t\tMARTY (respectfully)\n\tI can dig it- thank you, Uncle Al! Thank you!\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tStay near the house, for Christ's sake-\n\tsomeone's killing people. I have to be out of\n\tmy mind to be doing this, you know.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tYeah, I know. It's great!\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tOne of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that\n\tyou're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't\n\tset off anything that goes bang tonight, okay?\n\tJust bright colors. Can you tell the difference?\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tYeah... sure.\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tSave this one for last.\n\nHe brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. A\nfat fuse sticks out behind the head.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tWhat is it?\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tA tracer. You'll like it.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tThanks a million, Uncle Al!\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tYou're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em\n\tin the bushes for now.\n\nMARTY motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a\nline of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. UNCLE AL gets\nin his car and starts it up. MARTY comes back.\n\n\t\tUNCLE AL (grinning)\n\tHave a good time, dear boy! And watch out\n\tfor the werewolves!\n\nHe leaves. MARTY sits in his wheelchair, waving.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT\n</b>\nThere's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Now\nthe window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps the\ndownspout and begins working his way down. This should not\nbe too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong\nMARTY'S arms are.\n\nHis legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When he\nreaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple\nunder him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the\nback porch.\n\nMARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under a\ntarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside and\ngets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the\nporch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom he\nlooks up at:\n\n\n<b>EXT.  AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW, MARTY'S POV  NIGHT\n</b>\nStill a light on up there.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET\n</b>\n\t\tMARTY (whispers)\n\tShit!\n\nThinks a bit, then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward:\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE PATH BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE GARAGE\n</b>\nMARTY comes slowly up the path. We hear soft grunts of\nexertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of\nsilence, and it's hard work. He stops at the line of bushes\nand gets the bag of fireworks. He puts it on his lap and\nstarts moving again.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, FROM THE ROAD\n</b>\nThe driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easily\nout to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowly\nalong the verge of the highway, still using his hands. We\ncan see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turns\nback once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He's\nnot going to be deprived of his treat.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes the\nstarter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some\nmore. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary\nchoke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. It\ncranks, but doesn't start.\n\nMARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries\nagain. This time, after the engine has cranked over a few\ntimes, it starts.\n\n\t\tMARTY (softly)\n\tAll right!\n\nHe puts it in gear and starts off.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY, EXTREMELY LONG\n</b>\nWhat we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along\na dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars.\n\nDISTANT SOUND: The Bullet's engine.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  A ROADSIDE TURNOUT  NIGHT\n</b>\nSOUND: Fast-rushing water.\n\nThe turnout is packed dirt. There's a grove of trees with\npicnic tables spotted among them at the back. The sign in\nthe extreme f.g. reads ROADSIDE REST AREA at the top; AUGER\nFALLS in the middle; TOWNSHIP OF TARKER'S MILLS at the\nbottom.\n\nSOUND: The Silver Bullet approaching.\n\nMARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. He\nstops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of\nfireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time\nselecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a whole\ncellar of rare bottles to choose from. At last he chooses a\ntwizzer. He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top\nand lights the fuse.\n\nWhen it starts to fizz, MARTY tosses it high into the air.\n\n\t\tMARTY (soft)\n\tHere's one for the good guys!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE TWIZZER\n</b>\nIt flies in an arc over the drop.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE TWIZZER, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT\n</b>\nTHE CAMERA TRACKS ITS FALL onto some rocks at the edge of\nthe waterfall's catch pool.\n\nSOUND: Growling.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE CREEK, WITH THE WEREWOLF\n</b>\nIt has been drinking from the creek. It looks more than half\nhuman now- we would be able to recognize it for sure, but\nits face is in shadow.\n\nIt turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE TWIZZER, ON THE ROCKS\n</b>\nIt's guttering out. A hand-paw touches it and draws back\nquickly.\n\nSOUND: Hurt, angry growl.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY, IN THE REST AREA\n</b>\nHe's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pauses\nand looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but the\nwaterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it\non the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet.\n\nThe fountain bursts into a shower of light.\n\n\t\tMARTY (delighted)\n\tAll right!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE SLOPE OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG\n</b>\nThe waterfall is in the b.g.\n\nThe WEREWOLF is climbing the rocky slope.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU\n</b>\nIt goes out.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle.\nHe plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse. The\nRoman candle shoots into the sky.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE ROMAN CANDLE\n</b>\nBursts into colored light.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG\n</b>\nIt GROWLS... and shakes its fists at the fading light in the\nsky.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in\nthe other. He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall.\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tIs someone there?\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT\n</b>\nIt freezes, GROWLING FAINTLY.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nWith a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and\nsets it on the ground, as before.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE BACK OF THE GROVE, AT THE TOP OF THE CUT\n</b>\nClaw-hands settle over the top.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU\n</b>\nIt throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to die\ndown.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice\nwhen he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE GROVE, WITH THE WEREWOLF\n</b>\nIt's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing it\naside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree.\nAlthough the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this as\neasily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a\nThanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside and\nadvances, hunched over on two legs.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\n\t\tMARTY (terrified)\n\tWho's there?\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA, MARTY'S POV\n</b>\nThe grove is a darkened shadowland.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks and\ncranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire,\nalternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with\nterrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE GROVE, MARTY'S POV\n</b>\nHere it comes, out of the shadows, closing in.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nWorking that starter for all it's worth... but the motor\nonly cranks. Still no start.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  CLAWED, FURRY FEET\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic table\nwhere the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets the\nmatches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptly\ndrops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, MARTY'S POV\n</b>\nWe can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much\ncloser.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same\ntime.\nHe can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He\nputs the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries\nagain.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS\n</b>\nHe strikes the match... too hard! It bends, the neck broken.\n\n\t\tMARTY (voice; moaning)\n\tOh, please...\n\n\n<b>EXT.  WEREWOLF CLAWS, OPENING AND CLOSING\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe is in an extremity of terror.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS, CU\n</b>\nHe pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it. It\nlights.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WEREWOLF\n</b>\nIt recoils- we still can't see its face except for a vague\nshadow.\n\n(NOTE: I keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this is\nnot a full-moon period. I've been going on the assumption\nthat the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness,\ntoothiness, hairiness, etc., starting with a partial change\nat about the second quarter. It's a process like the tide\ncoming in. Thus, if we saw MARTY'S attacker clearly at this\npoint, I think we would recognize him.)\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET\n</b>\nHe takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to\nthe fuse. It splutters alight.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY AND THE WEREWOLF, A WIDER SHOT\n</b>\nThe WEREWOLF is less than twenty feet away. The tracer\nflares alight and shoots out of MARTY'S hand, leaving a\npink-orange trail of smoke behind it. The missile flies at\nthe WEREWOLF's head.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WEREWOLF\n</b>\nThe tracer strikes it in the face, and we see a flash of\nfire. The WEREWOLF screams and blunders away.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET\n</b>\nHe punches the starter again. The motor cranks.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE MOTOR OF THE SILVER BULLET\n</b>\nThe motor coughs and fires; a big blue flame jumps from the\nfancy carb... and the engine starts to run.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE WEREWOLF\n</b>\nIt's staggering away, ROARING and HOWLING. The tube of the\ntracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye, in\nfact- like an Indian's arrow. The WEREWOLF smashes branches\nout of its way.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET\n</b>\nHe wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gasping\nand weeping with fear.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

JANE\n</b>\nShe utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall,\nbumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an\noverhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING\nseveral. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then\nslowly bends toward the object and picks it up.\n\nJANE holds it, both puzzled and scared.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE BACK DOOR OF THE RECTORY\n</b>\nJANE approaches it, holding a piece of paper in her hand-\nher tally sheet. She knocks. Waits. There is no answer. She\nknocks again. Waits. No answer.

She approaches the mailbox,\nopens the mailbox door, and then glances at the envelope\nagain.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

As MARTY\nhas a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does\nLOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car.\n\n\n<b>INT.

He goes inside.\n\n\t\tJANE (voice-over)\n\tUncle Al's friend Mac was more than a\n\tgunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an\n\told-world craftsman, a sort of wizard\n\tof weapons.\n\nb.) In the gun shop interior, we see UNCLE AL talking to\nMAC, who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a\nkind of Gandalf figure. In the b.g. window we see a paper\nskeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that All\nHallow's Eve is nearing. UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly,\nusing his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale\nis, but it must be a whopper. In the course of it, he hands\nthe medal and the crucifix to MAC, who tents the silver\nchains over his fingers and looks at them.\n\n\t\tJANE (v-o continues)\n\tGod knows what sort of story my uncle\n\ttold him, but I think that for men who\n\thave been married as often as Uncle Al,\n\tinvention on short notice becomes\n\tsomething of a specialty.\n\nc.)

In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcerer\nthan ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin\nmelting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible.

THE HALLWAY FLOOR, WITH THE BULLET, SLOW MOTION\n</b>\nIn the extreme f.g. is a heating vent. The bullet is rolling\ntoward it.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MARTY AND JANE\n</b>\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tGet the gun!\n\nHe uses his hands to propel the ungainly Silver Bullet into\nthe hall.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE BULLET (THE REAL BULLET) AND MARTY, SLOW MOTION\n</b>\nThe silver bullet rolls slowly toward the heating vent. In\nthe b.g. we see a frantic MARTY in his wheelchair.\n\nHe heaves himself out of it and falls full-length, grabbing.\n\nHis fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in\nthe heating vent.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU\n</b>\nIt's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE\n</b>\nUNCLE AL lies senseless against one wall, the front of his\nshirt bloody. JANE runs into the corner and grabs the\npistol.\n\nThe WEREWOLF picks up the easy chair and throws it through\nthe hole it made coming in. It picks up an end table and\nhurls it through the TV. Then it sees JANE and starts toward\nher.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JANE, COWERING IN THE CORNER\n</b>\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU\n</b>\nComes toward her.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JANE IN THE CORNER\n</b>\nShe makes as if to run one way.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF\n</b>\nIt's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is\ntoying with her- it's making this reeeal slow.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE FIREPLACE TOOLS, CU\n</b>\nA bloodstained hand grabs a poker.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF AND JANE\n</b>\nAs it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and\nstrikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING.\n\nUNCLE AL hits it between the legs.\n\nIt BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it\naside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that\nnow it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JANE\n</b>\nShe breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward\nthe door. Most of the way there she trips and falls.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU\n</b>\nIts head whips around.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL\n</b>\nHe's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille\noff. One arm is down inside.\n\n\t\tMARTY (scream)\n\tJaney! The gun! THE GUN!\n\n\n<b>INT.  JANE\n</b>\nShe tosses it awkwardly.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE GUN, SLOW MOTION\n</b>\nIt slides down the hall floor to MARTY like some strange,\nawkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF\n</b>\n\t\tWEREWOLF (snarls)\n\tMaa-aaa-rty...\n\nIt begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing\nthings out of its way.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL\n</b>\nThe gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the\nheating duct again...\n\n\n<b>INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU\n</b>\nThere's an elbow bend just below MARTY'S twisting, grasping\nfingers- the silver bullet lies here. It's less than half an\ninch out of reach.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU\n</b>\n\t\tWEREWOLF (foaming)\n\tMaaa-aaa-rty...\n\n\n<b>INT.  JANE, ON THE FLOOR\n</b>\n\t\tJANE (sobbing)\n\tDon't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother!\n\nShe bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes.\n\n\n<b>INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF\n</b>\nIt roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back\ninto the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this\nis going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't\nhave to pay for.\n\n<b>\t\tWEREWOLF\n</b>\tReeeal slow, Maa-aaarty-\n\n\n<b>INT.  MARTY, CU\n</b>\nHe's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the\napproaching WEREWOLF.\n\n\n<b>INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU\n</b>\nMARTY'S fingers brush the bullet once... again... seize it.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL\n</b>\nHe rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet\nblindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the\ncylinder closed.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU\n</b>\n<b>\t\tWEREWOLF\n</b>\tBastard Marty!\n\n\n<b>INT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe points the gun and pulls the trigger. There's only a\nclick. An expression of dismay on his face.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU\n</b>\n<b>\t\tWEREWOLF\n</b>\tKill you...\n\n\n<b>INT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHe drags himself so he's half propped against the hall wall.\nHe pulls the trigger again. Click! Dismay becomes fear.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF\n</b>\nIt's reached the Silver Bullet. It smashes it aside. The\nBullet hits the wall.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MARTY\n</b>\nHolding the gun in both hands now, he pulls the trigger a\nthird time. Click!\n\nThe WEREWOLF'S shadow falls over him.\n\n\n<b>INT.  WEREWOLF, ECU\n</b>\n<b>\t\tWEREWOLF\n</b>\tBastard Marty!\n\nIt bends down, reaching.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MARTY, ECU\n</b>\nCraning back as if to drive himself into the wall, he pulls\nthe trigger again.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE BARREL OF THE .22 MAXI-CLOSE\n</b>\nThe bullet flies from the barrel, gleaming silver.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF\n</b>\nThe silver bullet strikes him in his one remaining eye. He\nflies backward, hands clapped to his gushing face... and\ncrashes into MARTY'S Silver Bullet wheelchair. It sits\nthere, roaring... and then it begins to change.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JANE\n</b>\nShe lies there, sobbing.\n\n\t\tUNCLE AL (voice)\n\tYou okay, Janey?\n\n\n<b>INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE\n</b>\nUNCLE AL is bloody and staggering but on his feet. He helps\nJANE up.\n\n<b>\t\tJANE\n</b>\tI'm all right... but Marty! Ma-\n\n<b>SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR.\n</b>\n\n<b>INT.  THE WEREWOLF, ECU\n</b>\nIts hands drop from its face. It is now blind in both eyes;\nit is half WEREWOLF and half LOWE.\n\nIt BELLOWS again, convulses... and dies.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MARTY, ON THE FLOOR\n</b>\n\t\tMARTY (calls)\n\tI'm all right. He's dead.\n\n\n<b>INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE\n</b>\nHere's a creature that is mostly FATHER LOWE collapsed in\nthe remains of MARTY'S wheelchair; beyond it, MARTY is lying\non the floor. UNCLE AL goes by the corpse. JANE starts by...\nand LOWE sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at\nher.\n\nShe shrieks and darts aside. LOWE falls back, now really\ndead. I think. Until the sequel.\n\n\n<b>INT.  THE HALL, WITH UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY\n</b>\nUNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing\nagain- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and\ndraws her down beside himself and MARTY.\n\n\t\tUNCLE AL (to MARTY)\n\tThere. I told you there weren't any such\n\tthings as werewolves.\n\nThey smile at each other with love.\n\n\t\tJANE (nervous)\n\tAre you sure it's dead? Or him? Or\n\twhatever it is?\n\n<b>\t\tUNCLE AL\n</b>\tIf it isn't now, it will be after I pound\n\tone of your mother's silver candlesticks\n\tthrough its heart.\n\n\t\tJANE (grimaces)\n\tOh Uncle Al, no!\n\n\t\tUNCLE AL (grim)\n\tOh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I\n\tbelieve it all the way.\n\nHe gets up and leaves.\n\n<b>\t\tJANE\n</b>\tAre you all right, Marty?\n\n<b>\t\tMARTY\n</b>\tAll except my legs...
