ADJACENT TUNNEL\n</b>\n               Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully \n               drags himself over. Liz's body is on the floor.\n\n               Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz's \n               head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest \n               and whispers in her ear.\n\n               A beat or two, then a moan.\n\n<b>                                     LIZ\n</b>                         In the dark -- I heard your voice -- \n                         What -- did you say -- ?\n\n               He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.\n\n<b>                                     HELLBOY\n</b>                         \"You, on the other side: let her go. \n                         Because for her, for her -- I'll \n                         die.

Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as \n               what he is: the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her \n               body.\n\n               Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated \n               by the flames.\n\n               Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom \n               Waits' CINNY'S WALTZ fills the air.\n\n<b>                                                                  FADE OUT:\n</b>\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Hellboy</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Mike Mignola\" title=\"Scripts by Mike Mignola\">Mike Mignola</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Guillermo del Toro\" title=\"Scripts by Guillermo del Toro\">Guillermo del Toro</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Peter Briggs\" title=\"Scripts by Peter Briggs\">Peter Briggs</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Hellboy Script.html#comments\" title=\"Hellboy comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:07:12.754791"}
