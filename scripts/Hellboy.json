Sammael misses: the tip imbeds itself in \n               the floor and then -- TCHAKKK!!! -- in a concrete column. \n               Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS \n               from the fleeing public.\n\n               A mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling, \n               steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant.\n\n               Sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars --\n\n               Then, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy's \n               stone hand emerges, triumphant.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         Hey, Chunk-face!\n\n               He climbs out of the crater.

It embeds \n               itself in the tile wall.\n\n               Sammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut.\n\n               Hellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second  \n               mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor, \n               scraping a jagged line with his stone hand.\n\n               He slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit \n               subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a \n               wooden bench, breaking it in two.\n\n               Sammael climbs up into the mezzanine.\n\n               Hellboy gets up -- his back bristling with glass shards -- \n               and hears a WAIL: a YOUNG GIRL is pointing at A BOX OF KITTENS \n               abandoned on a bench.\n\n                                     YOUND GIRL\n                         My kittens!!

Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!! \n               Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench.\n\n               Next, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking \n               citizens.\n\n               Illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances, \n               blood dripping from his forehead and nose.\n\n               Hellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots \n               out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps \n               the tongue with his stone hand --\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         Second date.

The kittens are \n               fine.\n\n               Using the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window.\n\n               Sammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself \n               and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel. \n               From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged \n               glass.\n\n               Sammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel.\n\n               Hellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is \n               millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems \n               lost, when...\n\n               WHAAAAA!!!!!!

She looks \n               around and sees BROOM coming down the hall.\n\n                                     BROOM\n                         Welcome back.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                         It's only for the weekend, Professor \n                         Broom.

We've made quite \n                         a few changes --\n\n               CRASH!!! Liz screams and Myers draws his gun. Smashing through \n               a glass partition, the mangled steel LOCKER lands in the \n               middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs.\n\n               Next, Manning appears, retreating but unharmed.\n\n                                     MANNING\n                              (gasping)\n                         I want that thing locked up, starting \n                         now -- Now!!!

Home, sweet home.\n\n               Mortified, Broom hurries after Manning. Hellboy calmly steps \n               through the hole in the wall.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                              (seeing her)\n                         Liz?

B.P.R.D. - LIZ'S ROOM - DAY\n\n               A familiar cell. Fireproof insulation covers the walls. Liz \n               throws her bags on the bed. Myers lingers in the doorway.\n\n               She reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist, \n               then lets it snap.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                         A little something I learned in \n                         therapy.

HELLBOY'S DEN - DUSK\n\n               A cat bats at a ball of paper. On it, two words are visible: \n               DEAR LIZ. Hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it \n               in a brimming wastebasket.\n\n               He's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration, \n               writing with evident difficulty. The floor around him is \n               covered with more crumpled pages. In the background, the \n               projector is showing DUCK SOUP. Myers pushes in a cartload \n               of CHILI.\n\n                                     MYERS\n                         Where do you --\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         Shh!

Silence --\n\n               SWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping \n               into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill -- \n\n               -- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen \n               bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate \n               blocks.\n\n               Kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         Screw that.\n\n               Hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig.

He and \n               Manning drop through, along with the phonograph.\n\n               Hellboy grabs a rope. It spins through a copper pulley, but \n               a large knot jerks him to a stop. Hellboy snatches Manning's \n               hand, but loses his backpack.\n\n               He looks down.

Wet earth drops onto their shoulders. \n               They draw their arms close to their bodies, pointing their \n               flashlight beams straight down. A moment of strange intimacy.\n\n                                     MYERS\n                         But it's not true, is it?\n\n                                     LIZ\n                         What -- ?\n\n                                     MYERS\n                         That you feel that way about me.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                         You want to know -- Now -- ?

TUNNEL \"C\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY\n\n               Hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for \n               handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath.\n\n               Light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly \n               hear Liz and Myers.\n\n               INT. TUNNEL \"B\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY\n\n               Liz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel \"B\". They find \n               themselves calf-deep in brown water.\n\n               Myers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone.\n\n                                     MYERS\n                         Watch out.

His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex \n               natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent \n               eggs.\n\n               SAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand \n               still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils \n               constrict. A snarl...\n\n               A SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself \n               off. A THIRD ONE raise its head.\n\n               Myers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right \n               behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!!\n\n               Myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up \n               the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers \n               falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                              (into the radio)\n                         Marco, Marco, Marco...

TUNNEL \"C\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY\n\n               Hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!!\n\n               The rocks below him start to crumble.\n\n               EXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY\n\n               In an \"ANT FARM\" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above, \n               pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers.\n\n               INT. TUNNEL \"B\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY\n\n               Dust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures \n               move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three \n               times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with \n               pebbles.\n\n               One of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy \n               crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along \n               with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed.\n\n               Two eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels \n               are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two \n               new ones. Liz sprints to safety.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two \n                         alone.\n\n               Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz.\n\n               Lit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One \n               clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy \n               howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a \n               zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back.\n\n               Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest \n               of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born. \n               They're FIVE.\n\n               Hellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. \n               A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy \n               is in trouble.\n\n               Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her \n               body.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                              (at Myers)\n                         Hit me.\n\n                                     MYERS\n                         What?\n\n               Liz is desperate, crying.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                         Hit me --\n                              (beat)\n                         All of my life I've run away from \n                         it... Now I want it to happen! Do \n                         it.\n\n               Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. \n               Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers.\n\n                                     MYERS\n                         I can't, I --\n\n               Liz slaps him.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                         I know now: I love him. I've always \n                         loved him.\n\n               A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, \n               once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around \n               her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                         Go now.\n\n               Myers ducks behind a rock as Liz's arms blaze with fire.\n\n               The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce.\n\n               On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion \n               hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees \n               Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                              (weak)\n                         Liz...\n\n               The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of \n               fire expands.\n\n               The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all.\n\n               INT. TUNNEL \"B\" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA -  DAY\n\n               The screen FADES TO WHITE and then...\n\n               Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat.\n\n               Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels. \n               The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He \n               stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried \n               in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground, \n               on her side, unconscious.\n\n               Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly, \n               Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness, \n               he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd \n               comedy.\n\n               Ilsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him \n               with a hammer --\n\n               FADE OUT / FADE IN\n\n               OMIT\n\n               INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT\n\n               Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden \n               yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church-\n               like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding \n               swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR \n               SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar.\n\n               Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on \n               the explosive belts.\n\n               Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under \n               his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab \n               bought from Lapikov.\n\n               Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial \n               robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, \n               he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.\n\n                                     GRIGORY\n                         \"And I looked and beheld an Angel, \n                         and in his hand the key to the \n                         bottomless pit...\"\n\n               Hellboy tenses, rage building.

The rough hemp cuts his \n               skin, but he manages to free one hand.\n\n               EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT\n\n               OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs \n               uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the \n               frame.\n\n               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT\n\n               Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He \n               turns it.\n\n               Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it --\n\n               INT. THE SKY - NIGHT\n\n               IN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN \n               TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE.\n\n               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT\n\n               Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs.\n\n                                     GRIGORY\n                         The final seal. Open it!\n\n               Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn \n               it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers \n               her full in the face. She staggers back and down.\n\n                                     MYERS\n                              (to Hellboy)\n                         Remember who you are!!!\n\n               He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy \n               catches it. It smokes in his hand.\n\n               He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts.\n\n               Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint \n               of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory.\n\n               With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with \n               both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the \n               stumps.\n\n               He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees, \n               holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn.\n\n               The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers \n               and the connection with the moon is broken.\n\n               Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent. \n               The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended.\n\n               Grigory crumples in agony.\n\n               The burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his \n               features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet.\n\n                                     GRIGORY\n                         You will never fulfill your destiny. \n                         You will never understand the power \n                         inside you.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         I can live with that.\n\n               He breaks Myers' chains, helps him up.\n\n               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT\n\n               Hellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers \n               stands by his side.\n\n               He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down \n               the steps.\n\n               Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed \n               GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER.\n\n                                     GRIGORY\n                         Child...\n\n               Hellboy turns. Grigory, on his knees, smiles.\n\n                                     GRIGORY\n                              (dying)\n                         Look what you've done --\n\n               He looks up. In his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift \n               lazily.\n\n                                     GRIGORY\n                         You've killed me -- an insignificant \n                         man... but you have brought forth a \n                         God.\n\n               He uncovers his abdomen. Long, fleshy pseudopods spill out \n               of the wound, like intestines.\n\n               A large entity erupts from Grigory's torso and claws the \n               air.\n\n                                     GRIGORY\n                         Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian \n                         of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.\n\n               Covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi-tentacled shape --\n               BABY BEHEMOTH -- lands on the stone slab. The squirming flesh \n               surges up like greasy pink foam. Growing exponentially by \n               the second.\n\n               Ilsa kneels and embraces Grigory's corpse. Kisses him on the \n               mouth. A gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.\n\n                                     ILSA\n                         Hell will hold no surprises for us.\n\n               A tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.\n\n               INT. CATACOMBS - ADJACENT TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\n               In a passageway, Hellboy carefully hands Liz's body over to \n               Myers.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll \n                         deal with whatever's back there.\n\n                                     MYERS\n                         Alone?\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         How big can it be?\n\n               As if in response, a massive tentacle fills the tunnel, \n               reaching for him. Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash \n               onto HELLBOY\u00b4S head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed, \n               finally confronting --\n\n               INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT\n\n               BEHEMOTH!!! The size of a house --\n\n               Hellboy -- head smoking -- writhes in the grip of the \n               tentacle. It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling.\n\n               As he arcs back down, ABM!! -- he cracks the floor wide open. \n               Next to him: the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to \n               grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way.\n\n               The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce \n               off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding \n               cogwheels and gears.\n\n               Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble \n               statue.\n\n               Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth. \n               FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the \n               floor, rolling into the crack.\n\n               From out of Behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles \n               replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy's \n               face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward.\n\n               He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to \n               grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice, \n               onto the first ledge. It crumbles!!\n\n               The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide \n               away.\n\n               A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second, \n               he grabs the belts with his tail.\n\n               The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens \n               in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever \n               seen.\n\n               Hellboy's tail passes him the belts.\n\n               The timers on them are crushed. A spark spurts: Useless.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         They never work --\n\n               He wraps them around his stone arm.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         Ugh -- Now, this is gonna hurt --\n\n               He pulls the pin on all the explosives. BEHEMOTH drops him \n               into a squid-like beak and gulps him down.\n\n               After a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature's \n               innards. Then --\n\n               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT\n\n               A surge of light roils within the thing, outlining the pulpy \n               organs. The creature starts to burn.\n\n               OMIT\n\n               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT\n\n               A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth \n               is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh.\n\n               Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!!\n\n               With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing \n               Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light. \n               Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.\n\n               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT\n\n               Hellboy stands, covered in goo. Two final shockwaves of light \n               ripple over the ground.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         Ouch -- It did hurt.\n\n               INT. ADJACENT TUNNEL\n\n               Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully \n               drags himself over. Liz's body is on the floor.\n\n               Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz's \n               head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest \n               and whispers in her ear.\n\n               A beat or two, then a moan.\n\n                                     LIZ\n                         In the dark -- I heard your voice -- \n                         What -- did you say -- ?\n\n               He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.\n\n                                     HELLBOY\n                         \"You, on the other side: let her go. \n                         Because for her, for her -- I'll \n                         die.

Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as \n               what he is: the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her \n               body.\n\n               Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated \n               by the flames.\n\n               Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom \n               Waits' CINNY'S WALTZ fills the air.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nHellboy\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Mike Mignola\u00a0\u00a0Guillermo del Toro\u00a0\u00a0Peter Briggs\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Action\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:26:45.904167"}
