The eye of the storm is\n    Clyde on the lawn, hugging his knees, fetal with horror and\n    grief.

Losing your wife and child.\n                 But please try to grasp how limited\n                 our options are.

Now he's killin' me and he\n                  got you people to do it. And that's\n                  a shame. A goddamn shame.

Cantrell is stoic.\n\n     Warden Iger nods to TWO GUARDS manning the LETHAL INJECTION\n     MACHINE, on which EIGHT OVERSIZED GLASS CYLINDERS in a vertical\n     row are the main feature, filled with various clear liquids.\n\n     There are two switches -- one a dummy, the other live (no way\n     to know which is which). The guards power up the machine.\n     Lights activate on the board. Each man grabs a switch, waits.\n\n     Nick watches the wall clock. It hits 7 o'clock. The warden         *\n     nods and the guards flick their switches, quickly leaving the      *\n     room. The warden follows them out, closes the door.\n\n     We hear the pumps quietly activate. Rupert is taking shallow\n     breaths, terrified...then lays back to wait.\n\n     PLUNGER ONE slowly descends, emptying its contents into the\n     I.V. lines...\n\n     Rupert sags as the fast-acting barbiturate spreads through\n     his veins...his breathing slows...his head drops back... he\n     loses consciousness...\n\n     PLUNGER TWO depresses, sending the second vial of liquid into\n     the I.V. lines with a quiet whir of pumps...\n\nBLUE   -   9-19-08                                         16.\n\nPLUNGER THREE activates...then PLUNGER FOUR...the row of\ncylinders emptying in sequence...\n\nRupert lies unconscious, just drifting away...\n\nHe suddenly comes to. He draws in a long, shaky breath. It\ncatches in his throat. His eyes go wide. His entire body starts\nto clench against some increasing pain.\n\nNick is surprised, uncertain. Betsy starts GROWLING SOFTLY at     *\nCantrell's side. Her head comes up, hackles rising.               *\n\nNick glances to the dog...then to Iger, sees the stunned look\non the warden's face. Something is definitely wrong.\n\nThe pumps keep whirring, the plungers keep descending...\n\nRupert he throws his head back, mouth wide...\n\n                              RUPERT\n             Ah...ah...AH!\n\nThe witnesses go tense, confused -- what the hell?\n\n                           RUPERT\n             Ah--ah--Jesus, don't that HURT!\n\nRupert looks down at his arms, his expression turning to sheer\nhorror, because: The veins are turning angry red, then\nblackening, as the liquids course through them...\n\n                           RUPERT\n             OH FUCK, OH FUCK, THAT HUUUURTS!\n\nThose are last coherent words he speaks. From then on, he's\njust shrieking and bouncing against his straps, because:\n\nHis veins are starting to smoke. Noxious and foul. The flesh\nstarts giving away, blood eating though skin like acid.\n\nShock sweeps the onlookers:\n\n                              SARAH\n             Oh, Jesus.\n\n                           CANTRELL\n             What's going on?

Nick pushes his way\n     to the viewing glass, shouting at the techs:\n\n                                NICK\n                  WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON? DO\n                  SOMETHING!\n\n     The techs dash into the chamber -- but are instantly gagging      *\n     and choking on the toxic fumes billowing from Rupert. They        *\n     retreat coughing, pulling the door shut again.                    *\n\n     Rupert's screams spew forth toxic fumes...breath blows smoke\n     from his nostrils...eyes liquefy...he's arching against his\n     restraints so hard that bones begin snapping, blood spewing\n     and smoking through his skin...\n\n     All Nick can do is stand at the glass in horror as whatever\n     is happening runs its course and the victim collapses in a\n     cloudy, toxic haze...\n\n22   EXT.

But the worst part:\n\nTOURNIQUETS are tied on Darby's arms and legs at various\npoints. Darby sees them and starts hyperventilating.\n\n                           CLYDE\n             Oh. These. Don't want you bleeding\n             out. This will take a while.\n\nClyde puts on a thick coat, like a meat-packer's. He returns,\nsorting implements, Darby trying to see.

In case you insist on\n             shutting your eyes.\n\nDarby's screaming -- but with the tetrototoxin in his system,\nall that's coming out is air, like a slow leak.\n\nClyde picks up an object, unfolds it -- a full-body plastic\ncoat. He puts it on over his other coat, as:\n\n                           CLYDE\n             Earlier on the phone? I said I'd\n             get you out? You asked me what it\n             would cost?

Maybe it's my delivery.\n\n     He puts a construction-site face protector atop his head, the\n     kind with a full plastic face shield that can be flipped down.    *\n\n     He turns and undoes the slipknot of a laundry cord stretching     *\n     up to the ceiling. He feeds the cord and a full-length mirror     *\n     tilts down horizontally above the table. Darby finds himself      *\n     staring straight up into it -- he'll see everything.              *\n\n     ANGLE FROM BEHIND VIDEO CAMERA\n\n     The CAMERA'S LCD SCREEN looms large in our shot. The LCD is\n     dark, the camera inactive. It's mounted high on a tripod,\n     aimed down at the table.

You?                        *\n\n     He flips his visor down -- dark, no face visible. He reaches\n     up, turns the camera on. The LCD screen activates.\n\n     ANGLE CLOSES IN until all we see is:\n\n     THE LCD IMAGE. Grainy in low light. Clyde, now faceless behind\n     the visor, crosses to the squirming figure on the table. We\n     hear the CIRCULAR SAW BUILD TO A HIGH SHRIEK...\n\n                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n     ...and the SHRIEKING SAW FADES...\n\n40   HOLD IN BLACK.                                                   40\n\n     THE BLACKNESS OPENS UP -- we're in a cop car's trunk looking\n     up as the lid is opened. A FIGURE in a meat-packing coat looms\n     over us, faceless and scary behind a dark face protector.\n\n     ANGLE INTO TRUNK                                                   *\n\n     reveals OFFICER HILTS hand-cuffed and duct-taped.

He\n     listens for a few beats, trying to get a word in:\n\n                                DUNNIGAN\n                  Yeah, we know. Nick, we know. The\n                  body's been found.

FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             56\n\n     A GIANT EYEBALL stares at us, unnaturally magnified by a\n     tabletop magnifier. The lens is swept aside, revealing:\n\n     Benson Clyde. In addition to the tabletop magnifier, he's\n     wearing MAGNIFYING LENSES on his head. He examines the figurine\n     with his naked eye, then flips the glasses down to continue...\n\n57   EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                       57\n\n     VEHICLES race along two-lane blacktop: CRUISERS, UNMARKED\n     CARS, TACTICAL VANS. A POLICE HELICOPTER skims along just\n     above them at scary-low altitude...\n\n     The cars veer off pavement and up a dirt road, kicking up an\n     awesome trail of dust as the copter sweeps wide, pacing...\n\n58   INT.

He clicks on a\n     tiny fan, holds the figurine under it, giving it a final dry.\n\n60   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             60\n\n     A shitstorm descends: vehicles swerving in, COPS jumping out,\n     machine gun-toting SWAT TACTICAL TROOPS pouring from vans...\n\n61   INT.

Satisfied with it,\n     he places it onto:\n\n     A CHESSBOARD -- the last piece. All the others are also hand-\n     painted, gorgeous. Real craftsmanship here.\n\n     He stands. Calmly moves to the middle of the room. Kicks off\n     his shoes. Peels off his shirt and undershirt. Even takes off\n     his pants. There will be no confusion about hidden weapons.\n\n     He positions himself, very precise and purposeful. Lifts his\n     hands high above his head. Presenting himself. Waiting.\n\n     Then, bam: doors EXPLODE in and windows SHATTER as the SWAT\n     tactical troops storm the room, bad-asses in black, machine\n     guns aimed, encircling him, everybody shouting:\n\n                                SWAT TROOPS\n                  DO NOT MOVE--FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER--\n                  DON'T EVEN TWITCH--WE WILL FIRE\n                  UPON YOU--LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS--\n\n     Clyde is the calm eye of a pissed-off storm of highly\n     professional cops with itchy trigger fingers. He remains\n     serene, looking around at them, hands raised high...\n\n                                SWAT CAPTAIN\n                  ON THE FLOOR! FACE DOWN! DO IT NOW!\n\n     He compliantly goes to his knees, then prone, offers his hands\n     behind his back. They move in, cuff him, as troops spread\n     throughout the house yelling \"Clear!\"\n\n62   EXT.

Nick\n     glances over and sees a perfect 1965 midnight-blue Lincoln\n     Continental in the carport...\n\n     BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          36.\n\n63   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                              63\n\n     Clyde is pulled to his feet just as Nick enters. UNIFORMS\n     spread out, securing the house. Dunnigan faces Clyde...\n\n                                DUNNIGAN\n                  Benson Clyde.

Then his eyes go to a floor-to-ceiling\n     bookcase. He's stunned to realize: they're all law books.\n\n                                GARZA (O.S.)\n                  Check this shit out.\n\n     Nick turns, moves to Garza's side. Dunnigan joins them. All\n     three staring at a wall. ANGLE SHIFTS around to reveal:\n\n     The long-ago PHOTO (clipped from a newspaper) of Nick and\n     Clarence Darby shaking hands on the courthouse steps.\n\n     ANGLE WIDENS to reveal:\n\n     Photo after photo. The crime scene photos...photos of Clyde\n     and his family in happier times...photos clipped from magazines\n     and newspapers about the murder and trial...all very neatly\n     and precisely arrayed. The entire wall covered with them.\n\n     THE MUSIC KEEPS BOOMING from the record player. Dunnigan turns     *\n     TIGHT TO CAMERA and yells:\n\n                                DUNNIGAN\n                  CAN SOMEBODY TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC\n                  OFF, PLEASE?\n\n64   INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY                              64\n\n     Clyde sits alone and isolated in a small room. WIDEN to reveal\n     Sarah at the observation glass. She turns as Nick steps up.\n\n                                SARAH\n                  He says he'll only talk to you.\n\nWHITE   -    9-7-8                                         37.\n\nNick and Dunnigan prepare to go in. Dunnigan takes off his\ngun and holster, lays them on a table, as Garza activates the\nVIDEO. Cantrell finds a chair by feel, sits down, as:\n\nINNER ROOM\n\nNick and Dunnigan enter. Dunnigan melts into a corner to\nobserve as Nick sits across the table from Clyde.\n\n                            CLYDE\n              Counselor.\n\n                            NICK\n              Mr. Clyde.\n\n                            CLYDE\n              Why so formal?

So?\n\n                            CLYDE\n              So. Maybe you can explain what this\n              is all about.\n\nNick almost laughs -- not what he expected to hear.\n\n                            NICK\n              I think that's obvious.\n\nClyde spreads his hands questioningly -- not really.\n\n                            DUNNIGAN\n              You murdered two people.

I knew about Ames, of course.\n               I've been following the news about\n               his horribly botched execution. But\n               Darby too? Quite a coincidence.\n\n                             DUNNIGAN\n               Cut the shit.

One\n               of Darby's drug rivals?

Some kind of mask maybe.\n             But you say it's actually me on the\n             video?

He and Sarah don't speak for long moments --\n      he's waiting for her to pull herself together.\n\n      She finally does, going into professional mode, pulling her\n      laptop and files and reports around her.\n\n                                 SARAH\n                   We got the latest batch of background\n                   in.

She picks\n      up a multi-page list of addresses, hands it to him.\n\n                                 SARAH\n                   This lists over fifty shit-value\n                   properties in industrial zones that\n                   nobody in their right mind would\n                   want to own -- stuff around chemical\n                   plants, factories.

Bordering it, on\n      the other side of some fencing, are municipal train tracks.\n\n      Nick's car pulls up. He gets out. It's a ghost town here.\n\n      BLUE   -   9-19-08                                        104.\n\n      He goes to the garage window -- glass thick with dirt.

We\n      hear CRANKING and the door rises...\n\n      Nick drops down, peering in. He squeezes under the door, stands\n      up. Gloomy in here. He hits the door switch -- it RATTLES up       *\n      on its tracks, flooding the place with light...                    *\n\n      He looks around. Cobwebs. Dust.

It was a bizarre, distinctive sound...like the one\n      Nick heard during his last phone call with Clyde.\n\n      Nick stands frozen, pieces in his head tumbling and threatening\n      to fall into place. Something about the shape of that car\n      under that tarp...\n\n      He turns, staring at it. Goes back in, drawn to it -- it's\n      long, distinctly old-school, with sharp boxy corners...\n\n      He draws the tarp off -- finds a 1965 Lincoln Continental,\n      midnight-blue, in excellent condition. The last time he saw\n      it, it was parked in a carport at Benson Clyde's farmhouse.\n\n      What's it doing here? More pieces falling into place. Nick\n      leaves the garage again, walking out...\n\n      CAMERA TRACKS HIM across the tarmac, and as we come around\n      the corner of the building, we reveal:\n\n      The County Correctional Annex is right there, a backwater\n      corner of the prison not sixty feet away...\n\n      Nick stares up at it -- a very curious location indeed.\n\n178   INT.
