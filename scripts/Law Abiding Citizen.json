But the worst part:\n\nTOURNIQUETS are tied on Darby's arms and legs at various\npoints. Darby sees them and starts hyperventilating.\n\n<b>                           CLYDE\n</b>             Oh.

Maybe it's my delivery.\n\n     He puts a construction-site face protector atop his head, the\n     kind with a full plastic face shield that can be flipped down.    *\n\n     He turns and undoes the slipknot of a laundry cord stretching     *\n     up to the ceiling. He feeds the cord and a full-length mirror     *\n     tilts down horizontally above the table. Darby finds himself      *\n     staring straight up into it -- he'll see everything.              *\n\n<b>     ANGLE FROM BEHIND VIDEO CAMERA\n</b>\n     The CAMERA'S LCD SCREEN looms large in our shot. The LCD is\n     dark, the camera inactive. It's mounted high on a tripod,\n     aimed down at the table.

The LCD screen activates.\n\n     ANGLE CLOSES IN until all we see is:\n\n     THE LCD IMAGE. Grainy in low light. Clyde, now faceless behind\n     the visor, crosses to the squirming figure on the table. We\n     hear the CIRCULAR SAW BUILD TO A HIGH SHRIEK...\n\n<b>                                              FADE TO BLACK\n</b>\n     ...and the SHRIEKING SAW FADES...\n\n<b>40   HOLD IN BLACK.                                                   40\n</b>\n     THE BLACKNESS OPENS UP -- we're in a cop car's trunk looking\n     up as the lid is opened.

He leans down, slits the tape binding Hilts' arms,\n     drops the keys in the cop's hands.\n\n<b>41   EXT.
