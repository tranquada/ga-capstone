We hear male voices \ngently singing \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" and a deep, affable, \nWestern-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE-OVER\n\t\tA way out west there was a fella, \n\t\tfella I want to tell you about, fella \n\t\tby the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At \n\t\tleast, that was the handle his lovin' \n\t\tparents gave him, but he never had \n\t\tmuch use for it himself.  This \n\t\tLebowski, he called himself the Dude.  \n\t\tNow, Dude, that's a name no one would \n\t\tself-apply where I come from.  But \n\t\tthen, there was a lot about the Dude \n\t\tthat didn't make a whole lot of sense \n\t\tto me.  And a lot about where he \n\t\tlived, like- wise.  But then again, \n\t\tmaybe that's why I found the place \n\t\ts'durned innarestin'.\n\nWe top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at \ntwilight stretches out before us.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE-OVER\n\t\tThey call Los Angeles the City of \n\t\tAngels.  I didn't find it to be that \n\t\texactly, but I'll allow as there are \n\t\tsome nice folks there.  'Course, I \n\t\tcan't say I seen London, and I never \n\t\tbeen to France, and I ain't never \n\t\tseen no queen in her damn undies as \n\t\tthe fella says.  But I'll tell you \n\t\twhat, after seeing Los Angeles and \n\t\tthisahere story I'm about to unfold--\n\t\twal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' \n\t\tbit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any \n\t\ta those other places, and in English \n\t\ttoo, so I can die with a smile on my \n\t\tface without feelin' like the good \n\t\tLord gypped me.\n\nINTERIOR   RALPH'S\n\nIt is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking \nin on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the \ndairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed \nmanner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.\n\nHe is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their \nexpiration dates.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE-OVER\n\t\tNow this story I'm about to unfold \n\t\ttook place back in the early nineties--\n\t\tjust about the time of our conflict \n\t\twith Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I \n\t\tonly mention it 'cause some- times \n\t\tthere's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, \n\t\t'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes \n\t\tthere's a man.\n\nThe Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of \nmilk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE-OVER\n\t\tAnd I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- \n\t\tsometimes there's a man who, wal, \n\t\the's the man for his time'n place, \n\t\the fits right in there--and that's \n\t\tthe Dude, in Los Angeles.\n\nCHECKOUT GIRL\n\nShe waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to \nher register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with \nhelicopter rotors spinning behind him.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE BUSH\n\t\tThis aggression will not stand. . . \n\t\tThis will not stand!\n\nThe Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at \nthe little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE-OVER\n\t\t...and even if he's a lazy man, and \n\t\tthe Dude was certainly that--quite \n\t\tpossibly the laziest in Los Angeles \n\t\tCounty.\n\nThe Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and \nis making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE-OVER\n\t\t...which would place him high in the \n\t\trunnin' for laziest worldwide--but \n\t\tsometimes there's a man. . . sometimes \n\t\tthere's a man.\n\nEXTERIOR  RALPH'S\n\nLong shot of the glowing Ralph's.  There are only two or \nthree cars parked in the huge lot.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE-OVER\n\t\tWal, I lost m'train of thought here.  \n\t\tBut--aw hell, I done innerduced him \n\t\tenough.\n\nThe Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.  \nNext to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and \ncap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.  \nThe two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.\n\nAfter a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tIt's the LeBaron.\n\nDUDE'S HOUSE\n\nThe Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow \ncourt.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small \nleatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the \ngrocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.\n\nINSIDE\n\nThe Dude enters and flicks on a light.\n\nHis head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.  \nWe track with him as he is rushed through the living room, \nhis arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.  \nGoing into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece \nof doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a \nhole.\n\nThe Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small \nbathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of \ndoorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper \nbag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet \nrim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the \nfloor.\n\nThe Dude blows bubbles.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWe want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny \n\t\tsaid you were good for it.\n\nHands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and \ngasps for air.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhere's the money, Lebowski!\n\nHis head is plunged back into the toilet.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWhere's the money, Lebowski!\n\nThe hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tIt's uh, it's down there somewhere.  \n\t\tLemme take another look.\n\nHis head is plunged back in.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tDon't fuck with us.  If your wife \n\t\towes money to Jackie Treehorn, that \n\t\tmeans you owe money to Jackie \n\t\tTreehorn.\n\nThe inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and \nflops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against \nthe toilet.\n\nThe Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.\n\nLooming over him is a strapping blond man.\n\nBeyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly \nand walks over to a rug.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHINESE MAN\n\t\tEver thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.\n\nHe starts peeing on the rug.\n\nThe Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his \nsunglasses.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOh, man.  Don't do--\n\n\t\t\t\tBLOND MAN\n\t\tYou see what happens?  You see what \n\t\thappens, Lebowski?\n\nThe Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tLook, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You \n\t\tgot the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude, \n\t\tman.\n\n\t\t\t\tBLOND MAN\n\t\tYour name is Lebowski.  Your wife is \n\t\tBunny.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tBunny?  Look, moron.\n\nHe holds up his hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYou see a wedding ring?  Does this \n\t\tplace look like I'm fucking married?   \n\t\tAll my plants are dead!\n\nThe blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a \nbowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious \nnative.\n\n\t\t\t\tBLOND MAN\n\t\tThe fuck is this?\n\nThe Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights \nit.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tObviously you're not a golfer.\n\nThe blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.\n\n\t\t\t\tBLOND MAN\n\t\tWoo?\n\nThe Chinese man is zipping his fly.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOO\n\t\tYeah?\n\n\t\t\t\tBLOND MAN\n\t\tWasn't this guy supposed to be a \n\t\tmillionaire?\n\n\t\t\t\tWOO\n\t\tUh?\n\nThey both look around.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOO\n\t\tFuck.\n\n\t\t\t\tBLOND MAN\n\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n\t\t\t\tWOO\n\t\tHe looks like a fuckin' loser.\n\nThe Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger \nand peeks over them.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHey.  At least I'm housebroken.\n\nThe two men look at each other.  They turn to leave.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOO\n\t\tFuckin' waste of time.\n\nThe blond man turns testily at the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tBLOND MAN\n\t\tThanks a lot, asshole.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:\n\nBOWLING PINS\n\nScattered by a strike.\n\nMusic and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins \nflying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes, \nsliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a \nball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.\n\nThe music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant \njukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.\n\nA lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail \nturns from the strike to walk back to the bench.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tHot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.  \n\t\tMark it, Dude.\n\nWe are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man \nnursing a large plastic cup of Bud.  He has dark worried \neyes and a goatee.  Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.  \nHe also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves \ncut off over an old bowling shirt.  This is Walter.  He \nsquints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he \naddresses the Dude at the scoring table.\n\nThe Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears \nsome of its foam on his mustache.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThis was a valued rug.\n\nHe elaborately clears his throat.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThis was, uh--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYeah man, it really tied the room \n\t\ttogether--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThis was a valued, uh.\n\nDonny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tWhat tied the room together, Dude?\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tWere you listening to the story, \n\t\tDonny?\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tWhat--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tWere you listening to the Dude's \n\t\tstory?\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tI was bowling--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tSo you have no frame of reference, \n\t\tDonny.

We hear the two men talk:\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG MAN\n\t\tAnd this is the study.  You can see \n\t\tthe various commendations, honorary \n\t\tdegrees, et cetera.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYes, uh, very impressive.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG MAN\n\t\tPlease, feel free to inspect them.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tI'm not really, uh.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG MAN\n\t\tPlease!

Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we \nrealize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the \ndisplay is mirrored.\n\nWe hear the door open and the whine of a motor.  The Dude, \nwearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.\n\nSo does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.  He \nwears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.\n\nEntering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized \nwheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEBOWSKI\n\t\tOkay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a \n\t\tLebowski, that's terrific, I'm very \n\t\tbusy so what can I do for you?\n\nHe wheels himself behind a desk.

V.I. Lenin!  \n\t\tVladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tWhat the fuck is he talking about?\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThat's fucking exactly what happened, \n\t\tDude!  That makes me fucking SICK!\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYeah, well, what do you care, Walter?\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tYeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed \n\t\toff?\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThose rich fucks!  This whole fucking \n\t\tthing-- I did not watch my buddies \n\t\tdie face down in the muck so that \n\t\tthis fucking strumpet--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tI don't see any connection to Vietnam, \n\t\tWalter.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tWell, there isn't a literal \n\t\tconnection, Dude.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWalter, face it, there isn't any \n\t\tconnection.  It's your roll.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tHave it your way.  The point is--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tIt's your roll--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThe fucking point is--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tIt's your roll.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tAre you ready to be fucked, man?\n\nThey both look up.\n\nQuintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of \nthe lanes.  Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a \nwindbreaker with a racing stripe and \"Jesus\" stitched on the \nbreast.  He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball \nsatchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein).  Behind him stands his \npartner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINTANA\n\t\tI see you rolled your way into the \n\t\tsemis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and \n\t\tme, we're gonna fuck you up.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYeah well, that's just, ya know, \n\t\tlike, your opinion, man.\n\nQuintana looks at Walter.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINTANA\n\t\tLet me tell you something, bendeco.  \n\t\tYou pull any your crazy shit with \n\t\tus, you flash a piece out on the \n\t\tlanes, I'll take it away from you \n\t\tand stick it up your ass and pull \n\t\tthe fucking trigger til it goes \n\t\t\"click\".\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tJesus.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINTANA\n\t\tYou said it, man.  Nobody fucks with \n\t\tthe Jesus.\n\nJesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tEight-year-olds, Dude.\n\nDUDE'S BUNGALOW\n\nWe are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug.  \nHis eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking \ntinnily through the headphones we can just hear an \nintermittent clatter.\n\nIn his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE \nBEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987.\n\nThe Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall \nrumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the \nDude opens his eyes.\n\nHe screams.\n\nA blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man  \nin paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards \nthe carrier.\n\nThe sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head \nthunking back onto the rug.\n\nA million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear \nthe \"La-la-la-la\" of The Man in Me.\n\nThe black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug.   \nThe rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of \nLos  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.\n\nThe Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in \nfront of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his \nbowling shirt. He looks up.\n\nAhead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the \nDude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing \nus, growing smaller.\n\nThe Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices \nthat a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.  \nHis bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic \nimplications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its \nweight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He \nis falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down \ntoward the city, dragged by the ball.\n\nA  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us \nout  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by  \nthe bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in \nblack.\n\nWe hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections \nmaterialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny \nsurface of an oncoming bowling ball.\n\nWe pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of \na ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being \nregurgitated up at us, overtaking us.\n\nThe Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass \nrolling a huge shadow across his face.\n\nThe gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward \nus --finger holes.\n\nThe largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing \nus once again in black..\n\nThe black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a \nbowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in \nthe thumbhole of the rolling ball.\n\nWe see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde \nwoman, performing her follow-through.\n\nFloor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and \naway; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; \nceiling; approaching pins; again and again.\n\nWe hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins \nspin, hit each other and drop.\n\nWe hear an irritating, insistent beeping.\n\nFADE IN\n\nWe are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades \nin the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint.  \nThey come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is \nnow askew, with one arm off his ear.\n\nAs the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put \nhim right side around.  His head is now resting against \nhardwood floor, not rug.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOh man.\n\nHe  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the  \nred   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is  \nblinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps.\n\nWIDE ON THE ROOM\n\nAn  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is  \nin place. The rug is gone.\n\nThe  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue.   \nThe beeps continue.\n\nThe phone starts to jangle.\n\nTRACK\n\nWe  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway.   \nAgain  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a  \nwrist to  look at  his watch.\n\n\t\t\t\tBRANDT\n\t\tThey called about eighty minutes \n\t\tago.  They want you to take the money \n\t\tand drive north on the 4 5.  They'll \n\t\tcall you on the portable phone with \n\t\tinstructions in about forty minutes.  \n\t\tOne person only or I'd go with you.  \n\t\tThey were very clear on that: one \n\t\tperson only.  What happened to your \n\t\tjaw?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOh, nothin', you know.\n\nThey have reached the little desk outside of the big \nLebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key \nand takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude \nalong with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.\n\n\t\t\t\tBRANDT\n\t\tHere's the money, and the phone.  \n\t\tPlease, Dude, follow whatever \n\t\tinstructions they give.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tUh-huh.\n\n\t\t\t\tBRANDT\n\t\tHer life is in your hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOh, man, don't say that..\n\n\t\t\t\tBRANDT\n\t\tMr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:  \n\t\tHer life is in your hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tShit.\n\n\t\t\t\tBRANDT\n\t\tHer life is in your hands, Dude.  \n\t\tAnd report back to us as soon as \n\t\tit's done.\n\nDUDE'S CAR\n\nWe pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through \nthe front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter \nstanding waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK \nSECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the \nfact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look \noddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape \nbundled in brown wrapping paper.\n\nThe car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door \nand hands in the briefcase.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tTake the ringer.  I'll drive.\n\nThe Dude takes the briefcase and slides over.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThe what?\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThe ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have \n\t\tthey called yet?\n\nThe Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it \nas the car starts rolling.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWhat the hell is this?\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tMy dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.  \n\t\tThe whites.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tAgh--\n\nHe closes the briefcase.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWalter, I'm sure there's a reason \n\t\tyou brought your dirty undies--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.  \n\t\tThe ringer can't look empty.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWalter--what the fuck are you \n\t\tthinking?\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tWell you're right, Dude, I got to \n\t\tthinking.  I got to thinking why \n\t\tshould we settle for a measly fucking \n\t\ttwenty grand--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWe?  What the fuck we?  You said you \n\t\tjust wanted to come along--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tMy point, Dude, is why should we \n\t\tsettle for twenty grand when we can \n\t\tkeep the entire million.  Am I wrong?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYes you're wrong.  This isn't a \n\t\tfucking game, Walter--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tIt is a fucking game.  You said so \n\t\tyourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE '\n\t\tYeah, but--\n\nThe phone chirps.  Dude grabs it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tDude here.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\t(German accent)\n\t\tWho is this?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tDude the Bagman.

These  \n\t\tguys are fucking amateurs--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tShutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say \n\t\tpeep when I'm doing business here.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t\t(patronizing)\n\t\tOkay Dude.  Have it your way.\n\nThe Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tBut they're amateurs.\n\nThe Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone:\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tDude here.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tOkay, vee proceed.

So as long as we get her back, \n\t\tnobody's in a position to complain.  \n\t\tAnd we keep the baksheesh.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tTerrific, Walter.  But you haven't \n\t\ttold me how we get her back.  Where \n\t\tis she?\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThat's the simple part, Dude.  When  \n\t\twe make the handoff, I grab the guy \n\t\tand beat  it out of him.\n\nHe looks at the Dude.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\t...Huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.  \n\t\tThat's fucking ingenious, if I \n\t\tunderstand it correctly.  That's a \n\t\tSwiss fucking watch.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of \n\t\tthis is its simplicity. If the plan \n\t\tgets too complex something always \n\t\tgoes wrong.

Here's \n\t\tthe bridge--\n\nThere is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.  \nThe Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from \nthe back seat.  Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to \ngrab the laundry.\n\nAnd there goes the ringer.\n\nHe flings it out the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWalter!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tYour wheel, Dude!

This is it, Dude!  Let's \n\t\ttake that hill!\n\nWalter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he \nhits the pavement.  The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, \ncursing, takes the wheel.\n\nOUTSIDE\n\nWalter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle \nflashes tear open the wrapping paper.\n\nINSIDE THE CAR\n\nThe car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.\n\nOUTSIDE\n\nThe car clunks and screams around in a skid.\n\nINSIDE\n\nThe Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something.\n\nOUTSIDE\n\nAs the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The \nfront of his car is crumpled into a tree.  The car body saps \nback to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out.\n\nWALTER  is  just  rising  from  the  ground  massaging an  \ninjured knee.\n\nThe  Dude  runs  up  the  road  toward  the bridge,  \nfrantically waving the satchel in the air.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!\n\nThere is a distant engine roar.  A motorcycle bumps up onto \nthe road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires \nsquealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite \ndirection.  It is closely followed by two more roaring \nmotorcycles.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!\n\nThe Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching \nthe three red tail lights fishtail away.\n\nAFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE:\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tAhh fuck it, let's go bowling.\n\nBOWLING LANE\n\nA ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins.\n\nWALTER.\n\nHe turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of \nmolded plastic chairs.  The Dude listlessly holds the portable \nphone in his lap.  It is ringing.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tAitz chaim he, Dude.

Who's \n\t\tsitting on a million fucking dollars?  \n\t\tAm I wrong?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWalter--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tWho's got a fucking million fucking \n\t\tdollars parked in the trunk of our \n\t\tcar out here?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\t\"Our\" car, Walter?\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tAnd what do they got, Dude?

You seem to \n\t\tknow the answer to everything else!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tHmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped \n\t\tspot.

You fucking \n\t\tknow it's been stolen!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tWell, certainly that's a possibility, \n\t\tDude--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tAw, fuck it.\n\nThe Dude walks away across the lot.  The portable phone starts \nringing again.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tWhere you going, Dude?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tI'm going home, Donny.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tYour phone's ringing, Dude.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThank you, Donny.\n\nDUDE'S LIVING ROOM\n\nThe Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, \nfingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.  Facing him \non the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, \nthe other a fresh-faced rookie.\n\nAt the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping.  \nThe Dude waits for the rings to end.  When they do:\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\t1972 Pontiac LeBaron.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNGER COP\n\t\tColor?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tGreen.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, \n\t\tcoloration.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNGER COP\n\t\tAnd was there anything of value in  \n\t\tthe car?\n\nDULLY:\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHuh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.

Dude continues to stare at a spot on the \nfloor.  The older cop stares at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\t...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But \n\t\tit's nice when they offer.\n\nAT LENGTH:\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\t...Also, my rug was stolen.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNGER COP\n\t\tYour rug was in the car.\n\nThe Dude taps the floor with his foot.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tNo.  Here.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNGER COP\n\t\tSeparate incidents?\n\nThe Dude stares at the floor.\n\nSilence.\n\n\t\t\t\tOLDER COP\n\t\tSnap out of it, son.\n\nThe home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct  from the  \nchirp of the portable.  The Dude makes no move to answer  \nit.   Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks \non.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYou find them much?  Stolen cars?\n\nDude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in.  Leave a message \nafter the beep.  It takes a minute.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNGER COP\n\t\tSometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much \n\t\thope for the tape deck though.  Or \n\t\tthe Creedence tapes.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tAnd the, uh, the briefcase?\n\nBeep.\n\n\t\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE\n\t\tMr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.  \n\t\tCall when you get home and I'll send \n\t\ta car for you.  My name is Maude \n\t\tLebowski.  I'm the woman who took \n\t\tthe rug.\n\nBeep.  Dial tone.\n\n\t\t\t\tOLDER COP\n\t\tWell, I guess we can close the file \n\t\ton that one.\n\nTRACKING FORWARD\n\nWe are moving through the open living area of a large downtown \nL.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing \nindustrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are \nspare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude's brilliant \nrug.\n\nWe hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude, \nstanding in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky \ndepths of the cavernous space.\n\nSomething huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head.  \nAs it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.\n\nWe see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended \nfrom a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the \nfloor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush \nin the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas.\n\nThe Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two \nyoung men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers \nreach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track \nand haul it back for another push.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tI'll be with you in a minute, Mr. \n\t\tLebowski.\n\nShe rumbles by in another pass.\n\nAll right, we'll do the blue tomorrow.  Elfranco.  Pedro.  \nHelp me down.\n\nThe  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked  \nexcept for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts  \nand wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix \nlook.\n\nDoes the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tIs that what that's a picture of?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tIn a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. \n\t\tMy art has been commended as being \n\t\tstrongly vaginal.  Which bothers \n\t\tsome men.  The word itself makes \n\t\tsome men uncomfortable.  Vagina.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOh yeah?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tYes, they don't like hearing it and \n\t\tfind it difficult to say.  Whereas \n\t\twithout batting an eye a man will \n\t\trefer to his \"dick\" or his \"rod\" or \n\t\this \"Johnson\".\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\t\"Johnson\"?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tThank you.\n\nThis to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe.\n\nAll right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My father \ntold me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a \ngift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.  \nNow.  As for this. . . \"kidnapping\"--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHuh?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tYes, I know about it.  And I know \n\t\tthat you acted as courier.  And let \n\t\tme tell you something:  the whole \n\t\tthing stinks to high heaven.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tRight, but let me explain something \n\t\tabout that rug--\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tDo you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tExcuse me?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tSex.  The physical act of love.  \n\t\tCoitus.  Do you like it?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tI was talking about my rug.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tYou're not interested in sex?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYou mean coitus?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tI like it too.  It's a male myth \n\t\tabout feminists that we hate sex.  \n\t\tIt can be a natural, zesty enterprise. \n\t\tBut unfortunately there are some \n\t\tpeople--it is called satyriasis in \n\t\tmen, nymphomania in women--who engage \n\t\tin it compulsively and without joy.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOh, no.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tYes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate \n\t\tsouls cannot love in the true sense \n\t\tof the word.  Our mutual acquaintance \n\t\tBunny is one of these.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tListen, Maude, I'm sorry if your \n\t\tstepmother is a nympho, but I don't \n\t\tsee what it has to do with--do you \n\t\thave any kalhua?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tTake a look at this, sir.\n\nShe is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen \nflickers to life.  A title card:\n\nJACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS\n\nSECOND CARD:\n\nKARL HUNGUS\n\nAND\n\nBUNNY LAJOYA\n\nIN\n\nA THIRD CARD:\n\nLOGJAMMIN'\n\nThe Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway  \nto his glass.\n\nFrom the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then  a \ndoor opening.\n\nOn the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced  \nman in blue coyer-alls.  It is Dieter, the floater in  \nLebowski's pool.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIETER\n\t\tHello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere \n\t\tiss problem mit deine kable.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tShit, I know that guy.  He's a \n\t\tnihilist.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tAnd you recognize her, of course.\n\nThe girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.\n\nBunny The TV is in here.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIETER\n\t\tZa, okay, I bring mein toolz.\n\nBunny This is my friend Shari.  She just came over to use \nthe shower.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\t\t(grimly)\n\t\tThe story is ludicrous.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIETER\n\t\tMein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to \n\t\tverk in zese clozes--\n\nMaude switches off the set.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tLord.  You can imagine where it goes \n\t\tfrom here.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHe fixes the cable?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tDon't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little \n\t\tmatter to me that this woman chose \n\t\tto pursue a career\n\nin pornography, nor that she has been \"banging\" Jackie \nTreehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I am \none of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other \nbeing my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts \nand--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tShit yeah, the achievers.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tLittle Lebowski Urban Achievers, \n\t\tyes, and proud we are of all of them.  \n\t\tI asked my father about his withdrawal \n\t\tof a million dollars from the \n\t\tFoundation account and he told me \n\t\tabout this \"abduction\", but I tell \n\t\tyou it is preposterous.  This \n\t\tcompulsive\n\nfornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYeah, but my-\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tI'm getting to your rug. My  father \n\t\tand I don't get along; he doesn't \n\t\tapprove of my lifestyle and, needless \n\t\tto say, I don't approve of his.  \n\t\tStill, I hardly wish to make my \n\t\tfather's embezzlement a police matter, \n\t\tso I'm proposing that you try to \n\t\trecover the money from the people \n\t\tyou delivered it to.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWell--sure, I could do that--\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tIf you successfully do so, I will \n\t\tcompensate you to the tune of 1% of \n\t\tthe recovered sum.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tA hundred.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tThousand, yes, bones or clams or \n\t\twhatever you call them.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYeah, but what about--\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\t--your rug, yes, well with that money \n\t\tyou can buy any number of rugs that \n\t\tdon't have sentimental value for me.  \n\t\tAnd I am sorry about that crack on \n\t\tthe jaw.\n\nThe Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has \nall but disappeared.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOh that's okay, I hardly even--\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tHere's the name and number of a doctor \n\t\twho will look at it for you.  You \n\t\twill receive no bill.  He's a good \n\t\tman, and thorough.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThat's really thoughtful but I--\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tPlease see him, Jeffrey.  He's a \n\t\tgood man, and thorough.\n\nLIMO\n\nThe Dude sits in back holding a White Russian,  listening to \nthe chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery \ncap a ponytail emerges.\n\n\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n\t\t--So he says, \"My son can't hold a \n\t\tjob, my daughter's married to a \n\t\tfuckin' loser, and I got a rash on \n\t\tmy ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.  \n\t\tBut you know me.  I can't complain.\"\n\nTHROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER:\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tFuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.\t\t\t \n\t\tFuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya \n\t\tTony.\n\nHe takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves \nmilk on his mustache.\n\nI was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost  a \nlittle  money, I  was down in the dumps.\n\n\t\t\t\tTONY\n\t\tAw, forget about it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be \n\t\tworrying about that shit.  Life goes \n\t\ton!\n\nThe limo has rolled to a stop.

Who's your \n\t\tfriend in the Volkswagon?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHuh?\n\nHis eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his \nshoulder.\n\nHe followed us here.\n\nThe Dude turns to look.\n\nHIS POV\n\nHalfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the \ncurb.  In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape.\n\nTHE DUDE\n\nHe scowls.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWhen did he-\n\nThe Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-\nnelson by another uniformed chauffeur.\n\n\t\t\t\tSECOND CHAUFFEUR\n\t\tInto the limo, you sonofabitch.  No \n\t\targuments.\n\nAs he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds \nhis drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tFuck, man!  There's a beverage here!\n\nThe waiting limo's back door is flung open.\n\nINSIDE\n\nThe Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the \nrear. The door is slammed behind him.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEBOWSKI\n\t\tStart talking and talk fast you lousy \n\t\tbum!\n\n\t\t\t\tBRANDT\n\t\tWe've been frantically trying to \n\t\treach you, Dude.\n\nBrandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from \nthe Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEBOWSKI\n\t\tWhere's my goddamn money, you bum?!\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWell we--I don't--\n\n\t\t\t\tLEBOWSKI\n\t\tThey did not receive the money, you \n\t\tnitwit!

Look at my LP's.  \n\t\tUnder 'Autobahn.'\n\nThe Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tThat was his group--they released \n\t\tone album in the mid-seventies.\n\nThe Dude stops between two albums.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tRoy Orbison. . .

On it is \nthe group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a \npicture\n\nOF THREE YOUNG GERMANS, THEIR FOREHEADS LOOMING BELOW \nSLICKED-\n\nback hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany.  They are \nwearing severe but modishly retro suits.  Each has his name \nunder his picture--Dieter, Kieffer; and Franz.  A bed of \nnails is the only set dressing on the cyc.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tJeez.  I miss vinyl.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tIs he pretending to be the abductor?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWell...yeah--\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tLook, Jeffrey, you don't really  \n\t\tkidnap someone that you're acquainted \n\t\twith.

He's a \n\t\tgood man, and thorough.\n\nCLOSE SHOT   THE DUDE\n\nHis eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking \ntinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of \n\"Comin' Up Around the Bend.\"\n\nBehind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, \na white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back.  After a \nmoment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His \nhand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the \nDude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tCould you slide your shorts down \n\t\tplease, Mr.  Lebowski?\n\nThe Dude's eyes open.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHuh?

The Dude \nis sucking down a joint.  He glances at the rear-view mirror--\nand, noticing something, looks again.\n\nHIS POV\n\nA Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving.\n\nTHE DUDE\n\nHis eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint \nbetween thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it \nout the driver's window--except that the window is not open.  \nThe butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering \nsparks.\n\nDUDE'S CROTCH\n\nThe glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs. \nThe Dude screams.\n\nTHE STREET\n\nThe car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off \nto, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes \nto rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone \npoll.\n\nINSIDE THE CAR\n\nThe Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, \nand then slides over to push at the passenger door, which \nalso won't open.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tFuck Me.\n\nBut he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from  \nthe lit butt.  He looks around for it.\n\nSmoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion \nand back cushion.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tFuckola, man.\n\nHe takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions.   \nThere is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper \nsticking out from between the cushions.\n\nThe Dude pulls it out.\n\nIt is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and \ndripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right-\nhand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, \nMrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled \"The Louisiana \nPurchase.\"  In red ink is a large circled D and some \nhandwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled \nin red throughout.\n\nCRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER\n\nWe are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage \nin the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, \nis performing a dance moderne.\n\nAs Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice \nhushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse \naudience.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tHe lives in North Hollywood on \n\t\tRadford, near the In-and-Out Burger--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThe In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tNear the In-and-Out Burger--\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tThose are good burgers, Walter.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tShut the fuck up, Donny.

That kid's already \n\t\tspent all the money!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tHardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's \n\t\tstill got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, \n\t\tdepending on the options.  Wait in \n\t\tthe car, Donny.\n\nTHE FRONT DOOR\n\nWalter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish \nwoman.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tJace?\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tHello, Pilar?  My name is Walter \n\t\tSobchak, we spoke on the phone, this \n\t\tis my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tJace.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tMay we uh, we wanted to talk about \n\t\tlittle Larry.

Dat mang is here!\n\nThere is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and \nnudges the Dude.  At the other end of the living room a man \nlies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its \nmidsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.  \nIt is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct \nhisses in and out.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThat's him, Dude.\n\n\t\t\t\tVIVA VOCE\n\t\tAnd a good day to you, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tPILAR\n\t\tSee down, please.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThank you, ma'am.\n\nHe and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa.  In a lowered \nvoice, to Pilar:\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tDoes he, uh. . . Is he still writing?\n\n\t\t\t\tPILAR\n\t\tNo, no.

These are the \n\t\tpoliceman--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tNo ma'am, I didn't mean to give the \n\t\timpression that we're police exactly.  \n\t\tWe're hoping that it will not be \n\t\tnecessary to call the police.\n\nHe adopts his command voice in turning to Larry:\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tBut that is up to little Larry here.  \n\t\tIsn't it, Larry?\n\nWalter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out \nthe homework, which is now in a ziploc bag.  He holds it out \nat arm's length, displaying it to Larry.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tIs this your homework, Larry?\n\nLarry does not respond.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tIs this your homework, Larry?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tLook, man, did you--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tDude, please!. . .

Where's the fucking money, \n\t\tyou little brat?\n\nThroughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework \nextended towards him.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tLook, Larry. . . Have you ever heard \n\t\tof Vietnam?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOh, for Christ's sake, Walter!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tYou're going to enter a world of \n\t\tpain, son.

And we know \n\t\tthat this is your homework, Larry.\n\nNo answer.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tYou're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.\n\nFINALLY, IN DISGUST:\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tAh, this is pointless.\n\nAs he shoves the homework back in the attache case:\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tAll right, Plan B.  You might want \n\t\tto watch out the front window there, \n\t\tLarry.\n\nHe is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to \nfollow him.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThis is what happens when you FUCK a \n\t\tSTRANGER in the ASS, Larry.\n\nOUTSIDE\n\nWalter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like \nan enraged encyclopedia salesman.  Without looking back at, \nthe Dude, who follows:\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tFucking language problem, Dude.\n\nHe pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes \nout a tire iron.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tMaybe he'll understand this.\n\nHe is walking over to the Corvette.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tYOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!\n\nCRASH!  He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which \nshatters.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tYOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!\n\nCRASH!  He takes out the driver's window.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tTHIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A \n\t\tSTRANGER IN THE ASS!\n\nLights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs \nbark.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tHERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!\n\nCRASH!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tHERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER \n\t\tIN THE ASS!\n\nCRASH!\n\nA man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over \nbehind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of \nthe crowbar.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tWHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!\n\nHe wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tI JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!\n\nWalter cringes before the enraged Mexican.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tHunh?\n\nThe man looks about, wildly.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tI KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR \n\t\tFUCKEEN CAR!\n\nHe runs over to the Dude's car.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tNo!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--\n\nCRASH!

Wind whistles through the caved-\nin windows.\n\nThe Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the\n\nroad.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch \n'on In-and-Out Burgers.\n\nCreedence music plays above the bluster of wind.\n\nDUDE'S BUNGALOW\n\nAs the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four \ninto the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tI accept your apology. . . No I, I \n\t\tjust want to handle it myself from \n\t\tnow on. . . No.  That has nothing to \n\t\tdo with it. . . .Yes, it made it \n\t\thome, I'm calling from home.  No, \n\t\tWalter, it didn't look like Larry \n\t\twas about to crack.\n\nHe finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair \nthat stands nearby.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWell that's your perception. . . \n\t\tWell you're right, Walter, and the \n\t\tunspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND \n\t\tLEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah, \n\t\tI'll be at practice.\n\nHe hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into \nplace with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced \nagainst the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when \nthe door is opened--outwards.  The chair clatters to the \nfloor.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHuh?\n\nWoo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in, \nkicking the chair away.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOO\n\t\tPin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie\n\t\tTreehorn wants to see you.\n\n\t\t\t\tBLOND MAN\n\t\tAnd we know which Lebowski you are, \n\t\tLebowski.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOO\n\t\tYeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk \n\t\tto the deadbeat Lebowski.\n\n\t\t\t\tBLOND MAN\n\t\tYou're not dealing with morons here.\n\nBLACKNESS\n\nOut of the blackness something is falling toward us.  It is \na woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her \nmouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy.  She is topless.  \nShe falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a \nbeat reappears, rising into the night sky.\n\nMALIBU BEACH\n\nA crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried \nhair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual \nattire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in \nnightmarish slow motion.\n\nWIDER\n\nIt is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing \nkerosene heaters.  1960's mainstream jazz, of the Mancini-\nBrubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'.\n\nIn long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears  \ninto darkness, descends into light, rises again.\n\nA man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach \nlight.  He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants \nand a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the \nneck.  Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and \ndisappears.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tHello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm \n\t\tJackie Treehorn.\n\nINSIDE THE BEACH HOUSE\n\nThe Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThis is quite a pad you got here, \n\t\tman.  Completely unspoiled.\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tWhat's your drink, Dude?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWhite Russian, thanks.  How's the \n\t\tsmut business, Jackie?\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tI wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in \n\t\tpublishing, entertainment, political \n\t\tadvocacy, and--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWhich one was Logjammin'?\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tRegrettably, it's true, standards \n\t\thave fallen in adult entertainment.  \n\t\tIt's video, Dude.  Now that we're \n\t\tcompeting with the amateurs, we can't \n\t\tafford to invest that little extra \n\t\tin story, production value, feeling.\n\nHe taps his forehead with one finger.\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tPeople forget that the brain is the \n\t\tbiggest erogenous zone--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOn you, maybe.\n\nHe hands him the drink.\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tOf course, you do get the good with \n\t\tthe bad.  The new technology permits \n\t\tus to do exciting things with \n\t\tinteractive erotic software.  Wave \n\t\tof the future, Dude.  100% electronic.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tUh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off \n\t\tmanually.\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tOf course you do.  I can see you're \n\t\tanxious for me to get to the point.  \n\t\tWell Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tI thought you might know, man.\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tMe?  How would I know?  The only \n\t\treason she ran off was to get away \n\t\tfrom her rather sizable debt to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tBut she hasn't run off, she's been--\n\nTreehorn waves this off.\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tI've heard the kidnapping story, so \n\t\tsave it.  I know you're mixed up in \n\t\tall this, Dude, and I don't care \n\t\twhat you're trying to take off her \n\t\thusband.  That's your business.  All \n\t\tI'm saying is, I want mine.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYeah, well, right man, there are \n\t\tmany facets to this, uh, you know, \n\t\tmany interested parties.  If I can \n\t\tfind your money, man-- what's in it \n\t\tfor the Dude?\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tOf course, there's that to discuss.  \n\t\tRefill?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tDoes the Pope shit in the woods?\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tLet's say a 10% finder's fee?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOkay, Jackie, done.  I like the way \n\t\tyou do business.  Your money is being \n\t\theld by a kid named Larry Sellers.  \n\t\tHe lives in North Hollywood, on \n\t\tRadford, near the In-and-Out Burger.  \n\t\tA real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure \n\t\tyour goons'll be able to get it off \n\t\thim, mean he's only fifteen and he's \n\t\tflunking social studies.  So if you'll \n\t\tjust write me a check for my ten per \n\t\tcent. . . of half a million. . . \n\t\tfifty grand.\n\nHe is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tI'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you \n\t\tmix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.\n\nThe Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.\n\n\t\t\t\tTREEHORN\n\t\tA fifteen-year-old?  Is this your \n\t\tidea of a joke?\n\nJackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.  He is joined on \neither side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking \ngrimly down at the Dude.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tNo funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's \n\t\tgot it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just \n\t\twanted a car.  All the Dude ever \n\t\twanted. . . was his rug back. . . \n\t\tnot greedy. . . it really.\n\nHe squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.  \nTied the room together.\n\nHe tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.\n\nFROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE\n\nLooking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and \nsquishes.\n\nFAST FADE OUT\n\nBLACK\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE STRANGER'S VOICE\n\t\tDarkness warshed over the Dude--\n\t\tdarker'n a black steer's tookus on a \n\t\tmoonless prairie night.  There was \n\t\tno bottom.\n\nWe hear a thundering bass.\n\nSCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD:\n\nJACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS\n\nANOTHER TITLE CARD:\n\nTHE DUDE\n\nAND\n\nMAUDE LEBOWSKI\n\nIN\n\nTHIRD TITLE CARD:\n\nGUTTERBALLS\n\nThe title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked \nby a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns  \ninto the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's  \n\"Just Dropped In.\"\n\nThe Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable \nrepairman.  The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light \nas the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.\n\nIn the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing \noperatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an \narmored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, \nand holds a trident.\n\nThe Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps \nher with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball.\n\nThe lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini- \nskirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs \nturning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the \nend.\n\nBut it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their \nlegs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, \nthe tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face \ndown, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides.\n\nHis point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little \nball-guide arrows zipping by.\n\nThe Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so \nthat he is now gliding along the lane face-up.\n\nNow his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing \nchorines.\n\nThe Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so \nthat he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward \nand his forward momentum blows back his hair.\n\nComing at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, \nare the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them,  \nand rush on into black.\n\nA body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless \nwoman, squealing, her legs kicking.\n\nAs she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three \nmen are entering from the background, emerging into a pool \nof light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding \noversized shears which they menacingly scissor.\n\nThe Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the \nadvancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping.\n\nThe scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of \ncar-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights.  \nThe Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific \nCoast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.\n\nWith the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with \nflashing gumballs pulls up.\n\nSQUAD CAR\n\nThe Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the \nmotion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHe was innocent.  Not a charge was \n\t\ttrue.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.\n\nCHIEF'S OFFICE\n\nThe Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces \noff of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.\n\nHis wallet is tossed onto the desk.\n\nThe chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through \nit with disgusted incredulity.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF\n\t\tThis is your only I.D.?\n\nHe is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card.\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tI know my rights.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF\n\t\tYou don't know shit, Lebowski.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tI want a fucking lawyer, man.  I \n\t\twant Bill Kunstler.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF\n\t\tWhat are you, some kind of sad-assed \n\t\trefugee from the fucking sixties?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tUh-huh.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF\n\t\tMr. Treehorn tells us that he had to \n\t\teject you from his garden party, \n\t\tthat you were drunk and abusive.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThat guy treats women like objects, \n\t\tman.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF\n\t\tMr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in \n\t\tthis town, Lebowski.  You don't draw \n\t\tshit.  We got a nice quiet beach \n\t\tcommunity here, and I aim to keep it \n\t\tnice and quiet.  So let me make \n\t\tsomething plain.  I don't like you \n\t\tsucking around bothering our citizens, \n\t\tLebowski.  I don't like your jerk-\n\t\toff name, I don't like your jerk-off \n\t\tface, I don't like your jerk- off \n\t\tbehavior, and I don't like you, jerk-\n\t\toff --do I make myself clear?\n\nThe Dude stares.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tI'm sorry, I wasn't listening.\n\nThe Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.  It \nhits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee \nsplashing everywhere.\n\nThe Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\t--Ow!  Fucking fascist!\n\nThe Chief slaps him twice.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF\n\t\tStay out of Malibu, Lebowski!\n\nHe kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts \nkicking at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF\n\t\tStay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep \n\t\tyour ugly fucking goldbricking ass \n\t\tout of my beach community!\n\nCAB\n\nThe Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks \nwith every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his \nface and scalp.\n\n\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\" is on the radio.\n\nDUDE'S POV\n\nThe back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds \nunder a knit cap.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tJesus, man, can you change the \n\t\tstation?\n\n\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n\t\tFuck you man!

Outta this fucking cab!\n\nTHE STREET\n\nThe cab screeches over towards the curb.  Another car, \noncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by.\n\nINSIDE THE OTHER CAR\n\nIt is a red convertible.  The driver, singing loudly and \nbadly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a \ndreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a \nkite, is Bunny Lebowski.\n\nTHE FOOTWELL\n\nOn the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright \nred high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.\n\nWhen she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch.\n\nFive more toes.\n\nDUDE'S BUNGALOW\n\nThe Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed \nto a lump on his forehead, and looks around.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tJesus.\n\nThe place is a wreck.  Furniture has been overturned, \nupholstery slashed, drawers dumped.\n\nQuiet.\n\nThe door to the bedroom starts to creak open.\n\nThe Dude cringes.\n\nMaude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tJeffrey.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tMaude?\n\nShe pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAUDE\n\t\tLove me.\n\nThe Dude is stupefied.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThat's my robe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t THOOMP!

More \nwhines and coughs; no start.\n\nThe man hurriedly fumbles in front of him.  He brings up a \nnewspaper, which he holds before his face.\n\nTHE DUDE\n\nAs he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver's \nwindow and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground.  \nHe is revved with nervous energy.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tGet out of that fucking car, man!\n\nThe man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's \nmovement as he gets out.\n\nThe man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch.\n\nHe is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.

She is apparently braless, \nand is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and \narms.\n\nNotable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage-\nswaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of \nthe bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German.   \nThey seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad \nand pen.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAITRESS\n\t\tYou folks ready?\n\nThe German shouting stops.

This is not a worthy--\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tHEY!\n\nThe Dude and Walter look.\n\nQuintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is \nrestrained by O'Brien.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINTANA\n\t\tWhat's this \"day of rest\" shit, man?!\n\nWalter looks at him innocently.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINTANA\n\t\tWhat is this bullshit, man?

To all who \n\t\tcling to it.\n\nThey react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming \nfrom a boom box.\n\nREVERSE\n\nDieter, Kieffer and Franz, in shiny black leather, stand in \na line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot.  Behind them \norange flames lick gently at the Dude's car, which has been \nput to the torch.  The orange flames glow on the men's \ncreaking leather.  Next to the car are three motorcycles, \nparked in a neat row.  The Dude looks sadly at the burning \ncar.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThey finally did it.  They killed my \n\t\tfucking car.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIETER\n\t\tVee vant zat money, Lebowski.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIEFFER\n\t\tJa, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANZ\n\t\tJa, it seems you forgot our little \n\t\tdeal, Lebowski.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYou don't have the fucking girl, \n\t\tdipshits.  We know you never did.  \n\t\tSo you've got nothin' on my Johnson.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\nThe men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in \nGerman.  Under his breath:\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNY\n\t\tAre these the Nazis, Walter?\n\nWalter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three \nmen:\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThey're nihilists, Donny, nothing to \n\t\tbe afraid of.\n\nThe Germans stop conferring.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIETER\n\t\tVee don't care.

Fuck the three of you.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHey, cool it Walter.\n\nWalter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThere's no ransom if you don't have \n\t\ta fucking hostage.  That's what ransom \n\t\tis.  Those are the fucking rules.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIETER\n\t\tZere ARE no ROOLZ!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tNO RULES!

Nihilist.  \n\t\tDipshit with a nine-toed woman.\n\nIn a rage, Dieter charges.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIETER\n\t\tI FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!\n\nWALTER\n\nhurls his leather satchel.\n\nKIEFFER\n\nWatching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard.  The bowling \nball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet.\n\nHe falls back, his uzi clattering away.\n\nWALTER\n\ntwists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in \nboth hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes \non Dieter's ear.\n\nDUDE\n\nHe rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate \nkicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping.  Franz gives \na loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his \narms up, evading the kicks.\n\nWALTER\n\nHis jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear.  Dieter draws his \nsaber against Walter's side, drawing blood.\n\nWalter doesn't react to the wound.  Growling as Dieter \nscreams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws \nclamped.\n\nTHE SABER\n\nDieter drops it.\n\nDUDE\n\nAwkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks.\n\nWALTER\n\nstill worrying the ear.  With a tearing sound his head and \nDieter's separate.\n\nDIETER, EARLESS, SCREAMS:\n\n\t\t\t\tDIETER\n\t\tI FUCK YOU!  YOU CANNOT HURT ME!  I \n\t\tBELIEF IN NUSSING!\n\nWalter spits his ear into his face.\n\nDUDE\n\nThe Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to \nestablish body contact.  Franz continues to kick.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANZ\n\t\tVEAKLING!\n\nWALTER\n\ndraws back his fist.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIETER\n\t\tNUSSING!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tANTI-SEMITE!\n\nBam!--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter \nfor the count.\n\nDUDE AND FRANZ\n\nWith a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to \ncharge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.\n\nAs he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the  boom box swings into  \nframe to smash him in the face.  Its volume shoots up.\n\nWalter bashes him a few more times over the head.  The music \nscreeches to static, then quiet.  Laid out now, Franz too is \nquiet.\n\nAll quiet.\n\nWalter, panting, looks around.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tWe've got a man down, Dude.\n\nWith a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to \nDonny, who lies gasping on the ground.\n\nThe Dude, also panting, rises and trots over.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHy God!  They shot him, Walter!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tNo Dude.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThey shot Donny!\n\nDonny gasps for air.  His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to \nWalter.  One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThere weren't any shots.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThen what's...\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tIt's a heart attack.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWha.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tCall the medics, Dude.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWha. . . Donny--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tHurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping \n\t\tblood.  Might pass out.\n\nThe Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand \non Donny's shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tRest easy, good buddy, you're doing \n\t\tfine.  We got help choppering in.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nHOLD IN BLACK\n\nTHE DUDE AND WALTER\n\n---\n\nThey sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript \nwaiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off \nthose of the other.  They sit.  They wait.\n\nA tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He \neyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's \narmy surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tHello, gentlemen.  You are the \n\t\tbereaved?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYeah man.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tFrancis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet \n\t\tyou.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tJeffrey Lebowski.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tWalter Sobchak.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThe Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tExcuse me?\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tNothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tYes.  I understand you're taking \n\t\taway the remains.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tWe have the urn.\n\nHe nods through a door.  Another man in a black suit enters \nto carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tAnd I assume this is credit card?\n\nHe is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk \nto whomever wants to take it.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tYeah.\n\nHe takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit \nhalfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head \npulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence.  \nThe Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a \nmortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards \nDonnelly, pointing.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tWhat's this?\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tThat is for the urn.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tDon't need it.  We're scattering the \n\t\tashes.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tYes, so we were informed.  However, \n\t\twe must of course transmit the remains \n\t\tto you in a receptacle.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tThis is a hundred and eighty dollars.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tYes sir.  It is our most modestly \n\t\tpriced receptacle.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWell can we--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tA hundred and eighty dollars?!\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tThey range up to three thousand.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tYeah, but we're--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tCan we just rent it from you?\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tSir, this is a mortuary, not a rental \n\t\thouse.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tWe're scattering the fucking ashes!\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWalter--\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tJUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T \n\t\tMEAN WE'RE SAPS!\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tSir, please lower your voice--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tHey man, don't you have something \n\t\telse you could put it in?\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNELLY\n\t\tThat is our most modestly priced \n\t\treceptacle.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tGODDAMNIT!  IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND \n\t\tHERE?!\n\nPOINT DUME -- DAY\n\nIt is a high, wind-swept bluff.  Walter and the Dude walk \ntowards the lip of the bluff.  Parked in the background is \none lonely car, Walter's.\n\nWalter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic \nlid.  When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly \nfor a beat.  Finally:\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tI'll say a few words.\n\nThe Dude clasps his hands in front of him.  Walter clears \nhis throat.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tDonny was a good bowler, and a good \n\t\tman.  He was. . . He was one of us.  \n\t\tHe was a man who loved the outdoors, \n\t\tand bowling, and as a surfer explored \n\t\tthe beaches of southern California \n\t\tfrom Redondo to Calabassos.  And he \n\t\twas an avid bowler.  And a good \n\t\tfriend.  He died--he died as so many \n\t\tof his generation, before his time.  \n\t\tIn your wisdom you took him, Lord.  \n\t\tAs you took so many bright flowering \n\t\tyoung men, at Khe San and Lan Doc \n\t\tand Hill 364.  These young men gave \n\t\ttheir lives.  And Donny too.  Donny \n\t\twho. . . who loved bowling.\n\nWalter clears his throat.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tAnd so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, \n\t\tin accordance with what we think   \n\t\tyour dying wishes might well have \n\t\tbeen, we commit your mortal remains \n\t\tto the bosom of.\n\nWalter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tthe Pacific Ocean, which you loved \n\t\tso well.\n\nAS HE SHAKES OUT THE ASHES:\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tGoodnight, sweet prince.\n\nThe wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing \njust to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands, \nfrozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tShit, I'm sorry Dude.\n\nHe starts brushing off the Dude with his hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tGoddamn wind.\n\nHeretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping \nWalter's hands away.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tGoddamnit Walter!  You fucking \n\t\tasshole!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tDude!  Dude, I'm sorry!\n\nThe Dude is near tears.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYou make everything a fucking \n\t\ttravesty!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tDude, I'm--it was an accident!\n\nThe Dude gives Walter a furious shove.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWhat about that shit about Vietnam!\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tDude, I'm sorry--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tWhat the fuck does Vietnam have to \n\t\tdo with anything!  What the fuck \n\t\twere you talking about?!\n\nWalter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost \nlost.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tShit Dude, I'm sorry--\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYou're a fuck, Walter!\n\nHe gives Walter a weaker shove.  Walter seems dazed, then \nwraps his arms around the Dude.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTER\n\t\tAwww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.\n\nTHE LANES THE DUDE AND WALTER BOWLING\n\nWe watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow \nthrough--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before.  \nThey are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his \nbowling shirt.\n\nBAR AREA\n\nThe Dude walks up to the bar.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tTwo oat sodas, Gary.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARY\n\t\tRight.  Good luck tomorrow.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThanks, man.\n\n\t\t\t\tGARY\n\t\tSorry to hear about Donny.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tYeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you \n\t\teat the bear, and, uh.\n\n\"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" has come up on the jukebox, and The \nStranger ambles up to the bar.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE STRANGER\n\t\tHowdy do, Dude.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tOh, hey man, how are ya?

Strikes and gutters, \n\t\tups and downs.\n\nThe Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE STRANGER\n\t\tSure, I gotcha.\n\nThe bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.\n\n\t\t\t\tDUDE\n\t\tThanks, Gary...Take care, man, I \n\t\tgotta get back.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE STRANGER\n\t\tSure.

Well, you know, the Dude \n\t\tabides.\n\nGazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE STRANGER\n\t\tThe Dude abides.\n\nHe gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into \nthe camera.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE STRANGER\n\t\tI don't know about you, but I take \n\t\tcomfort in that.  It's good knowin' \n\t\the's out there, the Dude, takin' her \n\t\teasy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I \n\t\tsure hope he makes The finals.  Welp, \n\t\tthat about does her, wraps her all \n\t\tup.  Things seem to've worked out \n\t\tpretty good for the Dude'n Walter, \n\t\tand it was a purt good story, dontcha \n\t\tthink?   Made me laugh to beat the \n\t\tband.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I \n\t\tdidn't like seein' Donny go. But \n\t\tthen, happen to know that there's a \n\t\tlittle Lebowski on the way.  I guess \n\t\tthat's the way the whole durned human \n\t\tcomedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self, \n\t\tdown through the generations, westward \n\t\tthe wagons, across the sands a time \n\t\tuntil-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' \n\t\tagain.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed \n\t\tyourselves.\n\nHe brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull \nback.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE STRANGER\n\t\tCatch ya further on down the trail.\n\nAs we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar.  As his \nvoice fades:\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE STRANGER\n\t\t...Say friend, ya got any more a \n\t\tthat good sarsaparilla?...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Lebowski, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Joel Coen\u00a0\u00a0Ethan Coen\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:20:49.323204"}
