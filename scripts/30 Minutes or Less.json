Will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at\r\n          his captors. His mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his\r\n          back. He wears his \"Giorgio's\" cap and a buttoned up olive\r\n          green Army jacket.\r\n                         \r\n                          DWAYNE\r\n           You thought we were gonna rape you.\r\n                          (CHUCKLES)\r\n           Idiot.\r\n                         \r\n          Will mumbles something through the duct tape.\r\n                         \r\n                          DWAYNE\r\n           Just shut up.

And that I needed some extra\r\n           dough to indulge my habit. Which, in\r\n           hindsight, was probably just a cry\r\n           for help.

I\r\n           musta come here three times a day\r\n           trying to collect all the game pieces.\r\n           Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from\r\n           all the grease. The Major said I was\r\n           the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he\r\n           ever laid eyes on. But I didn't care,\r\n           I just wanted to win the money and\r\n           get the fuck out of there. So, one\r\n           night, I followed this skinny register\r\n           kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling\r\n           on him, asking him where they were\r\n           hiding the Park Place piece. The\r\n           million dollar prize. But he didn't\r\n           know shit.

Jay holds up the hair clippers like a\r\n          weapon, flicks them on.

Get it out for me.

He seems to be\r\n          on the right road, headed for the radio tower. He crumples\r\n          the map and throws it in back.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

The minivan door opens and Jay steps out.\r\n          Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop.\r\n          A long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe-\r\n          like device in his hand.\r\n                         \r\n          Jay helps Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van.\r\n          They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him.\r\n                         \r\n                          KATE\r\n           Will, are you there?\r\n                         \r\n                          WILL\r\n           I'm here.

He hits a\r\n          button and a pilot light comes on.\r\n           98.\r\n                         \r\n                          JAY\r\n                          (FLAT)\r\n           Just do what we say.

The timer freezes and the lock at\r\n          the hinge opens. Will carefully extricates himself from the\r\n          vest. He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it.\r\n          His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat.\r\n                         \r\n          Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to\r\n          Dwayne. He looks inside, smiles.

He goes down hard. Kate screams. Vaughn\r\n          points the gun at her and she shuts up.\r\n                         \r\n          Dwayne steps forward with the bag.\r\n                         \r\n                          DWAYNE\r\n           It's all good.

Jay catches Dwayne's eye.\r\n          Dwayne nods. Vaughn sees this.\r\n           101.\r\n                         \r\n                          VAUGHN\r\n           What the -\r\n                         \r\n          Jay rears up with the flamethrower. Vaughn couldn't be more\r\n          surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive\r\n          ball of fire at him.\r\n                         \r\n          Vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of\r\n                         WHICH -\r\n                         \r\n          Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and\r\n          knocking him off his feet.\r\n                         \r\n          Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the\r\n          ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries\r\n          to torch him with the 25-foot flame. A hand touches Kate's\r\n          shoulder and she whirls around to find -\r\n                         \r\n                          KATE\r\n           Chet!?

Bad news: it\r\n          keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack,\r\n          which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to\r\n          have an incredibly low flash point. So the spark from, say,\r\n          a bullet, would cause\r\n                         \r\n          AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES\r\n                         \r\n          Meanwhile, Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, clutching the\r\n          garbage bag.\r\n                         \r\n                          WILL\r\n           I got the money.

The\r\n          first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows-\r\n          what spewing from his mouth. Vaughn levels his gun -\r\n                         \r\n          It doesn't make a sound for two reasons. The second being\r\n          that it's out of bullets.\r\n                         \r\n          Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash.\r\n           102.\r\n                         \r\n          Vaughn drops to his knees. Pulse snatched from him.\r\n                         \r\n          SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay's screams. Dwayne looks\r\n          over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and\r\n          shrieking. Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he\r\n          sees the Mustang's tires peel. He tears off his mask,\r\n          frantically looks around. The money is gone.\r\n                         \r\n                          DWAYNE\r\n           No!!\r\n                         \r\n          Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of\r\n          the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. In his frenzy,\r\n          he somehow manages to string together two coherent words -\r\n                         \r\n                          JAY\r\n           Dwayne! Help!\r\n                         \r\n          Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the\r\n          driveway. He looks to Jay, then to his minivan. Dwayne's\r\n          face: Two roads diverge in a wood. Which to take?\r\n                         \r\n                          DWAYNE\r\n           Goddamn it, Jay!\r\n                         \r\n          Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it\r\n          to beat the flames down.\r\n                         \r\n                          DWAYNE\r\n           Stop, drop and roll!\r\n                         \r\n          Jay hits the deck. Dwayne continues fighting the flames,\r\n          finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and\r\n          smothers the last of them out.\r\n                         \r\n          Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes.\r\n                         \r\n                          JAY\r\n           You came back for me...you said you\r\n           never would.\r\n                         \r\n                          DWAYNE\r\n           You didn't hesitate back there, Jay.\r\n           You did good.\r\n                         \r\n          Jay smiles.

Jay stumbles up to his\r\n          feet and limps off toward the woods.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

His\r\n          father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he\r\n          isn't totally spent yet.
