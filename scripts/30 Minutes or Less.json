I\r\n           musta come here three times a day\r\n           trying to collect all the game pieces.\r\n           Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from\r\n           all the grease. The Major said I was\r\n           the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he\r\n           ever laid eyes on. But I didn't care,\r\n           I just wanted to win the money and\r\n           get the fuck out of there. So, one\r\n           night, I followed this skinny register\r\n           kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling\r\n           on him, asking him where they were\r\n           hiding the Park Place piece. The\r\n           million dollar prize. But he didn't\r\n           know shit. A year later, The Major\r\n           won the lotto. I asked him for a\r\n           Sega Genesis.
