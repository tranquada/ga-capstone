VOID - DAY\n\nStanding in a nonexistent set is ANDY KAUFMAN, looking a bit\nnervous.  Wide-eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a\nneedy, unsettling cuteness.  His hair is slicked-down, and\nhe wears the \"FRIENDLY WORLD\" costume from the Andy Kaufman\nspecial.\n\nFinally, Andy speaks -- in a peculiar FOREIGN ACCENT.\n\n\t\tANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)\n\tHallo.  I am Andy.  Welcoom to my\n\tmovie.\n\t\t(beat; he gets upset)\n\tI hoped the story of my life would\n\tbe nice...but it turned out\n\tterrible!  It is all LIES!

FINAL CREDITS roll.\n\nAndy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience.\nEvery time the music ends he picks up the needle and\nrestarts the music.  He does that as many times as the\ncredits require.\n\nFinally, CREDITS END.  And then--a sly smile.  He leans in.\nDROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS.\n\n\t\tANDY (AS REGULAR VOICE)\n\tOkay!

An upper-class Jewish neighborhood.  In the street,\ncrewcut BOYS play t-ball, laughing and shouting.  A fat\nconvertible pulls up to the smallest house, and STANLEY\nKAUFMAN, 40, gets out.  Still in his suit, he's a well-\nmeaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible.\n\nStanley goes over to admire the t-ball game.  At bat is his\nson MICHAEL, 6, a natural charmer.  Michael swings -- crack!\n-- and hits a solid single.  Stanley smiles.\n\n\t\tSTANLEY\n\tThat's my boy!

You're finished here.\n\nAn uncomfortable beat -- and then Andy starts crying.\n\nThe manager is dumbfounded.  He doesn't know what to do.\n\nTears are rolling pitifully down Andy's cheeks.  The manager\nis confused -- totally disoriented.  Shamed, Andy covers his\nface, then runs out.  Silence.  The manager stares after\nhim... having no idea what just happened.\n\nEXT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT\n\nSobbing Andy bursts out the door.  He steps onto the\nsidewalk -- and IMMEDIATELY STOPS CRYING.  Just like that.\n\nAndy lifts his big case and starts walking.  Andy shakes his\nhead angrily.\n\nHe turns down a dark street, hurrying alone through an\nunsavory New York neighborhood.  But then... TWO MEN\nappear... silently approaching.  Andy stops uncertainly --\ndebating whether to turn around.  But in that second -- the\nthugs are upon him, glaring menacingly.\n\n\t\tTHUG #1\n\tGive us your wallet.\n\nAndy stares fearfully.

People are\nlined up, waiting.  The man strides up -- GEORGE SHAPIRO, a\nHollywood talent manager.  George is old school: Bronx\naccent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness\nthat is quite disarming.  A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and\nwaves George in.\n\nINT. NY IMPROV, BAR - 1975 - NIGHT\n\nThe bar is packed with COMICS and SHOW BIZ TYPES.

Good night!\nThe comic waves and exits.  APPLAUSE.  George politely\nclaps.  A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune.\n\nWe think there's a break... when Andy suddenly, awkwardly\nsteps on stage.  He is in character as Foreign Man.  Pink\njacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in\nheadlights.  He puts down his big case, pulls out various\njunk, and arranges it on chairs.\n\nThe room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is.\nAndy tentatively grabs the mike.  The stagefright is agony.\n\n\t\tANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)\n\tNow?  Now...?\n\t\t(looking around)\n\tTank you veddy much.  I am very\n\thappy to be here.  I tink -- this is\n\ta very beautiful place.  But one\n\tting I do not like is too much\n\ttraffic.  Tonight I had to come\n\tfrom, eh, and the freeway, it was so\n\tmuch traffic.  It took me an hour\n\tand a half to get here!\n\nAndy chuckles, as if this were a punchline.\n\nSilence.  The crowd is baffled.\n\n\t\tANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)\n\tBut -- talking about the terrible\n\tthings: My wife.  Take my wife,\n\tplease take her.\n\nYikes.  A few NERVOUS LAUGHS.\n\nAndy gestures, as if they got the joke.\n\n\t\tANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)\n\tNo really, I am only foolink.  I\n\tlove my wife very much.  But she\n\tdon't know how to cook.  You know,\n\tone time, she make a steak and\n\tmashed potato.  Ehh, and the night\n\tbefore, she make spaghetti and\n\tmeatballs.  Her cooking is so bad...\n\tis terrible.\n\nPeople are embarrassed.  Some avert their eyes.  A couple\nhipsters laugh mockingly.\n\nGeorge leans forward.  Andy wipes the sweat from his brow.\n\t\t     ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)\n\tRight now, I would like to do for\n\tyou some imitations.  So first, I\n\twould like to imitate Archie Bunker.\n\t\t(no change in his\n\t\tvoice)\n\t\"You stupid, everybody ees stupid!\n\tEhh, get, get out of my chair\n\tMeathead... go in the, eh, Dingbat\n\tget into the kitchen, making the\n\tfood!

A few giggle, getting into\nthe groove.\n\nGeorge is intrigued.\n\n\t\tANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)\n\tAnd now... I would like to imitate\n\tthe Elvis Presley.\n\nA woman LAUGHS caustically.  Andy grins stupidly, then turns\nhis back to us.  He presses \"Play\" on a CASSETTE RECORDER...\nand the THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.\n\nHouse lights dim dramatically.  With a flourish, Andy pulls\ntape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones.  He removes his\npink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket.\n\nHe combs his hair.\n\nThen he brushes his hair.\n\nThen he combs his hair some more.\n\nFinally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins\naround.\n\nHe is ELVIS.  CONFIDENT.  SEXY.  LIP CURL.  DEAD-ON PERFECT.\n\nThe crowd is blown away.\n\nVegas Elvis INTRO MUSIC suddenly blasts.  Andy/Elvis\nswaggers stage left and takes a bow.  Then he goes stage\nright and takes a bow.  Then he returns stage left for\nanother bow.\n\nMusic STOPS.\n\n\t\tANDY (AS ELVIS)\n\tThank you very much.\n\nWow.  Flabbergasted, people APPLAUD.

I have no\n\ttalent.\n\t\t(he shrugs)\n\tI'm a song-and-dance man.\n\nGeorge looks up at Andy -- and inexplicably there is a giant\nMOIST BOOGER hanging from Andy's nostril.\n\nGeorge cringes.  He doesn't know what to say.\n\nA waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's HEALTH FOOD\n-- seaweed, beans, stringy paste.  George frowns.  Andy\nbeams.\n\n\t\tANDY (cont'd)\n\tMmm!  I particularly recommend the\n\tLotus root.\n\nAndy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands.\nThen he starts arranging the food in compulsive little\npiles: Beans in pinwheel shapes.  Sprouts in piles.\n\nGeorge peers at the bizarre food behavior.\n\t\t   GEORGE\n\tYou show a lot of promise... but...\n\tmy concern is I don't know where to\n\tbook you.

He looks back up -- and Andy's\nbooger has suddenly switched nostrils.\n\nHuh?\n\n\t\tANDY\n\tSee, I don't want easy laughs.\n\nAndy's about to eat -- but first bows his head in silent\nprayer.

Two guards go running for him.\n\nZmuda barrels away, trying to escape.  The guards chase.\nZmuda races by George, and suddenly palms off the camera\ninto George's arms.  The guards whip by, oblivious.\n\nGeorge grimaces, unclear about his loyalties.  He sweatily\npeers at the timebomb in his hands.\n\nAnd then -- George thrusts it under his jacket.

It hums with curiosity.  WAITERS\nclean off the dinner tables.  George rushes in and is seated\nin a far booth, with some STRANGERS.  He overhears a heated\nconversation between a PUSHY MAN and his WIFE.\n\n\t\tPUSHY MAN\n\tYou're not listenin'!  It's a VERY\n\tsimple concept.\n\n\t\tWIFE OF PUSHY MAN\n\tYou're making no sense.  How can\n\tthey be the same person --?\n\n\t\tPUSHY MAN\n\tTrust me!  You'll never see them on\n\tstage at the same time!\n\nThe onstage ORCHESTRA hits a fanfare.  LIGHTS DIM.  Sharp\nSPOTLIGHTS meet at the foot of the stage.  Suddenly -- Tony\nswaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph.\n\nThunderous APPLAUSE.  Tony beams.  The music stops.\n\nGeorge leans in, curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of\nthis.\n\nTony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra,\nand waits.  The NOISE LEVEL slowly drops -- but not\nentirely.  Tony waits, and waits, and waits... until\nsuddenly he turns towards the audience and SCREAMS\nFURIOUSLY.\n\n\t\tTONY CLIFTON\n\tSHUT UP!!!!!!\n\nEverybody looks up, alarmed.  The general murmur almost\ndies.  Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all\nthe unruly people.  As they quiet down... Tony turns back to\nthe orchestra and raises his arms.  The MUSICIANS lift their\ninstruments.  Silence is total -- except for the clank of\nchina.\n\nWaiters are serving coffee.\n\nTony spins back around, livid.\n\n\t\tTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)\n\tTHAT APPLIES TO YOU, TOO,\n\tPENGUINS!!!\n\nPeople signal \"shh\"!  The waiters realize Tony's addressing\nthem, and they stare back in disbelief!  This is their job!\n\n\t\tTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)\n\tYeah!  Yeah!  YOU!  I'm talkin' to\n\tYOU!!  And you better freeze, or\n\tI'll get your asses fired!!!\n\nTony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze.  The\nwaiters stand there like statues, staring in terror.\n\nSatisfied, Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his\narms.  Again, the musicians lift their instruments.  In\nanticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about.\nAudience members start whispering.  Tony hears this -- and\ndrops his arms and head in despair.\n\nThe musicians lower their instruments.  Tony waits for\nabsolute silence.  Only then does he signal the musicians to\nget ready again.  They do.  And then at that precise moment\n-- somebody DROPS a spoon.\nTony jolts, as if hit by a current.  He drops his hands\nagain, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look.\nThen he turns again, lowers his head, and waits.  And waits.\nAnd waits.\n\nThe man at George's table WHISPERS to his wife.\n\n\t\tPUSHY MAN\n\tHe's never gonna start!  Kaufman\n\tthinks this is funny!\n\t\t(beat)\n\tWe've paid forty bucks for a show\n\tthat's never gonna start!\n\nGeorge grins stupidly.  The silence is now deafening.\nSlowly, very slowly, Tony raises his arms.  Slowly... the\nmusicians get their instruments ready.  Tony stands there,\nand stands, and stands, waiting for something... anything...\nto disturb the silence.  In vain.  Somebody COUGHS.  The\nwhole scene repeats itself.\n\nFinally -- finally -- Tony is surrounded by total silence.\nThen, (only a moment before the length of this scene would\nbecome unbearable), he begins to move.  Tony pivots around,\nlooks at the audience...\n\nAnd the entire room looks like Tussaud's Wax Museum.  Tony\nstarts LAUGHING hysterically.  The audience's reaction is\nmixed:\n\nSome people LAUGH.  Some BOO.  Some ask perplexed questions.\nSome SCREAM OBSCENITIES.  Some even APPLAUD.\n\nTony is very happy.  He turns to the orchestra, raises his\nbaton -- and commences the downbeat!  The MUSIC BEGINS.\n\nA SPOTLIGHT hits the wings... and then ANDY STRIDES OUT.\n\nGeorge's jaw drops.\n\n\t\tWIFE OF PUSHY MAN\n\tYou see!  I told you!  They're not\n\tthe same person!\n\nThe whole audience BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE.  Life is back to\nnormal.  Andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a\nprepared row of congas.  He starts to play.\n\nTony Clifton grabs the microphone.\n\n\t\tTONY CLIFTON\n\tThank you!  Thank you!  I wrote this\n\ttune for my friend Frank Sinatra.\n\tHe had a nice little success with\n\tit... but forgot to thank me on the\n\talbum.\n\nHe starts to BELT \"I Gotta Be Me\".\n\nGeorge squints his eyes, trying to figure out who this is.\n\n\t\tTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)\n\t\"Whether I'm right\n\t Or whether I'm wrong\n\t Whether I find a place in this\n\tworld\n\t Or never belong!\n\t I gotta be me!  I gotta be me!\n\t What else can I be, but what I am?\"\n\nTony's singing is awful.  Andy happily accompanies on\ncongas.  The audience doesn't know what to think.\n\nTony's SINGING reaches the end... aggressive and off-key.\n\n\t\tTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)\n\tLet's bring it on home --\n\t\t(he hits his\n\t\tscreeching CLIMAX)\n\t\"I GOTTA BE MEEEEEE!\"\n\nThe BAND ends with a brassy punch.

He's pleasantly\nsurprised to see George.\n\nGeorge doesn't enter.  He goes to the \"CLIFTON\" door.  Andy\nfollows.  George opens the mystery door...\n\nINT.

See, with all these\n\tarticles, people think they're\n\tinsiders.  They see Tony Clifton,\n\tand they say, \"Ah, that's really\n\tAndy Kaufman.\"  But that spoils it.\n\tSo NOW, Tony denying being me is the\n\ttruth!  Tony's not me!  But maybe he\n\tis!

I'm at a stage where the\n\taudience expects me to constantly\n\tshock them.  But short of faking my\n\tdeath, or setting the theater on\n\tfire, I don't know what else to do.\n\t\t(thoughtful)\n\t'Cause I've always got to be one\n\tstep ahead of them.\n\n\t\tGEORGE\n\tBut I feel you're extending this\n\tphilosophy to real life.

Lynne barrels at\nhim, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this\nexperience.  Andy immediately grabs her by the legs and\nflips her over.\n\nWHUMP!  She's down.  Andy has trained for this.\n\nZmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official.\nLynne struggles and slithers away.\n\nShe grabs Andy's arm and forces him down.  People CHEER.\nHis torso hits the mat.  LOUDER CHEERS.  But suddenly he\nrolls over and pulls her hair!  Her head snaps back.  The\ncrowd is INCENSED.  Zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a\nstern warning.\n\nAndy nods, and they separate.  They do a little dance around\nthe ring, Lynne looking for a hole.  Suddenly, Andy spins\nher into a Half-Nelson.  Her arms are pinned.  They\nstruggle, then he throws her down on her stomach.  One!\nTwo!  Three!\n\nAnd DING!  It's OVER.
