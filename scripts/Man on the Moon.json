He does that as many times as the\ncredits require.\n\nFinally, CREDITS END.  And then--a sly smile.  He leans in.\nDROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS.\n\n<b>\t\tANDY (AS REGULAR VOICE)\n</b>\tOkay!

George is old school: Bronx\naccent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness\nthat is quite disarming.  A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and\nwaves George in.\n\n<b>INT.

Good night!\nThe comic waves and exits.  APPLAUSE.  George politely\nclaps.  A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune.\n\nWe think there's a break... when Andy suddenly, awkwardly\nsteps on stage.  He is in character as Foreign Man.  Pink\njacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in\nheadlights.  He puts down his big case, pulls out various\njunk, and arranges it on chairs.\n\nThe room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is.\nAndy tentatively grabs the mike.

The crowd is baffled.\n\n\t\tANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)\n\tBut -- talking about the terrible\n\tthings: My wife.  Take my wife,\n\tplease take her.\n\nYikes.

Andy grins stupidly, then turns\nhis back to us.  He presses \"Play\" on a CASSETTE RECORDER...\nand the THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.\n\nHouse lights dim dramatically.  With a flourish, Andy pulls\ntape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones.  He removes his\npink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket.\n\nHe combs his hair.\n\nThen he brushes his hair.\n\nThen he combs his hair some more.\n\nFinally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins\naround.\n\nHe is ELVIS.  CONFIDENT.  SEXY.  LIP CURL.  DEAD-ON PERFECT.\n\nThe crowd is blown away.\n\nVegas Elvis INTRO MUSIC suddenly blasts.  Andy/Elvis\nswaggers stage left and takes a bow.  Then he goes stage\nright and takes a bow.  Then he returns stage left for\nanother bow.\n\nMusic STOPS.\n\n<b>\t\tANDY (AS ELVIS)\n</b>\tThank you very much.\n\nWow.  Flabbergasted, people APPLAUD.

It's the image\nfrom the opening of this film.\n\nANDY'S POV: The chapel is filled with GRIEVING MOURNERS.\nAll are in black.  Everyone's quiet, in a state of shock.\n\nAndy's family is huddled.\n\nLynne sits alone in a pew, crying.\n\nGeorge gives Zmuda a hug.  Little Wendy comes over... and\nthey comfort each other.\n\nEveryone who ever knew Andy is there: Taxi cast, Fridays\ncast, TM followers, hookers, Jerry Lawler, Ed Weinberger,\nMaynard Smith, Budd Friedman, it goes on and on...\n\nAnd -- they all have odd discombobulated expressions.  They\nstare up at the PROJECTED ANDY.\n\n<b>\t\tANDY (ON FILM)\n</b>\tWell... My show is over.  I did my\n\tbest, and I just want to say, until\n\twe meet again... please remember:\n\t\t(he begins to SING)\n\t\"In this friendly, friendly world...\n\t With each day so full of joy.\n\t Why should any heart be lonely.\"\n\nSome gathered people tentatively join in the SINGING.\n\n\t\tANDY (ON FILM) (cont'd)\n\tSo everybody!  Put your arm around\n\tthe person next to you, even if you\n\tdon't like that person.  Come on!\n\t\t(he resumes SINGING)\n\t\"The world is such a wonderful\n\tplace,\n\tTo wander through,\n\tWhen you've got someone to love,\n\tTo wander along with you.\n\tWith the sky so full of stars,\n\tAnd the river so full of songs,\n\tEvery heart should be so thankful,\n\tThankful for this friendly, friendly\n\tworld...\"\n\nThe curtain behind the coffin OPENS and the casket with\nAndy's body slowly slides into the DARKNESS.\n\nThe curtain closes.  The FILM ENDS.\n\nAnd all goes silent.\n\nSome people cry.  Some begin to leave.  Most of them are\njust staying, numbed.\n\nGeorge and Zmuda whisper.\n\n<b>\t\tGEORGE\n</b>\tIt's a perfect Kaufman audience.\n\n<b>\t\tZMUDA\n</b>\tYeah.  They don't know whether to be\n\tsad, or angry.\n\nThe Taxi cast are flustered.\n\n<b>\t\tCAROL KANE\n</b>\tWhy are people leaving?  The\n\tcurtain's gonna open.  Andy's gonna\n\tcome out... I know it!\n\n<b>\t\tTONY DANZA\n</b>\tSure, the body was just made of\n\twax...!\n\t\t(a very long beat)\n\tWasn't it......?\n\nSilence.  They look to the front.\n\nThe closed curtain wafts... then settles motionless.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT.\n</b>\n<b>FADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>EXT. SUNSET BLVD./COMEDY STORE - NIGHT\n</b>\nA SUPER slowly appears:  \"EXACTLY ONE YEAR LATER\"\n\nOn Sunset, TWO DUDES come riding along on skateboards.\nSuddenly they reach -- INSANITY.  Traffic on Sunset is\njammed.  HONKING limousines jockey to squeeze by.\n\nConfused, one Dude squints into the distance -- and his eyes\npop.\n\n<b>\t\tDUDE #2\n</b>\tOh my GOD.\n\t\t(stupefied)\n\tThat's the freakiest thing I've ever\n\tseen!!

He's not dead!\n\n<b>\t\tDUDE #2\n</b>\tHe's just been lyin' low for a year!\n<b>\tWE GOTTA GO!\n</b>\nHysterical, the guys race up to the club.  But outside,\nthere's a CRAZED, PULSING MOB.  People are screaming.\nPolice have barricades.  Everybody cries to get in.\n\n<b>INT. COMEDY STORE - SAME TIME\n</b>\nIt's packed.  Every square inch is filled with glittery\nHollywood VIPs.  People make chit-chat... but there is a\nsqueamish excitement in the air.  A brooding unease.  Nobody\nknows what to expect.\n\nSuddenly -- the lights go black.  A BOOMING ANNOUNCER.\n\n<b>\t\tANNOUNCER (V.O.)\n</b>\tLadies and Gentlemen!  Please put\n\tyour hands together for... Tony\n\tClifton!\n\nThe THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.  \"DAAAAA, DAAAAA,\n<b>DAAAAA!  DA-DAAAAA\"!\n</b>\nA small SPOT appears -- on a peach tuxedo.  The light grows\nbigger, bigger... the tension magnifying... people\ngasping... our view widening... until Tony Clifton is\nrevealed onstage!\n\nIt's an extraordinary theatrical moment -- without response.\nThe crowd has no idea what to do.\n\nTony smirks.\n\n<b>\t\tTONY CLIFTON\n</b>\tHow ya doin'?\n\nDead silence.\n\nTony struts downstage.  He waves to the crowd.\n\n\t\tTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)\n\tHow you doin' back there?!\n\t\t(to the front rows)\n\tHow you doin' up here?!\n\nStill no response.  Until -- a lone reckless VOICE.\n\n<b>\t\tVOICE\n</b>\tAndy!\n\nWhoa.  The crowd rustles nervously.\n\nTony grimaces.\n\n<b>\t\tTONY CLIFTON\n</b>\tDon't know nothin' about no Andy.\n\tJust some dead guy tryin' to ride my\n\tcoattails.\n\t\t(to the BAND)\n\tLet's HIT IT, boys!  One, two, anda\n\tone two three four!\n\nThe BAND kicks in with disco anthem \"I WILL SURVIVE.\"  Tony\nstarts SINGING the schmaltzy opening:\n\n\t\tTONY CLIFTON (cont'd)\n\t\"First I was afraid\n\t I was petrified.\n\t Kept thinkin' I could never live\n\t Without you at my side.\"\n\t\t(he wipes away a\n\t\tpretend tear)\n\t\"Were you the one that tried to\n\t Hurt me with goodbye?\n\t Did you think I'd crumble?\n\t Did you think I'd lay down and\n\t Die...?\"\n\nWe PAN the room full of enthralled spectators.
