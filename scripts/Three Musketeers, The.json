GASCONY - DAWN                                        1\n</b>\n    Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree-\n    tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox\n    darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out\n    of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL.\n\n    SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625.\n    Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points\n    cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The\n    first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every\n    facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance\n    and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this\n    moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous\n    cry.\n\n    They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew.\n    Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is\n    nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the\n    air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer-\n    saults. This is fun.\n    Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden\n    fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they\n    fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of\n    hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots.\n    Anything goes as the swords cut through the air.\n    D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard\n    up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly\n    cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof,\n    fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles...\n    and follows.\n\n\n<b>2   ANGLE ON ROOFTOP                                           2\n</b>\n    Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard\n    and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause\n    to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other\n    side, attacking, defending, as they go.\n\n<b>3   INCLUDE INTERIOR                                           3\n</b>\n    Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances\n    up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof.\n    She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open\n    window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                        2.\n</b>\n<b>4   BACK TO SCENE                                              4\n</b>    Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en-\n    closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies\n    after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild\n    progress frequently resembles that of a young colt --\n    stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his\n    sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan\n    parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over\n    the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and\n    rises to fight again.\n    The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de-\n    volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly\n    endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the\n    last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow-\n    moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs\n    toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan\n    with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes\n    when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap\n    to join him.\n    And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of\n    music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn-\n    ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just\n    then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard\n    backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he\n    stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He\n    prepares one last blow --\n    -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the\n    side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical\n    antidote to all this glorious swordplay.\n\n\n<b>5   INCLUDE CREEK                                              5\n</b>    Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of\n    reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with\n    grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation\n    will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and\n    lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's\n    apple.\n\n    A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh,\n    long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.\n\n<b>                            D'ARTAGNAN\n</b>              Had enough?\n<b>                            GIRARD\n</b>                     (breathless\n                      deadpan)\n              I believe now would be a good\n              time to end your, uhm, formal\n              training.

Two down.\n\n     D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath,\n     but greatly pleased with his performance.

Athos\n     takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT,\n     and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once.\n     D'Artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself\n     face to face with Jussac.\n     The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix-\n     ture of styles and techniques. Athos is a brutal swords-\n     man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire\n     also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional\n     elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful\n     technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic\n     ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than\n     paint and canvas.\n     And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all,\n     Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of\n     bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo,\n     nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill\n     of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his\n     already impressive size and strength, and you have a one-\n     man wrecking crew of epic proportions.\n     D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He\n     bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver-\n     sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac-\n     rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself\n     against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all\n     directions at once.\n<b>                                JUSSAC\n</b>                         (losing patience)\n                  Stand still!

He\n     produces a pair of nunchucks. Biscarat looks at the odd\n     weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion...\n     and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks\n     him to the ground.\n\n<b>                             PORTHOS\n</b>                      (eyes on the tower)\n               Damn monks. Always spoiling\n               everybody's fun.\n\n     Aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next.\n<b>                             ARAMIS\n</b>               They are nearer to God...\n\n<b>                             PORTHOS\n</b>               They're about to get a little\n               nearer to the hilt of my sword.\n<b>                               ARAMIS\n</b>               Pagan.\n<b>                               PORTHOS\n</b>               Papist.\n     Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents.\n     He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat\n     struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees\n     him, sighs.\n<b>                             PORTHOS\n</b>                      (to Aramis)\n               Excuse me?\n<b>                             ARAMIS\n</b>               I'm fine, thank you.\n\n     And Porthos returns to his original foe. Meanwhile,\n     Athos' heavy strokes take their toll. Cahusac staggers,\n     wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls\n     to the ground with a thud. Aramis calls out to him,\n     indicates d'Artagnan:\n<b>                             ARAMIS\n</b>               Take a look at our young friend.\n\n<b>                             ATHOS\n</b>               You mean he's still alive?\n\n     Not only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out\n     of Jussac.  Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge\n     at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's\n     sword like a snake and runs him through.\n\n<b>                                                  (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                              42.\n</b>\n<b>44   CONTINUED:                                                     44\n</b>     Jussac falls to the ground, lies still.    He is dead.\n\n     Athos and Aramis react, impressed. Then turn their full\n     attention on weakening foes. They disarm and disable\n     them with swift strokes. Meanwhile, Porthos chases\n     Biscarat into a grove of trees. The Guard has discovered\n     the better part of valor, now runs for his life. Porthos\n     -- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish\n     bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head.\n     Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound, turns to face him.\n     The color drains from his face.\n\n<b>                                 BISCARAT\n</b>                  Now what...?\n\n     Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about\n     the neck, the balls slam into his head. The Guard drops\n     to the ground without a sound.\n<b>                                PORTHOS\n</b>                  God, I love my work.\n\n\n<b>45   AFTERMATH                                                      45\n</b>     A sudden silence, save for the occasional dull groan.\n     D'Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis bending\n     over Jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his\n     breath.\n<b>                                D'ARTAGNAN\n</b>                         (to Athos)\n                  What's he doing?\n\n<b>                                ATHOS\n</b>                  Last rites.

They keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear\n     the brims of their hats pulled low to cover their faces.\n\n     The occupants of the inn regard the new arrivals with\n     suspicion. Outisde, the STORM BLOWS. D'Artagnan closes\n     the heavy door. Fearful, the Innkeeper comes forward to\n     meet the four ominous travelers.\n\n<b>                                  INNKEEPER\n</b>                  Good evening.\n<b>                                ATHOS\n</b>                  See to our horses and bring us\n                  some food.\n<b>                                INNKEEPER\n</b>                         (apologetic)\n                  I'm sorry but we have little to\n                  spare. The Cardinal's Guards were\n                  here today. They helped\n                  themselves to our food and then\n                  refused to pay.\n<b>                                ARAMIS\n</b>                         (bitter)\n                  In the name of God, I'm sure.\n     Porthos is on the lookout for danger. He reaches inside\n     his cloak for a weapon and, in doing so, accidentally\n     exposes his Musketeer tunic.\n\n<b>                                BARMAID #1\n</b>                         (crying out)\n                  Musketeers!\n\n     The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and\n     d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight. They stand\n     back to back in a circle, ready for attack.\n\n     But there is no attack. Quite the contrary.       The people\n     here are thrilled to see them.\n\n<b>                                INNKEEPER\n</b>                         (honored)\n                  Musketeers in my house!

Did you say Aramis?\n     And with that, the three Barmaids desert Porthos and\n     scurry across the room to attach themselves to Aramis.\n     Porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair.\n<b>                                PORTHOS\n</b>                  I don't get it.

Porthos regales the Barmaids with a tale.\n\n<b>                             PORTHOS\n</b>               I said, 'A Queen is no different\n               than a barmaid in the dark. Though\n               less... practiced in the arts of\n               pleasure...'\n\n     The Barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee.\n     But d'Artagnan isn't so sure. Porthos, with two Barmaids,\n     bellows a reply.\n\n<b>                             PORTHOS\n</b>               If you're going to be a proper\n               Musketeer, you'll have to learn\n               the manly art of wenching. Right,\n               ladies?\n     The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over\n     Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ-\n     ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins.\n<b>                             PORTHOS\n</b>               Ahh, very good. Your first\n               subject. But you'll need\n               instruction. Watch closely.\n     Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings\n     her lips toward his.\n<b>                             PORTHOS\n</b>               The secret to wenching is the\n               first kiss. For in that kiss, a\n               lasting impression is made. If it\n               is weak, she will think you are\n               weak. And if it is comical, she\n               will think you are a clown. With\n               me?\n<b>                               D'ARTAGNAN\n</b>               Weak... weak.    Comical... clown.\n\n<b>                              PORTHOS\n</b>               Very good.   And as a Musketeer is\n               never weak,  and only rarely a\n               clown, your  first kiss must be all\n               the things  that you are. Like\n               this...\n     Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.      He breaks it,\n     turns to d'Artagnan with a grin.\n\n<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                             73.\n</b>\n<b>83   CONTINUED:                                                    83\n</b><b>                                PORTHOS\n</b>                  You may speak first if you like,\n                  your name, her name, an endearment\n                  or two.

The Barmaid slips from\n     Porthos' lap, sits down on the bench beside him.\n     Aramis does not touch her. He simply looks into her\n     eyes... and begins to speak.\n<b>                                ARAMIS\n</b>                  'Shall I compare thee to a\n                     summer's day?\n                  Thou art more lovely and more\n                     temperate:\n                  Rough winds do shake the darling\n                     buds of May,\n                  And summer's leash hath all too\n                     short a date;\n                  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven\n                     shines,\n                  And often is his gold complexion\n                     dimmed;\n                  And every fair from fair sometimes\n                     declines,\n                  By chance, or nature's changing\n                     course untrimmed;\n                  But thy eternal summer shall not\n                     fade.\n<b>                                (MORE)\n</b><b>                                                    (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                             74.\n</b>\n<b>83   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             83\n</b><b>                                ARAMIS (CONT'D)\n</b>                  Nor lose possession of that fair\n                     thou owest,\n                  Nor shall death brag thou\n                     wanderest in his shade,\n                  When in eternal lines to time thou\n                     growest;\n                  So long as men can breathe, or eyes\n                     can see.\n                  So long lives this, and this gives\n                     life to thee.'\n\n     The Barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently.

I'd\n                   lay in bed at night and imagine it,\n                   just the two of us. But he died\n                   before I could go with him.\n      Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.       He replies with\n      quiet cynicism:\n<b>                                 ATHOS\n</b>                   Well. You have your boyhood wish\n                   at last. The dark forest.

And when it does -- it\n                   will mark you forever.\n\n      Athos rides into the forest.

A\n      pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING\n      HOOFBEATS. Athos and d'Artagnan turn in surprise, see\n      SIX HORSEMEN CRASHING through the glade.\n\n\n<b>102   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             102\n</b>      Athos and d'Artagnan GALLOP through the dense forest.\n      The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes\n      d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount.\n      Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at\n      the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all\n      around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag-\n      gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the\n      crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with\n      Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a\n      SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others\n      curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ\n      back and forth like angry hornets.\n      Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered.\n      The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to\n      tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads:\n<b>                              ATHOS\n</b>                I'll hold them off for as long as\n                I can.

D'Artagnan recognizes the\n      kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express\n      it. And that there is no use arguing with him.\n\n<b>                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n</b>                   At least take my pistol.\n\n      He gives it to Athos.

Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from\n      his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road.

D'Artagnan sees it in\n      the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking\n      the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out-\n      stretched.

Milady is the\n      messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to\n      the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her\n      negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh,\n      reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of\n      the fleur de lis.

Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un-\n      fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps\n      forward to meet him.\n\n      Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A\n      series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows.\n      The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the\n      martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet,\n      dazed.

D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on\n      the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop\n      d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted\n      on a sword OUT OF FRAME.

D'Artagnan\n      follows. The Musketeers confront Milady's evil Bodyguards\n      in the night and fog. Athos with brutal perfection.\n      Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the\n      absurd. And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry --\n      and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his\n      opponents.\n\n      Milady views the latter with alarm.

Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts,\n      rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the\n      ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard.

But\n      Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the\n      face with his fist.\n<b>                                                 (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                             131.\n</b>\n<b>158   CONTINUED:                                                    158\n</b>      Rochefort goes sprawling.

He\n      tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it\n      neatly. Athos watches from a short distance, knows\n      this moment belongs to d'Artagnan. He will not intervene.\n      But he shouts:\n<b>                                  ARAMIS\n</b>                   D'Artagnan.   Kill him where he\n                   stands.\n      These are d'Artagnan's words. A son vowing to avenge the\n      death of his father. D'Artagnan wonders.

Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan\n      has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto.\n      Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He\n      cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a\n      knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the\n      floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But\n      d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his\n      feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent.\n\n      Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall.\n      He pins him there, stunning the youth.
