GASCONY - DAWN                                        1\n\n    Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree-\n    tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox\n    darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out\n    of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL.\n\n    SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625.\n    Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points\n    cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The\n    first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every\n    facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance\n    and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this\n    moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous\n    cry.\n\n    They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew.\n    Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is\n    nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the\n    air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer-\n    saults. This is fun.\n    Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden\n    fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they\n    fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of\n    hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots.\n    Anything goes as the swords cut through the air.\n    D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard\n    up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly\n    cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof,\n    fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles...\n    and follows.\n\n\n2   ANGLE ON ROOFTOP                                           2\n\n    Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard\n    and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause\n    to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other\n    side, attacking, defending, as they go.\n\n3   INCLUDE INTERIOR                                           3\n\n    Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances\n    up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof.\n    She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open\n    window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side.\n\n                                                        2.\n\n4   BACK TO SCENE                                              4\n    Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en-\n    closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies\n    after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild\n    progress frequently resembles that of a young colt --\n    stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his\n    sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan\n    parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over\n    the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and\n    rises to fight again.\n    The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de-\n    volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly\n    endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the\n    last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow-\n    moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs\n    toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan\n    with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes\n    when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap\n    to join him.\n    And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of\n    music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn-\n    ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just\n    then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard\n    backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he\n    stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He\n    prepares one last blow --\n    -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the\n    side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical\n    antidote to all this glorious swordplay.\n\n\n5   INCLUDE CREEK                                              5\n    Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of\n    reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with\n    grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation\n    will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and\n    lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's\n    apple.\n\n    A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh,\n    long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.\n\n                            D'ARTAGNAN\n              Had enough?\n                            GIRARD\n                     (breathless\n                      deadpan)\n              I believe now would be a good\n              time to end your, uhm, formal\n              training.

Girard struggles upward, peers at the shape of his\n    clothing -- cut to ribbons, muddy and soaked.\n\n                               GIRARD\n                 And god have mercy on whomever\n                 you meet next.\n\n                                                   CUT TO:\n\n6   EXT.

They react\n     to SHOUTING   and VIOLENT NOISES coming from a tavern\n     ahead. The    one called... The Dead Rat.\n     The tavern door flies open, and two of the Cardinal's\n     Guards are flung into the street, bruised and bloody.\n     Just then: A window on the second floor bursts open,\n     and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his\n     feet, threatening to drop him into the street. The\n     Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women,\n     song -- is called PORTHOS. Jussac shouts:\n                                JUSSAC\n                  Release that man!!\n     Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges\n     to the street with a dull thud. Then, with a wink and a\n     piratical grin, Porthos ducks inside. Jussac darkens,\n     signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern.\n\n\n17   INT.

But for\n     now, all is calm.\n\n     A group of the Cardinal's Guards is seated around a big\n     table littered with flagons and bottles. On the floor\n     around them are their swords and rifles. It appears the\n     Gruards are celebrating a victory. But wait. There's\n     something wrong with this picture. On closer inspection,\n     we see that the Guards have been stripped to their under-\n     clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes. They are\n     all bruised and bloody.

What he beholds\n     is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven-\n     teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the\n     sky. For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a\n     magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true.\n     D'Artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of THUNDERING\n     HOOFBEATS coming from behind. He turns in response and\n     what he sees is this:\n     Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth\n     pursued by two men on horseback.\n\n19   D'ARTAGNAN                                                     19\n\n     His heroic blood stirs. Women in danger! As the women\n     GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse. Quickly\n     formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby\n     tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road.\n\n                                                           14.\n\n20   ANGLE                                                       20\n     As the two riders pass underneath, d'Artagnan leaps into\n     space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the\n     saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense-\n     less. One down.\n     D'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re-\n     verses direction and GALLOPS back, charging d'Artagnan.\n     The rider draws his saber.\n     D'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches\n     the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the\n     saddle. The man lands with a painful thud at\n     d'Artagnan's feet. Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is\n     upon him with flying fists. One swift punch -- and the\n     second rider is senseless. Two down.\n\n     D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath,\n     but greatly pleased with his performance. He looks up as\n     the two women ride back to see what's happened.\n     The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark-\n     haired girl in her late teens. Her name is ANNE. Her\n     companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and\n     equally beautiful.

THRONE ROOM - DAY                                       33\n\n     Anne, or rather, Queen Anne, steps into the throne room,\n     a massive cathedral-like chamber. Twin thrones occupy\n     a raised dais. An entire wall is covered with a spectac-\n     ular map of the world. The map contains every known\n     country and continent, including the New World. The\n     SENESCHAL exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom.\n     Anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber. And\n     for the first time, she looks and acts her age. Barely\n     a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings\n     and queens who came before her. And a long way from\n     home. Anne steps to the great map of the world. She\n     reaches out to touch her own country, Austria, feels a\n     pang of separation. We hear:\n                             MAN (O.S.)\n               Your Majesty...\n\n     Anne reacts with a start. A tall, powerfully built man\n     stands in the shadows, a spectre in red.\n                             ANNE\n               Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised\n               me.\n     Cardinal Richelieu steps out of the darkness.     He smiles.\n\n                             RICHELIEU\n               How was your ride?\n\n     Richelieu's question takes her by surprise. He bows\n     before Anne. Considering a reply, she extends her hand.\n     The Cardinal kisses it.\n\n                               ANNE\n               My ride...?    Well, I...

Anne\n     nods assent.\n\n                                RICHELIEU\n                  Louis was only nine years old\n                  when his father was assassinated.\n                  He lost his childhood forever that\n                  day. I have watched him grow\n                  toward manhood, seen the toll his\n                  life demands. A boy who is not\n                  allowed to be a boy sometimes has\n                  difficulty becoming a man. He is\n                  shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet\n                  stubborn. But most of all, he is\n                  not yet sure exactly who he is.\n                  The boy who lost his father. Or\n                  the King of France.\n                                ANNE\n                  But how can I...?\n\n                                RICHELIEU\n                  Flatter him. Make the boy feel\n                  like a King. So that the King\n                  may be your husband.\n\n     Anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply...\n     when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull\n     boom, the Seneschal chants:\n\n                                SENESCHAL\n                  His Majesty, the King.\n\n     The Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters. He is\n     surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan. His face\n     is handsome and intelligent.\n\n                                  RICHELIEU\n                  Your Majesty.\n                                LOUIS\n                  Cardinal Richelieu, I've been\n                  looking for you.\n\n     As Louis strides toward them, Richelieu and Anne bow.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              30.\n\n33   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              33\n     When Louis sees Anne, he reacts with an almost imper-\n     ceptible start.

He steps forward, extends a\n     hand. The others follow, shake as well. Athos intro-\n     duces each in turn.\n\n                                ATHOS\n                  Athos... Porthos...

Good to see you again...\n     Meanwhile, Jussac and his Guards look on with increasing\n     impatience. He clears his throat, draws his saber. The\n     Musketeers turn toward the Guards, d'Artagnan standing\n     among them.\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         40.\n\n41   CONTINUED:    (4)                                          41\n                                PORTHOS\n                  Well.

Athos\n     takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT,\n     and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once.\n     D'Artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself\n     face to face with Jussac.\n     The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix-\n     ture of styles and techniques. Athos is a brutal swords-\n     man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire\n     also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional\n     elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful\n     technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic\n     ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than\n     paint and canvas.\n     And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all,\n     Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of\n     bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo,\n     nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill\n     of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his\n     already impressive size and strength, and you have a one-\n     man wrecking crew of epic proportions.\n     D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He\n     bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver-\n     sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac-\n     rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself\n     against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all\n     directions at once.\n                                JUSSAC\n                         (losing patience)\n                  Stand still!

He grabs the BELL rope, gives\n     it a mighty pull... and sounds a clamorous ALARM.\n\n                                                           41.\n\n44   BACK TO SCENE                                               44\n     Porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation. He\n     produces a pair of nunchucks. Biscarat looks at the odd\n     weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion...\n     and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks\n     him to the ground.\n\n                             PORTHOS\n                      (eyes on the tower)\n               Damn monks. Always spoiling\n               everybody's fun.\n\n     Aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next.\n                             ARAMIS\n               They are nearer to God...\n\n                             PORTHOS\n               They're about to get a little\n               nearer to the hilt of my sword.\n                               ARAMIS\n               Pagan.\n                               PORTHOS\n               Papist.\n     Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents.\n     He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat\n     struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees\n     him, sighs.\n                             PORTHOS\n                      (to Aramis)\n               Excuse me?\n                             ARAMIS\n               I'm fine, thank you.\n\n     And Porthos returns to his original foe. Meanwhile,\n     Athos' heavy strokes take their toll. Cahusac staggers,\n     wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls\n     to the ground with a thud. Aramis calls out to him,\n     indicates d'Artagnan:\n                             ARAMIS\n               Take a look at our young friend.\n\n                             ATHOS\n               You mean he's still alive?\n\n     Not only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out\n     of Jussac.  Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge\n     at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's\n     sword like a snake and runs him through.\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              42.\n\n44   CONTINUED:                                                     44\n     Jussac falls to the ground, lies still.    He is dead.\n\n     Athos and Aramis react, impressed. Then turn their full\n     attention on weakening foes. They disarm and disable\n     them with swift strokes. Meanwhile, Porthos chases\n     Biscarat into a grove of trees. The Guard has discovered\n     the better part of valor, now runs for his life. Porthos\n     -- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish\n     bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head.\n     Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound, turns to face him.\n     The color drains from his face.\n\n                                 BISCARAT\n                  Now what...?\n\n     Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about\n     the neck, the balls slam into his head. The Guard drops\n     to the ground without a sound.\n                                PORTHOS\n                  God, I love my work.\n\n\n45   AFTERMATH                                                      45\n     A sudden silence, save for the occasional dull groan.\n     D'Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis bending\n     over Jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his\n     breath.\n                                D'ARTAGNAN\n                         (to Athos)\n                  What's he doing?\n\n                                ATHOS\n                  Last rites. Aramis takes death\n                  very seriously.\n\n     Porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a\n     pouch under his cloak. D'Artagnan sees the other weapons\n     there, including a boomerang. Maybe next time.\n\n                                PORTHOS\n                         (re: the bolo)\n                  Do you know where this bolo comes\n                  from?\n\n                                D'ARTAGNAN\n                         (a bold jest, given\n                          the circumstances)\n                  The Queen of America?\n\n                                 PORTHOS\n                  Spain.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 43.\n\n45   CONTINUED:                                                        45\n     Porthos deadpans, then grins acceptance.

By killing\n                  Jussac, the boy's made himself\n                  an outlaw too.\n\n                                ATHOS\n                  Not if he leaves Paris.

Whatever\n     the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers\n     mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier\n     tone.\n\n                                ARAMIS\n                  I know Athos may seem cold and\n                  unfriendly, but don't let that\n                  fool you.\n                                PORTHOS\n                  He really is cold and unfriendly.\n\n                                ARAMIS\n                  But he's also right.

It has been both the best\n     and the worst day of his young life.\n\n     That's when a group of horsemen come riding around the\n     corner of the monastery -- five Cardinal's Guards led by\n     Rochefort himself. They see their wounded comrades,\n     Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the\n     distance.\n\n                                ROCHEFORT\n                         (pointing)\n                  There they go!

But it is gone.\n\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                  My sword --\n                                ROCHEFORT\n                  It's magnificent. Where did you\n                  get it?\n\n     Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, the familiar eyepatch, admiring\n     d'Artagnan's sword in his hands.\n                                D'ARTAGNAN\n                         (after a beat)\n                  It belonged to my father.\n                                ROCHEFORT\n                  Your father...\n\n     Rochefort studies d'Artagnan for a long moment, then...\n                                ROCHEFORT\n                  Well now it belongs to me.

But Rochefort raises the\n     sword, points it at his throat. D'Artagnan freezes,\n     feels the sharp tip of the blade.\n                                 ROCHEFORT\n                  Soon enough.\n\n     Rochefort shoves d'Artagnan back to the floor with a\n     heavy boot. A beat.

D'Artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged\n     in the Crusades. He nods, gestures for Rochefort to\n     come closer. As if to impart a secret. Rochefort tilts\n     downward, d'Artagnan rises up... and whispers.\n                                D'ARTAGNAN\n                  Give me my father's sword, and\n                  I'll cut out your heart.\n     Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt\n     of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps\n     from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious.\n                                 ROCHEFORT\n                  Fool.   Like your father.\n     Rochefort storms from the cell. He nods at a grizzled\n     jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles\n     on the cell wall. The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan,\n     inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. He lifts, drags\n     him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open,\n     the jailer reacts with surprise, and...\n                                                   CUT TO:\n50   INT.

A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the\n     jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure. He\n     looks left and right -- dank corridors, darkness, the\n     OCCASIONAL GROAN. And steps lightly into the shadows.\n\n51   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                 51\n\n     He seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. Two jailers con-\n     verse, step towards him. D'Artagnan leaps into a cell\n     doorway, allows them to pass. Suddenly: scabrous hands\n     reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat.\n     He shudders, leaps free. And continues.\n\n     D'Artagnan steps     deeper in the labyrinth. Frustrated,\n     no way out. Just      then: more FOOTSTEPS heading toward\n     him. D'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked\n     figure steps INTO     VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of\n     sullen jailers.\n     D'Artagnan thinks fast... and joins them.\n\n                                                   CUT TO:\n\n                                                           49.\n\n52   INT.

He keeps his head down, glances at the corridor\n     ahead, looking for a way out. But the cloaked figure is\n     escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and\n     toward a pristine wooden door. D'Artagnan watches as\n     the door opens, revealing... Cardinal Richelieu, a fear-\n     some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France.\n\n     D'Artagnan's jaw drops. The cloaked figure steps inside.\n     The jailers disperse. D'Artagnan takes steps as if to\n     join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal\n     and the cloaked figure now behind it.\n\n53   ANGLE TO INCLUDE INTERIOR                                   53\n\n     The cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal. Richelieu\n     smiles, concupiscent. Rochefort stands in a corner,\n     ignored for the moment.\n                             RICHELIEU\n               I have an errand that requires\n               your singular talents.\n\n     The figure rises. The hood falls back... revealing the\n     unforgettable features of Milady de Winter. She answers\n     the Cardinal's smile with a seductive expression.\n                             MILADY\n               I was beginning to think you'd\n               forgotten me.\n                              RICHELIEU\n               Forget you?

He opens the door a fraction, holds an ear\n     close...\n\n\n55   BACK TO SCENE                                               55\n     Richelieu produces a sealed document from his sleeve,\n     and hands it to Milady.\n\n                             RICHELIEU\n               Carry this to the Duke of\n               Buckingham.\n\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               50.\n\n55   CONTINUED:                                                      55\n                                MILADY\n                         (impressed)\n                  You did it.

This\n     time Richelieu does not utter protest.

A motley crowd gathers around the execution\n     scaffold, held back by men-at-arms. A hooded executioner\n     mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a\n     PRIEST. The Priest wears a black cassock and a broad\n     black sombrero. The executioner, a large man, raises\n     his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his\n     finger. Razor-sharp. The executioner holds up his\n     bloody thumb.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         55.\n\n59   CONTINUED:                                                59\n     The crowd roars approval. And turns to regard the day's\n     victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.\n\n     D'Artagnan stands, half-naked, his hands bound behind him,\n     in a horse-drawn cart. The driver turns the cart, begins\n     a circuit of the square. The blood-thirsty crowd cheers\n     and jeers at d'Artagnan. But d'Artagnan keeps his head\n     high. If he must die, he will die with dignity.\n\n60   TOWER OF BASTILLE                                         60\n\n     Rochefort watches from a tower overlooking the square.\n     Richelieu appears beside him.\n\n                                ROCHEFORT\n                  Milady left at midnight.

A man-\n     at-arms drops the tailgate, d'Artagnan steps down. He is\n     taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and\n     several men-at-arms carrying muskets.\n\n61   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             61\n\n     The Cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance\n     from the square. The Guards who attend it have wandered\n     off to watch the festivities. The coachman remains,\n     seated on top, braiding his whip. Suddenly, a gloved hand\n     grabs the coachman, yanks him from his seat.\n\n62   SCAFFOLD                                                  62\n\n     D'Artagnan is led by the Captain of the Guards up the\n     stairs to the execution platform.

A CLOSER\n     look reveals Queen Anne and Constance. They ride through\n     the city, towards the countryside beyond. But their\n     progress has led them here.

Inestimable space\n     between. Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches\n     d'Artagnan. Porthos steps back from d'Artagnan, raises\n     his axe. D'Artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a\n     silent prayer. That's when screams of panic erupt from\n     the crowd. D'Artagnan raises his head to see the source\n     of this mayhem.\n\n\n64   MARKET SQUARE                                                64\n     The Cardinal's crimson carriage races toward the scaffold,\n     scattering the crowd in all directions. Men shout, women\n     scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves,\n     the coach's THUNDEROUS spinning WHEELS. In the driver's\n     seat, clutching the reins in one hand and CRACKING a WHIP\n     in the other... is Athos.\n     Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the\n     closest men-at-arms. Aramis opens his Bible, pulls out\n     a PISTOL, and BLASTS the saber from the hand of the\n     Captain of the Guards. A man-at-arms raises his musket\n     to shoot the false priest, but d'Artagnan leaps out of\n     nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the man-\n     at-arms off the scaffold.\n\n65   CARRIAGE                                                     65\n\n     Athos pulls up alongside the scaffold.\n                                ATHOS\n                         (the usual dour\n                          expression, but a\n                          hint of levity)\n                  Gentlemen, your carriage.\n                  Compliments of the Cardinal.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              58.\n\n65   CONTINUED:                                                     65\n     D'Artagnan rushes to the edge of the scaffold, springs\n     into the air, landing on the seat beside him.

Porthos regales the Barmaids with a tale.\n\n                             PORTHOS\n               I said, 'A Queen is no different\n               than a barmaid in the dark.

Porthos, with two Barmaids,\n     bellows a reply.\n\n                             PORTHOS\n               If you're going to be a proper\n               Musketeer, you'll have to learn\n               the manly art of wenching. Right,\n               ladies?\n     The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over\n     Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ-\n     ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins.\n                             PORTHOS\n               Ahh, very good. Your first\n               subject. But you'll need\n               instruction. Watch closely.\n     Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings\n     her lips toward his.\n                             PORTHOS\n               The secret to wenching is the\n               first kiss. For in that kiss, a\n               lasting impression is made. If it\n               is weak, she will think you are\n               weak. And if it is comical, she\n               will think you are a clown. With\n               me?\n                               D'ARTAGNAN\n               Weak... weak.    Comical... clown.\n\n                              PORTHOS\n               Very good.   And as a Musketeer is\n               never weak,  and only rarely a\n               clown, your  first kiss must be all\n               the things  that you are. Like\n               this...\n     Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.      He breaks it,\n     turns to d'Artagnan with a grin.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             73.\n\n83   CONTINUED:                                                    83\n                                PORTHOS\n                  You may speak first if you like,\n                  your name, her name, an endearment\n                  or two.

But the combatants make the most\n     of it. Slipping, sliding, and falling. They attack with\n     everything they've got. The Cavaliers are excellent\n     swordsmen. And, as if that were not enough, the\n     Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must\n     keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades.\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              93.\n\n97   CONTINUED:                                                     97\n     Porthos drives his opponent about the flatboat with a\n     devilish grin, chases him between -- and at one point,\n     over -- blindfolded horses.\n     Aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually re-\n     ducing his opponent to tatters. At one juncture, the\n     child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of\n     the flatboat, the deep river beyond. Aramis executes a\n     neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with\n     one arm while continuing to do battle with the other.\n     He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues.\n\n     The two Cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the\n     flatboat deck.

He promised to take me\n                   on my tenth birthday. I don't know\n                   why he picked that year. Something\n                   about a boy becoming a man. I'd\n                   lay in bed at night and imagine it,\n                   just the two of us. But he died\n                   before I could go with him.\n      Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.       He replies with\n      quiet cynicism:\n                                 ATHOS\n                   Well. You have your boyhood wish\n                   at last. The dark forest. The\n                   thrill of the hunt. The nearness\n                   of death.\n      Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.\n\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   I'd be proud to die for my King.\n                                 ATHOS\n                   I just wanted to save you from the\n                   life of a Musketeer.

And when it does -- it\n                   will mark you forever.\n\n      Athos rides into the forest.

A\n      pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING\n      HOOFBEATS.

A SHOT grazes\n      d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount.\n      Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at\n      the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all\n      around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag-\n      gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the\n      crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with\n      Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a\n      SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others\n      curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ\n      back and forth like angry hornets.\n      Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered.\n      The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to\n      tree.

D'Artagnan recognizes the\n      kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express\n      it. And that there is no use arguing with him.\n\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   At least take my pistol.\n\n      He gives it to Athos.

An exhausted\n      HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the\n      saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes\n      open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from\n      his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He\n      opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then\n      closes them.\n      We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING.\n      The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt\n      just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we\n      can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback,\n      bodyguards to the carriage's passenger.

Milady rises from the bed.\n      She wears a sky blue dressing       gown, something soft and\n      silken beneath it. D'Artagnan        reacts perceptibly.

Rochefort occupies a window seat, cleaning\n      d'Artagnan's sword. He lifts it to the light, and\n      slashes the air. He stands, duels with an imaginary\n      opponent.

They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains\n      his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady\n      speaks quietly, with seeming compassion:\n                                  MILADY\n                   You are sad.\n\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   I was thinking about my friends.\n      Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She\n      looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to\n      continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All\n      conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks\n      quietly, from the heart:\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              104.\n\n110   CONTINUED:                                                     110\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   The three best friends a man could\n                   have.

And Milady is well aware of it.\n      She looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose.\n                                 MILADY\n                   I understand. Men make bold plans\n                   in secret. And women wait... to\n                   mourn, or to celebrate the outcome.\n                   I know from experience, it's a\n                   lonely vigil.\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                          (after a beat)\n                   All I can tell you is...

I know, a dragon --\n      There is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than\n      a woman who does not take him seriously. D'Artagnan acts\n      accordingly, and reveals:\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               105.\n\n110   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             110\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   I came to Calais to stop a spy\n                   from sailing to England.\n                                 MILADY\n                          (alert; though\n                           d'Artagnan doesn't\n                           see it)\n                   A spy...?\n                                D'ARTAGNAN\n                   Yes.\n                                 MILADY\n                   I believe you...\n                          (beat)\n                   Aren't you afraid?\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   Musketeers are not afraid of\n                   anything.\n                                 MILADY\n                   I knew it.

You're not afraid\n                   of me?\n      Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the\n      look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him.\n      But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider.\n      And midnight as it approaches.\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   You're not dangerous.\n\n                                 MILADY\n                   Then what am I?\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               106.\n\n110   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              110\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   You're... beautiful.\n\n      Milady covers him with caresses. D'Artagnan resists\n      slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied.\n\n      Milady leans close, runs a fingertip along     the line of\n      his jaw. Her dressing gown falls open at      the top, enough\n      for d'Artagnan to see her breasts as they     press against\n      the silk beneath it. Milady speaks as her      finger traces.\n\n                                 MILADY\n                   Beauty, danger. They are the same.\n      And with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory\n      comb...\n\n\n111   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                  111\n      He cannot continue.      Constance, the hour, a confusion he\n      cannot deny.\n                                  D'ARTAGNAN\n                   I'm sorry --\n      D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down\n      toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a\n      dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in\n      the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking\n      the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out-\n      stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger,\n      stunned with fear and surprise:\n\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   What're you doing?!

Milady is the\n      messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to\n      the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her\n      negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh,\n      reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of\n      the fleur de lis. The infamous mark of the murderess.\n      Just as Athos told it to him.

Henri and Parker, the Indo-\n      Chinese bodyguard, appear. Parker faces d'Artagnan with\n      a half-smile. He holds out his hands, both empty. And\n      steps toward him. D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his\n      right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un-\n      fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps\n      forward to meet him.\n\n      Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A\n      series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows.\n      The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the\n      martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet,\n      dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions.\n      Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair,\n      and commands:\n                                MILADY\n                   Kill him.\n      Parker holds him fast.

Except to\n      suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping.\n      Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes\n      her mind.\n\n                                 MILADY\n                   We'll take him with us.\n                                 (MORE)\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                108.\n\n111   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            111\n                                 MILADY (CONT'D)\n                          (to d'Artagnan,\n                           with a nod at\n                           Parker)\n                   Parker will devise ways to\n                   convince you to share your final\n                   secret with me.

The\n      innkeeper shakes his   head. Armand grabs him by the\n      collar.\n\n      D'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience,\n      and just a hint of fear.

D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on\n      the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop\n      d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted\n      on a sword OUT OF FRAME.

Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts,\n      rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the\n      ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard.

But Athos\n      overtakes, leaps from his saddle, takes her into his arms.\n      They fall to the ground with a crash. Milady grabs the\n      deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle.\n      Athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his\n      side. Milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the half-\n      light. And lowers the dagger. She will not kill him.\n\n      Milady scrambles to her feet, runs toward a dark forest.\n      But Athos stands and shouts:\n                                ATHOS\n                   Stop!!\n      Milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him.\n      Athos holds his musket in a steady hand.

He tries to pull\n      the trigger, but it is not in him. Milady recognizes\n      his pain with a nod. She feels it, too. Then, briefly,\n      before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly.

There's a faint CRASH\n      as the marksman hits bottom. Utilizing the bell ropes\n      like a fireman's pole, d'Artagnan grabs hold and slides\n      down into the abyss.\n                                                 CUT TO:\n\n                                                           129.\n\n156   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                     156\n      Pandemonium reigns. Rochefort instructs his Guards to\n      close the huge door to the great hall. The members of\n      the King's royal court run in panicked circles, convinced\n      the palace is under seige. Constance pauses amid the\n      riot, seeks the Queen.\n\n      But Richelieu has found her first. He steps to Anne,\n      assumes an air of priestly innocence.\n                              RICHELIEU\n                Your Majesty...\n\n      But Louis steps INTO VIEW, puts a protecting arm around\n      his wife, speaks stern command:\n\n                              LOUIS\n                Leave us... alone.\n      That's when a loud BOOM rocks the room.\n\n\n157   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             157\n      The great door shudders under the impact of a terrific\n      blow. Another BOOM and the great hall is plunged into\n      further chaos. The regiment of Guards rush forward,\n      press their bodies against the door to secure it.\n      BOOM -- the great door threatens to split in half.\n      Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic.\n      His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis\n      and Anne across the room.\n\n                              RICHELIEU\n                       (a cold whisper)\n                Kill him. Kill her, too.\n\n      Rochefort draws d'Artagnan's sword from its sheath. He\n      advances on Louis and Anne. Louis has witnessed the\n      latter, treason confirmed. He raises his own sword,\n      prepared to protect his Queen. To die for her if\n      necessary.\n                              LOUIS\n                       (to Anne)\n                Get behind me.\n      Rochefort takes confident steps toward the King. But\n      one last BOOM and the great DOOR comes CRASHING down on\n      the Guards, revealing a tide of Musketeers on the other\n      side. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at the lead.\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          130.\n\n157   CONTINUED:                                                 157\n      Louis breaks into a wide grin. The Musketeers wade into\n      the Guards, and the great hall is transformed into a bat-\n      tlefield. Rochefort turns, sees Athos charging at him.\n                                 ATHOS\n                   Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops.   Are\n                   we interrupting?\n\n                                   ROCHEFORT\n                   Not for long.\n\n      Athos and Rochefort lock swords and duel.\n\n158   BATTLE                                                     158\n\n      Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack.\n      But the young King has no intention of being protected.\n      He wades to the fore, fights side by side with his\n      Musketeers. Anne watches him with a host of emotions.\n      Respect, admiration... love. Louis pauses to return her\n      gaze, then returns to battle.\n      Constance dashes through the fray. She sees a Guard\n      slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen. She grabs a\n      heavy goblet, shouts:\n                                   CONSTANCE\n                   Look out!\n      Anne looks up. Constance tosses the goblet to her. Anne\n      catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the\n      hapless Guard. Constance smiles, leaps forward.\n\n      Aramis cuts down a Guard. As another man comes at him\n      from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through.\n      The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks,\n      and continue.\n      Athos and Rochefort slash at each other. It is a mighty\n      confrontation. But Athos soon gains the upper hand.\n      Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help. Now it's\n      two on one. Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he\n      staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the\n      floor. Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the\n      treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. Athos shakes off\n      the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard. Rochefort and\n      Athos face each other a second time. Athos wounded,\n      Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer.\n\n      But Athos merely changes sword hands. Rochefort reacts.\n      Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together. Rochefort\n      grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. But\n      Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the\n      face with his fist.\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             131.\n\n158   CONTINUED:                                                    158\n      Rochefort goes sprawling. He loses his sword, it slides\n      across the floor until someone's foot stops it.\n      Rochefort looks up... and sees d'Artagnan standing on\n      the blade.\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   This sword belongs to me.\n\n      D'Artagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword. He\n      tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it\n      neatly. Athos watches from a short distance, knows\n      this moment belongs to d'Artagnan. He will not intervene.\n      But he shouts:\n                                  ARAMIS\n                   D'Artagnan.   Kill him where he\n                   stands.\n      These are d'Artagnan's words. A son vowing to avenge the\n      death of his father. D'Artagnan wonders. Rochefort\n      confirms.\n                                 ROCHEFORT\n                   By all means. Let's discover if\n                   you are as brave a man as your\n                   father was. And as foolish.\n                                  D'ARTAGNAN\n                          (stunned by the\n                            revelation as it\n                            unfolds)\n                   What...?\n                                 ROCHEFORT\n                   He died for his King and for\n                   France. But most of all... he\n                   died on the end of my sword.\n                          (the final curse)\n                   As will you.\n      Rochefort smiles a taunt.     D'Artagnan raises his sword,\n      whispers to heaven.\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   This is for you, Father.\n\n      Then, eyes blazing, d'Artagnan attacks Rochefort with\n      everything he's got, driving him into an adjoining\n      chamber.\n\n\n159   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHAMBER                                     159\n      A FIRE ROARS in a great stone hearth. Its light pro-\n      jects giant shadows on the wall as d'Artagnan and\n      Rochefort duel, slashing at each other.\n\n                                                             132.\n\n160   GREAT HALL                                                    160\n      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis take the fight to the\n      Cardinal's Guards. Each with his by-now familiar\n      tradmarks. King Louis fighting beside them.\n\n161   D'ARTAGNAN AND ROCHEFORT                                     161\n\n      They battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their\n      faces. Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan\n      has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto.\n      Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He\n      cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a\n      knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the\n      floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But\n      d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his\n      feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent.\n\n      Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall.\n      He pins him there, stunning the youth. And hisses with\n      superior disdain:\n                                 ROCHEFORT\n                   One thing's certain. You're no\n                   Musketeer.\n      But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice. \"Always find\n      your enemy's weakness.\" He shoves a thumb into\n      Rochefort's good eye. Rochefort stumbles backward.\n      D'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's\n      heart.\n                                 D'ARTAGNAN\n                   Take it back...?\n\n                                 ROCHEFORT\n                   I might... have been... mistaken.\n\n      Rochefort crumples to the floor, dead. D'Artagnan looks\n      at Rochefort's blood on his sword. His father's death\n      finally avenged. That's when he hears the RUSTLE of a\n      SILKEN ROBE. D'Artagnan pivots, sees Richelieu kneeling\n      at Rochefort's body... extracting the treaty from his\n      doublet.\n                                D'ARTAGNAN\n                   No!!\n\n      Richelieu smiles,   hurls the treaty into the blazing\n      fireplace. As the    flames begin to lick at the parchment\n      paper, d'Artagnan   flies past the Cardinal, and dives\n      after to retrieve   it.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               133.\n\n161   CONTINUED:                                                      161\n      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis enter the room. D'Artagnan\n      stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot,\n      clutching the treaty. He grins.

Truth\n                   despoiled by broken promises.\n                   Honor undermined by the pursuit\n                   of gold. Freedom sacrificed when\n                   the weak are oppressed by the\n                   strong. But there are those who\n                   oppose these powerful forces.\n                   Those who dedicate their lives to\n                   truth, honor, and freedom. They\n                   are a constant reminder to all of\n                   us. That such a life is not just\n                   possible, but necessary to our\n                   continued survival. As a country,\n                   as a King. These men are known as\n                   the Musketeers...\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               136.\n\n162   CONTINUED:    (3)                                            162\n      As Louis speaks, D'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless\n      images rush through his mind. His home in Gascony,\n      Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first\n      encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their\n      adventures together, the face of Milady. It's been a\n      busy week.\n\n                                 LOUIS\n                   Rise, d'Artagnan. And join them.\n                   Musketeer.\n\n      D'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. BELLS\n      RING in the distance. Constance smiles brightly, tears\n      gleam in her eyes. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround\n      their young friend, and happily present him with the\n      bright blue tunic of the Musketeers. They slip the tunic\n      over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer. D'Artagnan\n      hugs each of the three. For each has given him gifts\n      more valuable than gold.\n      Porthos, Aramis, and last... Athos.       Who, to the surprise\n      of all who know him... smiles.\n                                 PORTHOS\n                   Do my eyes deceive me?\n                                 ARAMIS\n                   I find it hard to believe myself.\n\n                                 PORTHOS\n                   His lips, unused as they are to\n                   such a contortion, twisted and\n                   stretched... into a smile.\n\n                                 ARAMIS\n                   It was spectacular.
