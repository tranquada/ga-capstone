Celtic harp. Scottish targe. Brooding statuary.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She moves deeper into the shadowed recesses, flicks on a lamp.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things. An open wooden case, empty.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Just the felt impression of a missing broadsword.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RACHEL\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(icy dread) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Connor...?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She crosses to the foot of the staircase.

Every so often, it's punctuated by a CHILD'S GIGGLE.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">AT THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rachel edges around the corner. Her breath catches in her throat.  BEFORE HER stands a locked wooden cabinet. It's been cleaved nearly in half by the BROADSWORD that still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel.  PHOTO ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have been shredded and scattered across the floor--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">--except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS, skewered onto the sword tip like a Medieval message spike. Rachel struggles to breathe. Like she's taken that sword in her own gut.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">INSIDE THE CABINET A TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME MOVIES.  A LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL) is entranced by a PORCELAIN MUSIC BOX held out by an AGELESS CONNOR MACLEOD.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">YOUNG RACHEL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Let me see, Connor!

In a train station. At her college graduation.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CONNOR and RACHEL in a laughing embrace that only hints at something deeper.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">In each new clip, Rachel has aged further. Connor has not.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rachel steps up to the broadsword, wraps both hands around the grip and jerks it clean of the cabinet.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE SKEWERED PHOTOGRAPHS (flutterd to the floor like dead leaves)\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE VIDEOTAPE ENDS, CLICKS OFF...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">and a NEW IMAGE burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity. Rachel. Staring back at herself, terror-stricken.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She hadn't even noticed it before now. The tiny CAMCORDER on the shelf above the TV with the glowing red light.  \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">MOVE IN ON THE TV as Rachel SLOWLY BACKS AWAY. Keep moving in on the TV until the PIXELS SWIM...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE PHONE RINGS shattering the stillness. The old rotary phone on the little Louis XIV stand. It's not just beckoning her.  It's taunting her.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone.  Any second now, you'd expect it to stop ringing, nobody home. But  whoever's on the other end knows better. It keeps right on RINGING. Insistant.  Trembling fingers reach out for the receiver. Slowly lift it off the hook.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RACHEL \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Hello?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">EXTREME CLOSE ON PHONE:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A TINY ELECTRIC CLICK is the last thing Rachel hears before--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT - ANTIQUE STORE - WIDE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">--a BLISTERING EXPLOSION blows out the entire second floor.

It takes a moment to realize they're LIVESTOCK-- oxen, pigs, goats, sheep-- piled like burning refuse.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A CRUDE, WOVEN-STRAW HUMAN EFFIGY stands astride the pile, engulfed in flame.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">BEYOND THE FIRE Connor MacLeod and his young wife, HEATHER, watch from the steps of their simple, isolated home. Connor betrays no emotion. Heather looks on in horror.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HEATHER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">My God, what are they?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CONNOR \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Farm animals.

They cut you off from your own people! What else could they want?!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Connor turns away from the flaming heap.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CONNOR \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Someone to blame.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"right\">CUT TO:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CONNOR swinging astride his horse.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HEATHER \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(dread)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't go back there.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THUNDER RUMBLES in the distance.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CONNOR \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I have no choice.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HEATHER\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Please--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CONNOR \n</p><p id=\"dia\">They can't hurt me.

I'm so sorry...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CAIOLIN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Tiny minds and sour dispositions. I don't need them, Connor. Any of them.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Connor crouches at her feet.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CONNOR \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Then it's settled. You're coming with me. There's somebody I want you to meet.

He's gross, corpulent and perpetually short of breath. A nasty NOSE BOIL figures prominently in his overall appearance.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">VILLAGERS of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FATHER RAINEY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">In the name of the Holy See and the rule of law, you are hereby charged, Connor MacLeod, with heresy and the practice of black magic. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(turns to the villagers) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Take him.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The townsmen jostle in place, each trying to squeeze backward behind the other.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FATHER RAINEY (cont'd) \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(squints)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Heresy is not contagious.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Two of the bolder men move forward, gripping Connor by the elbows.\nOnce its clear they haven't sucked up any demons, the others SWARM HIM.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT - STONE HUT - NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Caiolin SCREAMS as Connor's dragged outside and driven to the ground by a relentless battery of sticks and clubs.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"right\">CUT TO:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT - STONE CELL - NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Connor stirs awake in a centuries-old dungeon, a dark hole, crumbling and damp.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">VOICES seem to drip through the porous mortar. Taunting, vengeful, expectant.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow, ground-level view of THE TOWN COMMONS  where a well-attended EXECUTION is now underway.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Connor squints, craning to make out the identity of the condemned.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">TOWNSPEOPLE mingle and mill in front of him, obstructing his line-of-sight. \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Even as A FAMILIAR VOICE rises above the surrounding chatter.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JACOB KASE'S VOICE \n</p><p></p><p id=\"dia\">The curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next. The ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed, if in fact your blood is that of your son.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Several villagers STEP ASIDE to reveal:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CONNOR'S MOTHER bound to an UPRIGHT STAKE atop a mound of shorn timber. CONNOR siezes with the impossible horror of recognition.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CONNOR\n</p><p id=\"dia\">No.. . NO! !\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">JACOB KASE Makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of\nexecution. He stands atop a primeval CELTIC MONOLITH worn down to the form of a pedestal. Father Rainey wobbles behind him, sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic angina.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KASE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Through the infinite compassion of our Lord God, you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy, to declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end to the darkness that has been cast upon this land. How say you, Caiolin MacLeod?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Caiolin lifts her head, pale and beatific.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CAIOLIN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">If your god should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Shocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd.\nKase steps up and RIPS AWAY Caiolin's cherished silver CRUCIFIX, with its distinctive wooden Christ figure.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KASE \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(holding up Caiolin's crucifix) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You won't need this where you're going.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CONNOR grabs at the iron window-bars. Shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings. THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly approaches Caiolin. Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring. He tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">EXECUTIONER \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(softly)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Black powder. It will make short work of your suffering.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Caiolin nods.  He steps down off the pyre. Reaches for a BURNING TORCH. CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman. Mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY.  THE EXECUTIONER touches torch to kindling. It ALIGHTS.  CONNOR tries to squeeze through the window gap. Too tight. So he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury. Iron strikes unyielding stone, SPARKING and CHIPPING...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE PYRE BENEATH CAIOLIN ENGULFS IN FLAME. Heat ripples her face, distorts her body. CONNOR hammers harder, quicker, louder. Bits of stone fly everywhere. But the bulk of it remains spitefully intact. Still, it's enough to convince ALL FOUR GUARDS to intervene. They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes. &gt;Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next. Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam. Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The fourth guard drops his sword and BOLTS.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE PYRE is now fully ABLAZE. Caiolin looks out through the rippling wall of flame...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">. . . and smiles weakly.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CAIOLIN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">My water horse... \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">AS CONNOR splits the crowd like a battering ram. He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands. Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back, watching Connor desperately scatter the fire.  Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder, biting back the agony as... \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Sword in hand, Connor stretches upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs.  Freed of the ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward.  Connor grabs for her arm as THE BLACK POWDER EXPLODES in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further hope of rescue futile.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings.  He throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens.  Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">PANDEMONIUM breaks out. This isn't just a common witch. This is one of Hell's very own.  Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand.  The rest scatter in mindless PANIC. Father Rainey blocks Connor's path. Lifts his cross... \n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">. . . as he's CUT DOWN by the blind SLASH of Connor's sword. Connor steps over Rainey's body and keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings.  Kase crouches blustering over Rainey.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KASE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Father... Father, please--\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(tries to staunch the bleeding) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Father--!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rainey's eyes open slightly.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RAINEY \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who are you...?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KASE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Your son. It's your son-- Jacob.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Rainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted. And what he now sees terrifies him to death.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">RAINEY \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(eyes widen)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Who are YOU?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">KASE\n</p><p id=\"dia\">I'm your--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He stops. Rainey's eyes are frozen. Dead.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CONNOR returns to the flaming pyre, refueling his rage with the\nsight of his mother's blackened corpse. &gt;KASE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">scoops up a discarded sword, leaps to his feet and CHARGES CONNOR, bellowing like a madman.  &gt;Connor whirls around with his sword, making Kase IMPALE HIMSELF on  the blade. Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see.  Connor opens his fingers and lets him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest.  Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE.  In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO.  Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"right\">DISSOLVE TO:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT - ANCIENT STONE MONASTERY - NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Standing outside the massive door is a MONK clad in dark, hooded monastic garb.

THE LEADER, a tall eclectically-dressed Jamaican, dismounts and approaches the hooded monk.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JAMAICAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You people are extremely hard to find.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Monk unshoulders a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">HOODED MONK \n</p><p id=\"dia\">We like it that way. \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(pumps shotgun)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Now go.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The other six INTRUDERS surround the monk. His eyes flick from one to the next-- a buffet of different nationalities, all big.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">JAMAICAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Take your pick. Before you squeeze the trigger a second time, you'll be dead.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Easy choice. Monk levels his gun and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his feet.  And sure enough, he GAGS before his next trigger-pull. A very nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into a wooden hilt. Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a WIRY ASIAN, turns for the door, joined by the others.  IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE--\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The intruders are CUT DOWN where they stand. THREE MORE HOODED MONKS appear in the doorway, wielding ASSAULT RIFLES. They grimly regard the bodies.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MONK #1 \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Take the heads. Just in case.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Saws and cleavers are pulled by the other two guards while Guard #l keeps his gun trained on the corpses.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">VOICE \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don't bother. Really.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A FIGURE stands in shadow, his face UNSEEN. We catch\nonly a brief glimpse of a PRIEST\u0091S COLLAR. Guard #l whips his rifle toward the Stranger. Stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword. Bullets go nowhere. One slash and the guard is gone. Two more slashes and his comrades fall.  Stranger kicks the body of the dead Jamaican as he steps through the open doorway.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STRANGER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Don\u0091t be long.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT - MONASTERY - NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">FOLLOW THE STRANGER through a maze of chambers and DOWN into serpentine catacombs.  He KICKS THROUGH a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM cavernous and dripping, where even the air seems septic. A few dim candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs. Arms, legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood. From the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled fingernails, it's a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Except for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner, trembling silently.  Stranger stands at the threshold, his face obscured by flickering shadows. He scans the living corpses.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STRANGER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">So it's true.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He moves slowly among them.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STRANGER (cont'd) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">What sacrifices they made of you all. Warehoused, like rotting pieces of meat.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He pauses to lift up a downcast head. Gazes into the shackled face. The eyes are covered by strips of rusted\niron, the face by tangled beard.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STRANGER (cont'd) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Tell me-- is this the better way? I'm sure you've had some time to reflect on it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">One by one, THE RECENTLY-DEAD INTRUDERS filter into the room, led by the Jamaican. Blood stipples their clothes, streaks their faces. But they are, in every other sense, fully-restored.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Stranger straightens, swivels around to the terrified Custodian. Custodian backpeddles into the wall.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STRANGER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Which one is Connor MacLeod?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CUSTODIAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I-- I don't know...

I don't care about the Game. I don't care about the rules. I don't even care about these other pathetic souls you lock away as a barrier to the Prize.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Custodian stares back, uncomprehending.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STRANGER (cont'd) \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(squeezes his throat) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">I want Connor MacLeod. Give me MacLeod and I'll leave. And you can go right on pretending that what you do here actually matters.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The custodian lifts a shaking finger. RACK FOCUS TO:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE PRISONER IN THE LAST CHAIR Even with an iron slat across his eyes, he is unmistakably Connor MacLeod.  Stranger lets go of the custodian, turns...\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">STRANGER \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Long time.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Connor strains to lift his head.

He JOLTS from a series of SUDDEN VIOLENT IMAGES.  A FACE, bolted immobile, wrenched in agony.  A SWORDBLADE slashing into flesh. FINGERNAILS clawing wood.  BLOOD flecking tile.  ESSENCE.  PHONE.

MOVE SIDEWAYS TO REVEAL A SECOND CROUCHING FIGURE, this one human.  To many he'll be instantly familiar. He\u0091s METHOS, oldest of all  Immortals, gazing down in quiet contemplation.

Duncan steps inside. In the aftermath of the firebombing, nothing has been\nspared. Rachel and Connor's richly-cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape. One can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack. Duncan climbs the back stairs to THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse. Ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of Connor's home.\nPausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry, revealing\n<b>AN INNER DOOR\n</b>deliberately hidden from view.

We're looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeod's existance, stacked floor to ceiling.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Duncan moves among the mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask... a faded PHOTO of himself in a World War I uniform.\nHe pauses at a painting of Connor's wife HEATHER, radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling serenely across the ages.\nFinally, a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">TRANSITION TO:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT - FENCING ACADEMY, RAVENNA ITALY (1627) - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Duncan's LUNGE misses Connor by a mile. He stumbles upright in a grand hall streaked by SUNLIGHT from floor- to-ceiling windows.  Duncan and Connor face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times.  Several other elegant FENCING PAIRS spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier.  A little mustachioed PUFFER darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CONNOR\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You've improved greatly.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">You really think so?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Connor executes a simple combination that sends'Duncan's sword flying one way, his body the other.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CONNOR \n</p><p id=\"dia\">No. I'm just being gracious.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Duncan recovers, sets his feet. Puffer skitters over, brushes the dust off Duncan's coat, dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair. Duncan swats him away. They take en-garde position.

It's what drives other Immortals to kill us. And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than the rest.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his feet. \n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CONNOR (cont'd) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Survival. Learn it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Duncan goes on the attack. What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination. Almost. Connor sidesteps Duncan's next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan's ass and sends him plowing face-first into the floor. Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance. Puffer races up behind Duncan again, meticulously dusts his backside. Reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(whirls around)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">You mind?!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Connor clucks his tongue.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">CONNOR (cont'd)\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Allow me.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He squares Duncan\u0091s shoulders and steps back.

She saunters toward him, glancing around.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">She takes her time checking out the place before stepping up to Duncan.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The ragged crop of her hair and the slashing trowel application of makeup impart a kind of crazed anti- beauty.

He's strapped to the\nsame Giger-like chair, immobilized. Standing around him\nare hooded members of that same monk-like order in what is, essentially, a dungeon.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">One of them, MATTHEW, steps forward. His steel-gray eyes are familiar. He's the one who followed Duncan through customs.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a thick metal dowel, he reveals a distinctive TATTOO across his inner forearm. One that Duncan instantly recognizes. _\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Watchers?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Matthew simply nods.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">DUNCAN\n</p><p id=\"dia\">Watchers observe. They don't interfere.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MATTHEW \n</p><p id=\"dia\">True. And we were more than happy to perform our traditional function. Believe me, it's a whole lot easier charting the history of Immortals than it is running a day care center for them.

He uses holy ground as a safe haven. And every head taken in battle is reserved for him alone, each Quickening-- hundreds upon hundreds-- taken by just one man. Yes, Duncan. He is unbeatable.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Matthew pours a Scotch. Glenmorangie. Holds it to\nDuncan's lips like the final offering to a condemned man.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MATTHEW (cont'd) \n</p><p id=\"dia\">Worse still, far worse, is that he's become a perversion to the Game.
