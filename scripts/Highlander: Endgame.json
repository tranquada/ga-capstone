It's RACHEL ELLENSTEIN, early 60's now, a graying, maternal beauty.\nShe moves to the front door, reaches out to unlock i.t.\nIt falls open at her touch. Even though the hanging placard is still flipped to \"WE\u0092RE CLOSED\"\nRachel hesitates. Draws a shallow breath and steps\ninside.\nINT - ANTIQUE STORE\nAll those sublime European antiquities now drip with menace. Celtic harp. Scottish targe. Brooding statuary.\nShe moves deeper into the shadowed recesses, flicks on a lamp.\nHer gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things. An open wooden case, empty.\nJust the felt impression of a missing broadsword.\nRACHEL\n(icy dread) \nConnor...?\nShe crosses to the foot of the staircase. Listens.\nA MUSIC BOX\nspools a faint, tinny madrigal.\nShe climbs the stairs, padding softly upward.\nThe music grinds EVER LOUDER in its maddening repetitions. Every so often, it's punctuated by a CHILD'S GIGGLE.\nAT THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING\nRachel edges around the corner. Her breath catches in her throat.  BEFORE HER stands a locked wooden cabinet. It's been cleaved nearly in half by the BROADSWORD that still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel.  PHOTO ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have been shredded and scattered across the floor--\n--except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS, skewered onto the sword tip like a Medieval message spike. Rachel struggles to breathe. Like she's taken that sword in her own gut.\nINSIDE THE CABINET A TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME MOVIES.  A LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL) is entranced by a PORCELAIN MUSIC BOX held out by an AGELESS CONNOR MACLEOD.\nYOUNG RACHEL \nLet me see, Connor! Let me see!\nRachel stands frozen, watching her life with Connor flash by in RAGGED FILM CLIPS.\nCONNOR teaching RACHEL to ride a horse.\nCONNOR with RACHEL outside an English boarding school. In a train station. At her college graduation.\nCONNOR and RACHEL in a laughing embrace that only hints at something deeper.\nIn each new clip, Rachel has aged further. Connor has not.\nRachel steps up to the broadsword, wraps both hands around the grip and jerks it clean of the cabinet.\nTHE SKEWERED PHOTOGRAPHS (flutterd to the floor like dead leaves)\nTHE VIDEOTAPE ENDS, CLICKS OFF...\nand a NEW IMAGE burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity. Rachel. Staring back at herself, terror-stricken.\nShe hadn't even noticed it before now. The tiny CAMCORDER on the shelf above the TV with the glowing red light.  \nMOVE IN ON THE TV as Rachel SLOWLY BACKS AWAY. Keep moving in on the TV until the PIXELS SWIM...\nTHE PHONE RINGS shattering the stillness. The old rotary phone on the little Louis XIV stand. It's not just beckoning her.  It's taunting her.\nGathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone.  Any second now, you'd expect it to stop ringing, nobody home. But  whoever's on the other end knows better. It keeps right on RINGING. Insistant.  Trembling fingers reach out for the receiver. Slowly lift it off the hook.\nRACHEL \nHello?\nEXTREME CLOSE ON PHONE:\nA TINY ELECTRIC CLICK is the last thing Rachel hears before--\nEXT - ANTIQUE STORE - WIDE\n--a BLISTERING EXPLOSION blows out the entire second floor.  Rachel Ellenstein is obliterated right along with her own treasured history.  Linger on the FLAMES as we\nTRANSITION TO:\nEXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS (1565) - DAY\nA MOUND OF BURNING CORPSES\nThey crackle and twist in the fire that feeds off them. It takes a moment to realize they're LIVESTOCK-- oxen, pigs, goats, sheep-- piled like burning refuse.\nA CRUDE, WOVEN-STRAW HUMAN EFFIGY stands astride the pile, engulfed in flame.\nBEYOND THE FIRE Connor MacLeod and his young wife, HEATHER, watch from the steps of their simple, isolated home. Connor betrays no emotion. Heather looks on in horror.\nHEATHER \nMy God, what are they?\nCONNOR \nFarm animals. Dead of the plague.\nHEATHER \nWhy do they torment us with their dead cattle? \n(no response) \nConnor...?\nCONNOR \nThey think I've brought this upon them. It's a warning.\nA deeper fear now grips Heather.\nHEATHER \nA warning?! They drove you from your home! They cut you off from your own people! What else could they want?!\nConnor turns away from the flaming heap.\nCONNOR \nSomeone to blame.\nCUT TO:\nCONNOR swinging astride his horse.\nHEATHER \n(dread)\nDon't go back there.\nTHUNDER RUMBLES in the distance.\nCONNOR \nI have no choice.\nHEATHER\nPlease--\nCONNOR \nThey can't hurt me. And they know it. But they can still hurt the ones I care about.\nHeather looks off. Shivers.\nHEATHER \nI'm afraid.\nConnor leans forward, takes her face in his hands.\nCONNOR \nI love you, Heather. More than anything in this world.\nShe grips his hands. Desperately.\nCONNOR (cont'd)\nDo you believe me?\nHEATHER\nYes.\nCONNOR \nThen you needn't be afraid. \n(kisses her)\nNothing can ever keep us apart.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nEXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, VARIOUS - DAWN\nConnor travels a primeval landscape of jagged peaks and fog-shrouded valleys.\nCONNOR'S VOICE \nNothing...\nCUT TO:\nEXT - RIDGE ABOVE GLENFINNAN - TWILIGHT\nHe gazes down at the tiny hamlet of Glenfinnan, nestled between castle and shimmering loch. Breathes deep the forgotten smell of home.\nINT - HUT - EVENING\nCAIOLIN MACLEOD, ravaged by neglect and despair, strokes her son's face as if confirming his reality.\nCAIOLIN \nI thought you might be the water horse come to take me on his back and drown me in the loch.\nCONNOR \n(smiles)\nMaybe I am, Mother.\nCAIOLIN \n(touches his hair) \nThen come, let me grab hold of your golden mane and off we go.\nConnor lifts her from the tattered bed, spins her around several giddy times and sits her upright in a chair.\nCONNOR \nNot before we put some meat on those bones.\nHe rummages through her shelves looking for food. Finds\npainfully little.\nCONNOR (cont'd)\nNo one comes to look after you?\nCAIOLIN\nThey're all afraid of me. They think I bedevil their children because I've lost my own.\nCONNOR \nI'm sorry. I'm so sorry...\nCAIOLIN \nTiny minds and sour dispositions. I don't need them, Connor. Any of them.\nConnor crouches at her feet.\nCONNOR \nThen it's settled. You're coming with me. There's somebody I want you to meet. She's nearly as beautiful as you.\nCaiolin blinks back her disbelief.\nCAIOLIN \nYou're sure?\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nWe leave tonight. Let's start packing.\nCAIOLIN \n(lifts up her shoes)\nI'm already packed.\nTHE SLATTED WOODEN DOOR\nswings OPEN. A YOUNG MAN stands in the doorway. He's strong and severe, dressed in clergyman's black. But\nthat's not what draws the eye.\nEven though it's cold enough to fog his breath-- he's sweatinq.\nConnor looks up, guarded.\nCONNOR \nJacob--\nKASE\nYou shouldna come back, Connor.\nConnor feels the tension in Kase's voice.\nCONNOR \nSurely as a friend you can look the other way just this once... For old times' sake...\nKASE \nYou knew. You knew what would happen if you came back. I am not to blame for this.\nCONNOR \nWhat? \n(beat) \nWhat have you done?\nKASE\nGod help you.\nFATHER ALASDAIR RAINEY, the local priest and inquisitor, steps inside, bent over a silver cane. He's gross, corpulent and perpetually short of breath. A nasty NOSE BOIL figures prominently in his overall appearance.\nVILLAGERS of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them.\nFATHER RAINEY \nIn the name of the Holy See and the rule of law, you are hereby charged, Connor MacLeod, with heresy and the practice of black magic. \n(turns to the villagers) \nTake him.\nThe townsmen jostle in place, each trying to squeeze backward behind the other.\nFATHER RAINEY (cont'd) \n(squints)\nHeresy is not contagious.\nTwo of the bolder men move forward, gripping Connor by the elbows.\nOnce its clear they haven't sucked up any demons, the others SWARM HIM.\nEXT - STONE HUT - NIGHT\nCaiolin SCREAMS as Connor's dragged outside and driven to the ground by a relentless battery of sticks and clubs.\nCUT TO:\nINT - STONE CELL - NIGHT\nConnor stirs awake in a centuries-old dungeon, a dark hole, crumbling and damp.\nVOICES seem to drip through the porous mortar. Taunting, vengeful, expectant.\nHe crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow, ground-level view of THE TOWN COMMONS  where a well-attended EXECUTION is now underway.\nConnor squints, craning to make out the identity of the condemned.\nTOWNSPEOPLE mingle and mill in front of him, obstructing his line-of-sight. \nEven as A FAMILIAR VOICE rises above the surrounding chatter.\nJACOB KASE'S VOICE \nThe curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark onto the next. The ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed, if in fact your blood is that of your son.\nSeveral villagers STEP ASIDE to reveal:\nCONNOR'S MOTHER bound to an UPRIGHT STAKE atop a mound of shorn timber. CONNOR siezes with the impossible horror of recognition.\nCONNOR\nNo.. . NO! !\nJACOB KASE Makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of\nexecution. He stands atop a primeval CELTIC MONOLITH worn down to the form of a pedestal. Father Rainey wobbles behind him, sniffing ammonia to spell his chronic angina.\nKASE \nThrough the infinite compassion of our Lord God, you are entitled one final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy, to declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end to the darkness that has been cast upon this land. How say you, Caiolin MacLeod?\nCaiolin lifts her head, pale and beatific.\nCAIOLIN \nIf your god should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another.\nShocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd.\nKase steps up and RIPS AWAY Caiolin's cherished silver CRUCIFIX, with its distinctive wooden Christ figure.\nKASE \n(holding up Caiolin's crucifix) \nYou won't need this where you're going.\nCONNOR grabs at the iron window-bars. Shakes them until the mortar chips from their moorings. THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly approaches Caiolin. Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd, he takes out a small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring. He tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her chest.\nEXECUTIONER \n(softly)\nBlack powder. It will make short work of your suffering.\nCaiolin nods.  He steps down off the pyre. Reaches for a BURNING TORCH. CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman. Mortar continues crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY.  THE EXECUTIONER touches torch to kindling. It ALIGHTS.  CONNOR tries to squeeze through the window gap. Too tight. So he winds back with the iron bar and swings with mindless fury. Iron strikes unyielding stone, SPARKING and CHIPPING...\nTHE PYRE BENEATH CAIOLIN ENGULFS IN FLAME. Heat ripples her face, distorts her body. CONNOR hammers harder, quicker, louder. Bits of stone fly everywhere. But the bulk of it remains spitefully intact. Still, it's enough to convince ALL FOUR GUARDS to intervene. They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes. >Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next. Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam. Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack.\nThe fourth guard drops his sword and BOLTS.\nTHE PYRE is now fully ABLAZE. Caiolin looks out through the rippling wall of flame...\n. . . and smiles weakly.\nCAIOLIN \nMy water horse... \nAS CONNOR splits the crowd like a battering ram. He reaches the pyre, hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands. Initially stunned, the townsfolk shrink back, watching Connor desperately scatter the fire.  Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder, biting back the agony as... \nSword in hand, Connor stretches upward, hacking away the ropes that bind her, oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils around his own arms and legs.  Freed of the ropes, Caiolin begins to slump forward.  Connor grabs for her arm as THE BLACK POWDER EXPLODES in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further hope of rescue futile.\nConnor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings.  He throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens.  Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd.\nPANDEMONIUM breaks out. This isn't just a common witch. This is one of Hell's very own.  Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down where they stand.  The rest scatter in mindless PANIC. Father Rainey blocks Connor's path. Lifts his cross... \n. . . as he's CUT DOWN by the blind SLASH of Connor's sword. Connor steps over Rainey's body and keeps coming, driving the mob fleeing into their dwellings.  Kase crouches blustering over Rainey.\nKASE\nFather... Father, please--\n(tries to staunch the bleeding) \nFather--!\nRainey's eyes open slightly.\nRAINEY \nWho are you...?\nKASE \nYour son. It's your son-- Jacob.\nRainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted. And what he now sees terrifies him to death.\nRAINEY \n(eyes widen)\nWho are YOU?\nKASE\nI'm your--\nHe stops. Rainey's eyes are frozen. Dead.\nCONNOR returns to the flaming pyre, refueling his rage with the\nsight of his mother's blackened corpse. >KASE\nscoops up a discarded sword, leaps to his feet and CHARGES CONNOR, bellowing like a madman.  >Connor whirls around with his sword, making Kase IMPALE HIMSELF on  the blade. Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see.  Connor opens his fingers and lets him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest.  Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE.  In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO.  Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nEXT - ANCIENT STONE MONASTERY - NIGHT\nStanding outside the massive door is a MONK clad in dark, hooded monastic garb. Nothing in the panorama would suggest we've just jumped four  centuries into an uncertain future...  Until--\nA PACK OF MOTORCYCLISTS  chew their way up the rubbled slope. Fishtail to a stop. THE LEADER, a tall eclectically-dressed Jamaican, dismounts and approaches the hooded monk.\nJAMAICAN \nYou people are extremely hard to find.\nMonk unshoulders a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN.\nHOODED MONK \nWe like it that way. \n(pumps shotgun)\nNow go.\nThe other six INTRUDERS surround the monk. His eyes flick from one to the next-- a buffet of different nationalities, all big.\nJAMAICAN \nTake your pick. Before you squeeze the trigger a second time, you'll be dead.\nEasy choice. Monk levels his gun and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his feet.  And sure enough, he GAGS before his next trigger-pull. A very nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into a wooden hilt. Monk drops in a heap as his assailant, a WIRY ASIAN, turns for the door, joined by the others.  IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE--\nThe intruders are CUT DOWN where they stand. THREE MORE HOODED MONKS appear in the doorway, wielding ASSAULT RIFLES. They grimly regard the bodies.\nMONK #1 \nTake the heads. Just in case.\nSaws and cleavers are pulled by the other two guards while Guard #l keeps his gun trained on the corpses.\nVOICE \nDon't bother. Really.\nA FIGURE stands in shadow, his face UNSEEN. We catch\nonly a brief glimpse of a PRIEST\u0091S COLLAR. Guard #l whips his rifle toward the Stranger. Stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword. Bullets go nowhere. One slash and the guard is gone. Two more slashes and his comrades fall.  Stranger kicks the body of the dead Jamaican as he steps through the open doorway.\nSTRANGER \nDon\u0091t be long.\nINT - MONASTERY - NIGHT\nFOLLOW THE STRANGER through a maze of chambers and DOWN into serpentine catacombs.  He KICKS THROUGH a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM cavernous and dripping, where even the air seems septic. A few dim candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to complicated, almost Giger-esque chairs. Arms, legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood. From the wild overgrowth of hair and beard, and the impossibly long, curled fingernails, it's a good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years.\nExcept for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner, trembling silently.  Stranger stands at the threshold, his face obscured by flickering shadows. He scans the living corpses.\nSTRANGER \nSo it's true.\nHe moves slowly among them.\nSTRANGER (cont'd) \nWhat sacrifices they made of you all. Warehoused, like rotting pieces of meat.\nHe pauses to lift up a downcast head. Gazes into the shackled face. The eyes are covered by strips of rusted\niron, the face by tangled beard.\nSTRANGER (cont'd) \nTell me-- is this the better way? I'm sure you've had some time to reflect on it.\nOne by one, THE RECENTLY-DEAD INTRUDERS filter into the room, led by the Jamaican. Blood stipples their clothes, streaks their faces. But they are, in every other sense, fully-restored.\nStranger straightens, swivels around to the terrified Custodian. Custodian backpeddles into the wall.\nSTRANGER \nWhich one is Connor MacLeod?\nCUSTODIAN \nI-- I don't know... They never told me names...\nSTRANGER\n(low, seething) \nDon't. Lie. To. Me.\nCUSTODIAN \nI swear. I don't know...\nStranger grabs him under the chin, lifts him to his toes.\nSTRANGER \nYou need to understand one thing, my gimpy friend. I don't care about the Game. I don't care about the rules. I don't even care about these other pathetic souls you lock away as a barrier to the Prize.\nThe Custodian stares back, uncomprehending.\nSTRANGER (cont'd) \n(squeezes his throat) \nI want Connor MacLeod. Give me MacLeod and I'll leave. And you can go right on pretending that what you do here actually matters.\nThe custodian lifts a shaking finger. RACK FOCUS TO:\nTHE PRISONER IN THE LAST CHAIR Even with an iron slat across his eyes, he is unmistakably Connor MacLeod.  Stranger lets go of the custodian, turns...\nSTRANGER \nLong time.\nConnor strains to lift his head. His voice comes weak and drug-heavy.\nCONNOR \nWho are you...?\nSTRANGER \nYou'll know soon enough.\nGLINT OF A SWUNG BLADE--\nCUT TO:\nEXT - MONASTERY - NIGHT\nAn unearthly LIGHT pulses through slitted windows and cracked mortar.  TENDRILS of RAW ENERGY vein the ancient building, growing BRIGHTER until--\nTHE WINDOWS EXPLODE OUTWARD with a keening, animal-like HOWL.  ABOVE the sky responds with SCREAMING WIND and TORRENTS of RAIN.\nCUT TO:\nEXT - PARIS - NIGHT\nWIND HOWLS over the City of Lights, slicing up the Seine to. . .\nDUNCAN MACLEOD'S BARGE\ndocked at the quay.\nEXT - BARGE - NIGHT\nPUSH IN on DUNCAN MACLEOD, cross-legged in meditation atop the deck. He JOLTS from a series of SUDDEN VIOLENT IMAGES.  A FACE, bolted immobile, wrenched in agony.  A SWORDBLADE slashing into flesh. FINGERNAILS clawing wood.  BLOOD flecking tile.  ESSENCE.  PHONE.  Ringing. Duncan snaps up the receiver, sweat drenched.\nDUNCAN \nYeah?\nTiny electric CLICK...\n. . . then the HISS of an overseas line.\nWOMAN'S VOICE \n(filtered) \nHe's dead.\nDUNCAN\nWho? \nCUT TO:\nA PAYPHONE, SOMEWHERE IN LOWER MANHATTAN\nIn a driving RAIN. A woman's hand holds the receiver to her face, obscuring her features.\nWOMAN \nConnor MacLeod. He was killed last night.\nINT - DUNCAN'S BARGE\nDuncan reels with a sudden flood of emotions.\nDUNCAN \nWho is this?!\nWOMAN'S VOICE \nA friend.\nEXT - PAYPHONE\nThe unidentified woman slowly lowers the receiver and sets it back in the cradle. \nCUT TO:\nEXT - PARIS, ESTABLISHING, SUNRISE\nShadows crawl across the Parisian skyline as an ENGINE REVS TO 8000 RPM.\nSTREET LEVEL POV:\nWe PUNCH through the ARC DE TRIOMPHE and up the CHAMPS ELYSEE with a throaty FERARRI HOWL.  On a WICKED DOWNSHIFT, we SQUEAL HARD RIGHT onto the PONT NEUF, stopping on a franc at \nEXT - NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY\nDuncan hops out of his Ferrari 355 Spyder, pauses before the massive Gothic edifice, then disappears inside.\nCLOSE ON A CROUCHING STONE GARGOYLE\nperched atop the highest balustrade. MOVE SIDEWAYS TO REVEAL A SECOND CROUCHING FIGURE, this one human.  To many he'll be instantly familiar. He\u0091s METHOS, oldest of all  Immortals, gazing down in quiet contemplation.  Methos keeps staring at the ground below, sipping bordeaux from a paper cup, even as Duncan joins him at the edge. \nDUNCAN \nMethos.\nMETHOS \nso-- What brings you up here to the aerie of the lesser gods?\nDUNCAN \nI need your help.\nMETHOS \nI'm out of the help business. No future in it.\nDUNCAN\nI was told Connor MacLeod was killed last night.\nMethos' darkens. Another one lost.\nDUNCAN (cont'd)\nI just want to know who did it.\nMETHOS\n(sighs) \nIn our world, does it really matter?\nDUNCAN \nIt does to me.\nMethos looks down at the clotted life below.\nMETHOS\nDid I ever tell you I once kept a vineyard on the very spot where they built this monstrosity? Glorious, the wine.\n(looks up) \nWhen did you see him last?\nDUNCAN\nAlmost ten years ago.\nMETHOS\nWhat did you talk about?\nDUNCAN \nNothing much.\nMETHOS \nThink back.\nFLASH TO:\nINT - PUB (FROM HIGHLANDER 1) - DAY\nConnor and Duncan hunch over the bar, pounding scotch.\nDUNCAN \nWe mostly just sat around, downing shots, staring at the beer lights above the bar. When he finally got up to go, he looked at me like it was the last time I'd ever see him again. No goodbye. No handshake. Just got up and left. \nBACK TO SCENE:\nDuncan blinks back the memory.\nDUNCAN (cont'd)\nNobody's seen him since.\nMETHOS \nDescribe the look.\nDUNCAN \nWhat do you mean?\nMETHOS \nDescribe it.\nDUNCAN \nIt was like...\nFLASH: CONNOR'S FACE\nDUNCAN (cont'd) \n. . . Like every death he'd ever caused had come back to haunt him.\nBACK TO SCENE:\nMethos takes a thoughtful sip from his wine.\nMETHOS\nFor an Immortal who comes to abhor bloodshed, there's a solution-- a way to be removed from the Game forever. The price is unimaginably high, but you are, for all practical purposes, protected from the violence within yourself. It's called The Sanctuary.\nDUNCAN \nI don't understand.\nMETHOS \nThink of those Buddhist monks who came to cherish life so much that to step on a single insect, to harm a blade of grass was a violation of their creed. They placed themselves into an extreme form of protective custody. A sanctuary of sorts. \n(beat) \nWhat I'm talking about is something similar. But one that doesn't allow for a change of heart.\nHe opens his fingers and watches his cup plummet to the plaza below. Wine SPLATTERS like blood on white marble.\nMETHOS (cont'd) \nApparently it was wiped out last night.\nDUNCAN \nBy who?\nMETHOS \nI don't know.\nEXT - ABOVE THE ATLANTIC - DAY\nA 747 cruises at 40,000 feet.\nMETHOS (O.S.) \nHe left no witnesses.\nINT - 747 - DAY\nDuncan stares out the passenger window as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT sets a DRINK down.  He lifts the little plastic COCKTAIL SWORD from the glass. Yanks it out of the olive...\nTRANSITION TO:\nA BROADSWORD being jerked from a fallen warrior. \nEXT - 17TH CENTURY BATTLEFIELD - DAWN\nFOLLOW THE SWORD swinging above a PAIR OF HIDE-BOOTED FEET that tramp across uneven ground littered with CORPSES. FEET STOP at a BLOOD-CAKED BODY, swathed in the shredded colors of a defeated army. On a SWIFT KICK TO THE RIBCAGE--\nDUNCAN MACLEOD JERKS UPRIGHT, flailing in spastic fits.\nDUNCAN \nGAHHHHHHH! !\nHe blinks thickly, as if routed from a deep, disorienting slumber. Gapes up at--\nA SILHOUETTE\nthat ECLIPSES the rising sun.\nSILHOUETTE \nYou've better things to do than lie there collecting flies.\nDuncan puts a hand to his chest, touches the worst of his several lethal wounds. Utter confusion stitches his face.\nSILHOUETTE (cont'd) \nI suppose you're wondering how a knock- kneed swordsman with your obvious lack of skill keeps living to fight another day.\nThe figure extends a hand to Duncan. Duncan hesitantly reaches up...\nDUNCAN \n(squints)\nAre you an angel?\nSILHOUETTE \nI've been called that. And worse.\nDuncan\u0091s hand RECOILS--\nSILHOUETTE (cont'd) \nRest assured, I'm neither.\nHe hoists Duncan to his feet. Duncan gazes for the first time ever upon the face of\nCONNOR MACLEOD\nwho smiles back with the gift of untold secrets.\nCONNOR \nI'm Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. And like you, I have a hard time dying.\nTRANSITION BACK TO:\nINT - 747 - DAY\nDuncan's now sitting upright in his seat as the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S VOICE brings him back to the here and now.\nFLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.) \nWe'll be making our final descent into New York...\nWHEELS\nSMACK down onto the runway at JFK.\nCUT TO:\nA PHOTOGRAPH OF DUNCAN\nPULL BACK and see it's his passport, held by a US CUSTOMS OFFICER. He lowers the passport and turns to the long metal case Duncan's brought with him from the plane.\nCUSTOMS OFFICER \nWould you open the case, please?\nDuncan hands the Officer documentation as he sets it on the counter and opens it. Inside is an old, meticulously\ncared-for Japanese KATANA SWORD.  Customs Officer studies Duncan's paperwork, smiles.\nCUSTOMS OFFICER (cont'd) \nGet much use for this?\nDUNCAN \nYou'd be surprised.\nDuncan shuts the case and continues on.  Next MAN in line watches Duncan exit as he hands over his passport. Hang on the PHOTO. We'll remember those steel- gray eyes.\nINT - CAB, DRIVING - DAY\nDuncan watches the passing scenery. MUSIC and LANDMARKS\nfamiliar from the first \"Highlander\" sweep past.\nEXT - NEW YORK SIDE-STREET - DAY\nCab WIPES FRAME, leaving Duncan standing before the charred husk of Connor's antique store. Windows boarded, shreds of flapping police tape, the investigators have long since come and gone.\nINT - ANTIQUE STORE\nDoor SPLINTERS OPEN. Duncan steps inside. In the aftermath of the firebombing, nothing has been\nspared. Rachel and Connor's richly-cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape. One can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack. Duncan climbs the back stairs to THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse. Ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of Connor's home.\nPausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry, revealing\nAN INNER DOOR\ndeliberately hidden from view. He dips down, retrieves a key from under a loose floorboard and opens the heavily- reinforced door.\nENTERING he finds himself in a LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM surrounded by a staggering display of ARTIFACTS drawn from centuries of personal history. We're looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeod's existance, stacked floor to ceiling.\nDuncan moves among the mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask... a faded PHOTO of himself in a World War I uniform.\nHe pauses at a painting of Connor's wife HEATHER, radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling serenely across the ages.\nFinally, a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity.\nTRANSITION TO:\nINT - FENCING ACADEMY, RAVENNA ITALY (1627) - DAY\nDuncan's LUNGE misses Connor by a mile. He stumbles upright in a grand hall streaked by SUNLIGHT from floor- to-ceiling windows.  Duncan and Connor face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times.  Several other elegant FENCING PAIRS spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier.  A little mustachioed PUFFER darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries.\nCONNOR\nYou've improved greatly.\nDUNCAN \nYou really think so?\nConnor executes a simple combination that sends'Duncan's sword flying one way, his body the other.\nCONNOR \nNo. I'm just being gracious.\nDuncan recovers, sets his feet. Puffer skitters over, brushes the dust off Duncan's coat, dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair. Duncan swats him away. They take en-garde position. Connor points his blade. CONNOR (cont'd)\nRemember, you're only immortal as long as your head remains attached to those shoulders.\nDuncan lunges again. Misses and hits the deck.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nWhich in your case might not be long at all.\nHe puts his blade to Duncan's neck. Humor evaporates.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nWhat we give up to our adversary in defeat, Duncan... is evervthinq.\nDuncan stares up at him, uncomprehending.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nWe call it \"The Quickening\"-- our strength, our knowledge, our life essence-- it all flows into the victor, feeds him, makes him stronger, in ways you can't possibly comprehend. It's what drives other Immortals to kill us. And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than the rest.\nHe takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his feet. \nCONNOR (cont'd) \nSurvival. Learn it.\nDuncan goes on the attack. What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination. Almost. Connor sidesteps Duncan's next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan's ass and sends him plowing face-first into the floor. Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance. Puffer races up behind Duncan again, meticulously dusts his backside. Reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger.\nDUNCAN \n(whirls around)\nYou mind?!\nConnor clucks his tongue.\nCONNOR (cont'd)\nAllow me.\nHe squares Duncan\u0091s shoulders and steps back. Considers.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nUnh uh.\nHe steps up and swivels Duncan around until he\u0091s facing the opposite way.\nCONNOR (cont'd)\nIf you should ever again find yourself backside to a blade... just keep this in mind.\nHe proceeds to take Duncan through a move that's dazzling in it's inherent simplicity-- a move that winds up with Duncan's blade whisking perilously close across Connor's throat.\nCONNOR (cont'd)\nIt's a coup de fin.\nHe catches Duncan's sword-fist in his own, holds it immobile.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nProperly executed, even you cannot prevent your blade from finding its mark.\nDUNCAN \nProperly executed, we'll never have this talk again.\nDuncan and Connor's eyes lock. They break.\nTRANSITION BACK TO:\nINT - CIRCULAR ROOM\nDuncan suddenly SIEZES UP with a strange disquiet and ringing in the ears known as THE BUZZ. It's the sense of another Immortal.\nHe swings around, reaches for his katana and steps back through the door, swinging it closed as\nA YOUNG WOMAN\nappears at the top of the stairs. She saunters toward him, glancing around.\nShe takes her time checking out the place before stepping up to Duncan.\nThe ragged crop of her hair and the slashing trowel application of makeup impart a kind of crazed anti- beauty. Like a post-nuclear Barbi doll.\nDuncan regards her, intrigued and wary.\nDUNCAN \nWho are you?\nYOUNG WOMAN \nA friend.\nThose two words instantly recall the mystery voice on the\nphone.\nYOUNG WOMAN (cont'd) \nOr lover. Or wife. Take your pick.\nMemory jogs with a sudden lurch.\nDUNCAN \nKate?\nYOUNG WOMAN\nAtta boy. 'cept I'm \"Faith\" now. Part of the makeover. Like it?\nShe runs a playful finger across his chest.\nFAITH\nFunny how 'the time slips by, huh? You wake up one day and ohmigod-- Airplanes!\nDUNCAN \nWhy're you here?\nFAITH \nRemember our wedding day, Duncan? I do.\nShe takes him by the hands and leads him into an\nimpromptu dance.\nFAITH (cont'd) \nWe danced the \"Highland Fling.\"\nShe spins under his arm, circles back into his embrace.\nFAITH (cont'd) \nI felt like we were flying.\nHer sinuous body moves in perfect sync with his.\nFAITH (cont'd) \nAnd that we'd never come down.\nShe spins out of his arms again--\n--and SPIN KICKS him across the FACE. BLOOD spatters from his nose and mouth.\nFAITH (cont'd) \nOf course, we did come down. Didn't we? \n(kicks him again)\nCrashinq.\nDuncan staggers backward into a concrete stanchion. Recovers.\nThey stand facing each other across a gulf centuries wide.\nDUNCAN\n(spitting blood)\nWhy are you here?\nFAITH \nIsn't it obvious? I wanted to see you again.\nDuncan tenses at--\nTHE ROAR OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES.\nHis eyes track the SOUND. It's directly BELOW him.\nEXT - STREET OUTSIDE ANTIQUE STORE\nTHREE MOTORCYCLES hop the curb, SLICE through the open door to the antique store...\nINT - ANTIQUE STORE\n. . . and SPIRAL up the BACK STAIRS.\nINT - LOFT\nDuncan's eyes flick upward to a NEW SOUND, directly above him as--\nEXT - ROOF - DAY\nA FOURTH BIKE\nVAULTS the NARROW GAP between buildings and LANDS.\nKnobby tires SLAM onto the rooftop, squirrelling wild across the tarred surface before shuddering to a stop.\nA jackbooted heel digs in and grinds to a stop.\nBiker suddenly BACKWHEELS around, BLASTS through the\nROOF ACCESS DOOR\nand disappears inside.\nTWO MORE BIKERS\nfollow suit, SLAMMING DOWN onto the roof like alien invaders.\nINT - LOFT\nDuncan reacts. But it's not just the full-throttle howl of approaching bikes.\nIt's the BUZZ of approaching IMMORTALS.\nTHE BIKERS\nnow crest the stairs and fan out into the loft-- Same group we saw outside the monastery.\nTricked out in everything from Keds to chainmail, they drag a variety of weapons in their trailing hands-- sword, baseball bat, mace, dao and chain-whip.\nThe tips make a scraping noise across the floor that's deliberately unsettling.\nThey surround Duncan, cutting off any avenue of escape. Nobody moves or speaks. Just the low staccato growl of idling two-stroke engines.\nDuncan takes a step backward. Looks to Faith.\nDUNCAN \nWho're they?\nFAITH \nMore friends.\nPAN THE FACES. CARLOS from Bed-Stuy, BUG from Kyoto, WINSTON from Jamaica, SARGE from Shreveport and CRACKER BOB from nowhere in particular.\nAnd then there's CALVIN.\nA swaggering Immortal from the he's traded brute force in on a brand new weapon of choice. A DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA.\nCALVIN \nMake it pretty now. It's the bottom of the ninth.\nBIKERS DISMOUNT and CONVERGE on Duncan, swinging their weapons to limber up.\nDuncan backs away. This is unheard of-- Immortals packing like jackals.\nDUNCAN\nWhat-- it's a team sport now?\nCALVIN \n(zooming in) \nWhole new ballgame.\nTHREE IMMORTALS ATTACK. They're good. Duncan's better. About three times better.\nCALVIN\njockeys his camcorder-- GOES IN TIGHT on Duncan.\nCALVIN \nSup with the new blood, huh? Who's gonna lay him out? Take his secret sauce? \n(swivels around) \nYOU, Winston?\nWINSTON,\nthe tall Jamaican, stands off to one side watching, the\nlone holdout.\nCALVIN (cont'd) \nNope. Too proud. Old school.\nINTERCUT - VIDEO VIEWFINDER\nImage lurches and jostles as Calvin mixes it up with the combatants.\nCALVIN (O.S.)\nHow 'bout you, Carlos? You good for it? Carlos--?\nCARLOS HURTLES THROUGH FRAME. Lands hard.\nCALVIN (O.S.)\nI'll catch you later.\nSWISH PAN TO:\nSWORD\nsparking off chainmail.\nHANDS AND FEET\npounding flesh.\nBODIES\nslamming into walls.\nBLOOD. MAYHEM. PAIN.\nAnd Calvin, catching it all, up close and personal.\nCALVIN (cont'd) \nSarge is down. Cracker Bob's down.\nBut Carlos got some kick. Still got some kick.\nCarlos crawls to his feet, oozing blood and spite.\nCALVIN (cont'd)\nLike the man says, you gotta play with the small hurts.\nCarlos LUNGES--\nDuncan lays him out flat again, then swivels around to face--\nBUG\nwho straightens up to his full five-foot frame.\nCALVIN (cont'd) \nSay hello to my man BUG and his ugly- stick.\nBug brandishes a simple metal ROD with a woven grip. Nothing much to speak of...\nUntil he squeezes the grip--\n--and SIX BLADES EJECT SIMULTANEOUSLY.\nThe two on each end are SWORD BLADES, one for piercing, one for slashing.\nJutting perpendicular to the shaft, like an insane Swiss Army knife, are twin sets of DAGGERS-- two for stabbing and two sawtoothed SWORDBREAKERS.\nAnd then there's the shaft itself, if you're in need of a\ngood old-fashioned battering ram.\nCALVIN (cont'd)\nLike it? Came from a Tamaric swordsmith.\n(grins) \nWho smoked a lotta very wicked stuff.\nBug opens up a multi-pronged BARRAGE on Duncan. \nDuncan adapts to the first assault-- only to find himself reacting to an entirely new set of insane moves.\nCALVIN (cont'd) \nUhp--- Say welcome back to Carlos...\nCarlos cuts in yet again, swinging for the stands. He fans several times before Duncan backfists him across the nose and dumps him back onto the floor.\nDuncan spins back to Bug as the wiry Asian lifts his lethal metal rod again and grins.\nBut this time as he SQUEEZES the release mechanism--\n--Duncan KICKS IT, shoving it flush against Bug's chest.\nSNICK SNICK\ntwo PIVOTING DAGGERS slice into the dumbstruck Immortal. He falls backward WAILING like a stuck pig.\nA BOOMING VOICE freezes everyone in their tracks.\nVOICE \nThat's enough.\nAll eyes converge on:\nTHE STRANGER\nwho stands at a distance, cloaked in murky halflight.\nSTRANGER\nI'm sorry, Duncan. When it comes to discipline, the first hundred years are the hardest.\nDuncan lowers his katana, turns to the Stranger as--\nCARLOS\npainfully hauls himself upright and suddenly BULLDOZES Duncan clear through one of the immense loft windows.\nDuncan's launched AIRBORNE in a plume of shattered glass,\nstill clutching his katana.\nCarlos hooks an arm around the empty window-frame and watches with unvarnished satisfaction as the body SPIKES onto an upright iron ROD jutting from the construction site below.\nSTRANGER\nWhat was that?\nCARLOS \n(squinting) \nFull gainer with a quarter twist. Degree of difficulty-- not very.\nSTRANGER \nI thought I told you to stop.\nCARLOS \nYeah, well. I stopped.\nSTRANGER (cont'd) \nAre you challenging my authority?\nCarlos does his best to ignore him.\nSTRANGER (cont'd) \nBecause the only way to challenge my authority is to kill me.\nCARLOS\n(turns away)\nHey hey, take it easy, man.\nSTRANGER (cont'd)\nIs that clear?\nIn the split second it takes Carlos to turn back from the window, the Stranger is right there in his face.\nCARLOS \nShit!\nSTRANGER \nIS THAT CLEAR?\nStranger takes Carlos' sword and yanks it uo to his own neck -.\nSTRANGER (cont'd) \nHere's your chance.\nCarlos stares wide-eyed. Pride won't let him back down.\nFear won't let him proceed.\nSTRANGER (cont'd)\nTake it. You won't have another.\nWe can FEEL the SUDDEN HAMMERING of Carlos' HEART.\nCARLOS \nYou're crazy, man!\nSTRANGER \nAm I? Then go ahead... \n(rubs his neck across the blade) \nStop the madness.\nCARLOS \nHey--\nSTRANGER \nOr walk away... in perpetual fear of your own shadow. \n(beat) \nTell me, Carlos. Can you live with that? Can you live with the fear? Can you live with the weakness?\nTHUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP--\nSTRANGER (cont'd)\nWeakness, Carlos. Isn't that why you're here with me? Isn't that why you\u0091re ALL here with me?! Face it, you're nothing but. . . \n(savoring) \n. . . cattle.\nBlood POUNDS in Carlos' eyes. He YANKS back the sword,\nCRIES OUT and SLASHES for the Stranger's neck.\nCLOSE ON STRANGER'S HAND\nas it catches his wrist and diverts the blade around to Carlos' own throat, wedging it up tight under his chin.\nSTRANGER (cont'd)\nGod loves you. I don't.\nIn one vicious UP-SLICE, Stranger cuts through bone and\nsinew, stopping just short of a clean sever.\nCarlos gags and gurgles in liquid protest.\nSTRANGER (cont'd) \n(whispers) \nThey say the worst part, Carlos, is those last few seconds when you find yourself staring at your own headless body.\nSNICK--\nHe sends Carlos' head tumbling to the floor.\nSTRANGER (cont'd)\nOf course it's pure speculation, since nobody ever lives to tell about it.\nHOLD ON CARLOS' EYES\nstaring in pure, unknowable horror at his own body,\ntwitching several yards away.\nA tiny ARC of electrical ESSENCE crackles from the neck...\nTHE OTHERS\nbear mute witness to the GLOWING TENDRILS of ENERGY that stutter across the walls and ceiling.\nEXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW\nDuncan lies IMPALED on a JUTTING SHAFT OF RE-BAR as an UNMARKED PANEL VAN screeches INTO FRAME.\nHis eyes stare sightless upward as\nTHE LOFT WINDOWS\nEXPLODE with unearthly HOWLS of stretching metal and pulverizing concrete.\nSHOCKWAVES strafe the walls, blowing out mortar and brick.\nPOWER LINES SNAP and LASH against the building, spitting\nfiery plumes of SPARKS.\nINT - LOFT\nSeen from behind, the Stranger absorbs the QUICKENING in a series of wild electro-shock convulsions.\nEXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW\nSeveral darkly-clad MEN jump from the panel van and race up to Duncan. With pit crew efficiency, one takes a mondo set of BOLT CUTTERS to the metal stake while the others grab Duncan by the arms and ankles. A fourth throws open the cargo door.\nSnap-lift... they TOSS Duncan in the back of the van.\nINT - LOFT, SAME\nArms outstretched and rigid, head thrown back in silent rapture, the Stranger RISES slowly off the floor, suspended Christ-like in the air.\nBLINDING HALOES of PURE RADIANT ESSENCE engulf him, a lifeforce beyond human understanding.\nTHE OTHERS\nwatch transfixed. They've seen it all before, but it never ceases to amaze and terrify them.\nCUT TO:\nDARKNESS\nWhich becomes a harsh blast of LIGHT.\nDUNCAN'S EYES\nflutter open, squint at the glare. He's strapped to the\nsame Giger-like chair, immobilized. Standing around him\nare hooded members of that same monk-like order in what is, essentially, a dungeon.\nOne of them, MATTHEW, steps forward. His steel-gray eyes are familiar. He's the one who followed Duncan through customs.\nAs he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a thick metal dowel, he reveals a distinctive TATTOO across his inner forearm. One that Duncan instantly recognizes. _\nDUNCAN \nWatchers?\nMatthew simply nods.\nDUNCAN\nWatchers observe. They don't interfere.\nMATTHEW \nTrue. And we were more than happy to perform our traditional function. Believe me, it's a whole lot easier charting the history of Immortals than it is running a day care center for them. Unfortunately our role has changed somewhat.\nDUNCAN\nWhy?\nMATTHEW \nBecause the rules have been broken.\nDUNCAN\nNot by me.\nMATTHEW \nYou're not the one we're worried about.\nMatthew moves to the other side of the chair. Pegs the\narm cuff and ratchets down a redundant set of bindings.\nMATTHEW (cont'd)\nOne of your kind has gone renegade. In doing so he's gained himself a sizeable advantage. One that will be impossible to overcome.\nDUNCAN\nNobody's unbeatable.\nMATTHEW\nHe's surrounded himself with Immortals loyal only to him. He uses holy ground as a safe haven. And every head taken in battle is reserved for him alone, each Quickening-- hundreds upon hundreds-- taken by just one man. Yes, Duncan. He is unbeatable.\nMatthew pours a Scotch. Glenmorangie. Holds it to\nDuncan's lips like the final offering to a condemned man.\nMATTHEW (cont'd) \nWorse still, far worse, is that he's become a perversion to the Game. And if he prevails, that perversion will resonate through everything we know. For eternity. In ways we can't possibly comprehend.\nDuncan tugs at his bonds. Knows what's in store for him.\nMATTHEW (cont'd) \nThere must always be two of your kind. As long as there are two, and they're kept from fighting, the Prize is safe. The Sanctuary must continue.\nDUNCAN \nGet yourself another volunteer.\nMATTHEW \nWe had a number of \"volunteers.\" Sadly, that's no longer the case.\nAnother WATCHER steps up and forces an IRON FACE SHACKLE down over Duncan's head.\nMATTHEW (cont'd) \nYou'll be warehoused. Hidden away. So the Prize can remain safe.\nDuncan struggles frantically against his bonds.\nDUNCAN \nYou're insane!\nMATTHEW \nFor the world, Duncan. We do this for the world...\nThe Watcher takes two large BOLTS and begins to screw the mask directly into Duncan's skull.\nDUNCAN'S POV:\nBLACKNESS, accompanied by BRIGHT SEARING FLASHES of\nAGONY.\nMATTHEW'S VOICE (cont'd) \nDon't worry. The drugs should kick in momentarily.\nAll external SOUND is slowly DROWNED OUT by the POUNDING IN HIS OWN BRAIN.\nA POUNDING interspersed with jarring, synaptic flashes of\nBATTLE. Killing. Dying. Killing again. Dying again.\nThe recycling nightmare finally RECEDES back into\nNOTHINGNESS.\nThen, a NEW SOUND. Distant. Grind of metal on bone. Bolts being unscrewed.\nIron plate lifts from his eyes, flood of LIGHT.\nOnce again, Duncan SQUINTS up at a FACE. This time, the blurred, swimming features of a familiar Irish-American mug.\nDUNCAN\n(WOOZY) \nDawson...\nJOE DAWSON, familiar to many as Duncan's one friend inside the Watchers, smiles back.\nDAWSON \nYou look like shit.\nDUNCAN \nHow... long...?\nDAWSON \nWeek, maybe longer. We can't talk here. \n(unstraps Duncan) \nWe gotta go.\nDawson reacts to the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.\nDAWSON (cont'd)\n(urgently) \nNow. Can you walk?\nDUNCAN \nThink so.\nHe takes one step and pitches forward onto his face.\nDUNCAN (cont'd) \nPotent whiskey.\nHe clambers to his feet and follows Dawson out of the chamber.\nEXT - ARMORY - NIGHT\nDawson and Duncan emerge from a nondescript cinderblock armory, an overgrown Cold War relic recently co-opted by the Watchers.\nThey duck some scurrying guards, plow through thick underbrush to\nA HIDDEN CAR\nand climb inside.\nINT - CAR, TRAVELLING - NIGHT\nDUNCAN \nYou knew about The Sanctuary.\nDAWSON \nJust because I'm a Watcher, doesn't mean I'm always in the loop.\nDUNCAN \nI don't buy that.\nDawson averts his gaze. Stares ahead.\nDAWSON \nI really struggled with it, y'know, the idea of keeping guys on ice like that. But I couldn't argue with the logic. Least not 'til they went after you. \n(squeals hard onto the main drag) \nGuess that put it a little too close to home.\nDUNCAN \nI owe you.\nDawson slides Duncan's katana out from under the seat. Hands it over.\nDAWSON\nDo me a favor, buddy. Live to pay me back.\nDUNCAN \nWhat happened to the bodies?\nDawson winces slightly. Keeps driving.\nDUNCAN (cont'd)\nC'mon, Joe.\nDAWSON\nListen-- I got you outta one jam. Don't push your luck.\nDUNCAN \nI need to see them.\nDAWSON \nThey're dead. Trust me.\nDUNCAN \nWas one of them Connor MacLeod?\nDAWSON\nYes.\nDUNCAN \nLet me see the bodies.\nDAWSON \nThe heads are gone. You really don't wanna go there.\nDUNCAN \nI have to, Joe. I have to know.\nDawson jerks the car to a sudden shuddering stop.\nDAWSON\nAlright... Alright-- If I tell you, that's it, I'm outta here! You're on your own! I can't be a part of this, OK?!\nDUNCAN\nOK.\nDAWSON\nOK.\nDawson stares at Duncan. A beat, then:\nDAWSON \nFuck. I'm a part of it.\nHe throws the car back into gear and fishtails back onto the road.\nCUT TO:\nA VIEW THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\nof a forlorn and forgotten CEMETERY. Nothing marks its perimeter but a toppled gate and some trampled barbed wire.\nDAWSON \nIt was a Christian burial. Decent. They said all the right words.\nDUNCAN \nI can't begin to tell you how reassuring that is. Pull over.\nWIDE\nDawson pulls over. He and Duncan get out of the car.\nDAWSON \nNeedless to say, with a dozen unexplainable corpses, they had to go a bit off the beaten track.\nEXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET\nFrom here it looks like just a barren hillside littered with broken and crumbling marble.\nCLOSER\nDuncan and Dawson tramp up the shallow incline.\nDAWSON (cont'd) \nWhat do you think you're gonna find when you get up there?\nDUNCAN \nI don't know.\nDAWSON \nI'm not digging. Get that through your skull right now. Not these hands...\nCRESTING THE RIDGE\nTwelve freshly-mounded graves come into view, gouged into the rubbled downslope like wounds, each set off by a simple wooden cross.\nDuncan stops when he reaches the first grave. Stiffens.\nDAWSON \nWhat?\nDuncan remains frozen, staring, seemingly at nothing.\nDAWSON (cont'd) \nMy dog used to do that with locked closets. I hate that.\nDUNCAN \nShh.\nDawson listens. Nothing but the soft moan of WIND.\nDUNCAN (cont'd) \nHe's here.\nDAWSON \nTell me I'm not here for a seance.\nDuncan squints. Feels the BUZZ. Slight, but unmistakable.\nWHAT HE SEES:\nA row of stunted oaks, thick and gnarled againt the setting sun.\nCLOSER. . .\nStanding against the trunk, silhouette on silhouette, is the ghostly form of a MAN. Barely discernible, his features are hidden in shadow.\nDuncan slowly approaches the figure. Dawson hangs back,\nnervous and slightly twitchy.\nCLOSER STILL...\nThe figure steps up to greet Duncan. Sunlight brightens the face of\nCONNOR MACLEOD\nwho smiles as he embraces Duncan in the traditional bear- crush of Scottish clansmen.\nDUNCAN\nSorry I missed your funeral.\nCONNOR\nAll told, it was a bit underwhelming.\nDUNCAN\nSo it would seem.\nThey break. The brief joy suddenly drains from Connor's face-- his eyes speak of diffuse, faraway suffering.\nCONNOR \nWhy are you here?\nDUNCAN\nTen years ago you skipped out on a bartab.\nConnor's expression hardens.\nCONNOR\nYou need to know something...\nHe steps up to Duncan, locks eyes.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nEvery life I touch ends. Brutally. And for no reason. It's a curse that's followed me for centuries. I can't outrun it and I can't outlive it. \n(beat) \nYou're my last friend in this world, Duncan. I left for your own good. It was better that you didn't know where.\nDUNCAN\nThe Sanctuary.\nCONNOR\nYes. The Sanctuary.\nDUNCAN\nBut you escaped.\nCONNOR\nNo, I didn't escape...\nFLASH BACK TO THE SANCTUARY as the STRANGER moves toward a shackled Connor MacLeod.\nCONNOR (V.O.) \n...I was freed.\nAs before, the immobilized Connor stirs in a drug-addled haze.\nCONNOR \nWho are you?\nSTRANGER \nYou'll know soon enough.\nCONNOR'S POV - THROUGH THE BOTTOM EDGE OF HIS FACEPLATE\nAll Connor can see is the Stranger's HAND as it reaches down and PULLS THE PIN from one of Connor's arm shackles. The cuff FALLS OPEN. \nStranger turns away. A beat later come the unmistakable SOUNDS of SLAUGHTER that fill the room to a DEAFENING CRESCENDO.\nCONNOR (V.O.) \nI couldn't see the slaughter. I only heard it.\nBACK TO CEMETERY:\nWe can still see the agony playing out in Connor's eyes. He turns away, sees\nJOE DAWSON\nstill standing on the ridge, swatting at the occasional deerfly.\nCONNOR \nWho's he?\nDUNCAN\nThe reason I didn't become your replacement.\nDawson casually removes one of his legs and vigorously shakes it upside down.\nCONNOR \nWhat's he doing now?\nDUNCAN \nSand in the shoe would be my guess.\nConnor suddenly gazes beyond Dawson to\nTHE NEXT HILLSIDE\nand the FAINT SOUND OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES. He stiffens.\nCONNOR \nYou were followed.\nOne by one, a HALF-DOZEN MOTORCYCLISTS crest the surrounding hills and come to a menacing stop.\nDUNCAN \nYeah. I was meaning to tell you about those guys.\nDawson fumbles to put his leg back on. Hops a full 360 as he watches the intruders surround them.\nTWO MORE\napproach on foot, following the same path Duncan and Dawson took.\nOne is Faith. The other, The Stranger.\nExcept he's no stranger to Connor MacLeod. Far from it.\nConnor goes rigid. Breathing stops.\nHis nightmare's finally taken human form.\nMOVE IN for our first clear look at\nJACOB KASE\nstriding forward, bigger than death.\nHis is a face hewn by God\u0091s sharpest blade, every angle cold, remorseless, Puritannical.\nAs before, he's clad in basic black, accented by the stark white of a priest's collar.\nCONNOR\n(ice) \nJacob Kase...\nConnor edges back his coat. Hand seeks out the grip of his sword.\nDuncan grabs his arm.\nDUNCAN \nNot here.\nCONNOR \nWalk away, Duncan.\nKase and Faith continue toward them. Connor's rage seems to ratchet up with every step.\nDUNCAN \nYou're on holy ground. Remember the rules...\nPure, radiating hate seethes in Connor's eyes.\nCONNOR \nThe rules be damned.\nKase stops, inches from Connor's face. Cooly regards the sword.\nKASE\nLook at you. You'd think after half a millenium, you'd learn to keep that you'd learn to keep that temper of yours in check.\nGone is any trace of brogue. He's a fully-assimilated New Yorker now.\nConnor's fingers tighten around the swordgrip...\nCONNOR \nJust tell me where, Kase.\nKASE \nIf all I wanted was to kill you, you'd have been dead a very long time ago, Connor.\nSomething roils under Kase's controlled exterior. A rage every bit as consuming as Connor's.\nKASE (cont'd) \nBut your death alone could never appease the innocent souls you slaughtered.\nFLASH TO SEVERAL OF GLENFINNAN'S VILLAGERS being MOWED DOWN by Connor's mindless fury.\nKASE (cont'd) \nIt couldn't even begin to appease mine.\nFLASH TO KASE as he drops to his knees, gagging blood, RUN THROUGH by Connor's blade.\nKASE (cont'd) \nWorst of all, you murdered a man of God. Who raised me as his son.\nFLASH TO A FATHER RAINEY as Connor brings his sword CLEAVING DOWN on him.\nKASE (cont'd) \n...and no punishment conceived by man can ever atone for that.\nAFTERMATH OF MASSACRE\nScattered wisps of smoke gambol across the demolished commons, leading up to the CORPSE of JACOB KASE.\nKASE (cont'd)\nWhat you never could have expected was that you'd leave behind this one humble servant...\nKase's body lies there as cold as the Highland dawn.\nKASE (cont'd) \n...who would trade eternity itself to make you pay.\nHIS EYES\nsnap open.\nAnd we're once again TRANSPORTED BACK TO:\nEXT - CEMETERY - DAY\nKase steps closer, revelling in this moment.\nKASE \nLook back over the endless travesties of your life and you'll see me. Always there, waiting in the shadows.\n(beat) \nWhen friends and lovers are wiped from your sight, I'm there.\nKASE (cont'd) \nWhen those you cherish die abruptly and for no reason, I'm there. \n(kicks a clod of dirt onto a grave) \nAnd when a handful of misguided and pathetic idiots just happen to share your own private hell...\n(shrugs) \nGuess who?\nHe walks a full circle around Connor.\nAll the while Kase addresses Connor, Faith never takes her eyes off Duncan.\nKASE (cont'd) \nBut if you think it ends here, my ancient friend, you're wrong. Very... Very... Wrong.\nKase turns back to Faith. Pulls his sword and without\nwarning SLICES it across her throat.\nFaith reflexively GASPS, stumbles backward, leaving--\nA WOOD AND SILVER CRUCIFIX\ndangling on Kase's swordtip.\nFOLLOW THE CRUCIFIX\nas he swings it around and offers it up to Connor.\nKASE \nThought you might be wanting this. I kept it for you...\nFLASH TO CONNOR'S MOTHER, bound to the stake as Kase rips the crucifix from her neck.\nBACK TO SCENE:\nConnor stares down at the crucifix now in his open palm.\nKASE (cont'd) \nFor old times' sake.\nKase puts an arm around Faith.\nKASE (cont'd) \nWant to find me again, Connor? Just put your hands together...\nKASE (cont'd) \n(winks) \nAnd pray.\nHe gives Faith a little shove and they both start downhill.\nTHE SURROUNDING BIKERS\ngun their engines and ride off on billowing plumes of dust.\nConnor makes no move to follow. Strangely silent and impassive, he's like a warrior gutted by an invisible sword.\nDuncan puts a hand on his shoulder.\nDUNCAN \nWhatever it is...\nConnor swipes away Duncan's hand, starts walking.\nDUNCAN (cont'd) \nI can help you, Connor.\nConnor stops, swivels back. Eyes dead.\nCONNOR \nNobody can help me.\nHe walks off alone, a ghost against a sea of gravestones,\nDUNCAN \nCONNOR--\nDuncan watches his friend depart, helpless. Turning back, he sees\nFAITH AND KASE\nstopped halfway down the hill. They seem to be arguing. Kase turns abruptly and strides off.\nCLOSE ON FAITH\nShe stands there a moment, sullenly rubbing her throat. Duncan's VOICE spins her back around. \nDUNCAN (O.S.) \nProblem?\nFAITH \nI get a bit fussy whenever somebody points a sword at me.\n(dry) \nGoes a long way back.\nTheir eyes fix on one another. Air thickens. Buzzes with electricity.\nDUNCAN \nJust one question. After all these years. . . \n(re: Kase)\nWhy him?\nFaith glances down at Kase, who stands waiting at the base of the hill. Considers.\nFAITH\nBecause I've never known anyone who had such an amazing capacity for hate. \n(beat) \nExcept me.\nOn that, she brushes past Duncan and rejoins Kase.\nTRANSITION TO:\nEXT - IRISH COUNTRYSIDE, 17TH CENTURY - DAY\nDuncan and Connor ride side by side on horseback. They reach a\nRIVERBANK\nwhere a YOUNG WOMAN and her elderly CONSORT are detained at a crude wooden TOLL GATE.\nEight or nine disreputable-looking HIGHWAYMEN surround their carriage.\nConnor rides up to what would appear to be the LEADER. He has the most teeth.\nCONNOR \nWhat's going on?\nHIGHWAYMAN \nThe lady here refuses to pay her toll.\nCONNOR \nToll for what?\nHIGHWAYMAN \nPassage over the bridge.\nConnor cranes his eyes, upriver and down.\nCONNOR \nI see no bridge.\nHIGHWAYMAN \nWhat do you think pays for the bridge?\nConnor considers, then turns back to the lady with a\nshrug.\nCONNOR \nThe man has a point.\nDespite her sweeping auburn hair and natural beauty, we now recognize the young woman as FAITH from an earlier era.\nHer original name is CATHERINE MARY DEVANEY.\nCATHERINE \nThese men are liars and scoundrels. They\u0091ve preyed upon us three years running.\nCONNOR\nThis true?\nHIGHWAYMAN \nA good sturdy bridge is not an overnight accomplishment, Sir.\nCONNOR \nExactly what, may I ask, have you accomplished so far?\nHIGHWAYMAN\n(proudly) \nThe tollgate.\nDuncan trots around the tollgate and up alongside Connor. He leans over to the highwayman.\nDUNCAN \nExcuse me, but by whose authority do you act?\nHIGHWAYMAN \n(holds up scroll) \nBy deed of the King.\nDUNCAN \nMight I see that?\nHighwayman slowly unravels the parchment scroll. The nearly-illegible scrawl suggests random words copied by an illiterate.\nDUNCAN (cont'd) \nDoes the King always sign his name with an \"X\"?\nHighwayman's cronies reach for their swords.\nHIGHWAYMAN \nHe was in a hurry.\nAll eyes hover on Duncan's reaction. Two of the highwaymen edge around behind Catherine and her elderly consort, ready to gut them both at a moment's notice.\nDuncan tracks them with his eyes.\nDUNCAN \n(nods) \nBusy man, the King.\n(to Catherine) \nI suggest you pay the gentlemen and be on your way.\nCATHERINE \nHis deed is a fake!\nDUNCAN\nThat's a matter of opinion.\nCATHERINE\nYou, Sir, are no better than they!\nDUNCAN\nThat's also a matter of opinion. \n(to Connor) \nShall we?\nConnor sizes up his young protege'. Gives a dubious nod.\nCONNOR\nLead on.\nCATHERINE \nYou can't just leave!\nDUNCAN \nYou're right...\nHe tosses a handful of gold coins to the Highwayman.\nDUNCAN (cont'd) \nGood luck with the bridge.\nHe kicks his horse into a brisk trot. Connor reluctantly follows suit.\nThey cross the river through ankle-deep water.\nCONNOR \nI can't believe you gave those bastards your money.\nDUNCAN \nIt wasn't my money.\nDuncan pulls a cinched canvas BAG overstuffed with coins from his overcoat.\nDUNCAN (cont'd) \nIt was theirs.\nRACK FOCUS TO the duped HIGHWAYMEN scrambling onto their horses and riding hard in frantic pursuit.\nThey hit the river at a gallop, kicking up giant shimmering fantails of water.\nDUNCAN (cont'd) \nBy the time they reach us, the young lady and her escort should be safely out of harm\u0091s way.\nThe pursuers close the gap in seconds.\nConnor grins approvingly. Draws his sword and glances\nover at Duncan.\nCONNOR\nShall we?\nDuncan FLICKS his own sword, lets the hilt auto-rotate around his open palm and snaps it vertical. He nods back at Connor.\nDUNCAN\nLet's.\nTogether, they whirl around to face the onrushing horde.\nTHEY BATTLE\nin the middle of the shallow river. Nine maniacal thieves against two sporting Immortals.\nThe spray of water, the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves all build to an operatic crescendo.\nDuncan's improved since Ravenna. He easily scatters three of his adversaries before engaging the blood-crazed LEADER.\nThis time it's Connor who finds himself in trouble. He tumbles from his horse and goes down, losing his sword in the river.\nDUNCAN\nsuddenly winds back and FLINGS his sword at his opponent like a throwing dagger.\nBLADE\nwhistles past the dumbstruck highwayman's head. Which was not the intended target...\n. . .as we discover when we follow it's end-over-end\nflight. . .\n. . . straight into CONNOR'S OUTSTRETCHED HAND.\nConnor parries his attackers, drives them backward onto their asses, then swivels around and TOSSES the sword back to\nDUNCAN,\nwho catches it, ducks the highwayman's next swing and swiftly sends him packing.\nCONNOR\nrecovers his own sword, which is enough to send the last of their attackers into a full-on, stumbling retreat.\nThey both stand watching as\nTHE CARRIAGE\njostles safely across the river.\nCLOSE ON CATHERINE\nas she looks back at Duncan. She gives Duncan a knowing smile that's as innocent as it is seductive.\nCONNOR \n(watching Duncan) \nYou know that stirring in your gut? It's not just simple lust, my friend.\nDUNCAN \nI know...\nCONNOR \nAh, but do you really?\nMATCH CUT TO:\nFAITH\nas she and Kase drive away from the cemetery in a late model convertible.\nEXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET\nJoe Dawson walks up to Duncan.\nDAWSON \nI feel like I stepped in on the wrong party.\nDuncan keeps watching the convertible until it disappears over the next rise.\nDUNCAN \n(quietly)\nLet's go.\nCUT TO:\nEXT - BAR - NIGHT\nWe recognize this place. It's where Connor and Duncan shared a last drink together.\nDuncan and Joe Dawson now hunch over that same bar, staring into their drinks.\nDAWSON \nI swear, the man's a walking ghost.\nEXT - SIDEWALK - NIGHT\nFEET pound pavement.\nDAWSON (V.O.) (CONT'D) \nWhatever it is he's carrying around inside him, it's like he's dead already.\nGlare of streetlights rake across Connor's face, his eyes fixed forward as if driven by a sense more powerful than sight.\nConnor bumps shoulders with a passing PEDESTRIAN.\nPEDESTRIAN \nEyy man-- watch it.\nHe continues on, oblivious.\nINT - BAR - NIGHT\nDuncan turns to Dawson.\nDUNCAN\nThere are things you do in this life that damn you for eternity. They can't be changed. And they can't be undone. You carry these things to the grave, Joe, in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, you'll find some peace there. Some relief, even if it's oblivion. \n(hollow smile)\nBut Immortals don't die. We just go on reliving our sins. Over and over again.\nEXT - ANOTHER STREET - LATER\nConnor stops. Lifts his eyes to the light.\nA SOLITARY STONE CHURCH\nstands before him in a bed of crawling mist. It seems eerily out of place amid the urban blight around it.\nINT - BAR - NIGHT\nDuncan downs the last of his drink, shoves off from the bar.\nDawson glances warily up at him.\nDAWSON \nWhere now?\nDUNCAN\nThere were two places I figured Connor was likely to go. One of 'em was here.\nDAWSON \nAnd the other?\nDUNCAN \nYou're the \"Watcher.\" You tell me.\nEXT - STONE CHURCH - NIGHT\nConnor climbs the steps, presses through the heavy wooden doors...\nINT - CHURCH\n. . . and prowls slowly through the dimly-lit interior. Icon SHADOWS loom large and menacing.\nJUMP CUT:\nHe moves along the stations of the cross.\nJUMP CUT:\nHe's stalking through the nave.\nJUMP CUT:\nBarging into the sacristy.\nEXT - DAWSON'S CAR, DRIVING - NIGHT\nDawson's car screams past with a doppler howl.\nDAWSON (O.S.) \nIt's an old abandoned church just off Canal...\nINT - DAWSON'S CAR - SAME\nDawson's behind the wheel, gunning through narrow back\nstreets.\nDAWSON \n. . . Perfect safe haven for a so-called priest, huh? \"Our Lady of Sorrows.\"\n(dry) \nKinda has a nice ring to it.\nHe fishtails around the next corner. Recovers.\nDAWSON (cont'd) \nI'll tell ya this-- if he's going after Kase, he's in for a rude awakening. The man's untouchable.\nDUNCAN \nSo they tell me.\nINT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT\nConnor stops before the darkened altar, senses BUZZING.\nTHE SHADOWED CRUCIFIX\nstirs. Arms lift in the darkness.\nJacob Kase steps down off the cross, lingers in shadow.\nKASE \nI would grant you absolution. If I were a better man.\nHe turns and disappears out the back.\nConnor follows.\nRight past\nKASE'S POSSE OF IMMORTALS\nscattered throughout the pews, who simply track him with their eyes but make no move to follow.\nWINSTON,\nthe tall Jamaican, leans over to Faith.\nWINSTON\nYou know we're next, don't you?\nFaith lowers the book she's reading-- the Holy Bible. Looks up.\nFAITH \nWhat?\nWINSTON \nOur days are numbered. You can see it in Kase's eyes.\nFAITH \nDo you believe in a hereafter, Winston?\nWINSTON \nAll I know is I won't be hereafter Jacob Kase gets through with me. And that's all I care about right now.\nFaith leans back against the hardback pew, closes her\neyes.\nFAITH\nYeah...\nCUT TO:\nEXT - REAR OF CHURCH - NIGHT\nKase strides just beyond the perimeter of the church grounds, then turns back to Connor.\nConnor draws his sword, moves on Kase.\nKASE\nThe ancient samurai vowed never to draw blood in anger. It defiled their sense of purpose. \n(draws his own sword)\nOf course they're also somewhat extinct.\nHe steps fearlessly up to Connor, places his neck against Connor's swordblade...\n. . . just like he did with a certain late Immortal named Carlos.\nCLOSE ON KASE'S SWORD\nHe opens his fingers and lets the sword DROP. It clatters useless to the ground.\nKASE\nWould you slaughter an unarmed man of God again, Connor? Would that finally put your soul to rest?\n(low, taunting)\nThen go ahead. Send me home.\nBLOOD POUNDS with the rage pulsing through Connor's veins.\nKASE (cont'd) \nWhat's stopping you? Guilt? The nagging sense that maybe you, more than I, deserve to die?\nDawson's car pulls up in the background. Duncan jumps\nout.\nKASE (cont'd)\nOr somewhere along the way did you just lose your nerve?\nConnor's sword digs into Kase's neck. Breaks skin.\nDUNCAN \n(approaching) \nDon't do it, Connor.\nCONNOR \n(gritted) \nKeep back.\nKASE \n(to Duncan)\nYou heard him. No Immortal can interfere with another's duel.\nDUNCAN \nHe's playing you! Step back onto holy ground before it's too late--\nKase faces back to Connor.\nKASE\nGo ahead-- what better chance than now? Take your shot.\nDUNCAN \nDon't listen to him!\nKASE\nDo it. For your sweet mother...\nFLASH\nCaiolin burns at the stake. Suddenly startled,\nKASE (cont'd) \nYour Huguenot bitch in Navarre...\nFLASH\nrears back, THROWS Suddenly startled, the HORSE bearing a FRENCH DUCHESS her to the ground, breaking her neck.\nKASE (cont'd) \nBrenda Wyatt...\nFLASH\nBRENDA WYATT (\"Highlander 1\") is seen walking in CENTRAL PARK. A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER MOWS HER DOWN from behind.\nKASE (cont'd) \nRachel Ellenstein...\nFLASH\nRACHEL is BLOWN APART in the antique store she shared with Connor.\nKASE (cont'd) \nTell me-- do they even begin to equal the devastation of an entire village?\nBLADE TREMBLES in Connor's hands. Kase presses his neck even harder against Connor's blade. BLOOD trickles down his neck.\nKASE (cont'd) \nSo close. Soooo close...\nDuncan stands by, helpless to intervene.\nKASE (cont'd) \nLook at you. Even now, you're afraid you'll lose. That's your true fear isn't it?\n(whispers low, seductive) \nOh, it's not the dying, my friend. I know that. That would be a blessing. It's the thought of giving up your essence to me. Making me even stronger by it.\nOne look in Connor's eyes and you know he's right.\nKASE (cont'd)\nWhat's wrong? \n(almost a purr) \nDon't you want to be inside me?\nConnor slowly LOWERS his sword...\nand FLICKS Kase's discarded sword back up into his hands.\nKase simply smiles and takes position.\nDuncan can only look on helplessly as Kase takes the first offensive, driving Connor backward with dazzling -- almost casual-- swordplay.\nKASE \nI've taken more heads than you can possibly imagine.\nHis sword whistles across Connor's face, opens a THREE\nINCH GASH over his eye.\nKASE (cont'd) \nDo you really want a taste of all those accumulated quickenings?\nConnor stumbles backward again, blinded by his own dripping blood. Knows beyond a shadow of a doubt he's doomed.\nDuncan knows it too. And it's killing him to watch.\nStill Connor won't go down easy.\nHe manages a brief offensive, walking Kase backward on his toes.\nKase puts one hand behind his back, fencing-style, and goes to work on Connor's torso, crosshatching him in blood.\nConnor lunges wildly. Kase parries effortlessly.\nKase now opens up a BLINDING BARRAGE on Connor. It's like duelling against lightning, so quick and unpredictable are Kase's strikes.\nConstantly off balance, Connor still manages to NICK Kase in the cheek.\nKASE (cont'd) \n(touches scratch) \nI'd almost forgotten what that felt like. Thank you.\nHe now turns it on full. Drives Connor up against a wall and pins him with his swordtip.\nHis eyes go impossibly cold.\nKASE \nI want you to think back to this moment in the endless nights ahead. And know that every time you close your eyes, from now to eternity, I'll be there. \n(beat) \nRipping apart the ones you care about most.\nHe removes his sword and steps back.\nKASE (cont'd) \nIt's not over, Connor MacLeod. It will never, never be over.\nHe turns and walks back toward the church.\nDuncan does not step aside to let him pass-- their shoulders bump.\nKASE (cont'd) \nYou, on the other hand, are on borrowed time.\nHe continues on, past the other Immortals who have gathered to watch the unfolding spectacle.\nOne-by-one, they turn and file back into the church behind Kase.\nConnor stares into Duncan's eyes as if wanting to say something. Can't.\nInstead, he turns and starts limping out across the empty lot.\nFeeling the presence of another Immortal, Duncan slowly looks over at\nFAITH\nwho stands at a distance. Watching him.\nAs their eyes meet, she, too, turns and melts back into the surrounding blackness.\nTRANSITION TO:\nEXT - DUBLIN ROWHOUSE (17TH CENTURY) - DAY\nA BEARDED BRAWLER\nCRASHES DOWN onto a wooden table. He takes the table cloth with him as he TUMBLES head over heels onto the floor in a cascade of soda bread and cabbage.\nMiraculously (unless you're an Irishman) he spills not one drop of precious Guinness, which he hoists in a cheery salute to:\nTHE BRIDE AND GROOM\nwho sit laughing in the eye of an Irish hurricane. DUNCAN MACLEOD and CATHERINE MARY (KATE) DEVANEY-- aka \"Faith\"-- are a stunning couple that inspire joyful madness.\nThings have progressed nicely since their chance encounter at the toll crossing.\nBRAWLER \nLet's have at it!\nThey kiss to a CHORUS of BOOS. So this time they REALLY KISS. Crowd goes wild.\nAROUND THEM\nREVELERS DANCE and FIGHT with equal abandon, making it almost impossible to tell the difference. But they stop like clockwork for every new toast and testimonial.\nTHE BEARDED BRAWLER\nspears his mug into the air like a royal scepter.\nBRAWLER \nHappy is the bride that sees the sun! Sorry the corpse that sees the rain!\nCLOSE ON BEER MUG\nframed in a perfect BEAM of SUNLIGHT streaming through an open window.\nFOLLOW THE SUNBEAM TO:\nKATE who smiles back with her own inner radiance. Bedecked in flowers, her brown hair sweets low over white lace shoulders and cream skin.\nShe leans over RAUCOUS CHEERS and kisses Duncan, provoking a new RIOT of and UPRAISED GLASSES.\nTHE PIPERS\nresplendent in their Celtic kilts, launch into the \"Highland Fling.\nKate is instantly YANKED up onto her feet and into a ROUSING JIG.\nBefore Duncan can protest, he's HOISTED from his seat and FLUNG onto the dance floor.\nDuncan and Kate link arms, goaded on by a circle of shouting, stumbling CLAPPERS.\nWith each new upshift in tempo, they spin faster and faster until they're hanging on for dear life.\nSIGHT AND SOUND\ngradually blur into a queasy sense of vertigo. But for Duncan, it's not just the headstrong mix of drink and passion.\nIt's the BUZZ of another Immortal.\nHe spins to a stop as his eyes come to rest on\nCONNOR MACLEOD\nwho enters the room on a wave of silence.\nDuncan breaks away from Kate, crosses over to Connor and wraps him in a bear hug.\nDUNCAN\nAbout time. I was beginning to wonder.\nCONNOR \nI was on a junk in the South China Sea when I got your notice. 12 hours ago.\nDUNCAN \nHow...?\nCONNOR \nDon't ask.\nKate spins by on the arm of a new partner.\nKATE \nYou're next, Connor MacLeod.\nCONNOR \nThat better be no idle threat.\nDuncan watches Kate with a rapturous smile.\nDUNCAN\nWell, I finally did it!\nCONNOR \nSo it would appear.\nDUNCAN\nWhat do you think of her?\nCONNOR \nYou know that's not an easy answer.\nThe edge in his voice is not lost on Duncan.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nOutside.\nEXT - PORCH - NIGHT\nConnor stands with Duncan at the railing, staring out into the encroaching night.\nCONNOR \nYou know she's like us.\nDUNCAN\nYes. I sensed it the day we met her.\nCONNOR \nSo you know that, like us, her immortality can only be triggered by the shock of a violent death.\nDuncan looks off, as if purging the thought from his head.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nIt's what makes warriors of us all, Duncan. Good or bad, there seems a purpose to it.\nDUNCAN \nYes. And without such a death, she'll simply grow old and die like any other. Is that what you dragged me out here to tell me?\nConnor removes a uniquely-braided GOLDEN ROPE from his vest pocket.\nIt catches the candlelight with the glint of a thousand silken threads as he runs it lightly over his fingertips.\nCONNOR\nMany years after I was married, I came home to find Heather sitting on a stool in the kitchen, with a knife in one hand... and her hair in the other.\nFLASH TO:\nHEATHER, early-forties, her hair shorn to the scalp. She looks up at Connor with red-rimmed eyes and a bitter smile.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nAt first I was scared. Scared that she'd gone mad. And then angry, as if she'd somehow meant to hurt me by it.\nBACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN:\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nWhen I asked her why she'd done such a thing to herself, her answer cut me to the quick. She said it was the one part of her that would not age. It would forever remain the same as when I first fell in love with her.\nFLASH TO:\nCONNOR burying Heather in a simple grave overlooking their home. Tears streak his face. He sinks to his knees in unspeakable anguish.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nAnd that's how she wanted me to remember her.\nBACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN:\nConnor closes his fingers around the braid. Squeezes.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nIt's all I have now.\nDUNCAN \nI love Kate. I'll hold on to her as long as I can. That's all I can do.\nKate can be seen through the window behind them, exchanging dance partners with dizzying abandon.\nCONNOR \nIf that's your intent, so be it.\nDuncan swings over the rail and hops off the porch. Takes to the ground in long angry strides.\nEXT - COBBLED STREET - NIGHT\nConner walks double time to catch up with him.\nDUNCAN \nWhy are you telling me this?\nCONNOR \nBecause I once loved a woman more than life itself. And I watched her die. Unlike you, I had no other choice.\nDUNCAN \nAnd I have a choice?! What would you have me tell her?!\nCONNOR \nI'd tell her nothing. She wouldn't believe you. They never do when it involves themselves.\nDUNCAN \nThen I can do nothing.\nCONNOR \nShe's in the flower of her youth. Enjoy the moment and let it pass. If you think you can.\nDuncan suddenly grabs Connor's shoulder, spins him around.\nDUNCAN \nYou'd have me kill her?! Is that it?! Is that what you came all this way to tell me on my WEDDING NIGHT?!\nCONNOR \nI'd have you do what your heart-- and our conscience-- demand.\nDuncan settles. Searches his eyes.\nDUNCAN \nAnd if it were you in my place?\nConnor ponders. Then shakes his head.\nCONNOR \nI thank God I never had the choice.\nHe listens to the faint strains of music and laughter carried on the rising WIND.\nCONNOR (cont'd) \nTell Catherine I'm sorry I couldn't stay longer.\nHe clasps Duncan by the forearm. Then turns and continues n down the cobbled lane leading from the wedding party.\nTRANSITION BACK TO:\nINT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT\nDuncan lies sleepless in a nouveau-stark hotel room, somewhere in the bowels of Manhattan.\nA half-empty bottle of Glenmorangie is there for company.\nThe door CREAKS OPEN, casting a single ribbon of light across the room.\nIt WIDENS to REVEAL THE SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN.\nDuncan closes his eyes. Feigns sleep.\nShe pads silently inside. Pulls the door closed.\nDuncan remains still, breathing heavily.\nThe woman steals slowly up to the bedside. Pauses, as if quietly studying Duncan--\n--then swings her leg up and straddles him.\nEven in the murky halflight, he can still make out the familiar painted eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair.\nShe says nothing, her expression lost under a veil of darkness. Only her rapid breathing betrays her tension.\nInstead, she suddenly leans forward and KISSES HIM.\nPassionately.\nDuncan responds in kind. AS if powerless to do anything\nelse...\nLIGHTNING stitches the sky outside as--\nThey embrace.\nBodies entwine with an urgency that builds with the STORM\nraging outside.\nON THE NEXT THUNDERCRACK\nTRANSITION TO:\nEXT - EMPTY FIELD (DUBLIN) - NIGHT\nANGRY SHEETS OF RAIN rake the countryside as Duncan slogs imlessly through calf-deep mud. Still in his wedding arb, he's thoroughly drenched, as if he's been wandering this way for hours.\nINT - ROWHOUSE - NIGHT\nThe last of the guests have gone or passed out beneath toppled kegs of ale.\nOnly Kate remains upright, her face etched with sober dread as\nDUNCAN\nappears in the doorway, rivulets of water pouring off his\nshoulders and brow.\nFor a while they just stare at one another, each lost to his own sense of foreboding.\nKate is the first to speak. Despite her stoic veneer, her voice comes out small and terrified.\nKATE \nIf this is wrong, Duncan, tell me now.\nSaying nothing, Duncan slowly crosses the floor and takes her hands in his own.\nINT - BEDROOM - NIGHT\nCANDLES flicker in the storm-fed drafts that whistle through closed windows.\nKate lays Duncan's rainsoaked clothing across a nightstand then turns, regarding him naked for the very first time.\nDuncan reaches out to touch her. She trembles.\nGently, as if unwrapping an object of unimaginable fragility, Duncan removes her clothing down to a simple floating chemise.\nThen guides her down onto a canopied bed encircled by a hundred fresh-cut wildflowers.\nHANDS\nclasp, fingers dig into skin.\nWhatever refinements Kate displayed in public are now happily abandoned.\nShe arches up under Duncan, puts her lips to his ear.\nKATE \nI'll love you forever.\nOn an OMINOUS THUNDERCLAP--\nTRANSITION BACK TO:\nINT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT\nWe're back in the present. Little has changed but the\nsheets.\nAnd the fury of their lovemaking.\nEach new THUNDERCRACK highlights a different aspect of their hunger-- their wet, glistening bodies STROBING FASTER AND FASTER until the act itself becomes abstracted from any sense of time or place.\nFLASH FRAMES\nstutter inside the lightning:\nSILKEN HAIR\ncoursing over cream-colored breasts and a simple pewter cross.\nEYES\nsimilar in shape and color, that shift from painted to plain...\nFINGERNAILS\nthat toggle between neo-goth BLACK and natural pink...\nFAITH\nthrows back her head, biting back the shudders of release...\n. . . and sinks down into the bed with a drawn sigh.\nINT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT\nA SHADOW darkens Kate as she sleeps. It lingers there, deadly still.\nDUNCAN\nstands over her, gripped by indecision.\nThe fateful choice tears at him, even as he holds a DAGGER over her gently-rising chest.\nHis hand TREMBLES.\nDUNCAN \n(softly) \nForgive me.\nKATE'S EYES\nSNAP OPEN as the DAGGER PLUNGES INTO HER HEART.\nFor an instant their eves meet. And in that single shattering moment, Duncan knows he chose wrong.\nIt's not just terror that passes through Kate's eyes. It's the incomprehensible pain of betrayal.\nKate gasps once, jerks and settles. Lies there dead, blood pooling across her nightgown.\nDuncan stares down at her body, numb.\nDUNCAN \nI'm sorry...\nOn that look we TRANSITION BACK TO:\nINT - HOTEL - NIGHT\nThe pain imprints on Duncan as if he's still clutching the knife.\nDUNCAN\nI'm sorry.\nWhatever passion stirred Faith moments before is gone without a trace. Her eyes are as cold and empty as the dead Kate.\nFAITH\nYou had no right.\nDUNCAN\nI was doing it for you. For us.\nFLASH TO:\nINT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT\nKate CONVULSES BACK TO LIFE, eyes wild, insane.\nDuncan reaches out to her, which only sends her reeling further into panic delirium. She swats at him, punching flailing... \nDUNCAN\nNow you're an immortal. Like me. It was the only way...\nWords fall on deaf ears.\nShe wrenches out of his grip. Stumbles for the door, drenched in her own blood.\nLeaves Duncan standing mindblown in her wake.\nEXT - DUBLIN STREETS - NIGHT\nKate flees through wet empty streets-- barefoot, nightgown ripped and bloody, face contorted like a madwoman. Breath comes in ragged, whimpering gasps.\nShe trips, falls. Comes up running.\nBACK TO PRESENT:\nFaith climbs off the bed, throws on Duncan's shirt, whirls back, tears streaking her face like warpaint.\nFAITH \nYou wanted this! I never asked for eternity! You forced it on me! \n(screams) \nIT WAS MY DECISION, NOT YOURS!! \nDUNCAN\nWould you have really understood?\nFAITH \nUnderstood? Which part?! The part about never having children? Or the endless, numbing sameness of it all?\n(bitter laugh) \nOr maybe you mean the part where you wake up one day and realize you're nothing but a whore racking up faceless affairs because whole lifetimes tick by so fast they don't even count anymore!\nShe wraps her arms around herself as if to stem the escaping demons.\nDuncan remains silent, taking it all in.\nFAITH (cont'd) \nHere's the kicker, Duncan. I came here for one reason and one reason only. To see if I could feel again. Anything.\nShe walks out, leaving the door hanging wide in her wake.\nINT - HALLWAY\nFaith reaches for the stairwell door as--\n--DUNCAN'S ARM LANCES OUT, holding it shut.\nDUNCAN \n(leaning in) \nI'm watching my best friend driven insane by something that happened four centuries ago. And there's nothing I can do to stop it. Because those people are dead and nobody can bring them back.\nFaith struggles to open the door. Duncan holds firm.\nDUNCAN (cont'd)\nBut I'm lucky. You know why?\nFAITH\nLet go!\nDUNCAN \nI'm lucky because my crime can still be forgiven.\nFAITH \nLET GO!!\nDUNCAN \nAs long as you're still alive, there's at least the chance. It could take years. Centuries even. It may never happen...\nFaith is now PUSHING FURIOUSLY on the door.\nDUNCAN (cont'd)\nBut at least I can still carry the hope inside me. That's one blessing of immortality.
