Ali has a look that's all her own: short shorts,\r\n          white platform sandals, hair piled up high, more make-up than\r\n          the rest of Grundy's women combined. She's young -- 22 --\r\n          but has a confidence that's got nothing to do with age.\r\n\r\n                         REGULAR\r\n          No, that's your tip.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Huh.

I'm not working here for the\r\n          tips Loretta.\r\n          She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song.\r\n          She picks up the microphone and, after a few opening beats,\r\n          starts singing ETTA JAMES'S \"SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME\".\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n          OOOOOOOOOH, SOMETIMES I GET A GOOD\r\n\r\n          FEELING, Y-E-A-H\r\n          And now we see where the confidence comes from.

GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n           Ali's on the bus, in a seat by herself. A LITTLE GIRL in\r\n          front of her is peering over the chair, watching Ali. Ali\r\n          smiles at her. The Little Girl's mother notices, gets the\r\n          girl to sit down by tickling her.\r\n          Ali unzips the pocket on her suitcase, takes out the FRAMED\r\n          PHOTO of the mom and girl, looks at it. Then she looks out\r\n          the window and watches America fly by as DAY TURNS TO NIGHT.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CITY FREEWAY - DAY - THE BUS - SPEEDING BY\r\n\r\n          Over which we HEAR someone channel surfing radio static--\r\n\r\n          INT.

NEW MUSIC UP:\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. DAY - CARRY MUSIC\r\n\r\n          The rush of tourists and traffic. Through a sea of people\r\n          moving down the crowded sidewalk we FIND ALI as she emerges\r\n          through the crowd, carrying her bags. Looking around at this\r\n          exciting city. She SPOTS a SHITTY HOTEL with a sign: \"$49.00\r\n          a night.\" She looks up at it. Then heads across the street--\r\n\r\n          INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Cramped, dingy carpet, chipped paint. Key in the door. The\r\n          MIDDLE-EASTERN HOTEL MANAGER -- 40's -- leads Ali in,\r\n          pointing out the features of the room, speaking fast in an\r\n          impossibly thick Kurdish accent. Ali nods along, not\r\n          understanding a word. When he stops:\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Okay!\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          Well. Good luck with that.\r\n          He drops her suitcase on the bed and stands there. Waiting.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh, hang on.\r\n          She digs into her purse. All she has is twenties. She peels\r\n          one off and holds it out.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          If I could just get a little --\r\n          But before she can finish, he pockets it, nods and leaves,\r\n          closing the door behind him. To the closed door:\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          -- change.\r\n          She pulls open the blinds, they fall off the wall with a\r\n          CRASH! Ali stares at them. Then she opens the window. The\r\n          SOUNDS OF HOLLYWOOD pour in.\r\n          She digs out her cash, sticks it under the mattress. Then\r\n          she reconsiders.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          17.\r\n          She removes the money, takes a Ziploc bag full of make-up\r\n          from her purse, dumps the make-up onto the bed, seals the\r\n          money up in the Ziploc, and takes it into:\r\n          THE BATHROOM. She lifts the lid of the back toilet tank and\r\n          slips the Ziploc of cash under it, catching the bag in the\r\n          lid as she sets it back down, so it won't fall in.\r\n          She goes back into the main room to find a CALICO CAT sitting\r\n          on the window sill. It MEOWS, hops into the room.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey. I thought this was a single.\r\n          The cat curls up next to her. She checks his junk.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          Typical.

She refills the lid of the cup,\r\n          which the cat laps up.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          Singer/Actress... Singer/Songwriter\r\n          .Singer/Scuba diver?

She rounds a corner and sees:\r\n\r\n          A LONG LINE OF 165 GORGEOUS, IMPECCABLY GROOMED GIRLS.\r\n          Ali stops in her tracks. Tougher competition than she was\r\n          expecting. She heads for the back of the line, passing girls\r\n          doing vocal warm-ups. One girl is belting out a riveting\r\n          \"SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW\". Just as Ali gets in line, the\r\n          door opens and a SKINNY GUY sticks his head out.\r\n\r\n                         SKINNY GUY\r\n          Sorry, ladies, that's all the\r\n          applications we're taking today.\r\n          CLOSE ON: an ad: \"DANCERS WANTED.

As she leaves, a DRUNK GUY turns to A SEEDY GUY.\r\n\r\n                         DRUNK GUY\r\n          She'll be back.\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON: A FLYER, BEING SNATCHED OFF A BULLETIN BOARD:\r\n\r\n          \"BACKGROUND SINGERS FOR URBAN GROUP.\"\r\n\r\n          INT.

EDGE DANCE STUDIO - DAY\r\n\r\n           Ali, dressed like the girls at the video audition: hootchie,\r\n          street -- opens the door to find 30 CLASSICAL BUN-TOPPED\r\n           BALLERINAS stretching, warming up. A Degas painting. They\r\n          turn in unison and eye her. Again, not her crowd.\r\n\r\n          EXT. THE CAPITOL RECORDS BUILDING - HOLLYWOOD - DAY\r\n\r\n          Gleaming in the California sunshine. Ali stares up at the\r\n          glittering shrine to recording.

SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Ali wanders down the sidewalk chugging an iced latte. The\r\n          Strip hums with SLICK NIGHT LIFE. Expensive cars pull up to\r\n          valets. Hipsters swish past velvet ropes. Ali moves through\r\n          the throngs, alone, anonymous, invisible.\r\n          She passes a CONSTRUCTION SITE for a 15-STORY-TALL BUILDING,\r\n          all lit up, guys working at night. A BUS pulls out, spewing\r\n          exhaust. As the smoke clears, Ali sees, across the street:\r\n          A BEAUTIFUL, STATUESQUE GIRL standing on the landing of a\r\n          fire escape under a street lamp beside a NONDESCRIPT CLUB.\r\n          Ali catches glimpses of her as the Sunset traffic whizzes by:\r\n          full make-up, spangled burlesque costume, impossibly high\r\n          heels, awesome. This is Coco. Coco makes the dirty\r\n          streetlight look like a movie-quality Kleig. Everything about\r\n          her shimmers.\r\n          Intrigued, Ali looks for a break in the traffic and crosses\r\n          the street. As she nears the club, she hears a MAN'S VOICE:\r\n\r\n                         ALEXIS\r\n          Like I said, LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH!\r\n          ALEXIS, drag queen/door whore, also in full costume and make-\r\n          up, TOSSES a GUY out the front door onto the street, then\r\n          heads back inside--\r\n          Ali smiles to herself. Then turns back to look at COCO who\r\n          disappears inside a BACK DOOR as...NIKKI walks out. Lights a\r\n          ciggie. She has on full make-up. Lacquered lips. Lashes like\r\n          peacock feathers. She sees Ali staring.\r\n\r\n                         NIKKI\r\n          Didn't your Mama tell you it's not\r\n          polite to stare?\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Sorry, you're just -- so DAMN\r\n          beautiful.\r\n\r\n                         NIKKI\r\n\r\n                         (WARMING)\r\n          In that case, screw your Mama,\r\n          stare away.\r\n          Nikki strikes a pose, campy, showing Ali her best side. They\r\n          both laugh.\r\n\r\n                         AL I\r\n          No one would ever guess.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          20.\r\n\r\n                         NIKKI\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          That you're a dude.\r\n          Nikki's face turns to stone. Her eyes widen in horror. Ali\r\n          sees the mistake she made. She's mortified.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh, shit.\r\n\r\n                         NIKKI\r\n          \"Shit's\" right, you little half-wit\r\n\r\n                         TWAT--\r\n          Nikki is about to unleash when the stage door opens.\r\n\r\n                         SEAN\r\n          Bitch! You're on!\r\n          Sean grabs her and drags her inside. As he does, a STRAND OF\r\n          CRYSTAL BEADS comes off her costume, falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          I'm really sor--\r\n          The stage door slams shut. Ali picks up the strand of beads.\r\n          Holds them up in the light, watching them shimmer.\r\n          She goes to the front of club, where a smattering of L.A.\r\n          HIPSTERS enter. There's a GLASS DISPLAY CASE full of photos\r\n          of the acts. Ali looks at the pictures of the Girls in their\r\n          elaborate costumes and provocative poses.\r\n          She's unintentionally made her way to the front door. Black\r\n          curtains obscure her view inside. She peers in. HEARS cool\r\n          music emanating. The sounds of a nightclub. Intriguing. She\r\n          ventures inside...\r\n\r\n          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Ali MOVES down a DIMLY LIT HALLWAY. More beautiful photos of\r\n          women in elaborate costumes, drawings, sketches, paintings\r\n          clutter the walls. Ali follows the photos down the hallway.\r\n          MUFFLED SOUNDS penetrate the darkness: people talking over\r\n          each other, glasses clinking. 1930's Berlin style music.\r\n\r\n                         ALEXIS\r\n\r\n          I.D.?\r\n          Alexis sits on a stool, glaring down at her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          21.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          What is this place?

Alexis scans it --\r\n\r\n                         ALEXIS (CONT'D)\r\n          Twenty bucks.\r\n          Ali looks in her wallet. Sees one lone twenty inside. She\r\n          hands it to Alexis. He nods for her to go ahead. Ali\r\n          descends a staircase INTO THE CLUB...\r\n          .and is BOMBARDED by: colors, chaos, laughter, scandal --\r\n          all shimmering, as if someone dunked the place in glitter.\r\n          And over it all, an incredible mash-up of old music with a\r\n          contemporary beat tying it all together.\r\n          Ali ENTERS, rounds a pillar, staring out into the room as a\r\n          SPOTLIGHT finds the stage where half a dozen OSTRICH FANS\r\n\r\n                         PART REVEALING--\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n          Smoother than honey and twice as\r\n          sweet.

As Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a\r\n          tray for a DITSY WAITRESS. He slides the tray to her. She\r\n          doesn't notice.

BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Bumper Band plays as Ali makes her way back toward the\r\n          bar, dejected. Across the room, the Ditzy Waitress, holding\r\n          an empty tray, flirts with a table of YOUNG HIPSTER GUYS.\r\n          Ali sees ANOTHER TABLE OF CHIC CLUBSTERS trying to get the\r\n          waitress's attention. The Waitress ignores them.\r\n          Ali sees the trays on the end of the bar. She grabs one, goes\r\n          to the TABLE OF CLUBSTERS, clears their empties, takes their\r\n          order. She finds Jack at the bar, unloads the empties.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          One Dewar's neat, one shot of\r\n          Patron, and get this, tough-guy in\r\n          the hat?

I know every\r\n          number in the show.\r\n          Sean, eyes big as saucers, looks from Ali to Tess, then back\r\n\r\n                         AGAIN--\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n\r\n                         (DOUBTFUL)\r\n          You know every number.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Which one do you wanna see?\r\n          Tess looks at her in disbelief.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          I said, which one do you wanna see?\r\n          Ali just stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to\r\n          DAVE in the sound booth--\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          51.\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n          Tough Lover!\r\n          Tess plops down in a booth-- crosses her arms indignantly.\r\n          ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies herself, starts to\r\n          dance. Behind a beat to two. She's got the steps right, but\r\n          it isn't clicking. She's thinking too hard. No personality.\r\n          After a few measures, Tess has seen enough.\r\n\r\n                         TESS (CONT'D)\r\n          Okay then, next?\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Hang on.\r\n          (to Dave in the booth)\r\n          Start it again, please?\r\n          As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down\r\n          and shakes it loose.\r\n          Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage--\r\n\r\n                         NIKKI\r\n\r\n                         (TO GEORGIA)\r\n          What the hell's going on?\r\n\r\n                         COCO\r\n          Shhhh.\r\n          On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude.\r\n          Then she looks up at the booth again.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Anytime.\r\n          The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive.\r\n          She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but\r\n          she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her\r\n          before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She\r\n          misses a step or two, but who the hell cares?\r\n          On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced.\r\n          Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to\r\n          respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow.\r\n          At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms -\r\n          - unable to tear his eyes away.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          52.\r\n          As the SONG CLIMAXES, Ali finishes with an alluring toss of\r\n          her ass, then lands in a sexy layout on a chair, owning the\r\n          stage. The music ends. A stunned silence. The only sound\r\n          is Ali's heavy breathing.\r\n          Then Georgia jumps up, APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY.\r\n\r\n                         NIKKI\r\n          What are so you happy about, that's\r\n          your replacement.\r\n\r\n                         GEORGIA\r\n          Yeah, but she's really good.\r\n          Tess and Ali are in a stare down.\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n          I want so badly to say something\r\n          bitchy, but nothing's coming.\r\n\r\n                         SEAN\r\n          There's a first.\r\n          Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props.\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n          You were off the whole second half.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          So, I was spot on the first half?\r\n          Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco\r\n          and Georgia. Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP-- then\r\n          suddenly becomes overcome by nausea, covers her mouth and\r\n          RUNS to the bathroom to puke--\r\n          Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali.\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n          Oh, you're gonna be such a pain in\r\n          my ass.\r\n          Ali tries hard not to beam--\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Do I have the job, or not?\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n          You're not great.

She looks around. Feels like an fool.\r\n          She plunks down in a chair.

Ali\r\n          jumps in, seamless, as the guys on Bass and Drums join in.\r\n          Ali picks up the choreography. The girls fall in with her.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n          I WANT A TOUGH LOVER, YEAH, YEAH. I\r\n\r\n          NEED A TOUGH LOVER. WHOOO.

Hearing them, Jessie\r\n          and Anna join in as well. Ali takes off, holding nothing\r\n          back. The girls feed off her confidence, and soon all of\r\n          them are hitting the backs of their cabaret chairs, stomping\r\n          their feet to the music. The girls singing back-up.\r\n          In his seat, Marcus sits up a little straighter -- suddenly\r\n          paying more attention. Unable to take his eyes off Ali.\r\n          The BAND plays along. The BARTENDERS accompany them with\r\n          hand-claps. All except Jack, who's too spellbound to move.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n          WHEN HE KISSES ME I'LL GET A THRILL\r\n\r\n          AND WHEN HE DO THAT WIGGLE, I WON ' T\r\n\r\n          KEEP STILL ...\r\n          ON THE FLOOR, Nikki watches, aghast, as the crowd engages\r\n          like we've never seen them.\r\n\r\n                         ALI/GIRLS\r\n\r\n          I WANT A TOUGH LOVER, YEAH, YEAH.

UH-HA::!\r\n          The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE, knowing they caught a once-in-a-\r\n          lifetime performance. Marcus stands, clapping, whistling.\r\n          Ali basks in it, jubilant, rapturous. She glances to the\r\n          wings and sees Sean, clapping and jumping in place. Then she\r\n          sees Tess beside him, stone-faced.\r\n\r\n          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Girls exit the stage in a flurry, everyone congratulating\r\n          Ali -- a whirlwind of hugs, kisses.

BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n           Ali trots out from backstage, spots Jack behind the bar. She\r\n          heads over to him.

Sean looks at\r\n          Ali more closely. He brushes her hair out of her face. Then\r\n          he holds it off her shoulders and raises that gay eyebrow.\r\n          - INT. SALON - DAY - Ali sits in front of a mirror while Sean\r\n          gives the HAIRDRESSER very specific instructions.\r\n          - INT.

BURLESQUE LOUNGE - The Burlesque Girls dance on stage,\r\n          performing a high-energy tap dance, coupled with a European\r\n          slap-dance, with the slapping of each other's bodies and\r\n          faces integrated with tapping and music. It's very cabaret,\r\n          but modernized with contemporary STEPPING. CARRY MUSIC:\r\n          - INT. SALON - LATER - The HAIRDRESSER spins the chair\r\n          around. Ali's her hair is platinum blonde, with bangs and a\r\n          Louise Brooks bob that frames her face beautifully. Her\r\n          smoky eyes pop like never before. Ali studies herself:\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Where have I been all my life?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          71.\r\n\r\n          - INT.

Amazing. Like Helmut Newton meets Carnaby\r\n          St. circa 1965. As she begins this HIGH ENERGY SONG-- Jack is\r\n          looks up from the bar.

She sits at her mirror. The\r\n          girls stare at her, mouths agape. Ali picks up her mascara\r\n          wand, looks down the mirror at Nikki's reflection.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n\r\n                         (FAUX INNOCENT)\r\n          What's a fly-over state?\r\n          Ali takes a deft stroke of her wand over her lashes, then\r\n          bats them at Nikki. Nikki walks out. Coco smiles with\r\n          appreciation. Whistles long and low. The girls all laugh.\r\n\r\n          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Tess glad-hands guests, then spots Vince, waving at her. She\r\n          starts over, then sees Marcus in the booth with Vince. She\r\n          turns and walks the other way.

It's obscene, what he wants\r\n          to give us. At least hear him out.\r\n\r\n          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - TESS'S CLUTTERED OFFICE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Tess, at her desk, reads a contract. Marcus and Vince sit\r\n          across from her, watching.\r\n\r\n                         MARCUS\r\n          It's very simple. I buy you out\r\n          and pay you a million off the top.\r\n          (motions to Vince)\r\n          Five hundred grand each.\r\n          Tess looks up from the contract, squints at Marcus.\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n          Why do you want this club so badly?\r\n\r\n                         MARCUS\r\n          Best view on the Sunset Strip.\r\n\r\n                         VINCE\r\n          Do you know what you could do with\r\n          that money, Tess?\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n          Do you know what you can do with\r\n          that money, Vince?\r\n\r\n                         VINCE\r\n          Be reasonable. We're rolling\r\n          vendors ninety days out.\r\n\r\n                         MARCUS\r\n          The club's not even worth what you\r\n          paid for it. You've got a second\r\n          mortgage, you can't get a third.\r\n          Tess looks at Vince, betrayed.\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n          Did you also tell him about the\r\n          tattoo on my ass?\r\n\r\n                         VINCE\r\n          It's business, Tess.

Marcus\r\n          shoots Vince an angry look as they head downstairs.\r\n          IN THE STAIRWELL, Vince reassures Marcus:\r\n\r\n                         VINCE\r\n          Don't worry. The balloon payment's\r\n          due on the first. She doesn't have\r\n          the money. She has to sell.\r\n          IN TESS'S OFFICE, Tess stands in the doorway, having heard.\r\n          Then she walks back to her desk and sits, dejected. Head in\r\n          her hands. For the first time ever, looking worried and\r\n          defeated. Something she'd never show anyone. A beat. Then:\r\n\r\n                         SEAN\r\n          Well. We've had a pretty good run.\r\n          She looks up. Sean is in the doorway.\r\n\r\n                         SEAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Maybe it's time to just.. .hang it\r\n          up. Let it go. Call it a day.\r\n          Tess's eyes go steely with determination.\r\n\r\n                         TESS\r\n          No. You cannot say that to me. I\r\n          can eat these \"sky is falling\"\r\n          dipshits for breakfast, lunch, and\r\n          dinner, but not YOU. You cannot be\r\n          that person. I've scoured dirty\r\n          flea markets for costumes, stayed\r\n          up all night sewing till my fingers\r\n          bled, painted and repainted every\r\n          goddamn wall of this place myself.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          75.\r\n\r\n                         TESS (CONT'D)\r\n          I choreographed every step of every\r\n          number. I've played nursemaid,\r\n          sister, mother and shrink to every\r\n          girl who's ever danced here. I've\r\n          hocked every keepsake I've ever\r\n          owned to keep this place afloat.\r\n          Because this club is the last of\r\n          it's kind, and if it goes away, one\r\n          day there won't be anything like it-\r\n          - and THAT would be a tragedy. So\r\n          you cannot say that to me. Because\r\n          now someone's gotta believe in me,\r\n          Goddamnit. And I need that person\r\n          to be you. So don't you ever let me\r\n          hear you say that again. I will\r\n          never let this club go. Never.\r\n          Sean looks at her...a wry smile.\r\n\r\n                         SEAN\r\n          There she is. Thought I'd lost you\r\n          for a minute.\r\n          Tess just looks at him, and smiles. He grabs a boa, throws it\r\n          around his neck and exits. When he's gone, Tess's smile\r\n          fades.\r\n          IN THE CLUB, the place is empty. Jack is wiping down the bar\r\n          cleaning up. He starts stacking some chairs in the house\r\n          as..SEAN CROSSES the floor.\r\n\r\n                         SEAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Night, Jack.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Night.\r\n          Sean EXITS as Jack carries a stack of chairs to the side of\r\n          the room, sets them down near the piano. STOPS, grabs a chair\r\n          for himself and sits down. Begins to play an original song.\r\n          ACROSS THE ROOM, Ali ENTERS from backstage. Her dance bag\r\n          over her shoulder. She HEARS the piano, peers around a\r\n          column, SEES Jack playing. She stays in the shadows and\r\n          watches as he sings and plays a beautiful song. (TBD)\r\n          The song ends. Ali applauds slowly. Impressed. Jack looks up,\r\n          surprised that she is there.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Beautiful. You write that?\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Just some sentimental crap.

Nods. He crosses to her. Grabs her\r\n          dance bag and they EXIT together.\r\n\r\n          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Jack enters, unloading his keyboard from his back. He hears\r\n          Ali in the bedroom. He quietly moves over to the ajar\r\n          bedroom door -- peeks in and sees:\r\n          ALI, in bra and undies. She hums the song he played the night\r\n          before in the mirror as she gets dressed.\r\n          ON JACK, watching, mesmerized. His eyes travel her body.\r\n          She moves out of view. He leans against the wall to try to\r\n          keep seeing her -- and steps on the CAT. It MEOWS. He\r\n          flattens against the wall. Ali looks up.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Jack?\r\n          Jack zips back to the door, opens it quietly, then SLAMS it.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Hey! Just got home!\r\n          Ali grabs a dress from her bed, slips into it.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          In here! Can you zip me up?\r\n          In a nanosecond-- Jack enters the bedroom.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey. Where you been?\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Rehearsing. I'm playing a late\r\n          show tonight.\r\n          As he zips up the back of her dress, he sees the PHOTO\r\n          propped against the lamp on the bedside table.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Who is that?\r\n          She picks up the picture. Looks at it.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Me and my mom on my 7th birthday.\r\n          She died just a few weeks later.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          77.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          She was so young.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          24. There was so much she never\r\n          got to do. Sometimes I feel like,\r\n          if I make the most of my life, part\r\n          of her will get to live a little\r\n          more, too.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Wow. You must miss her.\r\n          She puts the photo down. Turns back to him. They're close.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Every single day, something happens\r\n          I want to tell her about.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          What was today's?\r\n          A beat. Their eyes connect.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Don't know. Hasn't happened yet.\r\n          They stand there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of\r\n          hair caught in the earring. He pulls it away, freeing it.\r\n          His fingers move through her hair. She closes her eyes,\r\n          feeling his fingers against her neck.\r\n          Then she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable\r\n          to look away. Until:\r\n          His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from\r\n          his pocket. Checks who's calling. Looks back at Ali.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          I should... it's... Natalie.\r\n          Ali steps away from him, disappointed. He answers the phone.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey, babe, how are you?\r\n          Ali watches him walk away from her, falling into the\r\n          conversation with Natalie.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Yes, she's still here-What do you\r\n          want me to do, it's not like you're\r\n          here helping out, you know...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          78.\r\n          Ali grabs her bag and jacket, heads for the door.\r\n          MUSIC UP: An incredibly sexy saxophone which takes us to:\r\n          FULL CLOSE UP: ALI steps into frame, starts singing.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n\r\n          A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME...\r\n          PULL BACK to reveal she's on stage at the club with the\r\n          BURLESQUE GIRLS.

He\r\n          looks at Ali. Watching her. Without looking up, she takes a\r\n          pencil, gathers her hair, and puts it up expertly. A few\r\n          strands fall back onto her neck. Sexy. Ali feels his stare.\r\n          Looks up at him. Smiles. He smiles back. She goes back to her\r\n          magazine. ON JACK. Loving that she's there.\r\n          - INT.

Break a\r\n          leg baby.\r\n          Jack hangs up with finality and marches toward the bar-- His\r\n          cell phone immediately rings again.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         101\r\n          He sees it's Natalie, sends it to voicemail, and shuts off\r\n          his phone. As he PASSES Sean and Coco--\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          I guess Natalie's not coming after\r\n          all.\r\n\r\n                         SEAN\r\n          Oh, please, that girl? Show up at\r\n          a party where she's not the center\r\n          of attention?\r\n          AT THE BAR - LATER - Jack drains one drink and orders\r\n          another, getting very drunk. Ali sidles up to the bar.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n\r\n                         (TO BARTENDER)\r\n          Shot of Patron.\r\n          Jack raises his brow. Ali drinks the shot, and without\r\n          looking at him--\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          Lookin' kinda lonely.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n\r\n                         (BOOZEY)\r\n          No. Not lonely. Liberated, yes.\r\n          Libated, absolutely. But never\r\n          lonely. Cheers, baby--\r\n          He raises his glass-- she rolls her eyes, walks off-- he\r\n          follows her, playfully PUSHING her from behind.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Hey-- what're we, in junior high?\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          You still mad at me, Iowa? C'mon.\r\n          Bring it on.\r\n          She starts to say something as-- THE SHIRELLES start to sing\r\n          \"BABY IT'S YOU\"-- Jack turns to the DJ, points both fingers\r\n          at him and YELLS:\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n          I LOVE THIS SONG, MAN!!!\r\n          Everyone stares at the drunk guy. Ali rolls her eyes and\r\n          walks off-- Jack swings her around, PULLING her close-- she\r\n          just looks at him. Starts to laugh at how drunk he is-- Jack\r\n          wraps her in his arms and starts to sing quietly in her ear.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          102.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          .Many many many nights go by, I\r\n          sit alone, at home and cry, over\r\n          you...\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Well, you're quite the crooner.\r\n          He looks her in the eye.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          I'm sorry for being a class A\r\n          prick.\r\n           Ali smiles, surprised at his candor.

She\r\n          laughs.\r\n          AT THE BAR, tipsy Sean and Coco stand side-by-side. Coco is\r\n          watching the DJ spin. The DJ glances down at them.\r\n\r\n                         COCO\r\n          That DJ's hot.\r\n\r\n                         SEAN\r\n          You think?\r\n\r\n                         COCO\r\n          He keeps looking at me.\r\n          Coco smiles up at him, flirty.

JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Jack and Ali stumble in, Jack knocks the lamp over trying to\r\n          turn on the light. It BREAKS. Ali giggles as she plops down\r\n          on the couch, struggling to take off her leather boot. No\r\n          luck. She holds her legs out.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Help me.\r\n          Jack gets the lamp to standing, then grabs one of Ali's\r\n          boots, slides it off, dumps it. Then he tries the second --\r\n          it sticks -- he pulls harder -- the boot pops off and he\r\n          careens backwards, crashing into the lamp, knocking it over\r\n          again. Ali cracks up. He turns to the lamp.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          (like to a dog)\r\n          Stay.\r\n          He turns back to Ali, regains composure, bows\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Good night.\r\n          He backs away, into the bedroom.

Okay.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Good night.\r\n          Jack disappears into the bedroom and closes the door. Ali\r\n          stares at it, surprised. Then resigned. Oh, well. She\r\n          undoes her bra, threads it through her top and out the arms.\r\n          Then Jack's door opens. He stands in the doorway in matching\r\n          \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" pajamas, leaning against the\r\n          doorframe like Hugh Hefner in his finest silk smoking jacket.\r\n\r\n                         ALI (CONT'D)\r\n          Cute jammies.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          A gift from my mother.

The door flies\r\n          open again -- Jack's there in just the pants, no top.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Water. No hangover.\r\n          He stumbles past Ali to the kitchen, drinks from the tap.\r\n          After a moment he returns to the bedroom, nodding to Ali.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Night.\r\n          Ali just nods. He closes the door. Ali smiles, waiting.\r\n          After a beat, the door opens again. Jack is there, in boxers.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Hungry.\r\n          He walks past her to the kitchen, opens a box of cereal,\r\n          pours it into his mouth. Grabs some milk from the fridge,\r\n          pours it into his mouth, too. Returns to the bedroom,\r\n          crunching. He closes the door. Then -- very quickly -- he\r\n          opens it again and walks out.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          I know I forgot something else, but\r\n          I just can't remember what...\r\n\r\n                         (TO HIMSELF)\r\n          Door locked, water, food...\r\n          He wanders out into the room, past Ali, and we see from\r\n          behind he is butt-ass naked. She cracks up.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          What's so funny?\r\n          She covers her face.

It's the first gate beyond Security. Ali sees\r\n          Jack, in line, about to board the plane. He's wearing his\r\n          iPod headset, deaf to the world.\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n\r\n          JACK! JACK!

The woman taps Jack and points. He looks to see:\r\n           ALI, on the other side of Security. Jack takes his earphones\r\n           off and smiles. He crosses over to her, carrying his bag.\r\n          They are separated by several feet of security ropes.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          What are you doing here?\r\n\r\n                         ALI\r\n          Sean told me you're going to New\r\n          York.

Ali\r\n          watches him go.\r\n          ON JACK, walking back to the gate-then -- he stops. Turns\r\n          back to see Ali, but she's gone.\r\n\r\n          FEMALE SECURITY GUARD\r\n          Boy, you get out there and kiss\r\n          that girl!

Bag stays here.\r\n          Jack drops his bag, takes a running JUMP over the ROPES and\r\n          RUNS through the crowded concourse -- startling everyone.\r\n          ON ALI, as she walks through the concourse, reliving her last\r\n          sight of Jack.

Their eyes meet.\r\n          Then Nikki nods. And Ali nods back. For the first time, a\r\n          mutual respect.\r\n          All the other girls begin to pour into the dressing room.\r\n          Chatting, gossiping, changing their clothes.

MUSIC UP: A heavy\r\n          bass drumlin beat which takes us to...\r\n\r\n          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC\r\n\r\n          A SPOTLIGHT. MOVING down the smoke-filled shaft of light as--\r\n          A FIGURE RISES into view at the back of the stage. Over the\r\n          contemporary BEAT, we HEAR a beautiful classic opera\r\n          (Carmen?) REVEAL...it's NIKKI! She sings a line or two in an\r\n          amazing operatic voice that totally blows us away. Then ...a\r\n          DANCE BEAT KICKS IN as COCO comes into view, and sings\r\n          another line. Then Jessie. Then Scarlett. And FINALLY...\r\n          Ali RISES into view, wearing a diamond studded Gaultier-type\r\n          harness top and sequined hot-pants. This song (to be written)\r\n          is a contemporary dance song about BURLESQUE with a vintage\r\n          feel to it. Nikki and the Burlesque Girls, in similar\r\n          costumes, back Ali as she SINGS her big finale. CAMERA MOVES\r\n          through the packed house as we SEE Georgia, Sean, Mark (the\r\n          DJ) and Tess, who double-takes at MR.

The entire company,\r\n          band and bartenders join in an all out BOLLYWOOD FINALE.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          135.\r\n          CAMERA MOVES INTO THE CLUB as music CROSSFADES with the\r\n          SOUNDS of people TALKING. Glasses CLINKING. All the\r\n          background sounds of a busy nightclub. A LOUD DRUM ROLL takes\r\n          us to...\r\n          A LOW CAMERA moving across a black stage as we MOVE IN ON the\r\n          footlights which become a MILLION BRILLIANT LIGHTS blasting\r\n          into camera, blinding us until they form letters reading:\r\n\r\n                                     BURLESQUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nBurlesque\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Steven Antin\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Musical\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:21:56.999308"}
