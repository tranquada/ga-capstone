Fourth down on the Georgia \n                         Tech 18. 4 ticks left.

The ball is snapped, \n               and we go to SLOW MOTION as the lines crash together in the \n               slop.\n\n               Joe rolls to the right, looking downfield. A huge DEFENSIVE \n               END bears down on him. Joe jukes. The end whips on by, \n               grabbing for jersey, slipping off. But big NUMBER 75 is \n               closing the gap. On the run, Joe releases a desperation pass \n               toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him \n               face-down in the swamp.\n\n               We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain. RAY \n               GRIFFEN, black running back, glances back for it, two \n               DEFENSIVE BACKS with him. All three leap in unison, climbing \n               as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. The \n               ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes \n               to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. Incomplete. \n               The BANG of the final gun snaps us back to LIVE ACTION.\n\n               Joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then \n               drops his head in defeat.\n\n               ANGLE ON SAM WINTERS\n\n               Betraying little emotion, Coach SAM WINTERS, wiry, intense, \n               early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across \n               the field.\n\n                                     REPORTER #1 (V.O.)\n                         Coach, this is the second year in a \n                         row you've failed to go to a bowl \n                         game.

We'll be back in a major bowl \n                         next year.\n\n               Elsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud-\n               splattered Joe Kane taking off his pads in front of his \n               locker. ALVIN MACK, black linebacker, comes by. Alvin exudes \n               danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly, \n               a sense of repressed anger off it.\n\n                                     ALVIN\n                         Good throw, Joe.

CHANCELLOR WILSON'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               CHANCELLOR GRANT WILSON, 60, grey-haired eminence, sits behind \n               his desk. Seated across from him are Coach Winters and GALEN \n               HOWARD, 50, the Athletic Director.\n\n                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON\n                         I'm concerned about our Program. \n                         It's always been a source of pride \n                         to our students and alumni, but two \n                         straight so-so seasons are having a \n                         damaging effect on our fund-raising, \n                         both public and private.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                              (half-joking)\n                         Then stop raising the entrance \n                         requirements on me. We never could \n                         have gotten Alvin Mack in here under \n                         the new guidelines.\n\n                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON\n                         As Chancellor, my first responsibility \n                         is to the academic interests of this \n                         University.\n\n               Wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed \n               to the wall. A football rests on the 40 yard line, which is \n               marked 160 million. The end zone (60 yards away) is \n               $400,000,000.\n\n                                     WILSON\n                         At a time when we're committed to a \n                         400 million dollar building program, \n                         alumni donations are down 15% the \n                         last two years. Because they've also \n                         voiced their displeasure to their \n                         legislators, we can expect a \n                         corresponding drop in state funds.\n\n                                     HOWARD\n                         The Athletic Fund is suffering too. \n                         Season tickets sales are off, \n                         merchandising's slow...\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         You layin' all this at my door? \n                         There's been a recession on.\n\n                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON\n                         Yes, but the heaviest drop has been \n                         from the big donors, the 100,000 \n                         dollar club. These people are \n                         recession proof. They sit in my box \n                         every game, and they're much more \n                         generous when we're ranked and going \n                         to bowl games. Two of them, as you \n                         know, are on the Board of Regents, \n                         including the Chairman.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         What are you trying to say to me, \n                         Grant? After 12 years, my job's in \n                         jeopardy?\n\n                                     CHANCELLOR WILSON\n                         I'm not prepared to discuss your job \n                         right now; I just want you to be \n                         aware of the situation. The alumni \n                         and the legislature are unhappy and \n                         they vote with their checkbooks. I \n                         don't pretend to be an expert on \n                         football, Sam, and I'll deny that \n                         this conversation ever took place, \n                         but I do know we need to win next \n                         year.\n\n               INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Coach Winters flanked by two assistant coaches, HUMES and \n               CLAYTON, walks down a cavernous tunnel beneath the stands to \n               a waiting car. At the end of the tunnel, a scarecrow EFFIGY \n               of Coach Winters hangs from an overhead pipe.\n\n                                     CLAYTON\n                              (ignoring the effigy)\n                         Tickets are in your coat.

Michigan's been down to see \n                         him twice.\n\n               INT. ST. LUKE'S HOME FOR BOYS - MORNING\n\n               Winters, Humes, Clayton and Joe Kane sit across from DARNELL \n               JEFFERSON and REVEREND WALLACE in a tattered parlor room. \n               Other boys of various ages and color look in from the \n               adjoining door. Darnell is black, good-looking, street-hip, \n               the letters D.J. shaved in block letters into his fade.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         Darnell, you have the potential to \n                         start for us as a freshman. That 108 \n                         yard kickoff return you made against \n                         Taft? One of the greatest runs I've \n                         ever seen a high school player make. \n                         Now, Michigan is set at tailback for \n                         two years. You won't play till you're \n                         a junior. With Joe here gettin' you \n                         the ball, runnin' 28 Thunder right, \n                         you'll be All-American with us as a \n                         Sophomore.\n\n                                     REVEREND WALLACE\n                         Yes, but I'm really more concerned \n                         with Darnell's education. He came \n                         here late. He's got some catching up \n                         to do.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         Believe me, education is the first \n                         priority in our program. That's why \n                         all the players are smarter than me. \n                         After all, a football coach is smart \n                         enough to understand the game, but \n                         dumb enough to think it's important.\n\n               This gets a little chuckle from the Reverend. It was intended \n               to.\n\n               EXT.

His FATHER, a grizzled man in his fifties, nods \n               in and out in a tattered armchair. All three have been \n               drinking beer, their empties scattered around.

She's even more attractive \n               than Darnell thought she'd be.\n\n               She takes Darnell's hand and leads him out onto the field \n               where he's greeted by the E.S.U.

The CHEERLEADERS whip into action, legs kicking, \n               pom-poms whirling.\n\n               The band parts and Darnell walks out into the 90,000 seat \n               stadium, an awesome sight for any young man.

She hesitates, not sure about \n               this, then comes forward, kisses him on the lips, starts to \n               let it deepen, then breaks it off.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         Good night.\n\n               As he watches her go up the steps, we go to:\n\n               EXT.

Joe, a little drunker than the \n               others, starts HOWLING at the moon like a Timber Wolf.

The draft-\n               wake of a passing truck almost blows him over.\n\n                                     BUD\n                         C'mon, Joe, that's enough.

Shit.\n\n               Bud can't fight it. He lies down on the line, his head \n               touching Joe's feet. Joe begins to HOWL again. Bud joins in. \n               Alvin and the others can't believe it.\n\n                                     ALVIN\n                         Startin' to look like a loaf of Wonder \n                         bread out there.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         They're makin' us look like pussies, \n                         ya know.

Time to ante \n               up. Both turn to Alvin.\n\n                                     ALVIN\n                         What are you lookin' at? You think \n                         you're bad?\n\n               Alvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop. \n               Bobby and Lattimer smile, go to follow. Louanne grabs Bobby, \n               holds him back.\n\n                                     LOUANNE\n                              (vaguely sexual)\n                         Bobby, be careful, o.k? Please, be \n                         careful.\n\n               Bobby smiles, grabs her ass, pulls her to him, gives her a \n               long, passionate kiss, then sprints out to the white line, \n               leaving her breathless.\n\n               Alvin, Bobby and Lattimer lie down in front of Bud. Now \n               there's a line of five, a human highway median. Everybody \n               scared shitless, howling their lungs out.\n\n               Louanne and Darnell watch from the side of the road.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         This guy do this kinda shit a lot? \n                         They never mentioned this in \n                         recruiting.\n\n               Finally, Joe laughing wildly, jumps up and they all scramble \n               back to safety. Out of breath, but pumped up, they exchange \n               exhilarated high fives. Alvin just shakes his head.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING\n\n               Twenty freshman football players, including Darnell, are \n               scattered at tables around the room, writing furiously in \n               test booklets, as a PROCTOR paces the room. Darnell starts \n               to write an answer, stops, stumped. Worried, he looks at the \n               clock, goes on to the next page.\n\n               EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING\n\n               Darnell and Joe walk across campus. Darnell carries a \n               gleaming, chromed TROPHY with a football player on top.

KELLER CENTER - DAY\n\n               The football meeting room. A quarter amphitheatre. The \n               Freshman, including Darnell, down in front. Nervous, talking \n               very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former E.S.U. \n               greats arranged on the Wall of Honor.\n\n               Behind them, the Upperclassmen, bantering, conversation \n               punctuated with laughter.\n\n               A door opens. The Assistant Coaches file in. The room hushes \n               immediately. Coach Winters walks in.

In life, people \n                         are always wondering how they measure \n                         up; whether they're getting ahead or \n                         fallin' behind. In football, you \n                         know.

He sweeps right, cuts \n               it up, blows past the end. In a spectacular display of broken \n               field running, Darnell breaks to the sideline, cuts back, \n               eluding the corner back, and stiffarms the safety. Alvin, \n               pursuing the play, finally tackles him from behind, stripping \n               the ball at the same time. There's a wild scramble for the \n               fumble. Darnell is crushed under the pile, as the defense \n               recovers it, ruining an otherwise brilliant run.\n\n               The players unpile to reveal Darnell, writhing on the ground, \n               the wind knocked out of him.

Coach \n               Winters actually smashed a replica. A smile appears on \n               Darnell's tired face.\n\n               INT.

All the players wearing \n               baseball caps, quickly doff them.

Joe pops a Nap and \n               looks across to the weight room where a stunning co-ed CAMILLE \n               SCHAEFFER works a knee lift. Camille's the perfect marriage \n               of Southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation.

Camille hitting \n               a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return. \n               Camille crushing another forehand. Joe crushes it back, sends \n               it over the fence and into the parking lot. Camille serving \n               again at match point. Joe pops up a weak return. Camille \n               puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost \n               knocking Joe down. He flings his racket against the fence. \n               Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         Thanks for the game, Heisman.

ACADEMIC ADVISOR'S OFFICE - MORNING\n\n               Darnell sits across from WILLIAM SMITH, Academic Advisor.\n\n                                     ADVISOR SMITH\n                         Darnell, I've reviewed your placement \n                         test and I'm afraid you failed to \n                         meet our entrance requirements in \n                         two areas.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         What does that mean? I can't play \n                         football?\n\n                                     ADVISOR SMITH\n                         No. It means you're going to have to \n                         take some remedial classes, what we \n                         call \"zero level\" courses. \n                         Specifically Math 0 and English 0.\n\n               Darnell is clearly deflated by this painful indication of \n               his academic standing.\n\n                                     ADVISOR SMITH\n                         You won't get college credit for \n                         them, but they will help you prepare \n                         to take the Placement Test again at \n                         the end of the quarter. If you pass \n                         at that time you'll be able to \n                         officially enter the university and \n                         take college level courses. You'll \n                         still be able to take an American \n                         History survey course, but it won't \n                         count on your record until you pass \n                         the Placement Test. But first things \n                         first. To start, I'm approving a \n                         tutor for you.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         A tutor? I don't need no tutor.\n\n                                     ADVISOR SMITH\n                         Any tutor. And yes you do.\n\n               INT. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\n               A meeting of the football brain trust; Coach Winters, Athletic \n               Director, GALEN HOWARD, a publicist, SHARON BRAVER, and the \n               Sports Information Director (S.I.D.) LARRY NICHOLS. Also \n               present is Joe Kane, somewhat discomfited at being the center \n               of all this attention.\n\n                                     HOWARD\n                         I think both Joe and the university \n                         are best served by a straightforward \n                         Heisman campaign. Nothing too \n                         gimmicky.\n\n                                     BRAVER\n                         We've compiled a mailing list of \n                         around 1300 opinion makers; \n                         newspapers, football writers, and \n                         sports anchors. First we send them a \n                         packet on Joe and his achievements. \n                         Bio, stats, plus human interest stuff; \n                         commitment to academics, charity \n                         work, etc. Then we update it each \n                         week with a postcard. Heisman voters \n                         hate opening envelopes.\n\n               Joe is increasingly uneasy with all this.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         I haven't really done any charity \n                         work...\n\n                                     BRAVER\n                         You're gonna start. We've got some \n                         things lined up.\n\n                                     NICHOLS\n                         Unfortunately, because we weren't in \n                         the top 20 last year, we only have \n                         one network T.V. game to give Joe \n                         national exposure. Although it's a \n                         good one; Michigan. But we'll also \n                         be taping all our other games and \n                         buying satellite time. That way we \n                         can produce our own highlight package \n                         and interview pieces and send them \n                         out to T.V. stations all over the \n                         country for their sportscasts.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         Any questions, Joe?\n\n               If Joe was uneasy before, he's overwhelmed now. He tries not \n               to show it. After all, who could turn down a Heisman campaign? \n               Still it's a megaton of pressure.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         Ah, no... I just... you really think \n                         I got a shot to win this?\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         Hell, yes. Plus it's a good thing \n                         for the program. Publicizes the \n                         school, gives a boost to recruiting, \n                         and it's a great thing for you. Jumps \n                         up your draft position, the size of \n                         your first contract, everything. \n                         It's a hell of an opportunity.\n\n                                     NICHOLS\n                         All you gotta do is back it up on \n                         the field, and we have no doubts \n                         about that, cause we know \"Kane is \n                         Able.\"\n\n               Nichols holds up a black CAMPAIGN BUTTON with the phrase \n               \"Kane is Able\" enblazoned on it in gold letters. This gets a \n               rise out of everyone except Joe, who's still not sure about \n               all this.\n\n               INT. JOE KANE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\n               Joe lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to \n               get to sleep.\n\n               INT. CAMILLE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\n               The phone rings. Camille, who's been asleep, rolls over and \n               answers it.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         Hello...\n\n               ON JOE\n\n                                     JOE\n                         This is Joe Kane. What did you decide?\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                              (still drowsy)\n                         What?\n                              (looking at the clock)\n                         It's 3:00 in the morning.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         I wanta know what you decided.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         I don't know... I couldn't think of \n                         any other sports I could beat you \n                         at.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         Then I'll pick you up tonight at \n                         6:00.\n\n               He hangs up.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         What?\n\n               INT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY\n\n               Autumn sits at a tutorial table, looking at her notes. She \n               becomes aware of someone approaching. She looks up to see \n               Darnell.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Hey, Autumn.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         Hi, Darnell. What are you doin here?\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         My advisor says I need a tutor. Ya \n                         know, just to get me over a couple \n                         rough spots.\n                              (showing her a paper)\n                         I saw your name on this list. I \n                         figured if you couldn't keep my \n                         attention, nobody could.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         I'm sorry, Darnell, but I've already \n                         been assigned. You're gonna have to \n                         find somebody else. I'm tutoring \n                         Scott Sherman.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters \n                         to switch us.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         Coach Winters wouldn't do that.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Yeh he would. I'm a bigger prospect \n                         than Sherman.\n                              (pointing across the \n                              way)\n                         He's a lineman on the scout team.\n\n               Autumn looks back to where Darnell is pointing. Sure enough, \n               SCOTT SHERMAN is hard at work with another Tutor. Autumn \n               can't believe it. She tries to compose herself.\n\n               Darnell sits down across the table from her.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         C'mon Autumn, you could teach me \n                         some real erudition.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                              (trying to whisper, \n                              pissed)\n                         Will you stop using those big words. \n                         It sounds ridiculous.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                              (serious about this)\n                         What doya mean? I'm improvin' myself. \n                         I learn a new word out of the \n                         dictionary every day. Mendacious, \n                         pejorative, antithetical, \n                         commensurate...\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         And you don't ever use them right. \n                         Pretending to be smart is not the \n                         same as being educated. Or erudite. \n                         It's just a con. And it makes you \n                         sound stupid, no matter how big a \n                         prospect you are.\n\n               Darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality. His \n               customary bravado melts away.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         O.K... even more reason for you to \n                         be my tutor. You already taught me \n                         something.\n\n               Autumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal. \n               She would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having \n               trouble being angry about it.\n\n               ALVIN MACK\n\n               At another table, looking distracted and bored as his TUTOR \n               reads his history assignment to him. Alvin takes out a walkman \n               and puts the headphones on. WE HEAR A HORN BEEP.\n\n               EXT. CAMILLE'S DORM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Camille comes out the front door, summoned by the horn. She \n               stops at the sight of something. We REVERSE TO REVEAL Joe on \n               his Harley.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         We goin' on that?\n\n                                     JOE\n                         Yeh. I thought we might take a ride.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         I promised my dad I'd never get on \n                         one of those.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         What are you, one of these trust-\n                         fund princesses? It's fine for me to \n                         play a game I don't know, but I ask \n                         you to try somethin' different and \n                         you hide behind your daddy.\n\n               He holds out a motorcycle helmet toward her, daring her. She \n               burns, but her competitiveness makes it impossible for her \n               to decline this challenge.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                              (snatching the helmet)\n                         All right. But we go slow. No cowboy \n                         stuff.\n\n               Joe smiles and kicks the starter. Camille climbs on and they \n               roar off.\n\n               EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Just outside town. Joe and Camille come down the highway at \n               moderate speed. Camille's hanging on for dear life, but we \n               can tell she's enjoying it.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         This speed, o.k.?\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         Yeh, fine.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         Good.\n\n               Joe immediately accelerates, throwing Camille's head back. \n               Her SHRIEK is lost in the whine of the engine, as they speed \n               away from camera.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         Slow down, damnit. Joe... Joe!\n\n               They approach a high-banked turn, beyond which appears to be \n               a long, sheer dropoff. Joe looks back at Camille, smiles \n               devilishly, not looking where he's going. Camille sees they're \n               heading straight for the edge.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                              (freaked)\n                         Joe, look out!!!\n\n               Too late. Joe brakes, fishtails, but goes over the top of \n               the bank, off the edge, flying out into oblivion, Camille \n               screaming.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               ANGLE ON HARLEY\n\n               As it plops down onto a wide LEDGE not visible from the road, \n               three feet below the top of the bank. Joe lands it, skids to \n               a professional stop, breaks into raucous laughter. Camille \n               jumps off the bike, scared stiff and livid with anger.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         How could you do that, you stupid \n                         punk?

I've done that a hundred \n                         times. No big deal.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         Oh, yeh?

And the scream was \n                         even better than I thought it'd be. \n                         Every dog within hearing distance \n                         wants to mate with you now.\n\n               Camille's ready to throttle him, then something catches her \n               ear. Sure enough, there are SEVERAL DOGS BARKING in the \n               distance. Joe smiles at her. She looks away, still angry, \n               but amused in spite of herself.\n\n               INT. ROADSIDE BAR - NIGHT\n\n               Working class, sawdust floor, George Thoroughgood's \"Who Do \n               You Love\" on the jukebox.

JOE'S ROOM - EVENING\n\n               Joe watches Bud Lite, Darnell, Alvin and Lattimer file in \n               and unveil a life-size CARDBOARD STAND-UP of Joe's Sports \n               Illustrated cover pose. They whoop it up, as Joe tries to \n               muster some enthusiasm.\n\n               INT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Autumn's pointing out a figure on a graph in Darnell's math \n               book. As she explains, Darnell leans close to kiss her. Autumn \n               quickly leans away, glances around to see if anyone saw \n               Darnell's attempt. Darnell laughs.\n\n               INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY\n\n               A group of football players sits in the back of the class. \n               As the HISTORY PROFESSOR lectures at the board, Darnell \n               furiously takes notes. Scott Sherman, seizing the opportunity, \n               leans forward from the desk behind him and pokes the football \n               out of Darnell's left hand. Darnell, Scott and two other \n               FRESHMAN FOOTBALL PLAYERS spring out of their seats, \n               scrambling after the loose ball. The prof and the other \n               students watch appalled as Darnell and the others dive under \n               chairs and overturn desks in pursuit of the elusive ball. \n               Finally, Darnell, winded and disheveled, comes up with it. \n               He and the others quickly return to their seats. The prof \n               looks at Darnell aghast.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Sorry... I lost my football.\n\n               INT. RAQUETBALL COURT - DAY\n\n               Joe and Camille are locked up in a furious game of raquetball. \n               Joe makes a wicked kill shot on the last point, and pumps a \n               fist in triumph. Camille, pissed at losing, throws her racket \n               and stomps around.\n\n               EXT. CAMPUS - DAY\n\n               Darnell and Autumn are having a daytime tutoring session on \n               a secluded patch of lawn. Darnell holds his football. As he \n               begins to read aloud from East of Eden, Autumn pokes the \n               ball out of his hand. They both scramble for it, Darnell \n               winding up slightly on top of her. They eye each other a \n               beat. Darnell bends down to kiss her. She lets herself kiss \n               him for a second, then gets up and starts to collect her \n               books.\n\n               INT. ATHLETIC CENTER - DAY\n\n               Several of the players are gathered around a bulletin board \n               in the hall. The starting lineup for the first game has been \n               posted. Darnell traces his finger from the designation \n               TAILBACK over to the name RAY GRIFFEN. He drops his eyes, \n               obviously disappointed.\n\n               Lattimer, meanwhile, is checking the defensive board. He \n               finds his name posted as a starting defensive end. Punching \n               the air, he dashes out of the building.\n\n                                     LATTIMER\n                         Yes!! Starting defense. Place at the \n                         table. Whooo!! Yes!!\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n               Lattimer, in his euphoria, races out into the lot, and begins \n               head-butting car windows. He breaks out three in a row, and \n               yells in triumph, his forehead dripping blood.\n\n               Winters, walking with the TEAM TRAINER, has seen this from \n               across the street. He knows there's something dark at work \n               here.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         N.C.A.A. is gonna test half the team \n                         before the game Saturday.

FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The chairs are arranged in several circles, ten players to a \n               circle, like a bunch of formalized huddles. Coach Winters \n               addresses the assembly.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         As the veteran players know, we have \n                         Pride Night every year before our \n                         opening game. It's a chance to get \n                         to know each other better, share \n                         some thoughts, and bring us closer \n                         together as a team. So to start off, \n                         I'd like each player to tell the \n                         others in his group what he likes \n                         best about football and then what \n                         he's most proud of off the field. \n                         I've asked some of the seniors to \n                         lead it off.

An NCAA OFFICIAL gives Lattimer a little \n               test tube to urinate in for his drug test. Lattimer goes \n               into one of the restroom stalls, reaches around to the back \n               of the tank, where a VIAL OF CLEAN URINE is taped. He pours \n               it in the test vial.\n\n                                     LATTIMER (V.O.)\n                         Havin' a chance to be somebody. To \n                         do somethin' that people look up to \n                         you for. Your strength and your \n                         courage.

They chuck each other's pads, then Lattimer opens his \n               mouth. Alvin spits into it. Then Lattimer spits into Alvin's. \n               Darnell can't believe this shit.\n\n                                     ALVIN (V.O.)\n                         You know it's killin' him, but you \n                         feel great.

The quarterback pitches to the tailback \n               as Alvin charges into the hole, screaming at the top of his \n               lungs. The tailback, eyes wide with fear, cuts back, away \n               from Alvin, where he's promptly crunched by Lattimer.

Bud Lite and \n               the Big Tackle fire out. Bud drives a forearm into the stomach \n               of the Black Tackle, doubling him over. The Black Tackle \n               comes back, slamming a forearm up under Bud's chin, snapping \n               his neck back.\n\n               Joe, meanwhile, fades to pass, pump fakes, steps up. Bud \n               Lite, chicken fighting the Black Tackle, sticks his fingers \n               in the Tackle's eyes, then cut-blocks him to the ground. The \n               Tackle falls on Bud, and smashes a fist into his ribs.

They bring him down, \n               but Darnell doesn't fumble. He gets up, still clutching the \n               ball, and starts back to the huddle with it.

She doesn't need this \n               complication, this conflict, but she can't say no.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         God, why am I even considering this?\n\n               The song ends.

Darnell shrugs them off \n               and leaves the party.\n\n                                     JOE\n                              (to Bud Lite)\n                         Just what we need, a little team \n                         unity.\n\n               Ray takes Autumn's arm, pulls her out onto the patio.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         I'm gettin' a little sick of this \n                         asshole, Autumn. I don't like you \n                         hangin' out with him.

They'll grease him through no \n                         matter what he does. Nobody's ever \n                         gonna see his graduation. Don't tell \n                         me you're falling for this guy. He's \n                         just another gang-banger with speed.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         I just said I wanted to help him. \n                         What are you more afraid of, losing \n                         your girl or your position?\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Maybe you oughta think about what \n                         you're in danger of losing.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         Maybe I will.\n\n               Autumn rips free of his grip, and walks out of the party \n               too.\n\n               EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT\n\n               Darnell sits alone on a bench under an old Willow, just \n               staring out at the night. He hears a voice behind him.\n\n                                     VOICE (V.O.)\n                         So where you wanna go?\n\n               He turns. It's Autumn.\n\n               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The party's still in full gear. Ray is now chatting up a few \n               of the groupies. Joe and Bud Lite sit off in a corner. Joe's \n               knocked back several beers. He's a little tipsy, and lost in \n               thought.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         Maybe she's out with some guy.\n\n                                     BUD\n                         Who? Camille? I don't think she's \n                         the type to screw around on ya. Shoot \n                         ya, maybe...\n\n                                     JOE\n                         It wouldn't be screwing around. It's \n                         not like we're going together.\n\n               Joe's gaze falls on a sultry brunette, SHERI, at a table \n               across the way. She's eyeing Joe big time. She wants him. He \n               stares back at her. She doesn't blink.\n\n               EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - NIGHT\n\n               Camille, carrying an armload of books, comes down the library \n               steps, having been studying late. As she heads for her dorm, \n               she sees Joe and Sheri going across the Quad; Sheri draped \n               around Joe, nuzzling him.\n\n               Joe looks over, spots Camille, stops; surprised, embarrassed \n               to see her. They exchange a look. Camille, upset, turns and \n               wheels off. Joe wants to say something to her, but can't get \n               it out.\n\n               ON DARNELL AND AUTUMN\n\n               We don't know where yet, but they seem to be slipping and \n               sliding, clutching on to each other.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         You're right, nobody would ever see \n                         us here.\n\n               PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\n               INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT\n\n               Near closing time. Darnell and Autumn lurch and stumble around \n               the ice, collapsing against the boards now and then. There \n               are few other skaters at this hour.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Yes, I figure the key is to go places \n                         only white people go. Next time we'll \n                         go bowling.\n\n               Autumn laughs, as the house lights start to blink, indicating \n               it's closing time.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Plus I saw this in Rocky. I never \n                         believed a guy who was supposed to \n                         be an athlete would skate that bad, \n                         but now I know.\n\n               They make their way to an opening in the boards, stumble \n               over to a bench, begin to unlace.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         Thanks, that was fun, sort of.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         You were pretty good for the first \n                         time.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         Well, it's not really my first time. \n                         My dad took me skating once.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         He used to play ball for E.S.U., \n                         didn't he?\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         Yeah, how'd you know that?\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         I saw his picture on the Wall of \n                         Fame. You got his eyes. Luckily, you \n                         didn't get his thighs.\n\n               She laughs, looks at him a beat, starts to come forward to \n               kiss him. He puts a finger to her lips.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Make sure you mean it this time.\n\n               She hesitates a beat, then comes forward again. They fall \n               into a deep kiss. We PULL BACK to LONGSHOT. Two people alone \n               in the expanse of the ice rink. The lights flicker and go \n               out.\n\n               INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\n               Camille, unable to sleep, enters in her workout clothes. \n               Languid, melancholy, she goes to the treadmill, as Joe comes \n               out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his \n               waist. Both are surprised to see the other.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         What are you doin' here?\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         Couldn't sleep.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         I was just sweatin' out some of the \n                         beer.\n\n               Camille just nods.

Good enough to devote your life \n                         to. Why aren't they good enough for \n                         me?

Was that just \n                         a joke?\n\n               She gets up and walks out of the room. Winters closes his \n               eyes and slumps down on the couch.\n\n               INT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Darnell sits at his table waiting for Autumn. Autumn storms \n               in, obviously upset about something.

By \n                         yourself, without me here. When I \n                         come back, we'll discuss it.

Darnell's grin fades. He \n               looks at his test, a hint of tears in his eyes. He's \n               embarrassed and deeply worried.\n\n               INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY\n\n               The players are dressing for Monday practice, but it's \n               strangely subdued. Bobby Collins opens his locker to find a \n               BULLET-RIDDLED PRACTICE JERSEY hanging inside. Immediately \n               the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter.\n\n                                     BUD LITE\n                         Coach'd probably shoot ya lower.\n\n               Suddenly the room goes silent. Standing in the doorway is \n               Coach Winters.\n\n               He says nothing, looks around the room, the players avoiding \n               his gaze. His eyes come to rest on Bobby. Bobby tries to \n               hide the shirt, but Winters has seen. Winters just stares at \n               Bobby a beat, then.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         You all played a fine game on \n                         Saturday. Take the day off.\n\n               With that, he turns and walks out the door. The players remain \n               silent. Bobby throws the shirt in the trash.\n\n               INT. LOUANNE'S SORORITY HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Winters walks in the front door, past the desk, up the stairs \n               and down the hall to his daughter's room. She's packing her \n               things. He goes over to her, takes her in his arms and hugs \n               her tight. Neither speak. A tear rolls down Louanne's cheek. \n               Hits the floor.\n\n               EXT. HALL OF ATHLETIC BUILDING - DAY\n\n               A very nervous Bobby Collins comes down the hall and knocks \n               on Coach Winter's door.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         C'mon in, Collins.\n\n               INT.

I was real \n                         glad to hear she's gonna be goin' to \n                         junior college here...\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                              (cutting him off)\n                         Shut up.\n\n               Bobby does.

You've had no prior \n                         infractions and I could argue that \n                         you were under abnormal pressure.\n                              (pause)\n                         But I won't. You embarrassed me, you \n                         embarrassed my family, you embarrassed \n                         the program. As of now, you are no \n                         longer a member of this university \n                         or it's football team. Clean out \n                         your locker.\n\n               Bobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief. \n               There is no wavering, no sympathy in Winters' eyes. Finally, \n               dazed and disoriented, Bobby turns and walks out.\n\n               EXT. E.S.U.

She falls to her knees screaming.\n\n               Under the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground, \n               head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties.

Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe \n               lies motionless on the tracks. Suddenly he stirs, pushes \n               himself up to his knees. She lets out a scream of joy, races \n               toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade. \n               She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps \n               him over to the embankment.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         God Joe, oh god, are you allright?\n\n                                     JOE\n                              (drained)\n                         Yeh, just got some dirt in my teeth. \n                         Guess you've really seen the dark \n                         side now, huh?

Yells \n               signals.\n\n                                     SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)\n                         Well, it was billed as a Heisman \n                         shootout, and it's been all of that. \n                         Both Waymen and Kane moving their \n                         teams up and down the field, having \n                         big days.\n\n               Joe fades to pass, looks right, looks left, can't find a \n               receiver, decides to run for it. He sprints up the middle, \n               15, 10; a SAFETY comes at him at the 5. We see\n\n               Joe's P.O.V. through HELMETCAM. He pushes the lunging safety \n               away, turns back just in time to be blasted by the OTHER \n               SAFETY he never saw. Joe is knocked down, over the goal line \n               and out cold. The crowd goes wild.\n\n                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)\n                         Kane back to pass, can't find anybody, \n                         gonna run it himself, ten, five, hit \n                         at the goal-line... Touchdown E.S.U.!! \n                         Great run by Kane!\n\n               Joe lies motionless as his teamates run over to him.\n\n                                     SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)\n                         He's still down. Looks like he's \n                         hurt.\n\n               We go to Winters, worried on the sideline, as the celebration \n               around him begins to die down.\n\n               ANGLE ON JOE\n\n               As he's carried off the field, his arms around two linemen's \n               shoulders, and lowered onto the bench. We go to a BLURRY \n               IMAGE of a man's face waving something. We REVERSE to REVEAL \n               a DOCTOR waving smelling salts under Joe's nose. Joe begins \n               to come around. The doctor holds up two fingers.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         How many fingers am I holding up?\n\n                                     JOE\n                         Four.\n\n               EXT. THE FIELD - DAY\n\n               Michigan comes to the line of scrimmage. As Tim Waymen gets \n               under center, Alvin begins to yell at him.\n\n                                     ALVIN\n                         Hey, powderpuff. You're the white \n                         boy that ratted my brother out. Sent \n                         him to jail, cocksucker. Ran off \n                         with the fuckin' money. Left the \n                         blood to do the time, huh?\n\n               Waymen begins to call signals.\n\n                                     ALVIN\n                         Yeh, you're the little bastard. \n                         Account of you, my bros' datin' his \n                         cell mate. You hear me, powderpuff? \n                         Gonna make you pay. You gonna be my \n                         cellmate now. You gonna have 250 \n                         lbs. of pissed-off nigger up your \n                         ass.\n\n                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)\n                         E.S.U. in an eight-man line looking \n                         for the run on third and short.\n\n               The ball is snapped. Waymen fakes a handoff to his fullback, \n               hides the ball on his hip, fades to pass. On the sideline, \n               Coach Winters yells, \"Pass! Pass!\"\n\n               Alvin's not fooled by the run, he shakes his blocker and \n               takes dead aim on Waymen. Just as Waymen releases the ball, \n               Alvin blasts him, driving him into the turf.\n\n                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)\n                         Waymen fakes to Simms, Mack on the \n                         blitz, Waymen is goin for it all! \n                         Hit as he throws.\n\n               The ball, however, flies through the air, a perfect spiral. \n               The E.S.U. secondary has been fooled by the play fake and is \n               a step behind. The ball comes down in the hands of the \n               Michigan tight end, JERRY HUNT.\n\n                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)\n                         Hunt has got a step. He's got it! \n                         Touchdown!\n\n               Winters slams his headphones to the ground.\n\n                                     SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)\n                         Great clutch throw under pressure. \n                         Can't do it much better than that.\n\n               ANGLE ON JOE\n\n               The Doctor examines Joe, shines a light in his eyes, makes \n               him track his finger, etc.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         You're vision's back to normal.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         You think you can go?\n\n                                     JOE\n                         Yeh, I'm fine. Just a little headache.\n                              (getting up, shouting \n                              to his teamates)\n                         O.K. Offense, let's get it back.\n\n               Alvin, meanwhile, plops down on the bench in disgust.\n\n                                     ALVIN\n                         Damn tough to scare that little white \n                         boy. Either his momma dropped him on \n                         his head, or the motherfucker is \n                         deaf.\n\n               Coach Winters goes to Darnell.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         Jefferson, in for Griffen.\n\n               Griffen slams his helmet to the ground.\n\n               EXT. FIELD - DAY\n\n               Joe breaks the huddle as the E.S.U. offense comes to the \n               line.\n\n                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)\n                         Ball on the Michigan 47, 1:02 to go, \n                         Kane brings 'em to the line of \n                         scrimmage.\n\n               Joe fades to pass once again, lets the rush come, then flares \n               out a screen pass to Darnell. Darnell grabs it and takes \n               off, slipping tackles, cutting back, juking. Darnell finally \n               runs out of bounds at the twenty.\n\n                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)\n                         Great run by Jefferson, the highly-\n                         touted Freshman, the longest of the \n                         day for the Wolves. And this one is \n                         turning out to be everything we \n                         thought it would be.\n\n               ANGLE ON DARNELL\n\n               coming back to the huddle, pumped up. Joe kneels in the \n               center.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         O.K., time to put the women and \n                         children to bed, and go looking for \n                         dinner.\n\n               He begins to howl, as do all the others. The Call of the \n               Wild.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         82 Strike, Eagle, Crown, on 2.\n\n               They clap hands, come to the line. Joe looks over the defense, \n               bends under center and barks signals, The ball is snapped. \n               Action goes to SLOW MOTION.\n\n               Joe fakes to Darnell, fades to pass. The Michigan cornerback \n               comes on a blitz, locked on Joe. Joe starts to roll, but \n               knows the corner will catch him. On the run, he launches the \n               ball toward Darnell. Darnell opens his hands to receive it, \n               but at the last second, the Michigan SAFETY steps in front \n               and intercepts it.\n\n                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)\n                         Kane looking for Jefferson. It's... \n                         Intercepted! Intercepted by Freeman! \n                         And that should do it.\n\n               Joe sinks to his knees in frustration. The blitzing cornerback \n               does a quick pit-pat on Joe's helmet. Winters looks like \n               he's been punched.\n\n               As Michigan and Tim Waymen celebrate on the sideline, we go \n               to:\n\n               INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - AFTERNOON\n\n               Steve Zabriskie is doing the wrap-up, the emptying stadium \n               behind him.\n\n                                     ZABRISKIE\n                         Well, it was everything we expected \n                         it to be. Fine performances on both \n                         sides of the field.\n\n               INT. E.S.U. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\n               Players undress and shower in relative silence. No joy here.\n\n                                     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)\n                         The edge in the much ballyhooed battle \n                         of the quarterbacks would probably \n                         have to go to Michigan's Tim Waymen \n                         who threw for 2 touchdowns, and ran \n                         for another. Joe Kane accounted for \n                         three E.S.U. touchdowns, but had \n                         that crucial interception in the \n                         waning moments. And that proved to \n                         be the difference.\n\n               The door of the locker room opens, and a flood of reporters \n               enter. Joe hides back in the showers, leaning his forehead \n               against the wall, the water coursing over him.\n\n               EXT. TUNNEL BENEATH STADIUM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Darnell comes out of the locker room, having showered and \n               dressed. He's surprised to see Autumn and her father talking \n               to Coach Humes.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Hey, Autumn.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         Hi, Darnell.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Is this your dad?\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         Yes...\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         How do you do, Mr. Haley.

It's obvious that Autumn \n               has never told her dad about him.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                              (filling the void)\n                         Ah, I tutor him...\n\n                                     MR.

Autumn wants to go explain, but can't in front \n               of her father.\n\n               INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The post-game party. Not as raucous as after the opening \n               game victory. A few players are dancing, but most are sitting, \n               drinking, commiserating.\n\n                                     BUD LITE\n                              (to Alvin)\n                         Anybody seen Joe?\n\n                                     ALVIN\n                         Not yet. Probably out with Camille. \n                         Haven't seen Darnell either.\n\n               INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Lattimer's sitting on the bed with a coed named LESLIE. \n               They're kissing softly, light necking. Lattimer starts to \n               unbutton her blouse. She begins to demur.\n\n                                     LESLIE\n                         I think we better get back downstairs.\n\n                                     LATTIMER\n                         No, Leslie, we're just getting to \n                         know each other.\n\n                                     LESLIE\n                              (starting to get up)\n                         No, I think...\n\n               Lattimer grabs her arm roughly, pulls her back to the bed. \n               She's starting to get a little scared.\n\n                                     LATTIMER\n                         C'mon Leslie, you didn't come up \n                         here to stop now.\n\n               He tries to kiss her again, she pushes him away, starts for \n               the door. Angered, that steroid pump in his eyes, he grabs \n               her again, throws her violently on the bed. She screams.\n\n                                     LATTIMER\n                         What were you doin'? Leadin' me on?\n\n               He gets on the bed, kneels above her. She starts to struggle. \n               He slaps her across the face, rips her blouse open. Freaked, \n               she begins to scream and kick. Enraged, Lattimer slaps her \n               around, picks her up, shakes her like a rag doll, slaps her \n               some more, throws her to the floor. Picks her up again, when \n               suddenly the door BURSTS OPEN and Bud Lite and Alvin race \n               in.\n\n                                     LATTIMER\n                              (throwing Leslie on \n                              the bed again)\n                         Get outa here!\n\n               Bud Lite and Alvin charge Lattimer, try to wrestle him down, \n               but his hormone level is so high, he fights like a bull. Two \n               other players charge in and finally all four are able to \n               shackle Lattimer. He continues to struggle a bit, then gives \n               up, a panting, sweating, shaking hulk.\n\n                                     BUD\n                         This is it, man. No more 'roids. \n                         This shit has gotta stop.\n\n               Lattimer breaks down and cries.\n\n               INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Joe lies on his bed, a bottle of vodka next to his coca-cola. \n               He stares at the larger than life cardboard stand-up of \n               himself. He takes a drink, then gets up and grabs his jacket. \n               The phone rings. He looks at it a beat, then walks out of \n               the room.\n\n               INT. CAMILLE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Camille's on the phone, waiting, the one calling Joe. She \n               listens a few more rings, hangs up, concerned.\n\n               INT. WINTERS HIGH-TECH VIDEO ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Winters sits at the main console replaying the game-ending \n               interception over and over. The phone rings.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         Hello, yeh... What?!\n\n               INT. WINTERS ATHLETIC OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n               The rest of the locker room is dark except for the light on \n               in Winters' office.

We can't \n                         ignore this anymore. I don't know \n                         what pisses me off more -- that he's \n                         juicin' or that he's doin' such a \n                         shitty job of hidin' it.\n\n                                     HUMES\n                         He's never tested positive. If we \n                         suspend him without proof, he could \n                         sue us for jeopardizing his draft \n                         status, his pro career.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         Yeh, but we can't sit and wait till \n                         he kills somebody. I hate to lose \n                         him as much as you do, but we gotta \n                         clean him up before he does somethin' \n                         that lands the whole program on \n                         probation.

LOCAL BAR - NIGHT\n\n               Not the 911 we saw earlier. Joe sits at a table in the back, \n               with Darnell, drinking tequila with a beer chaser. Both are \n               down in the dumps. At a nearby table there's a group of \n               TOWNIES and their GIRLFRIENDS.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         Coupla real college heroes, huh? \n                         Tearin' up the town.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         First time I ever lost a girl and a \n                         game on the same day.

Joe smiles back, not \n               really interested.

The boyfriend grabs him, Joe pushes him \n               away. The guy charges Joe. The bar owner rushes to the phone \n               as a full scale brawl begins. Joe takes a blow, knocks the \n               boyfriend back into a table, knocking beer bottles to the \n               floor.

He watches it catch \n               fire, then grabs his suitcase and walks out of the room. We \n               hold on the burning standup, as flames lick at Joe's smile.\n\n               INT.

Suddenly, \n               he smashes his fist into the screen, breaking it into pieces. \n               His hand bleeds. He doesn't care.

Seated in a metal folding chair, smoking a \n               cigarette, looking out at the yard is Joe's DAD.

Looking to generate some \n                         offense.

On go.\n\n               They break and the E.S.U. offense comes to the line. Collins \n               calls signals. We go to SLOW MOTION as he fades to pass. \n               Darnell fakes a block, then rolls out for a screen pass. \n               Georgia Tech's defensive line comes hard. Bobby flips the \n               ball over the charging defenders. Darnell catches it, gets a \n               good block from Bud Lite, then tucks in behind Ray who is \n               out ahead blocking.\n\n               There's only one linebacker to beat and Darnell will be into \n               the secondary. Figuring Ray will block the guy, Darnell begins \n               to look for the safeties. Ray, however, barely brushes the \n               linebacker, who doesn't even break stride. He lowers his \n               head, and drives into Darnell, his helmet hitting the \n               football. Fumble! There's a scramble. The Yellow Jackets \n               free safety comes up with it.\n\n               REGULAR SPEED\n\n               The crowd and the E.S.U. bench, quickly deflated, sit back \n               down. Darnell gets to his feet, glares at Ray, but says \n               nothing. He knows Ray tanked the block.\n\n               INT.

Around \n                         a 34 yarder. Ball is down, it's away, \n                         it's long enough. And good! Georgia \n                         Tech jumps out on top 3-0.\n\n               Alvin's mother looks to see if there's any reaction from \n               Alvin. There's none.\n\n               EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON\n\n               Bobby Collins fades back to pass, is rushed, throws a quick \n               sideline, but it's a little short.

The Wolves are gonna have \n                         to find some offense in a hurry here. \n                         Their defense has been keepin' them \n                         in it.\n\n               As he starts off the bench for the field, Coach Winters comes \n               up to him.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         Joe, I know that Rehab was good for \n                         you. Got rid of a lotta bad habits. \n                         But what about the rest of you? What \n                         happened to the Joe Kane that used \n                         to take command of this team, the \n                         Joe Kane these guys i'd run through \n                         a bulldozer for?

Nobody \n                         in this stadium gives a shit. It's \n                         time to step up, Joe. Time to sit at \n                         the head of the Table.\n\n               ANGLE ON THE E.S.U. OFFENSIVE HUDDLE\n\n               As Joe comes into the huddle.

First sound.\n\n               Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage, yells \"Go!\" \n               The ball is snapped, Joe drops back, hits Darnell on the \n               sideline. First down. In quick succession, we see Joe:\n\n               1) Complete a 15 yarder to Ray over the middle.\n\n               2) Fades to pass, is rushed. Forced out of the pocket, \n               scrambles for his life, manages to get down to the 4 yard \n               line. He gets up, surveys the distance to pay dirt.\n\n                                     HARVEY (V.O.)\n                         Nice bit of scrambling by Kane to \n                         get it to the four, but it's gonna \n                         bring up fourth and goal. No doubt \n                         about it, with 3:45 they've gotta go \n                         for it here, if they're gonna get \n                         back in this game.\n\n               ANGLE ON THE SIDELINE\n\n               Winters puts his arm around Ray who will take the play into \n               the huddle.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Give it to me up the gut, Coach. \n                         They've been ignoring me.

Ray is \n               upset, angry. He swears to himself.\n\n               ANGLE ON FIELD\n\n               Ray enters the huddle, whispers in Joe's ear.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         28 Thunder right. On 2.\n\n               The team breaks out, comes to the line. Joe looks over the \n               defense, screams signals as the CROWD NOISE is building.\n\n               We go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped. Ray takes one \n               step forward then turns right, leading the play. Joe pitches \n               to Darnell who follows Ray. Georgia Tech's outside linebacker \n               comes up to stop the play. Ray stumbles before he can make \n               the block. He drops out of our picture.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Shit!\n\n               Darnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline. The \n               linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle \n               on him. Darnell starts to cut back. He lowers his shoulder \n               to take the linebacker's blow. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray \n               reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker, \n               knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out. \n               Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal \n               line. Touchdown, E.S.U.\n\n               The stands erupt. It's the first thing they've had to cheer \n               about all day. Winters just looks at the clock, goes over to \n               talk to his defense.\n\n               Darnell foregoes his touchdown dance. He runs over to Ray, \n               grabs him by the helmet.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Monster block, man. Monster \n                         motherfuckin' block.\n\n               Ray smiles. They butt heads and run off the field\n\n               INT.

WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON\n\n               Georgia Tech has the ball. They break their huddle.\n\n                                     HARVEY (V.O.)\n                         1:11 and counting. Third and one. \n                         The Wolves have got to stop them on \n                         this play if they're gonna get the \n                         ball back. A first down here and \n                         it's all she wrote. E.S.U. is out of \n                         timeouts.\n\n               The Georgia Tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands \n               off to his TAILBACK on the countertrap. The tailback runs \n               behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer. \n               Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. The back lowers \n               his head, starts to power into Lattimer. Lattimer lets out a \n               fierce yell.\n\n               Smash! Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision \n               lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck, \n               vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the \n               tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face. \n               There are snot bubbles in his nose. No first down. No way.\n\n               Lattimer jabs both arms in the air. The crowd goes nuts, as \n               the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling \n               their arms, whipping up the crowd.\n\n               ANGLE ON SIDELINE\n\n               Winters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field. \n               He meets Lattimer, looks into his eyes. Sees the steroids \n               there. He knows it's the only way the kid could have done \n               it. Decides not to bust him. Lattimer knows it. Winters gives \n               his helmet a little slap, more in sympathy than praise.\n\n               ANGLE ON THE YELLOW JACKET PUNTER\n\n               He catches the snap, boots the ball away.\n\n               Darnell fields it at his 12, starts toward the right sideline, \n               where hemmed in, he looks like dead meat. Suddenly, he \n               reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where \n               a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there. \n               He turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the \n               corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a \n               wicked series of crack-back blocks, until he's finally run \n               out of bounds at the Yellow Jacket 35 yard line.\n\n               ON STANDS\n\n               The E.S.U. fans are on their feet. Winters races over to \n               Joe.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         Time for 2 plays. If it's not open \n                         in the end zone, take the sideline. \n                         As the offense runs onto the field, \n                         Winters checks the scoreboard. 17 \n                         seconds left.

Kane barking signals.\n\n               Joe takes the snap, drops to pass, finds no one, rolls away \n               from the rush. Just as he's about to go out of bounds, he \n               fires a bullet down the sideline. Ray Griffen catches it and \n               goes out of bounds at the twelve.\n\n               ANGLE ON SIDELINE\n\n               Joe runs over to Coach Winters, knowing they have no more \n               time outs, as the refs move the chains.\n\n                                     HARVEY (V.O.)\n                         Field goal here ties it, but a tie \n                         may not get the Wolves into a bowl. \n                         Tough decision for Winters.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                              (to Joe)\n                         You want me to send in the kicking \n                         team or you think you can handle it?\n\n                                     JOE\n                         Give me the ball.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         O.K., let's do 24 inside slot, left \n                         blue lightning.\n\n               ON FIELD\n\n               Joe races back out onto the field and into the huddle, as \n               the crowd's roar goes off the charts.\n\n                                     JOE\n                              (in huddle)\n                         O.K., 24 inside slot, left blue \n                         lightning.

The others join in, howling for all \n               they're worth, eleven jacked-up warriors. They clap and break \n               the huddle.\n\n               The crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the \n               Georgia Tech end zone. Joe looks up in the stands again at \n               the seat he left for his father. It's still empty.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         This one's for you, Dad.\n\n               Joe starts to call signals as Bud Lite sings \"Bali Hi.\" We \n               go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped.\n\n               The Georgia Tech defense fires off the line, throwing \n               everything at Joe. Joe drops back five steps. Bud Lite picks \n               up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player. \n               Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher \n               breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket. It's wartime \n               as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble \n               up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe.\n\n               Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern \n               and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one \n               tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back \n               for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between \n               defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen, \n               Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open \n               space that Darnell is heading for.\n\n               The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker. \n               Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close \n               on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral. \n               Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes \n               between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch, \n               landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls \n               over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown! This \n               time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance.\n\n               ANGLE ON STANDS\n\n               Pandemonium. The crowd including Autumn and her dad goes \n               crazy. Winters just gives a few quick nods, watching almost \n               wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other, knowing \n               none of them will hug him. Joe, Bud and the others mob \n               Darnell.\n\n               INT.

WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON\n\n               As Darnell comes off the field, Autumn runs out and hugs \n               him, leads him to her dad.\n\n                                     AUTUMN\n                         Daddy, you remember Darnell.\n\n                                     MR. HALEY\n                         Yes, I do. Great catch, Darnell.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         Thank you, sir. I got somethin' for \n                         you.\n\n               Darnell reaches into his helmet and takes out a sweat-stained \n               piece of paper.\n\n                                     DARNELL\n                         My entrance exam. Got a 92. Coach \n                         Winters said you got an 87. He looked \n                         it up.\n\n                                     MR. HALEY\n                              (laughing)\n                         I'll kill him.\n\n               ANGLE ON JOE KANE\n\n               walking toward the tunnel, acknowledging the plaudits of the \n               fans. He looks for Camille, doesn't see her. Coach Winters \n               comes up next to him.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         Hell of a throw, Joe. Good to see \n                         you back.\n\n               Winters gives him a quick, but firm hug.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         And don't worry about the Heisman. \n                         We'll gear up for it next year.\n\n               Joe manages a weary smile.\n\n               ANGLE ON BUD LITE\n\n               coming down the tunnel, Bobby Collins next to him. Both stop \n               as Louanne walks toward them. Bobby smiles to himself in \n               anticipation of her fawning over him. She walks right by him \n               and up to Bud.\n\n                                     LOUANNE\n                         You still feel like gettin' a beer?\n\n               Bud smiles. Bobby quickly looks around for someone else to \n               hit on, hails a cheerleader. Bud and Louanne walk off \n               together. Louanne stops when she sees her father, fearful of \n               his reaction.\n\n                                     LOUANNE\n                         He's not a football player any more. \n                         He's graduating this year.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         He's still got a bowl game.\n\n               Louanne waits, not sure whether her father's angry or not.\n\n                                     WINTERS\n                         So make sure he doesn't violate \n                         curfew.\n\n               Louanne smiles. Winters returns it, and walks away.\n\n               ANGLE ON STEVE LATTIMER\n\n               Sitting on the bench, his head in his hands, weeping.\n\n                                     HARVEY (V.O.)\n                         An amazing conclusion to a great \n                         season. We can see Steve Lattimer \n                         down on the bench weeping tears of \n                         joy as E.S.U. goes back to a bowl \n                         for the first time in three years.\n\n               These are not tears of joy, but a man/boy who knows he'll \n               never be able to play pro football without steroids.\n\n               EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Joe sits on a bench at the intersection of four converging \n               Quad paths. Camille approaches from the opposite direction, \n               stops when she sees Joe.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         What are you doin' here?\n\n                                     JOE\n                         Waitin' for you. I figured you'de \n                         have to come through here on your \n                         way to dinner.\n\n               This softens, relaxes her a bit.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         Shouldn't you be out celebrating? \n                         You played real well.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         I need your help with somethin'. I \n                         know I'm not your favorite guy right \n                         now, but it's all startin' again. \n                         The expectations, the pressure, the \n                         talk about the Heisman next year. I \n                         was wonderin' if you'de like to go \n                         somewhere, maybe share a six-pack \n                         with me?\n\n               Camille's shocked that he might be drinking again. He pulls \n               a six pack of 7-Up out from behind his back. She laughs in \n               spite of herself. They settle again.\n\n                                     JOE\n                         I miss you, Camille. I don't like \n                         bein' without you.\n\n                                     CAMILLE\n                         I'll think about it.\n\n               They look at each other a beat, come forward into a long \n               kiss and embrace as we pull up and back.\n\n               CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL AS\n\n               EXT. STADIUM TUNNEL - DAY\n\n               Coach Winters, flanked by Humes and Clayton, walks down the \n               tunnel to a waiting car. No effigy this time.\n\n                                     HUMES\n                         Tickets are in your coat.
