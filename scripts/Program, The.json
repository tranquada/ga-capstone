She starts to struggle. \n               He slaps her across the face, rips her blouse open. Freaked, \n               she begins to scream and kick. Enraged, Lattimer slaps her \n               around, picks her up, shakes her like a rag doll, slaps her \n               some more, throws her to the floor.

Two \n               other players charge in and finally all four are able to \n               shackle Lattimer.

Ray takes one \n               step forward then turns right, leading the play. Joe pitches \n               to Darnell who follows Ray. Georgia Tech's outside linebacker \n               comes up to stop the play. Ray stumbles before he can make \n               the block.

The tailback runs \n               behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer. \n               Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. The back lowers \n               his head, starts to power into Lattimer. Lattimer lets out a \n               fierce yell.\n\n               Smash! Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision \n               lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck, \n               vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the \n               tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face. \n               There are snot bubbles in his nose. No first down. No way.\n\n               Lattimer jabs both arms in the air. The crowd goes nuts, as \n               the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling \n               their arms, whipping up the crowd.\n\n<b>               ANGLE ON SIDELINE\n</b>\n               Winters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field. \n               He meets Lattimer, looks into his eyes.

Suddenly, he \n               reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where \n               a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there. \n               He turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the \n               corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a \n               wicked series of crack-back blocks, until he's finally run \n               out of bounds at the Yellow Jacket 35 yard line.\n\n<b>               ON STANDS\n</b>\n               The E.S.U. fans are on their feet.

The others join in, howling for all \n               they're worth, eleven jacked-up warriors. They clap and break \n               the huddle.\n\n               The crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the \n               Georgia Tech end zone. Joe looks up in the stands again at \n               the seat he left for his father. It's still empty.\n\n<b>                                     JOE\n</b>                         This one's for you, Dad.\n\n               Joe starts to call signals as Bud Lite sings \"Bali Hi.\" We \n               go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped.\n\n               The Georgia Tech defense fires off the line, throwing \n               everything at Joe. Joe drops back five steps. Bud Lite picks \n               up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player. \n               Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher \n               breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket. It's wartime \n               as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble \n               up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe.\n\n               Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern \n               and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one \n               tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back \n               for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between \n               defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen, \n               Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open \n               space that Darnell is heading for.\n\n               The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker. \n               Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close \n               on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral. \n               Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes \n               between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch, \n               landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls \n               over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown! This \n               time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance.\n\n<b>               ANGLE ON STANDS\n</b>\n               Pandemonium. The crowd including Autumn and her dad goes \n               crazy. Winters just gives a few quick nods, watching almost \n               wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other, knowing \n               none of them will hug him. Joe, Bud and the others mob \n               Darnell.\n\n<b>               INT.
