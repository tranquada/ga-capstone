HARVEY\u0092S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               A BEDROOM MIRROR.\n\n               The room is dark. A perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on \n               a wall.\n\n               Suddenly, out of the darkness, the reflection of a man's \n               face comes into focus. He stares straight ahead, perhaps \n               studying his own unrecognizable reflection. It's quite clear \n               this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray, \n               his eyes are confused. There is something most definitely \n               wrong.\n\n               Tentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving \n               the frame empty and dark.\n\n               ANGLE ON BED\n\n               Like a ghost, the naked man (Harvey) stands over his bed \n               staring down at his sleeping wife (Joyce). In the eerie light, \n               he's almost translucent.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                              (faintly)\n                         Joyce...

What are you \n                         doing up?\n\n               Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing.\n\n                                     JOYCE\n                         What is it?\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                              (delirious, out of \n                              breath)\n                         Tell me the truth.

Suddenly \n               Harvey collapses.\n\n               Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical.

Similar to \n               the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus, \n               revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face. But this \n               time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic \n               mask of the D.C. Comic hero -- SUPERMAN.\n\n               INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1956\n\n               CLOSE ON SUPERMAN MASK\n\n               It glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp. A child's pupils \n               glare through the eye holes...\n\n               The camera pans from SUPERMAN to the masked face of another \n               caped-crusader: BATMAN. Batman turns toward his loyal sidekick \n               ROBIN, who clutches a plastic, trick-or-treat pumpkin.\n\n               Next, we find THE GREEN LANTERN as he reaches up to ring the \n               doorbell. The camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt \n               KID wearing no costume at all. Looking irritated and removed \n               from the rest of the group, the KID shoves his hands in the \n               pockets of his shearling coat.\n\n               He spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door.\n\n               The brick home is as working class as it gets. The lady at \n               the door is a 1950's HOUSEWIFE.\n\n                                     BOYS\n                              (in unison)\n                         Trick or treat!!\n\n                                     HOUSEWIFE\n                         Well, look at this!

He halfheartedly \n               holds up a ratty, stained pillowcase.\n\n                                     HOUSEWIFE\n                         And what about you young man?\n\n                                     KID\n                         What about what?\n\n               The other boys giggle.

For the most part, he's \n                         lived in shit neighborhoods, held \n                         shit jobs, and is now knee deep into \n                         a second disastrous marriage.

He clutches a movie script in his hand.\n\n               The frame is spare, with a few well-chosen items to indicate \n               that he's in a recording session.\n\n               Although he is significantly older than the man who portrays \n               him, the \"Real Harvey\" is every bit as much of a sad sack... \n               maybe even more. He is large and slightly threatening with \n               knitted brows and wild eyes. Yet there is something kind and \n               vulnerable about him -- a teddy bear who could kick your \n               ass. Off Camera, WE HEAR the voices of the male and female \n               directors (us -- BOB and SHARI) coaching the \"Real Harvey\" \n               through his voice over.

Pushing back her huge glasses, she \n               reprimands Harvey like he is an infant: \"Harvey you are \n               talking too loud, Harvey you are being difficult.\" Harvey \n               just rolls his eyes. Joyce gets offended. It is clear they \n               have had this argument a million times. As Joyce storms off...\n\n               Harvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the \n               movie. He laments that she is his third wife, and he has no \n               luck with women. \"Man, chicks just don't dig me.\" That's why \n               he marries anyone who will have him. \"And I marry them fast \n               before they get to know the real me...\"\n\n               END HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

CRUMB sit on a park bench together by a bus \n               stop. A distraught Harvey whines while Crumb just sketches.\n\n               Harvey's voice is still raspy.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         I dunno, man. On the one hand most \n                         women gettin' graduate degrees \n                         wouldn't give a guy like me the time \n                         a' day. An' she married me an' \n                         everything, so I gotta give her some \n                         kinda credit. But then she got so \n                         mean to me in the end. An' it ain't \n                         like I tried t'keep her captive or \n                         anything like that, y'know?\n\n               Crumb may or may not be listening to Harvey. It's hard to \n               tell.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         An' then on top of it I lost my voice \n                         for three months. I still sound like \n                         shit, but before I had nothin'. Man, \n                         talk about hell. I started forgettin' \n                         what I sound like, y'know? So I \n                         started writin' stuff down -- stories \n                         an' things, my points a' view, ideas. \n                         I even published a couple jazz record \n                         reviews. I guess that ended up bein' \n                         a good thing.\n\n                                     CRUMB\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         But don't think I buy into this \n                         \"growth\" crap. Everybody talks about \n                         how bad experiences can cause ya \n                         t'grow, an' all that clich\u00e9d stuff. \n                         I've had enough bad experiences and \n                         growth to last me plenty.\n                              (a beat)\n                         Right now, I'd be glad to trade some \n                         growth for happiness.\n\n               For a moment, they both just sit there saying nothing to \n               each other, each man in his own private universe.\n\n               Finally Harvey looks over to Crumb.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         So how long are ya stayin' in \n                         Cleveland?\n\n               Crumb never looks up from his picture.\n\n                                     CRUMB\n                         I dunno, man. I gotta go visit this \n                         chick in New York. And I'm really \n                         busy with the comic book stuff. It's \n                         good bread and all man but I'm getting \n                         fed up with the whole scene.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         What are ya talkin' about?

It sure beats workin' a \n                         gig like mine -- being a nobody flunky \n                         and sellin' records on the side for \n                         a buck.\n\n                                     CRUMB\n                         Yeah, well that's true...\n\n               Harvey nods in agreement, mulling this over. He's not at all \n               offended.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1975 - DAY\n\n               CLOSE ON A FILE DRAWER MARKED: \"RECENTLY DECEASED.\"\n\n               A hand reaches into the frame and opens the drawer.\n\n               By rote, HARVEY fumbles with a large stack of \"expired \n               patient\" files. He places each into the appropriate \n               alphabetical \"deceased\" drawer.\n\n               Attempting to grab another batch, Harvey accidentally knocks \n               the entire pile onto the floor.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         Damn it!\n\n               He crouches down to survey the mess -- a collage of \"expired \n               lives\" laid out before his eyes.\n\n               We move past dozens of anonymous names -- William Anderson, \n               Louis Collins, Mark D'Amico, Tyrone Moore, Franklin Ray, \n               etc... Each file has a red \"Deceased\" stamp.\n\n               Depressed, HARVEY is transfixed by the files surrounding him \n               on the floor. Suddenly he stops and picks one up.\n\n               ANGLE ON FOLDER: It is marked, \"CHARLIE MARSHALL.\"\n\n               He opens the folder and reads the stats...\n\n               Born: 1920 in Cleveland Died: 1920 in Cleveland Occupation: \n               Clerk\n\n               ANGLE ON HARVEY: He swallows hard as he reads about Charlie's \n               small, invisible and now vanished life... He tosses the folder \n               back onto the pile.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1975 - MORNING\n\n               CLOSE ON: TWO STICK FIGURES IN AN EMPTY FRAME\n\n               HARVEY sits at a table with a pen in hand and a blank sheet \n               of paper in front of him. Nothing seems to come to him.\n\n               He flips through a pile of comic books -- everything from \n               D.C. Comic Super Heroes to underground works such as Crumb's \n               Mr. Natural and Zap Comix. No inspiration. Harvey throws \n               them down in frustration.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         I'm starvin'.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. SUPERMARKET - 1975 - DAY\n\n               HARVEY pushes a cart through the cramped aisles of a crowded \n               supermarket. He pulls a few cans of Beef-A-Roni off the shelf \n               and heads off to pay. Reaching the check-out area, he \n               evaluates the situation.\n\n               ANGLE ON CHECK-OUT COUNTERS:\n\n               There are three lines to choose from. Two of the counters \n               have long waits. The third is much shorter but there is an \n               OLD JEWISH LADY next in line.\n\n               SUDDENLY, THE SCREEN SPLITS IN TWO:\n\n               The LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME remains Harvey at the supermarket \n               deliberating over the check-out lines.\n\n               However, the RIGHT SIDE OF THE FRAME now contains a CRUMB \n               STYLE COMIC PANEL DEPICTING THE EXACT SAME SCENARIO. A BUBBLE \n               appears over CARTOON HARVEY'S head revealing his thoughts. \n               It reads: \"Pickin' the right check-out line is an art... \n               There's a lot of things you gotta consider.\"\n\n               ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... Harvey decides to get behind \n               the Old Lady.\n\n               MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE FRAME... Cartoon \n               Harvey stands behind the Old Lady.\n\n               A new BUBBLE reads: \"It may be the shortest line but I am \n               takin' a chance 'cause she's an Old Jewish Lady.\"\n\n               BACK TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... The CASHIER rings up \n               the Old Lady's purchases -- a few kitchen glasses.\n\n                                     OLD JEWISH LADY\n                              (Yiddish Accent)\n                         Listen, goily, dese glasses are six \n                         for $2.00 because I couldn't carry \n                         twelf...

It's \n                         ok, you can esk de meneger.\n\n               Harvey rolls his eyes and stamps his foot impatiently. He \n               knows he's in trouble now.\n\n                                     CASHIER\n                              (yelling)\n                         Frank! I need a price check.\n\n               SUDDENLY, THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN BECOMES FULLY \n               ANIMATED... Instead of still comic panels with balloons, the \n               Cartoon Harvey now rants directly into the camera.\n\n                                     CARTOON HARVEY\n                         Man, Old Jewish Ladies will argue \n                         forever with a cashier about anything. \n                         Get behind them in a line an' yer \n                         gonna wait forever!\n\n               The Human Harvey seems oblivious to his cartoon replica. He \n               impatiently leans on his cart, waiting and seething.\n\n                                     CARTOON HARVEY\n                         I mean, I'm a yid myself, an' the \n                         women in my family are like that... \n                         But I never got used to it... I may \n                         be cheap, but I got limits!\n\n               ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN... The MANAGER finally \n               arrives. The Old Lady haggles with him, too.\n\n                                     OLD JEWISH LADY\n                         Please. Let me 'splain von more time.\n\n               MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE... The Cartoon Harvey turns \n               to address the Human Harvey, who actually looks him in the \n               eyes. It now seems Human Harvey can actually hear his cartoon \n               alter ego.\n\n                                     CARTOON HARVEY\n                         Wake up!

Or ya \n                         gonna make a mark. Huh? Huh?\n\n               IN AN INSTANT, THE CARTOON HARVEY DISAPPEARS AND THE LIVE \n               ACTION SCENE TAKES OVER THE WHOLE FRAME.\n\n               Suddenly motivated by an odd notion, Harvey abandons his \n               grocery cart and runs out of the supermarket.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

HARVEY'S KITCHEN - 1975 - MORNING\n\n               A bleary-eyed HARVEY, still clad in an undershirt and boxers, \n               dozes off over a bowl of Corn Flakes. On the table next to \n               some spilled milk are a stack of papers covered with \n               scribbling. He clearly has been slaving over this work all \n               night.\n\n               ANGLE ON PAPERS:\n\n               At the top is a quickly scribbled title, \"Standing Behind \n               Old Jewish Ladies In Supermarket Lines.\" These are ad hoc \n               versions of a comic book. The pages are divided like a tick-\n               tack-toe board. Each square is filled with crude stick figure \n               drawings and lots of writing.\n\n               An alarm clock goes off. Harvey's eyes fly open.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         Shit. Work.\n\n               Harvey yawns, then notices the pile of papers. He peruses \n               them, proud of his work. He gets up and looks out the window.\n\n               I/E. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - HARVEY'S POV - 1975 - MORNING\n\n               It is yet another grey day in Cleveland. The neighborhood is \n               run-down. Garbage is strewn everywhere.\n\n               The following scene unfolds through the window:\n\n               Two UNSIGHTLY WORKERS lug an old, smelly mattress from a \n               garage towards the garbage cans on the curb. Their \n               conversation is distant, but entirely audible.\n\n                                     MATTRESS GUY #1\n                         So how smart is she?\n\n                                     MATTRESS GUY #2\n                         I dunno.

With the window framing \n               these guys, the scene FREEZES, looking just like a comic \n               book panel.\n\n               INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Harvey turns around from the scene and ponders it.

But \n                         hey, maybe the guy who's had a happy \n                         life feels worse just before he dies \n                         than th' guy who had a sad one. Or, \n                         maybe not. I dunno. Maybe I just \n                         needed a woman.\n\n               Toby comes in, decked out in plaid and stripes.

And \n                         I'm a very spiritual person. You \n                         know, you should try believing in \n                         something bigger than yourself.

Seated in an ultra-yuppie \n               restaurant filled with business lunchers, Harvey and Joyce \n               hide behind their menus. While everyone else looks slick and \n               successful, these two compete for the world's worst posture. \n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         What's wrong?\n\n                                     JOYCE\n                         Nothing.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         Somethin's wrong.

And \n                         this movie has uplifted me. There's \n                         this one scene where a nerd grabs \n                         the microphone during a pep rally \n                         and announces that he is a nerd and \n                         that he is proud of it and stands up \n                         for the rights of other nerds. Then, \n                         he asks the kids at the pep rally \n                         who think they are nerds to come \n                         forward... So nearly everyone in the \n                         place does. That's the way the movie \n                         ends.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         So the nerds won, huh?\n\n                                     TOBY\n                              (smiling)\n                         Yes.\n\n               Harvey grabs the rest of Toby's fries and opens the door to \n               leave.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         Wow.

The \n               sound of Joyce's voice fades until it seems like a distant \n               echo.\n\n               Then PANELS from Harvey's comics begin to float over his \n               head, his life literally passing before his eyes in comic \n               book form.\n\n               Slowly, the comic images and the unconscious Harvey evaporate, \n               giving way to:\n\n               GREEN SCREEN\n\n               A SURREAL DREAM SEQUENCE\n\n               We are now in a large, empty room similar to a blank comic \n               book panel.\n\n               A healthy, fully dressed Harvey appears in the corner of the \n               frame.

Therefore, his was a purer \n                         listing.\n\n               We see Harvey age in the images: he's hanging on the street \n               corner with friends, collecting records, hanging with Crumb.\n\n                                     HARVEY\n                         Then, in the seventies, I noticed \n                         that a third Harvey Pekar was listed \n                         in the phone book!

She pointed out \n                         an obituary notice in the newspaper \n                         for a man named Harvey Pekar. One of \n                         his sons was named Harvey. These \n                         were the other Harvey Pekars.\n\n               The comic images fade out.

Although I'd met neither man, \n                         I was filled with sadness. \"What \n                         were they like,\" I thought. It seemed \n                         that our lives had been linked in \n                         some indefinable way.\n\n               We slowly move in on his face. Extremely close.
