He sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer\n\twith a huge smile on his face. It's a frozen smile that\n\tdoesn't seem to be affected by too much in particular--like a\n\ttour guide at Disneyland.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN'S VOICE (OS)\n\t\tHello darling.\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tMRS. GEORGE PARKER (BETTY) enters, untying the back of her\n\tapron. She is a vision of '50s beauty with a thin figure and\n\tconcrete hair. Betty crosses to her husband and hands him a\n\tfresh martini.

NIGHT.\n\n\t1996 -- (LIVING COLOR)\n\n\tDAVID WAGNER sits on his couch watching this entire action on\n\ta sleek new Sony T.V. He stares riveted at the set with a big\n\tsmile on his face.

You sure know the way to\n\t\tthis man's heart.\n\n\tThere is a loud and inappropriate LAUGH TRACK. David smiles\n\twider and is just about to reach for more corn chips, when\n\this real MOTHER'S VOICE rings out from the other room.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID'S MOM (OS)\n\t\t... Bullshit Barry, that wasn't the\n\t\tdeal\n\n\tINT.

Beepers and nose rings--blue hair\n\tand tattoos. Dissonant boom boxes compete with one another.\n\tThe hormones are running crazy.\n\n\tSCHOOL COURTYARD.\n\n\tlt is a large open area, alive at lunchtime. Groups of kids\n\thang out together, divided by their various cliques. The\n\tmusic pounds in the background.\n\n\tCLOSE UP. DAVID.\n\n\tHe stands at one end of the courtyard beside a chain link\n\tfence. Beads of sweat form on David's forehead as he speaks\n\tto someone in front of him.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tHi. I mean ...\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t... Hi.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE.\n\n\tA very pretty blonde girl smiles back at him. It's a warm,\n\twelcoming smile.\n\n\tCLOSE UP. DAVID.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tLook. You probably don't think I should\n\t\tbe asking you this. I mean--not knowing\n\t\tyou well and all ...\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE.

DAVID.\n\n\tInstead of smiling back, David just stares, then looks at the\n\tground.\n\n\tWIDE ANGLE. SCHOOLYARD.\n\n\tFor the first time WE SEE THAT SHE WASN'T TALKING TO HIM.\n\tDavid stands a good hundred yards across the schoolyard,\n\trehearsing this speech while the young woman stands face to\n\tface with a much cooler boy. He has a cell phone and a very\n\thip haircut.\n\n\tANGLE. DAVID.\n\n\tDavid watches as the girl throws her arm around the boy's\n\twaist and heads out of the playground ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. \"LUNCHEON COURT\". DAY.\n\n\tDavid and his friends are all gathered around the plastic\n\tpicnic tables and vending machines that form the luncheon\n\tcourt. The chess club meets at one end and there are some\n\tteachers at the other. All the cool kids are on the other\n\tside of the fence but David and his friends eat lunch at the\n\tsame table every day.\n\n\t\t\t\tHOWARD\n\t\tOkay, whose window did Bud break when he\n\t\twas playing with his father's golf\n\t\tclubs?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tEasy.

You'll win this\n\t\tthing for sure. When is it on?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tMarathon starts at 6:30. Contest's\n\t\ttomorrow at noon.\n\n\t\t\t\tHOWARD\n\t\t\t(weighing it)\n\t\tA thousand dollars ... And it's on all\n\t\tnight?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tOf course it is Howard. That's why they\n\t\tcall it a Marathon.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.\n\n\tDavid's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the\n\tparking lot. All the girls are dressed in the exact same\n\tuniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white V-neck T\n\tshirt, car keys in their hand. (Even the girls WITHOUT a car\n\thold car keys in their hand). Jennifer is by far the\n\tprettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. They all\n\tlook toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends\n\tare hanging out.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\tOmigod, it's so mortifying, being\n\t\trelated to him. I can't believe you're\n\t\tlike--\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tOnly on my parent's side.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY\n\t\tI know, but you're like ... twins and\n\t\tstuff.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tYou must be from like, the cool side of\n\t\tthe uterus.\n\n\tA group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They\n\tbop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen\n\tyear olds. The girls freeze when they see them.\n\n\t\t\t\tKIMMY (CONT)\n\t\tOmigod, omigod--here they come.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHRISTIN\n\t\tDon't do anything.

Jennifer slides sinuously\n\toff the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young\n\tracehorse. She has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole\n\tparking lot knows it. Mark heads over to her, followed by his\n\tlackies. The two groups meet at the tail-gate of the Nissan\n\tPathfinder like a small summit conference.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARK\n\t\t\t(to Jennifer)\n\t\tHey.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(right back)\n\t\tHey.\n\n\tBeat ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMARK'S LACKEYS\n\t\t\t(to Jennifer's lackies)\n\t\tHey.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER'S LACKEYS\n\t\t\t(back to them)\n\t\tHey.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARK\n\t\tSaw you at the mall yesterday.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tYeah ...

The import of the thing isn't lost\n\ton anybody. Mark bobs up and down a little faster.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARK\n\t\tSo uh ... Maybe we could uh ...\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tCool.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARK\n\t\t\t(nodding faster)\n\t\tCool.\n\n\t\t\t\tVARIOUS LACKEYS\n\t\tCool.\n\n\tEverybody bobs and shuffles for \u0094 beat, when Mark nods,\n\tsummoning his flock.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. WAGNER HOUSE. DUSK.\n\n\tlt is a south-westem version of \"Leave it to Beaver.\" The\n\tuniformity of Suburbia has been washed in earth tones. There\n\tis a red tile roof gracing every home. All the houses have\n\tthe same anemic palm tree. It's a urban planner's version of\n\thell.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER (VO)\n\t\t... I know, I know--He's just like so\n\t\tFINE ... I'm still like: \"Omigod.\"\n\n\tINT. WAGNER HOME.\n\n\tlt is just as sleek and impersonal as before. Maybe more so\n\tat night. Jennifer crosses through the living room with the\n\tcordless phone attached to her ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tIt was amazing, Daph ... I'm like:\n\t\t\"Well my Mom'll be out of town.\" And\n\t\the's like \"Well then, maybe we could--\n\t\tyou know ...\" And I'm like \"Yeah, sure.\"\n\t\tAnd he's like \"Well, cool.\"\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI know, he's just so smart.\n\t\t\t(pause ...)\n\t\tI don't know.

Well I'm jealous of you too\n\t\tsometimes.\n\n\tINT. DAVID'S BEDROOM.\n\n\tlt is studious and academic--not joyless, but not colorful\n\teither. David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside\n\twith a cordless phone in his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t... He's not homeless Howard, they just\n\t\tdon't say where he lives.\n\t\t\t(pause ...)\n\t\tWell it's a silly question.\n\t\t\t(pause ...)\n\t\tBecause nobody's homeless in\n\t\tPleasantville.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE.

WAGNER LIVING ROOM.\n\n\tThe huge black TV sits like a monolith in the middle of the\n\troom. All at once David comes bounding down the stairs making\n\ta B-Iine for the couch. Jennifer enters just as quickly from\n\tthe other direction, fiddling with her clothes.\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE.\n\n\tThey hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at\n\texactly the same moment. Both of them freeze then look up at\n\teach other in shock.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(stunned)\n\t\tWhat are you doing?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWhat are you doing?\n\n\tNeither one moves. They clutch the remote together.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tDavid, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna\n\t\tlike be here in five minutes.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWell great.

You can watch TV upstairs.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tUpstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any\n\t\tSTEREO!\n\n\tJennifer gets panicked and yanks at the remote. David yanks\n\tback and before they know it, the remote goes flying out of\n\ttheir hands, CRASHING onto the hardwood floor. lt smashes\n\tinto a million tiny pieces.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(breathless)\n\t\tOh my God ...\n\t\t\t(sinking to his knees/\n\t\t\tscooping up the remains)\n\t\tOh my God ...\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tDavid, stop stressing, you can like--\n\t\tturn it on normally ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tNo you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It\n\t\tdoesn't work without a remote.\n\n\tDavid cradles the pieces like a fallen comrade, when the\n\tDOORBELL RINGS behind him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tOh my God! He's here!\n\n\tJennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa\n\tand tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door. David\n\tjust stares in shock at the shattered plastic. Jennifer\n\treaches the front door and wets her lips. She fluffs her hair\n\tquickly, sticks out her chest then swings it open.\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE. FRONT DOOR.\n\n\tJennifer steps forward with her sexiest smile, but it isn't\n\tMark Davis on the other side. DICK VAN DYKE STANDS ACROSS THE\n\tTHRESHOLD IN A TV REPAIRMAN'S OUTFIT. Jennifer looks at him\n\tpuzzled. He steps forward, flashing her a chipper grin,\n\ttoolbox in hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tTV repair.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tTV repair?\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tYeah.

DAVID'S POV.\n\n\tHe glances out the front door toward a weird VAN parked at\n\tthe curb. It says TV REPAIR on the side but looks like\n\tsomething from a medicine show. The antenna on top resembles\n\ta weather vane and the mural beneath it depicts a happy\n\tfamily from the 1950s, gathered around their TV set. Everyone\n\twears a smile, including the dog. The hand-painted motto\n\treads \"Rob's TV Repair--WE'LL FIX YOU FOR GOOD.\"\n\n\tINT. LIVING ROOM.\n\n\tDavid looks back at Dick Van Dyke who smiles at him, then\n\tcrosses to the living room STEPPING NIMBLY AROUND THE\n\tOTTOMAN. He heads toward the TV.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\t\t(seeing the smashed remote)\n\t\tHoly cow. Look at that. Had a little\n\t\tdisaster didn't ya fella.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tYeah ...

It's a\n\tstrange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash\n\tGordon ray gun. Dick Van Dyke extends it with pride, while\n\tJennifer and David stare at him warily ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tHow much does it cost?\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tOh--couldn't charge you for something\n\t\tlike that.

Dick starts across the living room when he\n\tsuddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and\n\ttumbles end over end. He rolls on the carpet, executes a\n\tperfect somersault and comes right back to a standing\n\tposition.

David and Jennifer look at one another while the\n\tfront door shuts with a THUD. It's quiet for a second or two\n\tbefore there is another CLAP OF THUNDER. David cocks his\n\thead.\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE.\n\n\tDavid glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the\n\tcoffee table. It looks a little scary. Slowly, very slowy, he\n\treaches down and touches it. Nothing seems to happen so he\n\tpicks it up.\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tDavid points the remote toward the TV set with an\n\tapprehensive look on his face.

It looks like a\n\tLeni Riefenstahl movie.\n\n\tANGLE. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.\n\n\tDavid stands beside Jennifer looking at the entrance to the\n\tschool. Three girls huddle together by the front steps.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tThose are my friends.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tPeggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(staring at them)\n\t\tCan we do any better?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI don't think so.\n\n\t\t\t\tLISA ANNE\n\t\t\t(seeing her)\n\t\tMary Sue.

GEOGRAPHY CLASS. LATER ...\n\n\tIt looks like a propaganda film from the Eisenhower\n\tAdministration. The boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve\n\tbutton down shirts. The girls all have lacy dresses buttoned\n\tto the neck. Everyone stares straight ahead at the\n\tblackboard.\n\n\tANGLE. FRONT OF THE ROOM. TEACHER.\n\n\tMiss Peters stands in front of the class with a pointer in\n\ther hand. She indicates a diagram that spans the length of\n\tthe blackboard.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS PETERS\n\t\tLast week Class, we discussed the\n\t\tgeography of Main Street.

It's not as long.\n\t\tAlso, it only has houses. So the\n\t\tgeography of Main Street is different\n\t\tthan the geography of Elm Street.\n\n\tANGLE. JENNIFER.\n\n\tShe glances around at several students who seem to be nodding\n\tin agreement. All at once, she thrusts her hand into the air.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS PETERS\n\t\tMary Sue.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tWhat's outside of Pleasantville?\n\n\tThe teacher looks at her with a puzzled frozen smile on her\n\tface.

What's at\n\t\tthe end of Main Street?\n\n\tThe class lets out a knowing groan--as if to say \"Oh. We get\n\tit now. Boy what a stupid question.\" Miss Peters gives a kind\n\tbut condescending look.\n\n\t\t\t\tMISS PETERS\n\t\tOh, Mary Sue. You should know the answer\n\t\tto that. The end of Main Street is just\n\t\tthe beginning again.\n\n\tMiss Peters gives a big grin as a series of heads nod up and\n\tdown.

DAY.\n\n\tThere are fifteen to twenty boys scattered around the Gym.\n\tEach is dressed identically in white shorts and black socks\n\twith a \"PLEASANTVILLE\" jersey.\n\n\tSHOT. DAVID.\n\n\tHe stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his\n\thand. (Not exactly an athletic image.) David lets go of a\n\tjump shot that swishes effortlessly through the net. He looks\n\ta little surprised.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWow.\n\n\tHe stares at the backboard slightly intrigued. David\n\tretrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it\n\tup blind. The ball sails through the hoop again, HITTING\n\tNOTHING BUT NET.\n\n\tFULL SHOT. OTHER SIDE OF THE GYM.\n\n\tTen to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the\n\thoop. ALL OF THE SHOTS SAIL THROUGH THE HOOP, NONE EVEN\n\tNICKING THE RIM. The boys retrieve their shots as the coach\n\tclaps his hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOACH\n\t\tThat's it men. Keep it up. Big game\n\t\ttomorrow.\n\n\tANGLE. DAVID.\n\n\tHe gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely.\n\tDavid flings the ball wildly over his shoulder. It bounces\n\toff all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as\n\tsmoothly as the others. He stares in amazement.\n\n\t\t\t\tBIFF (OS)\n\t\tBud ...\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tBiff Martin (the boy in the convertible) approaches from the\n\tother side of the Gym.

The ball does a couple of\n\trevolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out.\n\n\tWIDE ANGLE. GYM.\n\n\tPlay comes to a halt. ALL THE PLAYERS TURN AND STARE,\n\tDUMBSTRUCK AT THE SIGHT OF A MISSED SHOT.\n\n\tSHOT. DAVID.\n\n\tHe retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to Biff.\n\tDavid pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other\n\tside of the gym.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(under his breath)\n\t\tLook, I'm sure we'll work something out.\n\t\tI'll talk to her or something.\n\n\tBiff looks at him, troubled.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tHonest.

Under the sweater she wears a 1950's \"bullet\n\tbra\" that turn her breasts into lethal weapons.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(looking in the mirror)\n\t\tI could like kill a guy with these\n\t\tthings.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tIt's in your closet.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(examining her profile)\n\t\tI've worn some kinky stuff before ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tHe won't notice anyway.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tThey don't notice that kind of thing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tSo what's the point?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tJen please ...\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tHe-llo?

Johnny\n\tMathis drifts out into the evening air ...\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tDavid comes sprinting up to the screen door and pauses to get\n\this breath. He adjusts a little soda jerk's hat, then plunges\n\tinside.\n\n\tINT. SODA SHOP.\n\n\tMr. Johnson, the owner and proprietor is wiping down the\n\tcounter. He is a \"pleasant\" looking man, in his early forties\n\twearing a white apron and black glasses.

He runs a comb through his short blonde\n\thair before grabbing the bouquet of flowers next to him and\n\theading up the walk. Biff rings the doorbell and, a moment\n\tlater, Jennifer's silhouette appears in the doorway ...\n\n\t\t\t\tBIFF\n\t\tOh. Mary Sue ...\n\n\tEXT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.\n\n\tThe place is really hopping now. All the spots in the parking\n\tlot are filled with vintage \"jalopies\" and several patrons\n\tare streaming through the door. The SAME JOHNNY MATHIS SONG\n\tis still PLAYING on the juke box, and the neon ice cream soda\n\tsign blinks against the sky.\n\n\tINT. SODA SHOP.\n\n\tDavid is trapped behind the counter, furiously working to\n\tkeep up with the load. Several clean cut teenagers pepper him\n\twith orders while he yanks at the pumps and spiggots. It's\n\tclear he isn't used to this.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(frazzled)\n\t\tPeppermint shake, chocolate soda, two\n\t\torders of fries and a split?\n\n\t\t\t\tTEEN AGE GIRL\n\t\tPeppermint soda, two chocolate shakes,\n\t\torder of fries, and we'll split it.\n\n\tDavid nods quickly, wiping some sweat from his brow.

It's fine.\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE. SODA SHOP ENTRANCE.\n\n\tThe screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a\n\tLetterman's sweater. A moment later, Jennifer sashays\n\tthrough, parading her new Jane Russell profile. Her\n\t\"girlfriends\" TITTER from the comer as Biff rushes up to a\n\ttable, and pulls out a chair. She sashays into it, brushing\n\tagainst him as she goes.\n\n\tANGLE. DAVID.\n\n\tHe stares motionless at the spectacle--concerned and\n\tapprehensive. David holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda\n\tspiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all\n\tover his chest.\n\n\tFULL SHOT.

Biff GUFFAWS for a moment or two\n\tthen glances down at the table top. There is a momentary\n\tbreak in the Music as Johnny Mathis' \"MISTY\" starts up all\n\tover again. It's enough to make you shoot yourself.\n\n\t\t\t\tBIFF (CONT)\n\t\tSo I know I haven't been steady with\n\t\tanybody, but I just don't want to rush\n\t\tit.

STOREROOM.\n\n\tIt is just as cheery as the rest of the place. There is a\n\tsmall table with a telephone on it. A Texaco calendar shows a\n\thappy family motoring in their Rambler.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWhat did you say?\n\n\tMr. Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR.

He stares at Mr. Johnson, then tries\n\tto speak softly.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tLook, you can't always like what you do.\n\t\tSometimes you just do it because it's\n\t\tyour job. And even if you don't like it,\n\t\tyou just gotta do it anyway.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(exasperated)\n\t\tSo they can have their hamburgers!\n\n\tThis sounds stupid even to David. He shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR.

The next\n\t\tI do Santa's workshop. Here I'll show\n\t\tyou.\n\n\tHe pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens\n\tit for David.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(impressed)\n\t\tWow ... That's pretty good ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tThanks.\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tBut this morning I was thinking about\n\t\tit and I realized that I looked forward\n\t\tto it all year.

That's a good point, Ralph. They\n\t\tdo have that saying.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tBut they do win 'em all, Gus. They've\n\t\talways won 'em all.\n\n\t\t\t\tGUS\n\t\tWell, yeah.

A\n\tbeat goes by ...\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY (CONT)\n\t\tWhat's sex?\n\n\tJennifer looks over at her stunned, but Betty just looks at\n\ther with a blank, curious expression.

He wears long sleeve pajamas that are\n\tbuttoned up to the neck. George puts his glass of warm milk\n\ton the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed.

Betty's heart beats a\n\tlittle faster as she HEARS the WATER THUNDERING DOWN.\n\n\tCLOSER STILL ...\n\n\tBetty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top\n\tof her robe. She slips it off, and lets it drop to the floor,\n\tstanding naked in the middle of the bathroom. Betty glances\n\ttoward the mirror and then quickly glances away. She takes a\n\tdeep breath and steps into the tub.\n\n\tEVEN TIGHTER. ON HER FACE ...\n\n\tBetty slides down into the warm water, breathing in the\n\tsteam, and closing her eyes for a moment. She lingers like\n\tthat for a second or two, before settling a little lower in\n\tthe tub. Betty opens her eyes, but they only half open. There\n\tis the slight trace of a smile.\n\n\tEXTREME CLOSE UP BETTY'S FACE.\n\n\tHer eyes close again as she bites her lower lip gently.

A\n\tsmall CROWD has gathered in front of the fire. (They don't\n\tseem frightened--just sort of amazed.)

The Fire Chief looks\n\taround ...\n\n\t\t\t\tFIRE CHIEF\n\t\tWhere is it?\n\n\tDavid shoots him a look then glances at the inferno. He\n\tshakes his head and leaps from the truck.\n\n\tFOLLOWING DAVID.\n\n\tHe races around to the back where the other firemen are\n\tstanding just as confused. David grabs one of the hoses and\n\tbegins to pull it from the truck.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tHere!

DUSK.\n\n\tDavid heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat.\n\tThe BUDDY HOLLY music has given way to \"hip\" '50s JAZZ. DAVE\n\tBRUBECK drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a\n\tmoment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside.\n\n\tSODA SHOP.\n\n\tThe place has \"morphed\" even more. If it was a teenage\n\thangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house\n\tnow. Brubeck's \"TAKE FIVE\" plays in the background while\n\tseveral patrons talk \"intensely\" in their booths.\n\n\tDOORWAY.\n\n\tDavid walks into the building and pauses. Next to him, one of\n\tthe boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz\n\ton a BONGO DRUM.

I didn't know how to\n\t\thandle it. So ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tSure.\n\n\tHe crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at\n\thim.

The boy leans forward.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOY\n\t\tAnd where's that?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(carefully)\n\t\tUm ... Outside of Pleasantville.\n\n\tThis sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids.\n\tIt's like electricity. They glance excited at one another.

KITCHEN.\n\n\tDavid gets a couple of steps in and stops. He looks across\n\tthe room to see:\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE.\n\n\tBetty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the\n\twindow. Her back is to him. She grips the formica kitchen\n\tcounter.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(approaching slowly)\n\t\tAre you okay?\n\n\tShe doesn't answer. David moves up to her and rests a hand on\n\ther shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tAre you alright?\n\n\tBetty turns around to face him. HER FACE HAS TURNED\n\tCOMPLETELY TO COLOR. THE EYES ARE GREEN. THE LIPS ARE RED.\n\tSHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole\n\tthing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the\n\ttear stains on either side of her face.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\t(fighting tears)\n\t\tWhat am I going to do?\n\n\tDavid moves closer and looks at her.

David pushes a reassuring smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tHave you got any make up?\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\tIn my handbag.\n\n\tHe crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits\n\tBetty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for\n\ther compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tOkay--first we'll dry you out a little.\n\n\tHe dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude,\n\tThen David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY\n\tpowder puff.\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tIt is a truly amazing sight. As David smears on the makeup,\n\tshe returns gradually to BLACK AND WHITE. The skin tones\n\tdisappear. The flush of her cheeks goes. David takes out a\n\tDARK GRAY lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE. OVER BETTY'S SHOULDER.\n\n\tHe works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back.\n\tAll at once, David seems to wince:\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. BETTY'S FACE.\n\n\tThe life is gone from her face. In an instant Betty has gone\n\tfrom three dimensions to two. She stands in front of him, the\n\tfictional version of herself all over again.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\t(off his reaction)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\tDavid shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the\n\tcompact so she can examine herself.

They won't be able to tell.\n\n\tBetty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the\n\tplate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before\n\tshe goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide\n\t\"stewardess\" smile ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tWait.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\t(turning back)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\tHe wants to say something, but doesn't.

It's quiet, and subtle, but it's still a\n\tgasp. David looks over at him but he's lost in the pages.\n\n\tHIS POV. (INSERT) ART BOOK ...\n\n\tMassacio's \"Expulsion of Adam and Eve' leaps off the pages in\n\tvibrant, tortured color. The beauty of the garden is offset\n\tby their agony and their shame. HE TURNS THE PAGE ...\n\n\tTitian's \"Venus to Utano\". Soft, fleshy, in a rich golden\n\tlight. She is utterly real and entirely nude. The folds of\n\ther flesh almost seem to glow ...\n\n\tRembrandt's \"Self Portrait.\" Dark reds, umbers, blacks and\n\tbrowns. He looks back at Mr. Johnson with pain and wisdom.\n\tThere's a brilliant light on his hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON (OS)\n\t\tMmmmgh ...\n\n\tFaintly, almost imperceptibly, the SOUND of a rich ARIA\n\tbegins to UNDERSCORE THE IMAGES. It's so faint you can't be\n\tsure you even hear it at all ... like you're hearing it with\n\tyour eyes.\n\n\tHe TURNS THE PAGES faster. Breugal's \"Harvesters\" ... Tumees\n\t\"Steam Train\" ... Monet's \"Cathedralo\" ... Cezanne's\n\t\"Oranges\" ... Mr. Johnson shuts the book.\n\n\tWIDER. SODA SHOP.\n\n\tThey sit like that for a beat.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR.

David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just\n\tsmiles and shrugs.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tMust be awfully lucky to see colors\n\t\tlike that.

I just ...\n\t\t\t(out of the blue)\n\t\tCan I ask you a question?\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tSure.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tRemember when you told me that Lisa\n\t\tRosenberg liked me?\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tYeah ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWell--did she really like me or were\n\t\tyou just making that up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tNo. She really liked you.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tYou weren't playing a joke? She\n\t\twoulda gone out with me?\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tGone out with you. She woulda like\n\t\trearranged your tonsils.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWow.\n\n\tHe looks at her amazed--reliving the missed opportunity.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tCan I ask you a question?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tHow come I'm still in black and white?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(back to earth)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tWell I've had like ten times as\n\t\tmuch sex as these girls and I'm\n\t\tstill like this.

Maybe ...\n\t\t\t(thinks)\n\t\t... it's not just the sex ...\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(looking up quickly)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\tShe stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard\n\ttheir name called. Jennifer's eyes dart around like she's\n\tcalculating a math problem. After a moment or two, her\n\texpression changes: a vague look of recognition.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER (CONT)\n\t\tNo, it's not just the sex, is it?\n\n\tShe glances down at her book. It's a big book. Jennifer takes\n\ta deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand. After\n\ta second or two, she looks back. David looks at her for a\n\tbeat ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. MARGARET HENDERSON'S HOUSE. (MAPLE STREET) DAY.\n\n\tDavid gets out of his \"dad's\" convertible, carrying a dozen\n\t\"gray\" roses. He takes a deep breath and heads up her front\n\twalk ...\n\n\tINT. CAR. NIGHT. LATER ...\n\n\tDavid sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with Margaret\n\tHenderson by his side. He concentrates hard on the road,\n\tholding the wheel at \"10 and 2\" as he steals a glance to his\n\tright.\n\n\tHIS POV. MARGARET.\n\n\tIt's not quite evening yet, and late afternoon light makes\n\ther glow. Margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm\n\twind that swirls inside the convertible ...\n\n\tSHOT. DAVID.\n\n\tHe studies her for a moment or two, then suddenly swerves to\n\tavoid a parked car on his right ...\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tThey pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads:\n\n\t\"NOW LEAVING PLEASANTVILLE\"\n\n\tMain Street turns into a winding country road as they leave\n\tthe town behind and head off into the woods. They wind\n\tthrough the dense woodland for a moment or two before a\n\tsecond sign appears, much like the first:\n\n\t\"NOW ENTERING PLEASANTVILLE\"\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.\n\n\tSure enough, the town emerges in front of them again,\n\tcompleting the 4 dimensional circle. David looks confused.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET\n\t\tUm ... You gotta turn off Main Street.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tOh ... Right.\n\n\tHe looks over at her and smiles. Margaret turns on the radio.\n\n\tEXT. CAR. DUSK.\n\n\tSAM COOKE sings for them as David turns from Main Street onto\n\ta smaller unmarked lane. The car starts to rise up a small\n\thill, with Dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road.\n\tIt continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the\n\tcrest in the hill. David looks over at Margaret who takes a\n\tdeep breath shutting her eyes. He glances down at the seat\n\tbetween them ...\n\n\tHIS POV. CAR SEAT.\n\n\tTHE ROSES THAT WERE GRAY HAVE SUDDENLY TURNED TO COLOR. They\n\tsit next to him on the seat: a deep, rich RED ...\n\n\tINT. CAR.\n\n\tDavid looks up and out the windshield. The same thing seems\n\tto be happening around them ... Many of the Dogwoods have\n\tstarted to turn PINK. Not all of them, but at least fifty\n\tpercent of the petals have \"bloomed\" in some weird false\n\tspring. The road twists and turns on its way to the top, as\n\tthey finally reach a crest in the hill.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWow.\n\n\tTHEIR POV. LOVERS LANE.\n\n\tThere, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone\n\tTechnicolor: THE LAKE IS BLUER THAN BLUE. THE WEEPING WILLOW\n\tIS GREENER THAN GREEN.

CAR.\n\n\tSlowly, David rolls the convertible forward. Many of the kids\n\thave left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by\n\tthe edge of the water. A few of them have books open. It\n\talmost looks \"Athenian.\"\n\n\tINT. CAR.\n\n\tDavid looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly\n\tcocks his head to the side.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWhat's that smell?\n\n\tMargaret looks at him and smiles. She leans well out of the\n\tconvertible, and plucks a Gardenia from a bush that is\n\tblooming beside the car.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET\n\t\tAren't these great?\n\n\tDavid takes the flower, then puts it up to his nose. He takes\n\ta long deep breath then all at once, his posture seems to\n\trelax. As the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like\n\tsome strange narcotic is washing over him. David lowers the\n\tflower ...\n\n\tEXT. MAIN STREET. DUSK.\n\n\tBetty is walking down Main Street with a shopping bag on\n\teither hand. From a block away, she looks like any other\n\thomemaker in Pleasantville. You don't even notice the gray\n\tmake-up.\n\n\tCLOSER. FOLLOWING BETTY.\n\n\tShe nods to Mrs. Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in\n\tthe Post Office. Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street\n\twhen she glances up, and suddenly stops.\n\n\tHER POV. ACROSS THE STREET.\n\n\tThere, in the middle of the block, sits Mr. Johnson's soda\n\tshop. The whole scene is still black and white, except for\n\tthe large CUBIST PAINTING THAT FILLS MR. JOHNSON'S WINDOW. It\n\tis rendered in bright PINKS, YELLOWS AND ORANGES, and looks\n\tlike a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject\n\tmatter. Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres\n\tand cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist\n\tSanta hovering over the roof tops.\n\n\tSHOT. BETTY.\n\n\tShe stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to\n\twander across the street. It's late afternoon and the\n\tbusiness district is empty. Betty crosses in the middle of\n\tthe block, staring straight ahead.\n\n\tINT. SODA SHOP.\n\n\tThe door opens and she sticks her head inside. Most of the\n\tplace is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining\n\tthrough the window near the back of the store. Betty glances\n\taround. The little bell JINGLES as she enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON (OS)\n\t\tWe're closed right now ...\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE.\n\n\tHe sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a\n\tboard which doubles as a canvas.

JOHNSON\n\t\tNo, no ... Come on in.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE.\n\n\tHe gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still\n\tholding the palette in his hand. Betty stares at the \"Cubist\n\tChristmas\" in the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\tI just thought ... It's beautiful.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tThanks.\n\n\tTheir eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr.\n\tJohnson motions toward his easel.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON (CONT)\n\t\tI was just trying to do one of these\n\t\t\"still lifes.\"\n\n\tHe sighs and looks behind him. Next to the easel is a bowl of\n\tGRAY FRUIT.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON (CONT)\n\t\tHaving kind of a tough time.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\tI think it looks nice.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tWell ...\n\t\t\t(shrugs)\n\t\tHere's what it's s'posed to look like.\n\n\tHe leads her over to the table and points down at the art\n\tbook. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\tOh my ...\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tThey are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at\n\tthe book. Neither one of them moves. Betty almost disappears\n\tinto the pictures--drawn by a strange new world.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tHere. Look at this.\n\n\tHe turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color. The image is\n\tnearly electric.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\t(breathless)\n\t\tWhere'd you get this?\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tBud brought it to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\tBud?\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tHere's my favorite.\n\n\tINSERT. BOOK.\n\n\tHe turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's \"Weeping\n\tWomen.\" The woman is rendered in pink and red and green. Her\n\thead is a large sphere, laying \"peacefully\" on her own\n\tshoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n\tShe doesn't answer ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMR.

JOHNSON\n\t\tNo she's not.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\tYes she is.\n\n\tHe looks up at her ...\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE.\n\n\tA single tear is running down Betty's cheek. She senses it\n\tand reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just\n\twiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of GRAY MAKE-UP.\n\tA long strip of PINK FLESH is revealed underneath.\n\n\tANGLE. MR. JOHNSON.\n\n\tHe stares up at her in amazement.\n\n\tANGLE. BETTY.\n\n\tShe senses something and glances down at her hand. Her\n\tfingertips are covered in GRAY MAKE-UP. Betty turns and bolts\n\tfor the door.\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\t\t(following her)\n\t\tWait ...\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\tI've got to go ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tIt's alright.\n\n\tHe stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the\n\twall. Mr. Johnson touches her shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON (CONT)\n\t\tIt's alright. Let me see.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\t(shame)\n\t\tNo ...\n\n\tHe reaches up and gently touches her chin. Mr. Johnson moves\n\taround to glimpse the other side of her cheek.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tIt's beautiful.\n\n\tCLOSER ...\n\n\tShe freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly,\n\tturns toward him. THE COLOR of her real flesh is revealed\n\tunderneath. Betty stands there exposed.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\t... It's beautiful.\n\n\tShe swallows, not sure what to do. Betty glances down.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON (CONT)\n\t\tYou shouldn't cover that up.\n\n\tMr. Johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on\n\tthe counter and pulls one out. He leans forward and dabs at\n\tthe tears beneath Betty's eyes. Then slowly, gently, he\n\tstarts to wipe the makeup off her cheek.\n\n\tCLOSER STILL ...\n\n\tShe recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him. Mr.\n\tJohnson is gazing at her \"true color\" with wonder and\n\tacceptance. She hesitates for an instant, then seems to make\n\ta decision. Betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing\n\ther flesh all the way down to the neck. Mr. Johnson continues\n\tto wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the\n\tbeautiful pink flesh begins to emerge ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\tINT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM. NIGHT.\n\n\tShe lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing\n\tearlier. Jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the\n\tpages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word. After a\n\tmoment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting\n\tthe book. The cover is plainly visible: \"LADY CHATTERLY'S\n\tLOVER.\"\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tShe doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed\n\tand crosses to \"her\" desk. She sits in the chair and flattens\n\tthe book in front of her. Jennifer is deep into the plot and\n\tdoesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. She\n\tcould almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the\n\tlittle desk.\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE.\n\n\tShe flips the page and peers more intently. Her hair is\n\tbothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony\n\ttail. After a little while her eyes begin to get more tired\n\tand she looks up and blinks a couple of times. Jennifer\n\tnotices something across the desk.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE.\n\n\tA pair of Mary Sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of\n\ther. Jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances\n\tback down at the print.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(impressed)\n\t\tHunh.\n\n\tShe can see much clearer now. Jennifer folds her hands in\n\tfront of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked\n\tthe PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY SUE THAT SITS BESIDE HER IN A SILVER\n\tFRAME. The face is the same, but that's to be expected. So is\n\tthe pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look\n\ton her face. Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel\n\twhen there is a loud TAP on the window.\n\n\tShe rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. Jennifer\n\tslides open the window.\n\n\tEXT.

JENNIFER'S ROOM.\n\n\tShe hesitates for a second then glances back at the desk. Her\n\town image in the silver frame stares back at her. The hair is\n\tpulled back in a pony tail. The glasses sit on the front of\n\ther nose.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\t\t(turning to Biff)\n\t\tI'm studying.\n\n\tShe thinks about it for a moment, then suddenly smiles.

She shifts on\n\tthe grass hiking her skirt up above the knee. It reveals a\n\tlong tan leg beneath it. David watches as she kicks off her\n\tshoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET (CONT)\n\t\tSo what's it like?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tOut there.\n\n\tShe clings onto the words like they could transport her by\n\tthemselves.

And scarier I\n\t\tguess ... And ... and a lot more\n\t\tdangerous ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET\n\t\tSounds fantastic. You know some kids\n\t\tcame up here the other night to go\n\t\tswimming--took off all their clothes.\n\n\tShe giggles.

It's hot up here.\n\n\tSuddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan\n\tsweater. She slips it off, arching her back like the\n\tfigurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts.\n\tShe wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it\n\tforms a translucent silhouette ... She lays the sweater\n\tacross the grass and leans back on it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET (CONT)\n\t\tYou want some berries?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tHunh?\n\n\tShe unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in\n\tREDS AND BLUES AND PURPLES.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET\n\t\tI picked them myself.

There's a lot of stuff.\n\t\tCurrants and strawberries ... Here.\n\t\tI'll show you.\n\n\tShe hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her\n\theels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and\n\treaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a\n\tpiece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers\n\tback toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET (CONT)\n\t\tHere.\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tMargaret sticks out her hand, offering him a BRIGHT RED\n\tAPPLE.

Even though she sits in front of him\n\tfully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual\n\tnude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself\n\trevealed like that.

Of course you don't ...\n\n\tHe puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the\n\tgrassy slope. A dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank,\n\tlooking in terror at the water falling from the sky.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET\n\t\tWhat do we do?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(reaching the car)\n\t\tWe'll just put up the top.\n\n\tHe goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the\n\tcatch to release it. David leans into the back seat fishing\n\taround as the rain starts to pound harder.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET\n\t\tWhat top?\n\n\tHe looks back at her. No top either. David smiles, drenched\n\tin rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to\n\tshiver.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tIt's fine. Come on.\n\n\tHe leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the\n\tkids are clustered together.

There's nothing to be\n\t\tafraid of.\n\n\tThey look a little reassured and Margaret looks up at him\n\tpositively adoringly.

There is nothing bright and cheery\n\thowever. The floor lamps in each comer cast huge, looming\n\tshadows up the walls. The light at the podium bathes Big\n\tBob's face in a blinding splash of light.

She\n\tputs it back on her shoulder and turns a series of\n\tpirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points\n\ther face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a\n\tsummer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the\n\tcorner.\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tDavid grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly.

Up until now, things\n\t\tin Pleasantville have always been--\n\t\twell ... \"Pleasant.\" And, recently,\n\t\tcertain things have become ...\n\t\t\"Un-Pleasant.\" Now it seems to me\n\t\tthe first thing we have to do is to\n\t\tseparate out the things that are\n\t\tpleasant, from the things that are\n\t\t\"Un-Pleasant.\"\n\n\tThere is a loud murmur and nod of agreement ...\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB (CONT)\n\t\tGeorge, why don't you and Burt\n\t\ttake the lead on this.

NIGHT.\n\n\tMr. Johnson has scrubbed the snow scene from the window and\n\tstares with his palette at a blank pane of glass. There is a\n\tknock at the door ...\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tMr. Johnson puts down the paints and crosses to open it.\n\tBetty is standing in the doorway clutching her purse and a\n\t\"Lady Samsonite Weekender\" bag. She stares up into his eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tFULL SHOT. SHOP WINDOW. MORNING.\n\n\tBurt Campbell opens up the hardware store like he does every\n\tmorning, only today there is a slight difference. He swings\n\topen the door, puts out the rakes and shovels, then sets a\n\tnewly handwritten sign clearly in the front window:\n\n\t\"NO COLOREDS\"\n\n\tSERIES OF SHOTS. SHOP WINDOWS.\n\n\tAs the businesses are opened on Main Street, more and more\n\t\"NO COLOREDS\" signs appear in the windows: next to the\n\tdonuts ... by fishing poles ... beside the stationery\n\tsupplies ... Everything else looks frighteningly the same...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.\n\n\tJoey Anderson, the local paper boy, is finishing his morning\n\trounds. He reaches in his bag and tosses left toward the\n\tbakery. Then he throws right toward the post office. Then he\n\tturns left toward the soda shop, does a double take and slams\n\tinto a trash can ...\n\n\tWIDER. SODA SHOP.\n\n\tWhere Mr. Johnson had once painted his cubist snow scene,\n\tthere is a brand new painting that isn't cubist at all. A\n\tNUDE version of Betty graces the shop window--painted in\n\tcurving sensual brush strokes. Joey stops his bike and just\n\tstares in amazement. He gets up and rides away as fast as he\n\tpossibly can ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tMAIN STREET. LATER ...\n\n\tDavid is in a happy daze, wandering up Main Street and\n\tdoesn't even notice the crowd gathered outside Mr. Johnson's\n\tsoda shop. After a moment or two, he glances up and sees the\n\twindow ...\n\n\tCLOSER. DAVID.\n\n\tHis eyes go wide. The murmur of the crowd grows louder as\n\tstray derisive comments rise above the noise. David glances\n\tfrom the nude in window to the growing angry mob ...\n\n\tMAIN STREET. DAY.\n\n\tDavid goes tearing through the business district looking for\n\tany sign of his \"mother.\" He glances in the flower shop ...\n\ttoward the green grocer ... David is just about to turn on\n\tElm Street when a booming voice seems to come from the\n\tsky ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE (OS)\n\t\tBud ...\n\n\tDavid stops and looks to his right. There, in the window of\n\tthe Philco TV store, are twenty screens of various sizes\n\tdisplaying the image of Dick Van Dyke.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE (CONT)\n\t\tI want a word with you ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(scared)\n\t\tOh--well ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\t\t(BOOMING)\n\t\tNOW!\n\n\tThe sound reverberates like God Himself.

You know\n\t\thow rare that is?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(beat/\n\t\t\tquietly)\n\t\t... Only if they mean it.\n\n\tDick Van Dyke looks at him for a beat, then goes \"red\" in the\n\tface.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tOKAY.

TV SCREEN.\n\n\tAll at once a box appears in the upper right hand comer of\n\tthe screen containing the image of David and Margaret at\n\tLover's Lane. The VIDEOTAPE rolls forward as she extends the\n\tBRIGHT RED APPLE. David hesitates, then takes it, then puts\n\tit to his mouth and takes a bite.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\t\"YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS PLACE.\"\n\n\tThe image of David biting the apple PLAYS BACKWARDS AND\n\tFORWARDS like some football instant replay ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE (CONT)\n\t\tYOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE IN THIS\n\t\tPARADISE!\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tDavid just stares at the repeated images of Dick Van Dyke on\n\tthe TV screens.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\t\t(quickly)\n\t\tWhere's the remote control I gave\n\t\tyou?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tBecause you're coming home.

DAY.\n\n\tDavid sprints down the tree lined street toward his house.\n\tThe leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn GREEN\n\teven this far into town. David vaults over Mr. Simpson's\n\thedge and goes tearing up his front walk.\n\n\tINT. FOYER.\n\n\tThe door flies open and he rushes in, breathless. David\n\tglances around the house to make sure that it is empty. He\n\tcrosses into the living room.\n\n\tINT. LIVING ROOM.\n\n\tDavid rushes to the TV and grabs the remote. He looks down at\n\tit, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door.\n\n\tMAIN STREET. DAY.\n\n\tDavid moves quickly down Main Street looking for a place to\n\tstash the remote. He pauses in front of the Pleasantville\n\tTravel Agency. It has posters in the window depicting various\n\tdestinations in and around Pleasantville (the place doesn't\n\tsee much business). David bends down to stash the remote in a\n\tdrain pipe near the entrance when he hears VOICES from up the\n\tstreet.\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tDavid turns to see a small crowd up near the end of Main\n\tStreet. He sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to\n\this feet as the voices get louder.\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE.\n\n\tThe crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a\n\tgroup of young men who circle around her, taunting and\n\tharassing her. A moment later David can make out the face:\n\tBETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd\n\tcircles her like a pack of dogs.\n\n\tCLOSER. BETTY.\n\n\tThe ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the\n\tblack and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high\n\twith dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one\n\tanother \"Oooh--let's see the rest of you ... Let's see what's\n\tunder that nice blue dress ... Bet she's even pinker than her\n\tpicture ...\" One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she\n\tquickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to\n\tthe ground ...\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tDavid shields his \"mother\" as he shoves one of the boys into\n\tthe dirt. The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the\n\tside of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (Violence is\n\tas new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.)\n\tDavid steps in front of his \"mother\" with both fists\n\tclenched.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(as scared as she is)\n\t\tCome on!\n\n\tHe plants his back foot primed for action. The crowd of black\n\tand white thugs just stares at it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tCOME ON!\n\n\tANGLE. CROWD.\n\n\tThey look at him warily. The boy reaches up and feels the\n\tside of his mouth where a trickle of RED BLOOD is running\n\tdown his chin. He looks at his finger in horror and starts\n\tbacking away.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tGet out of here!\n\n\tThey back away further and David takes a threatening step.\n\tThe boys turn and run as he turns back to face his \"mother.\"\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE. BETTY. (OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER)\n\n\tDavid moves up to her gently.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tAre you alright?\n\n\tShe nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. David\n\treaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go\n\twide.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\t\t(off her look)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\tCLOSER. STILL OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER.\n\n\tBetty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. She\n\topens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected\n\timage of his own face. AT LAST HE HAS TURNED TO COLOR.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE. DAVID.\n\n\tHe holds the mirror staring at his own reflection. The\n\tcourage which transformed him only seems to grow. They look\n\tat each other, both in color now, when David puts a gentle\n\tarm around her shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tCome on.\n\n\tHe begins to lead her up toward the corner.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tFULL SHOT. SODA SHOP WINDOW. DAY.\n\n\tA larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude\n\tpainting of Betty in the window. The jeers and cat calls are\n\teven louder. The \"closed\" sign still sits in the doorway.\n\tAfter a beat or two, a HUGE BRICK SHATTERS THE GLASS ...\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tA big CHEER goes up from the crowd. Drunk on adrenalin, the\n\tfever builds and ANOTHER BRICK SMASHES THE WINDOW. In an\n\tinstant, Mr. Johnson's \"canvas\" is totally destroyed. The\n\tCHEERING grows louder ...\n\n\tAlmost by osmosis, the crowd rushes the building together.\n\tThe door is kicked in and they stream into the place. Soon\n\tall that can be heard is the weird SOUND OF LAUGHTER AND\n\tBROKEN GLASS.\n\n\tINT. SODA SHOP.\n\n\tIt is an orgy of destruction. Stools are hurled--tables\n\tripped out. The cash register is turned over. Two boys kick\n\tin the front of the juke box ...\n\n\tEXT. MAIN ST. DAY.\n\n\tDavid and Betty round the corner to find the Soda Shop being\n\tdestroyed. They stand at the far side of the intersection\n\twatching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok.\n\tAfter a moment or two, there are some more HOOTS as MARGARET\n\tcomes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped\n\topen.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tOh my God.\n\n\tHe takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob. David\n\tstrokes her hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tAre you alright? Are you okay?\n\n\tShe nods. Margaret catches her breath for a moment or two,\n\tthen glances down to her side ...\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tShe is clutching the umbrella in her left hand. The thing has\n\tbeen ripped to shreds. The spines are broken and the fabric\n\tis torn. Margaret stares at the thing with a combination of\n\tconfusion and shame. David goes white with rage and looks\n\ttoward the mob.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\t(taking his arm)\n\t\tNo. Let's get out of here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. COUNTRY ROAD. (LEADING TO LOVER'S LANE).\n\n\tThey all ride in George's convertible up the twisting turning\n\troad. It has turned completely PINK with the dogwood petals.\n\tDavid winds up the trail, in the fading light, looking for\n\trefuge. He clutches the wheel tight.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWe should be okay up here.\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.\n\n\tThe car twists and turns up the narrow dirt road. After a\n\tmoment, Lover's Lane reveals itself. It is lush and green\n\tlike before only this time, there is one major difference. A\n\tphalanx of BLACK AND WHITE THUGS have created a roadblock in\n\tthe foreground.\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tDavid jams on his breaks when he sees the barrier. It is a\n\tweird incongruous image: the black and white roadblock in\n\tfront with the vibrant colors of the pond and willow behind--\n\tlike some perfect dream you can never get to. The thugs have\n\tturned their cars sideways and dragged several huge logs\n\tacross the road. They hold axe-handles in their hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tWe better go.\n\n\tEXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.\n\n\tDarkness has fallen and the streetlamps have come on. Some\n\tdebris is scattered around the street and distant sounds of\n\tthe mob still fill the air. David rolls back into town with\n\tthe headlights off.\n\n\tCLOSER. CAR.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET\n\t\tWhere are they?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI'm not sure.\n\n\tThey head down Main St. and turn the comer on Walnut. All at\n\tonce, a weird ORANGE LIGHT bathes the car ...\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE. THEIR POV.\n\n\tA BONFIRE has been lit in the middle of the street between the\n\tlibrary and the barber shop. Twenty to thirty people are\n\tgathered around it still whooping and hollering as the bright\n\tORANGE FLAMES shoot into the air.\n\n\tANGLE. CAR.\n\n\tDavid pulls over by the curb, and their eyes go wide ...\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE.\n\n\tFrom closer up, it becomes clear what they're burning. Huge\n\tpiles of library books have been dumped onto the sidewalk,\n\twaiting their turn on the pyre. There is a strange celebratory\n\tatmosphere as they chuck book after book on the flames, with\n\tthe glee of a teenager tossing a firecracker. David sees\n\tsomething and bolts from the car ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tOh my God.\n\n\tANGLE. SIDE OF THE BONFIRE.\n\n\tJennifer is locked in some strange wrestling match with Biff.\n\tHe clutches a book over her head while she tugs at his wrist\n\ttrying to stop him from throwing it on the fire ...\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tDon't! Just let go.\n\n\t\t\t\tBIFF\n\t\tIt's better, Mary Sue.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tI said, NO!\n\t\t\t(yanking it)\n\t\t... I've read like one book in my\n\t\twhole life and I'll be damned if I\n\t\tlet you throw it on that fire ...\n\n\tJennifer wrestles with him for a couple of seconds and then\n\tsuddenly kicks Biff in the groin. He doubles over in agony\n\twhen Jennifer snatches the book and bolts in the other\n\tdirection.\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE. STREET.\n\n\tShe sprints up the street and is just passing the barber shop\n\twhen a hand reaches out and grabs her. Jennifer starts to\n\tscream but David puts a hand to her mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tIt's okay. It's me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tWIDE SHOT. SODA SHOP. OTHER SIDE OF MAIN STREET.\n\n\tThe crowd has moved on and all that is left is the dark\n\twreckage of the soda shop. Several stools lie out in the\n\tstreet and shards of brightly painted glass are scattered\n\taround the sidewalk. It is eerily quiet.\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tDavid, Betty and Margaret sit silently in the car, across the\n\tstreet with the lights off. He unlatches the door handle and\n\tgets out slowly. The rest of them follow him into the empty\n\tstreet as they move silently toward the soda shop, like some\n\tplatoon on patrol.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE.\n\n\tAs they get closer, more of the wreckage comes into view. Half\n\ta booth ... a soda spigot ... After a moment or two Jennifer\n\tlooks up and gasps.\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tSeveral teenagers step out of the shadows. They have scraped\n\tfaces and ripped clothing--the signs. Most are dazed and ALL\n\tOF THEM ARE IN COLOR. After a second or two, more appear:\n\tMary Jane ... Lisa Anne ... The boy who was reading Huck\n\tFinn...\n\n\tANGLE. DAVID.\n\n\tThe kids turn to him as if he has some kind of answer. Of\n\tcourse he doesn't. The sounds of the Mob still carry through\n\tthe air from somewhere off in the distance.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tLet's go inside.\n\n\tINT. SODA SHOP.\n\n\tThe place is just sad. All the remnants of what they had are\n\tstrewn around the floor, The jukebox is turned over. The\n\tstools are ripped out of the floor. Betty looks over at the\n\tcorner where he painted her ... The easel is smashed to bits.\n\n\tANGLE. BETTY.\n\n\tShe brings a knuckle to her lip and David puts an arm around\n\ther and draws her close. After a moment or two they HEAR a\n\tweird SCRAPING sound.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tHello?\n\n\tThe SCRAPING SOUND stops. They all look to the open door and\n\tafter a second or two, Mr. Johnson appears holding a broom and\n\tdustpan.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tJust thought I'd try to tidy it up\n\t\ta bit.\n\n\tBetty runs across and throws her arms around him. The\n\tteenagers watch as she holds him tight.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON (CONT)\n\t\tIt's okay. Once we sweep it up it'll\n\t\tbe alright again ...\n\n\tBetty stifles a sob as he strokes her hair. No one says\n\tanything while they just embrace for a moment. Finally ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWell he's right. Come on. Let's turn\n\t\tthese booths back up. \"Mary Sue\",\n\t\twhy don't you help me slide this in\n\t\tfront of the door. We'll be okay in\n\t\there.\n\n\tThey respond to the tone of leadership. One by one the kids\n\tstart to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage.\n\tJennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as\n\tthe kids try to put their shop back together.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT. TOWN HALL. (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETING) NIGHT.\n\n\tBig Bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house. The\n\tatmosphere is odd: somewhere between a bake-off and a\n\tlynching. People sit in the aisles and in the window sills.\n\tBob points his finger.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tThis is not the answer people.\n\n\tThe crowd quiets a bit.

Everyone sits motionless for a\n\tmoment or two, letting the decree sink in. David just stares\n\tdown at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of\n\tsadness.\n\n\tOff in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling\n\twith the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was\n\tbeing read. All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOY\n\t\tHey. This thing works.\n\n\tHe hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop.\n\tRAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive\n\ttime.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUDDY HOLLY\n\t\tWell all the things that you say\n\t\tand do Make me want to be with\n\t\tyou-oo-oo ...\n\n\t\t\t\tLISA ANNE\n\t\t\t(suddenly/\n\t\t\tin a panic)\n\t\tTurn that off!\n\n\tThe boy looks back at her.\n\n\t\t\t\tLISA ANNE (CONT)\n\t\t\t(shrieking)\n\t\tYou're not allowed to do that now!\n\n\tHe flinches and pulls the plug from the wall. The jukebox\n\twinds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it.\n\tDavid looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear\n\ttone.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tSure you are.\n\n\tHe walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids\n\twatch spellbound at this personal display of defiance.\n\n\tWIDER SHOT. SODA SHOP.\n\n\tBuddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly\n\tdifferent meaning. All the kids listen spellbound, as if to\n\tan anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious\n\treputation.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUDDY HOLLY\n\t\tThe little things that you say and do\n\t\tMake we want to be with you-oo-oo ...\n\t\tRAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ...\n\t\tRAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ...\n\n\tJennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an\n\tarm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little stronger--a little\n\tsafer ... The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they\n\tdon't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel\n\tashamed.\n\n\tTwenty \"colored\" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE\n\tON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the\n\thelm of his ship ...\n\n\tEXT. STREET. LATER ...\n\n\tHe steps out over the debris and looks both directions. David\n\tmotions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge.\n\tThe disturbance seems to have died down and the street is\n\tsilent although strewn with debris. David turns to the kids.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(whisper)\n\t\tStick together till you get off\n\t\tMain Street.\n\n\tThey nod and head off down the block. David just watches them\n\tsilently from the wreckage of the soda shop ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT. TOWN SQUARE. NIGHT.\n\n\tThe Fire Department is cleaning up the charred remains of the\n\tbonfire ...\n\n\tINT. SODA SHOP. LATER ...\n\n\tBetty is asleep in one of the booths. Jennifer sleeps beside\n\ther on the floor. David and Margaret sleep next to them in\n\tanother booth with Margaret curled up against his chest.\n\tDavid opens his eyes.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.\n\n\tMr. Johnson is standing in the middle of the shop, staring at\n\tthe large piece of plywood where his window used to be. He\n\tjust gazes at the thing as if he could look through it.\n\tThere's a faraway look in his eye.\n\n\tSHOT. DAVID.\n\n\tHe rises carefully from the booth, without waking Margaret.\n\tDavid crosses over to Mr. Johnson and speaks in a whisper.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tIt's okay. We'll get you a new one.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\t\t(softly)\n\t\tI don't know what I'd do if I\n\t\tcouldn't paint anymore Bud. I just\n\t\tdon't know what I'd do ...\n\n\tCLOSE UP. DAVID.\n\n\tHe just nods. David glances down at the table next to him. He\n\tpicks up one of the brightly painted shards of glass and just\n\tlooks at it. It's orange and pink and yellow. David thinks\n\tfor a second.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tMaybe I have an idea.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\tEXT. MAIN STREET. DAWN.\n\n\tThe same paper boy who rode into the trash can, peddles down\n\tMain Street tossing his papers toward the curb. He throws\n\tright toward the post office, then left toward the hardware\n\tstore, then right toward the bakery, then finally looks up.\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tThis time the boy slams into a lamp post. He tumbles off his\n\tbike and stares straight ahead in disbelief ...\n\n\tHIS POV. TOWN HALL.\n\n\tTwo men sleep at the base of the wall next to a clutter of\n\tpaint cans. Above them, however, is painted A VIVID ALMOST\n\tUTOPIAN MURAL OF THE TOWN OF PLEASANTVILLE in LIVING COLOR.\n\tInstead of being drab, the place literally gleams with life.\n\tThe post office turns out to be a RICH RED BRICK. The sky\n\tshines in vibrant BLUE. It is a rendering of what the town\n\tcould look like. David and Mr. Johnson sleep soundly next to\n\ttheir own signatures. David opens his eyes and sees the\n\tpaperboy ...\n\n\tANGLE. PAPER BOY.\n\n\tHe turns around and rides away as fast as he can.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. TOWN HALL. LATER ...\n\n\tA huge crowd has gathered. There is a loud buzz in the air.\n\tDavid and Mr. Johnson stand side by side in front of their\n\twork like they're presenting and guarding it at the same\n\ttime.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE. CROWD.\n\n\tMost of the faces are black and white. A few near the back\n\tare in color. Big Bob moves through the back of the crowd,\n\thurriedly buttoning his shirt. The buzz grows and the people\n\tpart as he heads toward the front of the pack ...\n\n\tANGLE. FRONT OF CROWD.\n\n\tWhen Bob emerges from the crowd, Mr. Johnson flinches\n\tslightly. David just looks him in the eye and tries to find\n\tas much courage as he can. \"Big\" Bob looks up at the color\n\trendering of his town with absolute horror. His eye scans the\n\tgreen trees, the bright yellow gas station, the puffy pink\n\tclouds on the horizon.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\t\t(bellowing)\n\t\tDid you do this?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(quietly but clearly)\n\t\tYes I did.\n\n\tBob grabs a copy of the Code of Conduct and waves it at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tDo you know that it's illegal?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(thinks)\n\t\tYes I do.\n\n\tBob looks dumbfounded. He tries to process the whole thing\n\tbut just looks more confused. Bob runs his hand through his\n\thair, shaking his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tBUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tBecause anybody should be able to\n\t\tpaint in whatever color they want.\n\n\tANGLE. BACK OF CROWD.\n\n\tBetty stands beside Margaret and Jennifer watching the\n\tspectacle. There are tears in her eyes and a great deal of\n\tlove. Jennifer smiles with pride at her brother ...\n\n\tSHOT. BOB.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tYou're not allowed to do this! I\n\t\tcould arrest you for this.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tStill doesn't make it right.\n\n\tThere is some clapping from the back of the crowd. Bob's eyes\n\twiden. His face goes flushed (darker gray). A vein bulges in\n\this neck. He turns to the police chief.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tDan! Arrest them!\n\n\t\t\t\tDAN (POLICE CHIEF)\n\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tUm ... I don't know how to do that,\n\t\tBob.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tWhat do you mean!?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAN\n\t\tWell, I never had to do it before.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tYou put handcuffs on them and you\n\t\ttake them to the police station.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAN\n\t\t\t(thinks)\n\t\tOh. guess I could do that, then.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(suddenly stronger)\n\t\tC'mere, Dan. I'll help you.\n\n\tDavid walks toward the police chief and sticks his hands out.\n\tA louder murmur moves through the crowd as David actually\n\thelps him fasten on the cuffs. Mr. Johnson comes over to join\n\tthem and the murmur starts to grow ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tNIGHT TIME.\n\n\tA bright full moon stands out against a jet black sky ...\n\n\tEXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.\n\n\tA group of \"colored\" kids hangs out on Main Street near the\n\tpolice station. They gaze off into the distance at the barred\n\twindow of a jail cell. It is elevated half a story above the\n\tstreet. Everything is black and white except for the warm\n\tYELLOW LIGHT, that glows through the bars. They know in a\n\tglance who's inside.\n\n\tINT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT.\n\n\tDavid sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling. The place has\n\tnever been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the\n\tsheets and pillow cases. He can't help smiling.\n\n\tINT. DIFFERENT JAIL CELL. WAY OFF DOWN THE HALL ...\n\n\tMr. Johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food. He\n\tclutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in\n\ttrue \"inmate\" fashion.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE. WALL.\n\n\tRather than scratching the days or even the hours, Mr.\n\tJohnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall\n\tcomplete with lush forest and a running brook. He looks at\n\this work and smiles.\n\n\tSHOT. POLICE CHIEF.\n\n\tHe approaches David's cell from the other direction and\n\tknocks gently on the bars. David turns around.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAN\n\t\tThere's someone to see you Bud.\n\n\tDAVID.\n\n\tDavid sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could\n\tbe. After a moment or two, a strange look of understanding\n\tcrosses his face. He HEARS the sound of a KEY TURNING IN THE\n\tLOCK. David looks up at the doorway and smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI thought it might be you.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE. DICK VAN DYKE.\n\n\tHe stands in the doorway, still dressed in his TV repairman's\n\toutfit. FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE IS COMPLETELY IN BLACK AND\n\tWHITE.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tHope you're proud of yourself.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI am actually ... Glad to see you've\n\t\tfinally shown your true colors.\n\n\tDick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the\n\tcell behind him.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tOkay, let's cut the shit and get\n\t\tright to it. Where's that remote\n\t\tcontrol?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tBecause you're coming home.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(smiles)\n\t\tWhy don't you just take me back\n\t\twithout it?\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tOh. You're a smart little bastard\n\t\taren't you?\n\t\t\t(tightly)\n\t\tIt's kind of like a restricted\n\t\tticket. You gotta leave the same\n\t\tway you came.\n\n\tDavid just looks at him. He smiles, confidently. Leans back\n\ton the bunk ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tSo ... I guess as long as I'm\n\t\there, all sorts of things could\n\t\thappen to this place. We could\n\t\thave pink lawns and blue trees ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tJust gimme the damn remote!\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI'm sorry. I can't do that.\n\n\tDick Van Dyke takes a deep breath. He glances toward the\n\tbarred window.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tI don't know what went wrong.\n\t\tYou answered every question. You\n\t\tknew every detail. The senior\n\t\tProm ... McIntire's Department\n\t\tStore. We had all the same warm\n\t\tmemories: Sock hops. The Church\n\t\tSocial ...\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tThey weren't my memories.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tI borrowed them. It's no good when\n\t\tyou borrow them.\n\n\tDick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to\n\ttremble.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\t\t(containing his rage)\n\t\tHow long do you think you've been\n\t\there?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(warily)\n\t\tI don't know ... Three, four weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tMuch less than that.\n\t\t\t(checks his watch)\n\t\tAn hour and a half.\n\n\tDavid looks at him uneasily. Dick Van Dyke flashes a broad\n\tnasty smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE (CONT)\n\t\tSee--and this is really great--\n\t\tthe show was on for what--half an\n\t\thour a week? So that means for\n\t\tevery week that goes by in\n\t\tPleasantville, only half an hour\n\t\tgoes by in the real world.\n\n\tThe smile gets bigger. Dick Van Dyke moves closer to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE (CONT)\n\t\tNow Buddy, you're going on trial\n\t\ttomorrow. And if they find you\n\t\tguilty, you're gonna be stuck here\n\t\tforever. Well, not forever--lemme\n\t\tthink ...\n\t\t\t(calculates)\n\t\tFive year sentence ... Carry the\n\t\tthree ... That comes out to ...\n\t\tsixteen and a half centuries, and\n\t\tthat's rounding down.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI'm going on trial tomorrow?\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tThis is TV pal. They don't fool\n\t\taround.\n\n\tDavid is rocked but tries not to show it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(stoicly)\n\t\tThere's worse places.\n\n\t\t\t\tDICK VAN DYKE\n\t\tOh sure. For the first hundred\n\t\tyears. Then it starts to get a\n\t\tlittle monotonous.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tSleep well.\n\n\tHe taps on the bars for Dan who opens the lock and lets him\n\tout. The door CLANGS shut as the two of them disappear down\n\tthe hall. The minute they are gone, the stoicism falls. David\n\tlooks around his cell, truly afraid.\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tHe stares at the tiny cot ... The plain light bulb in the\n\tceiling ... The single pillow with the plastic covering it\n\t... Forever is starting to look like a long time. David\n\tcrosses to the small window and looks out.\n\n\tHIS POV. OUT THE WINDOW.\n\n\tAcross the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall\n\tcomplete with the newly painted mural. The \"Utopian\" view of\n\tPleasantville is just as he left it with one notable\n\texception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to\n\tBLACK AND WHITE.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. TOWN HALL. DAY.\n\n\tIt is bathed in sunlight. Dozens of people stream through the\n\tfront door for the first trial in Pleasantville's history.\n\tThere is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air.\n\n\tINT. TOWN HALL. DAY.\n\n\tThe place has been transformed from the Chamber of Commerce\n\tmeeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews\n\tand ceiling fans. The only carry over from its previous\n\tconfiguration is the huge CHAMBER OF COMMERCE banner draped\n\tacross the back wall.\n\n\tANGLE. BENCH.\n\n\tAt the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is\n\ta large, elevated judge's bench with a Rotary insignia on the\n\tfront. Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings\n\tfinally living up to his name. The whole thing is a strange\n\tcombination of Franz Kafka and \"Inherit the Wind.\" Big Bob\n\tbangs the gavel ...\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tThe undertone begins to quiet down. All of the faces in the\n\tpews are Black and White. There is a \"colored\" section in the\n\tback for standing room only.\n\n\tANGLE. JURORS BOX.\n\n\tGeorge is seated in the front row of the jury, despite his\n\trelationship to one of the defendants. He is dressed\n\timpeccably with his Rotary Pin still gleaming on his lapel.\n\tAfter a moment or two he sneaks a glance toward the back of\n\tthe room ...\n\n\tANGLE. BETTY.\n\n\tShe stands in the back with the rest of the \"colored\" faces.\n\tBetty cranes her head to catch a glimpse of David or Mr.\n\tJohnson. All at once, a hush goes through the crowd.\n\n\tANGLE. DOORWAY.\n\n\tIt swings open and David and Mr. Johnson are led in wearing\n\thandcuffs. Dan, the Police Chief (now ballif), shows them to\n\ta table in the center of the room directly facing Big Bob.\n\tThere is no lawyer present. There is also no prosecutor.\n\n\tANGLE. DAVID.\n\n\tHe glances around a little confused. (Weird courtroom.) Big\n\tBob bangs the gavel.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tBud Parker and William Johnson,\n\t\tyou have been charged with\n\t\tdesecration of a public building\n\t\tand the intentional use of\n\t\tprohibited paint colors in\n\t\tviolation of the Pleasantville\n\t\tCode of Conduct and laws of\n\t\tcommon decency. Do you admit that\n\t\ton the night of May 1, you did\n\t\tconsciously and willfully apply\n\t\tthe following FORBIDDEN colors to\n\t\tthe Pleasantville Town Hall:\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tRed, Pink, Vermillion, Puce,\n\t\tChartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox\n\t\tBlood, Green, Peach, Crimson,\n\t\tYellow, Olive and Magenta.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tUm ... Yes I do. Where's our\n\t\tlawyer?\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tWe prefer to keep these\n\t\tproceedings as \"pleasant\" as\n\t\tpossible. I don't think a lawyer\n\t\twill be necessary.\n\n\tThere is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the\n\tblack and white faces. Big Bob smiles to himself then\n\tproceeds.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB (CONT)\n\t\tDo you further admit that this\n\t\twas done surreptitiously and\n\t\tunder the cover of darkness?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWell--it was dark out ...\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tGood. Do you further admit that\n\t\tthis unnatural depiction occurred\n\t\tin full public view where it was\n\t\taccessible to, and in plain sight\n\t\tof, minor children?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tIt was accessible to everyone.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tVery well. Let the record show\n\t\tthat the defendants have answered\n\t\tin the affirmative to all the\n\t\tcharges.\n\n\tHe looks directly at them for the first time.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB (CONT)\n\t\tDo you have anything to say in\n\t\tyour defense?\n\n\tSHOT. DEFENSE TABLE.\n\n\tMr. Johnson just looks at David, confused and terrified.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tI didn`t mean to hurt anybody.\n\t\tI just have to paint ... I\n\t\tneed to.\n\n\tHe gropes for something else to say, but what else is there?\n\tDavid glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat.\n\tDavid rises from his chair.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI think I've got something to say.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tVery well ...\n\n\tDavid looks out over the audience. After a moment or two, he\n\tlooks back at Big Bob.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI think I know why you're doing\n\t\tthis. I mean, I understand why\n\t\tyou're doing this. I used to\n\t\tfeel the same way. I used to\n\t\twant this place to stay just the\n\t\tway it was. I never wanted it to\n\t\tchange ...\n\n\tThere is a loud MURMUR. Big Bob bangs the gavel.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\t\t(he smiles slightly)\n\t\tBut nothing stays the same. You\n\t\tget things, and you lose things,\n\t\tand that's the good part and the\n\t\tbad part--but you can't have a\n\t\tgood part without a bad part.\n\n\tHe turns and sees his mother in the balcony. They lock eyes\n\tfor a moment. David smiles slightly and continues.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tIt's like the basketball team.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\t\t(leaning forward)\n\t\tThe basketball team?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tSure. Everybody's upset because\n\t\tthey're not winning anymore--but\n\t\tjust think how it would feel if\n\t\tall of a sudden they do win.\n\n\tThere's a murmur in the gallery.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tWouldn't it feel better than when\n\t\tthey used to win all the time?\n\n\tThere is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob looks concerned.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tSee, I know you want it to stay\n\t\t\"Pleasant\" but there are so many\n\t\tthings that are so much better:\n\t\tlike Silly ... or Sexy ... or\n\t\tDangerous ... or Wild ... or\n\t\tBrief ...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAnd every one of those things is\n\t\tin you all the time if you just\n\t\thave the guts to look for them.\n\t\t\t(pointing to the \"colored\" section)\n\t\tLook at those faces back there.\n\t\tThey're no different than you are.\n\t\tThey just happened to see\n\t\tsomething inside themselves that\n\t\tyou don't want to ...\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tOkay--that's enough!\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI thought I was allowed to\n\t\tdefend myself.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tYou're not allowed to lie.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI'm not lying ... Here I'll show\n\t\tyou.\n\n\tHe turns suddenly toward the jury box.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tMr. Simpson ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. SIMPSON\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWhat color is that hedge of yours?\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. SIMPSON\n\t\tGreen.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tNo, not that hedge. The other one.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. SIMPSON\n\t\tThe other one?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tThe one in your mind. The one\n\t\tthat you see on a bright cold\n\t\tmorning. The one that you see\n\t\twhen you walk in front of your\n\t\thouse and you just stand there\n\t\tand stare.\n\n\tMr. Simpson suddenly looks far away. He gets a kind of dreamy\n\tlook in his eye.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tWhat color is that hedge?\n\n\tCLOSE UP. MR. SIMPSON.\n\n\tSUDDENLY AND BEFORE OUR EYES, MR. SIMPSON TURNS TO LIVING\n\tCOLOR. A huge MURMUR moves through the courtroom. Bob bangs\n\tthe gavel.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tI said, that's enough!\n\n\t\t\t\tVARIOUS VOICES FROM\n\t\t\t\tTHE AUDIENCE\n\t\t\"No ... Let him finish ... Go on ...\"\n\n\tBig Bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when David\n\tsuddenly turns toward George.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tAlright. Dad ...\n\n\tDIFFERENT ANGLE.\n\n\tThere is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob just looks at him frozen\n\twhile David confronts his \"father.\" George straightens up.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\t\t(solemn)\n\t\tYes Bud.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tDon't you miss her?\n\n\tCLOSE UP. GEORGE.\n\n\tHe looks at him stunned. Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody\n\tlistens. George just stares at him like he got shot.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI mean, of course you do, but it\n\t\tisn't just the cooking or the\n\t\tcleaning that you miss--it's\n\t\tsomething else, isn't it ...\n\n\tGeorge swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as\n\the glances toward the back of the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\t\t(softer whisper)\n\t\tMaybe you can't even describe it.\n\t\tMaybe you only know it when it's\n\t\tgone. Maybe it's like there's a\n\t\twhole piece of you that's missing\n\t\ttoo.\n\t\t\t(shrugs)\n\t\tYou might even call it \"love.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tBIG BOB\n\t\t\t(BANGING the gavel loudly)\n\t\tOkay, that's IT!!!\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(motioning toward the back)\n\t\tNow don't you think she looks just\n\t\tas pretty in color? Don't you\n\t\tthink she looks just as pretty as\n\t\tshe did the day you met her?\n\n\tSlowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls\n\tdown his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a\n\tlong trail of COLOR behind it.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tDon't you wish you could tell her\n\t\tthat?\n\n\tHe nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him\n\tthrough her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\t\t(POUNDING the gavel)\n\t\tYOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWhy am I out of order?\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tBECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO\n\t\tTURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tWell I don't think it's a circus.\n\t\tAnd I don't think they do either.\n\n\tDavid motions behind him to the black and white section.\n\tThere are now ten to fifteen \"colored\" faces.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tTHIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tBut see that's just the point. It\n\t\tcan't stop at once. Because it's\n\t\tin you. And you can't stop\n\t\tsomething that's in you.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\t\t(tightly)\n\t\tIt's not in ME.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tOh sure it is.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOB\n\t\tNo it isn't.\n\n\tHe crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans\n\tover the bench and gets right up in his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(smug whisper)\n\t\tWhat do you want to do to me\n\t\tright now?\n\n\tBig Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves\n\tcloser.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tC'mon. Everyone's turning colors.\n\t\tKids are making out in the street.\n\t\tNo one's getting their dinner--\n\t\thell, you could have a flood any\n\t\tminute ... Pretty soon you could\n\t\thave the women going off to work\n\t\twhile the men stayed home and\n\t\tcooked ...\n\n\t\t\t\tBIG BOB\n\t\tThat's not going to happen!\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tBut it could happen.\n\n\t\t\t\tBIG BOB\n\t\tNo it couldn't!\n\n\tBig Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts\n\taround the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of\n\this head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely\n\tRED IN THE FACE.\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tA gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and\n\tjust smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big\n\tBob turns and catches his reflection in the window.\n\n\tCLOSE UP. BIG BOB.\n\n\tHe sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down\n\tat his hands. They have gone completely RED as well. Big Bob\n\tfreezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and\n\tflees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom.\n\n\tANGLE. DOORWAY.\n\n\tAs Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town\n\tSquare GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep\n\tgreen. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators\n\tbolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd\n\tmoves outside.\n\n\tEXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!)\n\n\tAll the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars,\n\tGreen hats ... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally\n\tturned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David\n\twalks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his\n\tcreation. The whole town is washed in joy.\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tMargaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet\n\tin a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of\n\tconduct). Several people around them actually clap, like\n\tspectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and\n\tlooks at her brother making out.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tUch ... I am like gonna hurl ...\n\n\tDavid turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David\n\tthrows his arms around his sister as more and more people\n\tstream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.\n\n\tDavid and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She\n\tclutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tAre you sure?\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tI told you. I'm like positive.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tThis thing works. We could go\n\t\thome right now.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tI'm not ready yet. I gotta do\n\t\tthis for a little while.\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tThey stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge).\n\n\tA large sign says: \"Springfield 12 Miles\" and for the first\n\ttime, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning.\n\tJennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit\n\tof style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the\n\tdistance.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tBesides. You think there's like\n\t\ta chance I'm gonna get into\n\t\tcollege back there?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(thinks ...)\n\t\tHonestly ... no.\n\n\tThey both smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tYou got the admissions letter.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tRight here.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tAnd you're sure about this?\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tI've done the slut thing, David.\n\t\tIt's really kinda old.\n\n\tDavid nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI'll come back and check on you\n\t\tin a month.\n\n\tJennifer nods and gives him a hug. She holds on tight for a\n\tcouple of seconds.\n\n\t\t\t\tJENNIFER\n\t\tYou're like the coolest brother\n\t\tin the world.\n\n\tDavid smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly\n\thear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge\n\tGreyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at\n\tthe sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at\n\ther brother, then turns toward the door ...\n\n\tEXT. MARGARETS HOUSE. DAY.\n\n\tShe clutches her umbrella at her side. David holds a bag of\n\toatmeal cookies. Each one clings on to the other one's\n\tclothing. Their faces are inches apart.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET\n\t\tYou're gonna forget about me.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tNo I won't. I swear.\n\n\tMargaret nods. She looks at him for a moment then wraps her\n\tarms around his neck. They meet in a long, rich, wet, soft\n\tkiss. The umbrella falls to the ground ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGARET\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\tI like calling you David.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI like it too.\n\n\tINT. PARKER LIVING ROOM.\n\n\tDavid stands in front of the television with Mr. Johnson at\n\this side. He holds the remote control in his hand. Mr.\n\tJohnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tWell how do you know it won't go\n\t\tback to the way it was?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tYou're gonna keep painting aren't\n\t\tyou?\n\n\tMr. Johnson nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID (CONT)\n\t\tWell ...\n\n\tHe nods again and thinks about it. They smile at each other\n\tone last time.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\t\t(remembering something)\n\t\tOh.\n\t\t\t(reaching into his pocket)\n\t\tI've got something for you.\n\n\tHe pulls out a folded piece of paper. Mr. Johnson extends it\n\tto David who unfolds it and instantly smiles.\n\n\tINSERT. PAPER.\n\n\tIt is a small painted replica of their mural in the same\n\tvibrant colors. Everything is scaled perfectly, exactly like\n\tthe one on the wall.\n\n\tSHOT. DAVID.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tIt's beautiful.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. JOHNSON\n\t\tJust a little--You know.\n\n\tDavid looks up at him and smiles. All at once he glances\n\ttoward the door.\n\n\tWIDER.\n\n\tBetty is standing there holding a brown paper bag. A sweater\n\tis draped over her arm.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\t(extending the bag)\n\t\tI made you these for the trip.\n\t\tThey're marshmallow rice squares.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tThanks. I thought you weren't\n\t\tgonna ...\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\t(painful/\n\t\t\tquieter)\n\t\tI had to say goodbye.\n\n\tShe looks up at David and their eyes lock. Betty hands him\n\tthe bag.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY (CONT)\n\t\tThere's a meatloaf sandwich in\n\t\tthere too. Don't go skipping\n\t\tdinner just 'cause you're not\n\t\there anymore.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tI won't.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\t(voice quivering)\n\t\tAnd ... wear this on the trip in\n\t\tcase it gets cold.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\t\t(nodding)\n\t\t... It's a pretty short trip.\n\n\tShe nods as well. Betty puts the sweater around his shoulders\n\tanyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two. Then\n\tshe throws her arms around his neck.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\tI'm so proud of you, Bud.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tThanks ... I love you.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\tI love you too.\n\n\tShe clings on tight for a second or two then lets go. Betty\n\tflicks away a tear and draws a deep breath.\n\n\t\t\t\tBETTY (CONT)\n\t\tWell ...\n\n\tShe steps back and looks at him. David glances down at the\n\tremote.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAVID\n\t\tYou better stand back a little.\n\n\tBetty and Mr. Johnson cross toward the comer of the room.\n\tDavid points the remote at the TV ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. MODERN HOUSING TRACT. DAY.\n\n\tAll the ersatz Spanish houses stretch out toward infinity. A\n\tWESTEC security patrol cruises by them at a crawl. A second\n\tor two later, all the sprinklers turn on in uniform\n\tsynchronization.\n\n\tINT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM.\n\n\tHe stands in the middle of the living room looking at his\n\tnew/old surroundings. Everything is the same as it was. The\n\tblack onyx coffee table. The clean burbur rug. The big screen\n\tTV in its sleek black cabinet. David looks at it and smiles.\n\tThe place is inadvertantly in black and white.\n\n\tCLOSER.\n\n\tHe reaches forward and turns on the TV (by hand) flipping\n\taround the dial. Jerry Springer is berating a prostitute ...\n\tTony Robbins hawks self-improvement in an infomercial ...\n\tCourt TV is doing an O.J. recap. David unfolds Mr. Johnson's\n\tsketch and glances down at it. He smiles to himself. A\n\tdifferent kind of nostalgia ...\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPleasantville\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Gary Ross\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:06.861863"}
