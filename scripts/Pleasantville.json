Huge\n\tpiles of library books have been dumped onto the sidewalk,\n\twaiting their turn on the pyre. There is a strange celebratory\n\tatmosphere as they chuck book after book on the flames, with\n\tthe glee of a teenager tossing a firecracker.

The boy who was reading Huck\n\tFinn...\n\n<b>\tANGLE. DAVID.\n</b>\n\tThe kids turn to him as if he has some kind of answer. Of\n\tcourse he doesn't.

The easel is smashed to bits.\n\n<b>\tANGLE. BETTY.\n</b>\n\tShe brings a knuckle to her lip and David puts an arm around\n\ther and draws her close.

David\n\tlooks around his cell, truly afraid.\n\n<b>\tCLOSER.\n</b>\n\tHe stares at the tiny cot ... The plain light bulb in the\n\tceiling ... The single pillow with the plastic covering it\n\t... Forever is starting to look like a long time. David\n\tcrosses to the small window and looks out.\n\n<b>\tHIS POV. OUT THE WINDOW.\n</b>\n\tAcross the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall\n\tcomplete with the newly painted mural. The \"Utopian\" view of\n\tPleasantville is just as he left it with one notable\n\texception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to\n<b>\tBLACK AND WHITE.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT.

Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings\n\tfinally living up to his name. The whole thing is a strange\n\tcombination of Franz Kafka and \"Inherit the Wind.\" Big Bob\n\tbangs the gavel ...\n\n<b>\tCLOSER.\n</b>\n\tThe undertone begins to quiet down. All of the faces in the\n\tpews are Black and White. There is a \"colored\" section in the\n\tback for standing room only.\n\n<b>\tANGLE.
