DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM\r\n\r\n   The room is dingy. Unkempt. The camera sits on the bed, on\r\n   its side, facing the door. We can hear someone moving around\r\n   off screen.\r\n\r\n   The door handle clicks; someone's trying it.    Then nothing.\r\n   Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door.\r\n\r\n   Andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking.   He speaks\r\n   with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety.\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          What do you want, I'm getting ready\r\n          for school-\r\n\r\n                    MR.

DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMER'S ROOM\r\n\r\n   Equally dingy. SANDRA DETMER, gaunt and sickly, is sat up in\r\n   bed. Andrew's filming her. She's clearly very ill, speaking\r\n   in a weak rasp.

CLARK STREET - MORNING\r\n\r\n   Clark Street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the\r\n   street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon.

I'm trying to get\r\n          custody of her from my dad. She's\r\n          getting worse, and he's\r\n          not...helping, and this way, in\r\n          case something goes down-\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          He gets violent or whatever-\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          Right, it'd be evidence.\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          Evidence.

You should\r\n          read him, maybe, it might make you\r\n          feel- you know, improve your\r\n          outlook.\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          Yeah, right.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT.

HAVEN HILLS FARM - BARN\r\n\r\nCars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and\r\nAndrew approach. We see Christmas lights strung up, and\r\nthere's clearly a party going on inside the barn. Kids are\r\nmilling about outside, too, drinking, fucking around.\r\n\r\n                     MATT\r\n          Hey dude, don't follow me around\r\n          all night.\r\n\r\n                     ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          Don't follow me around all night,\r\n          okay?\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          What am I supposed to do?

Lots of bad footage of people talking, drinking,\r\ngirls dancing sexy, guys joking around. Andrew is silent and\r\ndetached, just filming. He sees a girl, CASEY Letter, 16,\r\nfilming as well. They shout over the music.\r\n\r\n                    CASEY\r\n          Hey, what are you filming for?\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          Oh, I don't- just filming.\r\n\r\n                     CASEY\r\n          What?

Why are you\r\n          filming?\r\n\r\nAndrew simply backs away. More footage of the party.\r\nAUSTIN, 18, in an Ed Hardy shirt, comes out of nowhere.   He's\r\nclearly a little drunk.\r\n\r\n                    AUSTIN\r\n          Hey, were you filming my\r\n          girlfriend?

HAVEN HILLS FARM - EDGE OF THE WOODS\r\n\r\nAndrew's out alone in a field now, furiously cleaning the\r\nlens of the camera, obstructing our view.

They've come\r\ninto a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from\r\nwithin; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise\r\nglow.\r\n\r\nThey speak loudly, clearly talking over something we can't\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          Is that, is that showing up on the\r\n          camera?\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          I don't wanna film it, it's messing\r\n          with the camera-\r\n\r\nMatt forcibly turns the camera, to reveal Steve standing next\r\nto some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing\r\nfrom, or maybe embedded in, the wall. Around it, and him,\r\nfloat wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.\r\n\r\nSteve is clearly entranced, sweeping his hands through the\r\nlight.\r\n                       STEVE\r\n          Touch one!\r\n\r\nWe see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora\r\nborealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent\r\nlittle explosion of light, beautiful.\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          Guys maybe...maybe we shouldn't...\r\n\r\nA light cloud passes in front of Andrew, and we sees his hand\r\nto extend to touch it. The subsequent little light burst\r\nbadly warps the camera, clearly permanent damage.\r\n\r\n                                                      CUT.\r\n                                                           19.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed\r\nup close, it's almost arachnid, organic somehow. The light\r\nclouds have turned yellow. Matt is practically inside the\r\nstructure, pressing it with his palms.\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          -changes color, see? It must be\r\n          reacting to the heat, some kind of\r\n          exothermic reaction-\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          WHAT?

There's a low sustained hiss as\r\nthe light clouds turn an angry shade of red. A stream of\r\nthem is released from beneath the structure. The camera\r\njerks suddenly, revealing Steve, who's clutching his ears.\r\n\r\n                     STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          AGHHHHH!\r\n\r\nBlood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes, ears, mouth\r\nand nose, and he buckles forwards; the camera spins wildly\r\nand we see Matt seemingly FLUNG out of the crystalline\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nIt pulses, and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart,\r\nrevealing a blinding light within which EXPLODES OUTWARD; we\r\ncan suddenly hear an OVERWHELMING CHOIR OF VOICES, and the\r\ncamera sent rocketing backwards, flipping backwards up the\r\ntunnel-\r\n                                             CRACK.

MATT'S BACKYARD - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nThe camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, it's\r\nimmediately evident that this is a newer, better camera.\r\nIt's on a tripod, and Matt stands across a well manicured\r\nbackyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed.\r\n                                                        20.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MATT\r\n          Ready?\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          Rolling, yeah.\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          Okay, ball test.   Take one.\r\n\r\nA baseball comes flying in from behind the camera, nailing\r\nMatt in the face; he drops like a rock.\r\n\r\n                     MATT (CONT'D)\r\n          OW FUCK! WHAT THE FUCK STEVE!\r\n          UNDERHAND!\r\n\r\nSteve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can\r\nhear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.\r\n\r\n                    STEVE\r\n          I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-\r\n\r\n                                                     CUT.\r\n\r\nNow it's Steve who stands on the yard.\r\n\r\n                     STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Go.\r\n\r\nA baseball comes in from off camera, slower. It comes down\r\ntowards Steve, but at the last second makes a bizarre,\r\nimpossible course correction, FLIES UP AND HITS STEVE IN THE\r\nFACE.\r\n                     STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          AGH!   HEY, MATT, NOT COOL!\r\nMatt rushes on, doing a victory lap, one hand holding an ice-\r\npack to his face. Again, we hear Andrew laughing.\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-\r\n\r\n                                                     CUT.\r\n\r\nAndrew's out across the yard. He looks a little better; he's\r\ngotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard, and his hair is a\r\nlittle better kept. He nods.\r\n\r\nIn flies the baseball. It abruptly stops in the air, a foot\r\nand a half from Andrew's face. Steve and Matt let out a\r\ncheer, and the camera is yanked off the tripod, taken to show\r\na closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball and\r\nAndrew.\r\n                                                         21.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball.   A trickle\r\nof blood comes out of his nose.\r\n\r\n                      ANDREW\r\n          Ah, shit.\r\n\r\n                                                      CUT.\r\n\r\nThe camera's on a tripod up on the back porch, filming\r\nAndrew, Steve and Matt standing a triangle. They are playing\r\ncatch...no hands. The ball simply flies from guy to guy.\r\nThey drop it a few times in some cuts, but shout\r\nencouragement, and are clearly having a good time.\r\n\r\nFinally, they get the ball going EXTREMELY fast.   Matt looks\r\nup.\r\n\r\n                      MATT\r\n          Is-\r\n\r\nMatt gets nailed in the balls, and drops as Steve and Andrew\r\nrush to him, laughing.\r\n\r\n                    STEVE\r\n          `In the- penis- the penis-\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          I thought I heard my dad...UGHHH\r\n          WHY ME AGAAAAIN!?\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. MATT'S KITCHEN\r\n\r\nSteve is very intently using his newfound powers to make a\r\npeanut butter and jelly sandwich, knife shakily moving over\r\nbread. The camera is set down on the counter, Matt and\r\nAndrew watching.\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW\r\n          The trick is to pretend like it's\r\n          on a plate.

Plate's easier for me.\r\n\r\n                    STEVE\r\n          Guys, check it out.\r\n\r\nSteve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butter\r\nfloating freely. They slap together and then down onto the\r\nbread, which slaps closed.\r\n\r\n                     STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Ha!\r\n              (notices his bloody nose)\r\n          Shit, shit-\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. MATT'S ROOM - LATER\r\n\r\nMatt's room is covered in band posters, kind of a mess.\r\nMatt's sitting on the floor by a desk, slowly assembling a\r\nLEGO set with his telekinetic abilities. Andrew's filming\r\nfrom the bed, where he's laying down.\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          Try to imagine that your squeezing\r\n          the entire piece in your hand.\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          That's what I'm doing, it's just,\r\n          it's hard.

It crawls up onto the side of the\r\nbed, then onto the sheets. Andrew's finger points at it.\r\n\r\nThe spider is telekinetically lifted into the air.    It hangs\r\nstruggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid.\r\n\r\nHe spreads his fingers, and the spider abruptly separates\r\ninto all of its component parts. They stop moving, hanging\r\nlifeless.\r\n\r\nAndrew's home phone rings, and he drops the spider.    Rings\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n                    MR.

They're playing catch with a\r\nfootball. Steve tosses it to Andrew, who actually goes into\r\na short dive to catch it. He looks up to see Steve and Matt\r\ndistantly cheering and waving their approval.\r\n                                                      CUT.\r\n\r\nSteve's holding the camera, filming Andrew attempting a few\r\nfancy moves, but he's a clumsy flier.

Matt is using his abilities to\r\nshape cloud fluff into an M. There is a humming, rattling\r\nsound, slightly audible even over the deafening wind.\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          Guys, do you hear that?\r\n\r\nNeither of the guys can hear him. Steve however stops in the\r\ndistance, looking around. He shouts something, inaudible.\r\n\r\n                     ANDREW (O.S.) (CONT'D)\r\n          What?   I can't hear you!\r\n\r\nSteve pantomimes, pointing at his ear and shrugging.\r\n\r\nA BOEING 737 BLOWS OUT OF THE CLOUDBANK BEHIND STEVE.    He's\r\nspun like a top in its wake, and drops like a rock.\r\nSuddenly we're launched downwards, and after a moment, the\r\ncamera disconnects from Andrew, and we see him zooming ahead.\r\nThe camera, in free-fall, spins wildly, then suddenly it\r\nswims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in\r\nsome tall grass. Less than a second later, Andrew and Steve\r\ncome falling down into the grass and roll roughly, splitting\r\napart.\r\n\r\nThey lay there, breathing hard. Andrew sits up, coughing;\r\nhis eyes, nose and mouth bleeding. Steve suddenly leaps up.\r\n\r\n                    STEVE\r\n          WOO! HOLY FUCKING FUCK! I COULDA\r\n          DIED, MAN!

Andrew's camera movements are rigid again, tight and\r\nconfined, back to how they were when we first started.\r\n\r\nWe see Steve's mother and father. His mother is sobbing.\r\nHis father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket.\r\nSteve's mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away.\r\nThere's Samantha, crying uncontrollably.

I mean- I don't, I don't\r\n          know how I'm supposed to- Why won't\r\n          you just tell me what happened?\r\n\r\nThe camera and Andrew suddenly launch into the air, rocketing\r\naway from Matt.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT.

He\r\ntakes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh\r\nof his wrist. He drags the blade down hard, all the way to\r\nhis elbow...but no cut appears. He then violently jabs\r\nhimself several times...but no penetration.\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (CONT'D)\r\n          See, it's- I put a little sheet\r\n          between myself and the knife, and\r\n          the barrier, the sheet, is too\r\n          strong. The knife can't cut it. I\r\n          mean like, what I'm saying is if I\r\n          concentrate, I can't be hurt. I\r\n          can't be injured. Because of the\r\n          little sheet.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD\r\n\r\nAndrew sits alone on the bleachers. The cheerleaders are\r\npracticing. The camera zooms in on Samantha. She sits alone\r\non the sidelines, watching numbly.\r\n                                                        62.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY\r\n\r\nAndrew is putting his stuff away in his locker. He's\r\nsuddenly shoved into the locker roughly. The camera turns,\r\nrevealing Wayne walking away.\r\n\r\nThe camera scans the mostly empty hallway quickly, then goes\r\nback to Wayne, now almost twenty feet away.\r\n\r\n                       ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          Hey Wayne!\r\n\r\n                    WAYNE\r\n          What, you got a probl-\r\n\r\nOne of Andrew's hands flicks out, and Wayne's mouth suddenly\r\ngushes blood. Wayne screams, falling, and is immediately\r\ntended to by other students.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - BATHROOM STALL\r\n\r\nAndrew has laid out three small bloody objects on the back of\r\nthe toilet, and presents each one to the camera one by one.\r\n\r\nThey're Wayne's bloody teeth.\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW (O.S.)\r\n          See, this one, I got clean, cause I\r\n          did a little lasso around the root,\r\n          but these two, they're broken cause\r\n          I think I pulled them from the\r\n          middle. Matt was always better at\r\n          the little, the intricate stuff, he\r\n          got good at that. See how broken\r\n          it is, ugh, sloppy.\r\n\r\nINT.

I know that you\r\n          come from a difficult background,\r\n          and I know how horrible the pain\r\n          can be when you lose a friend. But\r\n          I don't think you should let this\r\n          make you lose hope. I mean, this\r\n          is your future.

This is ensured\r\nby the handcuff on his left wrist.\r\n\r\nThe machines beep. Andrew doesn't move. The door opens, and\r\nMr. Detmer enters, speaking to a POLICE DETECTIVE on the\r\nother side of the door.\r\n\r\n                    MR. DETMER\r\n          -come down to the city, cause his\r\n          mother's all alone right now.\r\n          She's got MS, I had to leave her at\r\n          the house all a fucking alone.\r\n\r\n                    POLICE DETECTIVE\r\n          I understand, Mr. Detmer.\r\n\r\n                    MR. DETMER\r\n          Shit. Jesus, look at this.   Can I\r\n          have a moment with my son.\r\n\r\n                    POLICE DETECTIVE\r\n          Yeah I- I'll be outside the door,\r\n          yeah?\r\n                                                        77.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MR. DETMER\r\n          Okay.\r\n\r\nThe officer closes the door, and Mr. Detmer goes and sits\r\ndown in a chair next to the bed. He sits there staring at\r\nAndrew, clearly horrified and upset, and buries his head in\r\nhis hands. We SPEED UP THE RECORDING, and Detmer just sits\r\nlike that. After five minutes of speed up, we slow down.\r\n\r\n                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)\r\n          I want you to apologize to me.\r\n\r\nAndrew is comatose.\r\n\r\n                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)\r\n          I said I want you to apologize to\r\n          me. I know you can hear me. So I\r\n          want you to sit up and apologize to\r\n          me. I want you to stop this\r\n          bullshit right now.\r\n\r\nAndrew is comatose.\r\n\r\n                     MR. DETMER (CONT'D)\r\n          Do you know how much this shit is\r\n          going to cost me? Do you know what\r\n          you've done to your family?\r\n              (beat)\r\n          You don't even care, do you? You\r\n          just don't give a fuck, you've got\r\n          your fucking morphine, don't you.\r\n\r\nThere's a beat, and then Detmer suddenly slaps Andrew's burnt\r\nshoulder. Andrew flinches badly, and his pulse speeds up on\r\nthe monitor.\r\n                     MR. DETMER (CONT'D)\r\n          Stop it. I'm not buying this shit,\r\n          you can't just play this off like a\r\n          fucking\r\n              (slap)\r\n          Game, this is real. You really\r\n          fucked me, me and your mother you\r\n          know that, you little\r\n              (slap)\r\n          Shit.\r\nAndrew no longer flinches, but the slaps leave red, bleeding\r\nmolten welts. Detmer stands up, clearly upset, and takes a\r\nquick pace forward and back.\r\n\r\n                    MR. DETMER (CONT'D)\r\n          Goddamn it, goddamn it!-\r\n                                                           78.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetmer goes to slap Andrew again, and Andrew's arm jerks up.\r\nMr. Detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air.\r\n\r\nHe hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes\r\nrigid.\r\n\r\nAndrew spreads his fingers, and his father abruptly separates\r\ninto all of his component parts.\r\nThey stop moving, hanging lifeless, then drop to the ground\r\nin a bloody mess.\r\n\r\nAndrew's eyes open, revealing black-red eightball\r\nhemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream of\r\nagony, and then another, tearing at his IV.\r\n\r\nThe police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror to\r\nthe gore that was Andrew's father. They barely have time to\r\nscream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, and\r\nlets out AN ENORMOUS CONCUSSIVE BLAST, blowing apart\r\neverything in the room including the camera.\r\n                                              SMASH CUT TO:\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM CASEY'S CAMERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT.

Casey's\r\nbreathing is painfully short and sharp. Matt stares out into\r\nthe night sky.\r\n\r\nHe flicks on the brights. There's Andrew, in his hospital\r\ngown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and\r\ntwisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain.\r\nA news helicopter circles past out of sight, and for a\r\nmoment, Andrew is framed in the chopper's spotlight.\r\n\r\nHis eyes flash to the car.\r\n\r\n                    ANDREW\r\n              (screaming)\r\n          WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?\r\nThe windshield is TORN OUT, and seconds later MATT IS RIPPED\r\nOUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK, taking his\r\nseatbelt with him.\r\n                     CASEY\r\n          No NO NO\r\n                                                         83.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe car goes into freefall, no longer important to Andrew,\r\nplummeting down, down, down. Casey's screams are barely\r\naudible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush\r\npast outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to\r\nher death.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly, so suddenly it's completely disorienting,\r\nthe side of the car bursts apart and we're flying, blurred\r\nviews of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans...\r\n\r\nStillness.

We're too far away to hear anything that's\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nMatt tries again, and Andrew yells something. Matt, clearly\r\nupset, replies. Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures\r\ntowards his burns. Matt tries to reply several times, but\r\nAndrew isn't hearing it. Matt smiles nervously at the\r\ndestruction, and says something gently.\r\n\r\nAndrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a\r\nradical shift in Matt's demeanor. He's no longer concerned;\r\nhe seems repulsed. Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING at\r\nMatt.\r\n\r\nMatt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents.\r\nMatt continues, more forcefully, and then notices something\r\nto his right. A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR, SWATTING HIM\r\nLIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.\r\nAndrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopper;\r\na mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MICHAEL ERNESTO'S CAMERA.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL ERNESTO is, along with several other people from his\r\nbuilding, out on his roof.

Matt gets the upperhand, decking\r\nAndrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the cop\r\ncar (our POV), lifts off.\r\n\r\nWE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he turns\r\nand creates a telekinetic wall.\r\n                                                        86.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM CALA PRENTI'S CAMERA.\r\n\r\nCALA, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock and\r\nhorror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sent\r\nFLIPPING INTO THE AIR, and we glimpse it as it passes her\r\nwindow, lights still flaring.\r\n\r\nHer sister rushes up, looking out the window.\r\n\r\n                    CALA (O.S.)\r\n          Sissy stay away from the window!\r\n\r\n                    SISSY\r\n          What's happening what's happening-\r\n\r\n                    CALA (O.S.)\r\n          They're right out there fighting!\r\n          They're-\r\n\r\nAndrew and Matt come BLASTING UP THROUGH THE FLOOR IN THE\r\nKITCHEN OFF TO THE RIGHT, AND THEN OUT THROUGH THE CEILING.\r\n\r\nFROM KPR-PORTLAND'S HELICAM.\r\n\r\nThe two boys come smashing up through the roof of the\r\napartment building. Andrew flies low, and Matt gives chase.\r\nAndrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at\r\nstreet level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees,\r\netc...\r\n...But Matt's too good a flyer. What he doesn't block he\r\nsimply dips and weaves around. Andrew, clearly still woozy,\r\nis distracted and smashes into a street-light, wiping out on\r\nthe asphalt.\r\n                    CAMERA-MAN\r\n          They're down. One of them just\r\n          went down. Jesus christ.\r\n\r\nMatt slowly lands nearby. The camera zooms in and hits them\r\nboth with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes and\r\nlook up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand.\r\n\r\nWe get a good look at the toll this is taking on him; Matt's\r\nface is a crimson mask of blood from his nose, eyes, mouth\r\nand ears. He's limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly\r\ncovered with injuries. He looks like he's been in a car\r\nwreck.\r\n\r\n                    CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh shit, look at him.\r\n                                                         87.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe approaches Andrew, talking again, more fervently. Andrew\r\njust shakes his head, falling repeatedly as he tries to\r\nstand, like a wounded dog.\r\n\r\nTwo cop cars skid to a halt nearby, the officers unloading\r\nand taking cover. One of them advances on Matt and Andrew,\r\ngun raised. Matt goes out in front of Andrew, protective,\r\npleading, raising his hands.\r\n\r\nThe cop is clearly panicked. He fires a shot.    Matt's arm\r\nwhips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain,\r\nholding his hand, which is gushing blood.\r\n\r\n                                            Andrew blasts the\r\nMatt falls, screaming, and Andrew stands.\r\nofficers backwards.\r\n                     CAMERA-MAN (CONT'D)\r\n          OH SHIT!   Oh jesus christ!\r\n\r\nAndrew approaches Matt, screaming and looking absolutely\r\nterrifying. Matt turns and ROCKETS OFF INTO THE SKY, Andrew\r\nfollowing a second later, tackling Matt out of the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM KPR-PORTLAND'S LIVE-ON-THE-SCENE.\r\n\r\nWe're at street level in downtown, people are absolutely\r\neverywhere, wandering out into the street, baffled, scared\r\nand looking for answers. A FIELD REPORTER fixes herself,\r\npreparing to speak.\r\n\r\n                    FIELD REPORTER\r\n          Are we...Okay, yeah, gimme- two,\r\n          one- We're live on the scene on\r\n          Parson Boulevard just south of the\r\n          center of downtown, and-\r\nThere's a rushing, screeching sound from around the corner.\r\nThe camera jerks, and moves towards the corner, the cameraman\r\nman running to see what the sound is.\r\n\r\n                    FIELD REPORTER (CONT'D)\r\n          Shawn, wait, you're unplugged.\r\n          Shawn-\r\n\r\nSomething around the corner explodes, and Matt comes flying\r\npast overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lunging\r\nat Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man,\r\nSLAMMING HIM INTO THE SIDE OF A SKYSCRAPER ON THE STREET.\r\nAndrew lifts Matt up high into the air, scraping him against\r\nbuildings on either side of the street, bouncing like a\r\npinball until-\r\n                                                           88.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM ABC 5'S HELICAM.\r\n\r\n-Matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; a\r\nmassive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketing\r\ndownwards as though shot out of a cannon.\r\nThey strike the massive bronze statue of \"Portlandia,\" a\r\ntrident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Graves\r\nbuilding, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nMatt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops\r\ndown at a broken, dead angle. Andrew lands nearly as badly,\r\nlays still for a moment, and then begins twitching and\r\nscreaming when the chopper's spotlight hits him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MICHAEL GRAVES' BUILDING EXTERIOR SECURITY CAMERA\r\n\r\nThe statue of Portlandia lays awkwardly in the street.\r\nAndrew writhes. Matt is motionless, blood pooling around\r\nhim, his back broken.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM POLICE DASHBOARD CAMS, HELICOPTER CAMERAS, HANDHELDS\r\nFROM WINDOWS, EVERYTHING.\r\n\r\nA bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the\r\nfront of the Michael Graves building and downed statue. Matt\r\nand Andrew's bodies are painted by spotlights as police and\r\nnews helicopters hang overhead.\r\n\r\nPolice unload en-mass, guns out, immediately forming a\r\nperimeter and pushing in. We're with them as they approach;\r\nthe mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting\r\nback and forth to each other.\r\nAndrew and Matt are polka-dotted by red-laser sight dots.\r\n\r\nAndrew suddenly stands up, and several officers fire; the\r\nbullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him, and\r\nhe shakily raises both hands.\r\n\r\nThe all of the police officers, firemen and paramedics are\r\ntelekinetically lifted into the air.\r\n\r\nThey hang struggling for a moment, and then all of their\r\nlimbs go rigid. We've seen this before.\r\n\r\nAndrew screams, and then...It all happens in under two\r\nseconds:\r\n                                                         89.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of\r\nPortlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard,\r\nfirst through Andrew, then into the pavement.\r\n\r\nAndrew stands impaled, a look of shock on his face, and then\r\nMatt flails up his hand; the bullet lodged inside fires out,\r\nstriking Andrew in the head, killing him instantly.\r\n\r\nAll of the floating people drop, dazed.\r\n\r\nMatt collapses.   After a moment, the police advance.\r\n\r\n                                              CUT TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM CLEAN ROOM CAMS.\r\n\r\nThe clean room cams are incredibly hi-def, crisp and clear,\r\nwith all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the\r\ntop and bottom of the screens.\r\n\r\nMatt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room. At the far\r\nend is a blackened out two way mirror. There's a camera on\r\nthe inside of this too, and we can see resolute men in suits\r\nreflected on the inner glass, watching with unreadable\r\nexpressions.\r\n\r\nThere is a chair and a table, but he's clearly fallen out of\r\nthe chair. It's maybe an hour after the scene in front of\r\nthe Michael Graves building, and he's received no medical\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nTo this end, Matt is suffering from, among other things,\r\nmassive blood-loss, multiple broken bones, dozens of gashes\r\nand cuts, presumed internal bleeding, and a broken back.\r\nHe can barely move, sliding around on the floor in his own\r\nblood as he dies, watched by the compassionless eyes of the\r\ncameras.\r\n\r\nHe is barely coherent, screeching in agony.\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          Please...Help me. Help me, HELP ME,\r\n          please...I'm sorry! I'm so sorry,\r\n          I tried- help me, help me, I'm\r\n          dying, I'm dying. Stars- I see\r\n          stars, somebody- It hurts, please.\r\n          I'm- the blood...I tried...\r\n\r\nTwo men in contamination suits enter the room, wielding some\r\nkind of radiation sensors. They go over to Matt, scanning\r\nhim.\r\n                                                          90.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MATT (CONT'D)\r\n          Listen, help me, help me.

I-\r\n\r\nThe men ignore him as Matt makes some gasping sounds, his\r\neyes going wide.\r\n\r\n                    MATT (CONT'D)\r\n          I can...I can hear the singing.\r\n\r\nMatt entirely stops moving.   He lays there, not breathing,\r\ncompletely still.\r\n\r\nAnd then suddenly the two men are flung backwards, as is the\r\ntable and the chair. There are a series of grotesque popping\r\nand snapping sounds from Matt's body, and he jerks, and\r\nwrithes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees.\r\n\r\nThe security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, we\r\nrealize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves.\r\nHis broken bones have already molded back into place. His\r\nbruises are shrinking away to nothing.\r\n\r\nThe blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its\r\nframe, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking\r\nmilitary personnel, along with several men in civilian\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nMatt stares at them.   They stare back at him.\r\n\r\n                    4-STAR GENERAL\r\n              (terrified)\r\n          Listen...Son, you don't- I mean...\r\nMatt raises a finger to his lips, and the general trails off.\r\nMatt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.\r\n\r\n                    MATT\r\n          Would you please...turn off the\r\n          fucking cameras.\r\n                                               CUT TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n                                               HOLD ON BLACK\r\n                                               FOR A MOMENT.\r\n\r\n                                            SMALL TITLE: (2\r\n                                               YEARS LATER)\r\n                                                        91.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM INTERNATIONAL NEWS BROADCASTS.\r\n\r\nWe see a variety of international reporters covering a\r\nbreaking story, but only see little clips of each, in\r\nmultiple languages.

KIM HAI-SU'S HOUSE\r\n\r\nKim Hai-Su, 17, is behind the camera filming his father, 40s,\r\nas his father hurries to gather his things into a duffle.\r\nKim Hai-Su's younger brother, 8, wanders into the room,\r\ncrying loudly, and Kim's father screams at him to put down\r\nthe camera.\r\n\r\n                                                     CUT.\r\nThey're in the car, driving fast through town. All around we\r\ncan see people panicking, and we see two cars collide on the\r\nroad up ahead.\r\n\r\n                                                     CUT.\r\n\r\nThey pull up onto an on-ramp, and are immediately trapped\r\ninto gridlocked, dead-end traffic. Kim Hai-Su's father\r\nbegins shrieking, and banging on the dashboard, which\r\ntriggers his younger brother crying again. Kim shouts to\r\ncalm down.\r\n\r\n                                                     CUT.\r\n\r\nKim is climbing out of the car; people all around are getting\r\nout of their cars, hopelessly trapped. Someone screams, and\r\nKim turns to reveal an enormous dam several miles away.\r\n                                                        92.\r\n\r\n\r\nRubble is falling off the side of an gigantic crack, which\r\nsplits further. Kim yells in fear. The crack widens, an\r\nenormous tidal gush of water bursts through, gushing down the\r\nside of the hills into the valley.\r\nKim's father embraces him, and they have a brief exchange,\r\nwhen suddenly there's the sound of a sonic boom overhead.\r\n\r\nAll around them people EXPLODE into cheers. It's not fear,\r\nbut rather a kind of frantic ovation. The camera sweeps up,\r\npanning the empty blue sky excitedly, finally coming to rest\r\non\r\n\r\nMatt Garrety.\r\n\r\nLooking fucking great as he floats above the freeway. He\r\npantomimes \"yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!\" This gets the\r\nintended response, and he pumps a fist shouting \"FUCK YEAH\r\nKOREA!\"\r\n\r\nHe turns, pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the\r\nfirst time, mouths \"Oh shit!\" Points at the flood casually\r\nas it closes in: \"I should deal with this.\" Another huge\r\novation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head \"yeahhhhhh!\"\r\nand turns.\r\n\r\nThere's a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach 4 in less\r\nthan a second, rattling the cars on the freeway, disappearing\r\ninto the distance over the flood.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, the impossibly huge onrush of water seems to\r\nstop, slowing and freezing in place, and then...SLOWLY BEGINS\r\nTO REWIND TOWARDS THE DAM.\r\nThe camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane,\r\nembracing, kissing, screaming, jumping on their cars. Kim's\r\nfather has collapsed into tears of joy next to the car, and\r\nKim himself is hooting and hollering from the bottom of his\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\nThe camera comes up to show his little brother, who is going\r\npositively ape-shit on the hood of their car, jumping up and\r\ndown, screaming, smiling...\r\n\r\nAn unearthly, angelic, vibrating chorus of voices starts to\r\nrise, rise, singing and we-\r\n\r\n                                         SLAM TO TITLE ON\r\n                                                   BLACK:\r\n                                               CHRONICLE.\r\n\n\n\n\nChronicle\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Max Landis\u00a0\u00a0Josh Trank\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:29.616072"}
