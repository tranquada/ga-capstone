SUBURBIA - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tA beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers\n\tsprinkling.\n\n\tWe PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,\n\twhere we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He\n\thas a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly\n\tthe lights turn on.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPEEPER\n</b>\t\t\t(whispering)\n\t\tShowtime!\n\n\tWe see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's\n\twindow.

I wish you would let me\n\t\trub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't\n\t\tuse my hands.  Heh heh heh heh...\n\n\tHe sips some wine.\n\n\tThe mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off,\n\trevealing a nice bra.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tLooks like Victoria just told me her\n\t\tsecret.\n\n\tThe peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing\n\tthe words as he goes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tThursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,\n\t\tfirst brassiere sighting...\n\t\t\t(stops writing)\n\t\tI will pleasure myself to this image for\n\t\tmonths.

You mother was just\n\t\tgetting comfy.\n\n\tThe son talks to his mother excitedly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tYes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great\n\t\tknots today or whatever.

Is there a man up\n\t\tour tree?\n\n\tThe peeper gets nervous.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPEEPER\n</b>\t\tTell her no.  Tell her it's just a big\n\t\tbird.\n\n\tThe peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.\n\tWe SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He\n\tshoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls\n\tto the ground with a thud.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tMrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And\n\t\twear your bikini.\n\n\tThe peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television\n\tout the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t   HARD CUT:\n</b>\n<b>\tINT. HOLE - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on\n\tall sides.\n\n\tThe peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way\n\tscreaming like a five-year old girl.\n\n<b>\tPEEPER'S POV\n</b>\n\tWe see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the\n\tpeeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He\n<b>\tSCREAMS.\n</b>\n<b>\tEXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL\n</b>\n\tWe see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.  We hear screaming.  Wham!\n\tWe see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in\n\ta heap in a shallow pit of coals.\n\n\tDazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the\n\tfire wall at different levels.  (NOTE: All the arrivals\n\tclothes are now burned &amp; shredded).\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER (O.S.)\n</b>\t\tWelcome!\n\n\tThe peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his\n\tstation greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPEEPER\n</b>\t\tAm I in hell?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER\n</b>\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n\tA GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.

A road leads toward it\n\tlike the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  We see\n\tthe black castle in the distance.  The camera zooms into the\n\tcastle, to one particular window.\n\n<b>\tINT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n\tLooks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,\n\theavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no\n\tbed - Devils don't sleep).  Nicky is air guitaring to the\n\tsong.  Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled\n<b>\t\"NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX.\"\n</b>\n\tThe head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring\n\tNICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICKY\n</b>\t\t\t(embarrassed)\n\t\tHey...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJIMMY THE DEMON\n</b>\t\tYour father wants to see you and your\n\t\tbrothers in the throne room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICKY\n</b>\t\tOkay, but Jimmy, when the house is\n\t\trockin', don't forget the knockin'!\n\n<b>\tINT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n\tADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.  They're aiming for\n\tpeople's faces that are coming through the wall.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n</b>\t\tI knew it.  He's finally retiring.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n</b>\t\tI've been waiting on this day for ten\n\t\tthousand years.\n\n\tHe throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHUMAN DARTBOARD\n</b>\t\tAaaah!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n</b>\t\tIf the old man picks me to take over\n\t\tHell, I'll keep the torture going twenty\n\t\tfour seven.

You have to let people\n\t\tfeel a sense of relief.\n\n\tCassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS\n\tin the eye.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHUMAN DARTBOARD\n</b>\t\tAaaaaaaaaaaah!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n</b>\t\tThen again, the beauty of Dad retiring\n\t\tis what he says doesn't matter anymore.\n\n\tCassius pulls out the dart.  The eye comes with it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n</b>\t\tI'll take that.\n\n\tCassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.  THWACK!\n\tIt splatters like a grape.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHUMAN DARTBOARD\n</b>\t\tWas that really necessary?\n\n\tNicky enters sheepishly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n</b>\t\tHey, how's Daddy's little girl doing\n\t\ttoday?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICKY\n</b>\t\tGood, thanks.\n\n\tCassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n</b>\t\tHey.

Please Cassius...\n\n\tNicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer\n\tuntil it latches on to Nicky's crotch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICKY (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tAaaaah.\n\n\tCassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own\n\thand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't\n\tnotice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small\n\tdevil horns), enters behind them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDAD\n</b>\t\tWhat are you boys doing?\n\n\tCassius releases Nicky's hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICKY\n</b>\t\tNothing, Dad.

Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of\n\tconfidence and power.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDAD (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tNow everybody sit down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNICKY\n</b>\t\tHey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying\n\t\tdown my monsters of metal compilation\n\t\ttape.  I really think it's a\n\t\tmasterpiece.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDAD\n</b>\t\tOkay, kid, we'll listen to it later.\n\n\tHe leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the\n\twindow the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his\n\thead.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad\n\tcloses the curtains.\n\n\tNicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of\n\this throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip\n\tof which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at\n\this three sons.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDAD (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tMy dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was\n\t\tthrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules\n\t\there in hell for ten thousand years.\n\t\tAnd after this ten thousand years had\n\t\tpassed, he decided to abdicate his\n\t\tthrone...\n\n\tConfused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDAD (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t...to step aside.\n\t\t\t(Nicky lowers his hand)\n\t\t...and let me become the ruler of hell.\n\t\tThis, as some of you might know, is my\n\t\tten thousandth year as Prince of\n\t\tDarkness.

Dad turns his attention\n\tback to his sons.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDAD\n</b>\t\tThis was a very difficult decision,\n\t\tbecause I have three wonderful sons.

This is Hoyashit.\n\n\tDad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human\n\tDartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the\n\ttongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDAD\n</b>\t\tRight.  Right.  Send him in.\n\t\t\t(to the boys)\n\t\tI'm sorry, boys.

Adrian stops.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n</b>\t\tYou sure about this decision, Dad?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDAD\n</b>\t\tI'm telling you, pal, it's the right\n\t\tthing to do.\n\n\tHITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by\n\tJimmy.  They head towards the closet.\n\n\tInside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out\n\ta relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head \"no.\"  Dad walks\n\tover to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.\n\tDad nods \"yes.\"  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends\n\tHitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...\n\n<b>\tCLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES\n</b>\n\tAs the pineapple's jammed up his ass.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHITLER\n</b>\t\tHoly schnit!!\n\n<b>\tEXT.
