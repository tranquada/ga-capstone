SUBURBIA - NIGHT\n\n\tA beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers\n\tsprinkling.\n\n\tWe PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree,\n\twhere we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He\n\thas a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly\n\tthe lights turn on.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER\n\t\t\t(whispering)\n\t\tShowtime!\n\n\tWe see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's\n\twindow.  She is wearing business attire.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\tRough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy?\n\t\t\t(takes bite of sandwich)\n\t\tWell you'll feel better once you slip\n\t\toff those work clothes and get into some\n\t\tsweats.\n\n\tThe mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing\n\ther feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\tOh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me\n\t\trub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't\n\t\tuse my hands.  Heh heh heh heh...\n\n\tHe sips some wine.\n\n\tThe mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off,\n\trevealing a nice bra.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\tLooks like Victoria just told me her\n\t\tsecret.\n\n\tThe peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing\n\tthe words as he goes.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\tThursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m.,\n\t\tfirst brassiere sighting...\n\t\t\t(stops writing)\n\t\tI will pleasure myself to this image for\n\t\tmonths.  MONTHS I TELL YOU!\n\n\tThe mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks\n\tin wearing a scouts uniform.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\tYoung Scottie Dunleavy.  What\n\t\tunfortunate timing.  You mother was just\n\t\tgetting comfy.\n\n\tThe son talks to his mother excitedly.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\tYes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great\n\t\tknots today or whatever.  Now get out.\n\n\tThe son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\tNow what.  This simply won't do.\n\n\tThe peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son\n\tanswers.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTTIE\n\t\tHello?\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER\n\t\tHello, Scottie.  Why don't you go\n\t\tdownstairs like a good boy and let your\n\t\tmother freshen up.\n\n\t\t\t\tSCOTTIE\n\t\tWho is this?\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER\n\t\tJust a little birdie.  A birdie who\n\t\twants to see if your mother's panties\n\t\tmatch her bra.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOTHER\n\t\tOh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up\n\t\tour tree?\n\n\tThe peeper gets nervous.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER\n\t\tTell her no.  Tell her it's just a big\n\t\tbird.\n\n\tThe peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises.\n\tWe SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He\n\tshoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls\n\tto the ground with a thud.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\tMrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And\n\t\twear your bikini.\n\n\tThe peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television\n\tout the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t   HARD CUT:\n\n\tINT. HOLE - DAY\n\n\tThe peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on\n\tall sides.\n\n\tThe peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way\n\tscreaming like a five-year old girl.\n\n\tPEEPER'S POV\n\n\tWe see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the\n\tpeeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He\n\tSCREAMS.\n\n\tEXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL\n\n\tWe see the GATE/WALL OF FLAMES.  We hear screaming.  Wham!\n\tWe see the peeper come flying through the flames and land in\n\ta heap in a shallow pit of coals.\n\n\tDazed, he stands and we see other people shooting through the\n\tfire wall at different levels.  (NOTE: All the arrivals\n\tclothes are now burned & shredded).\n\n\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER (O.S.)\n\t\tWelcome!\n\n\tThe peeper looks left to see the GATEKEEPER standing at his\n\tstation greeting the new SOULS with mock cheer.\n\n\t\t\t\tPEEPER\n\t\tAm I in hell?\n\n\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER\n\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n\tA GIANT BIRD appears and bites the peeper's crotch area.  We\n\tleave the peeper in the pit and tilt up to...\n\n\tMATTE PAINTING HELL\n\n\tMUSIC UP: \"RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL\" BY VAN HALEN\n\n\tThe VAST and insane kingdom of Hell.  A road leads toward it\n\tlike the yellow brick road only with fire and coals.  We see\n\tthe black castle in the distance.  The camera zooms into the\n\tcastle, to one particular window.\n\n\tINT. NICKY'S ROOM - DAY\n\n\tLooks like an American teenager's room - models, a dresser,\n\theavy metal posters (tons of OZZY stuff) everywhere (but no\n\tbed - Devils don't sleep).  Nicky is air guitaring to the\n\tsong.  Over at the stereo, we see the cassette playing titled\n\t\"NICKY'S MONSTER METAL MIX.\"\n\n\tThe head demon, JIMMY THE DEMON, opens the door, scaring\n\tNICKY who falls backward into the table, breaking it.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\t\t(embarrassed)\n\t\tHey...\n\n\t\t\t\tJIMMY THE DEMON\n\t\tYour father wants to see you and your\n\t\tbrothers in the throne room.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tOkay, but Jimmy, when the house is\n\t\trockin', don't forget the knockin'!\n\n\tINT. BLACK PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY\n\n\tADRIAN and CASSIUS are playing darts.  They're aiming for\n\tpeople's faces that are coming through the wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tI knew it.  He's finally retiring.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tI've been waiting on this day for ten\n\t\tthousand years.\n\n\tHe throws a dart that hits one of the heads in the forehead.\n\n\t\t\t\tHUMAN DARTBOARD\n\t\tAaaah!\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tIf the old man picks me to take over\n\t\tHell, I'll keep the torture going twenty\n\t\tfour seven.  No breaks.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tWell Dad says it's the breaks that make\n\t\tthe torture.  You have to let people\n\t\tfeel a sense of relief.\n\n\tCassius whips a dart which hits one of the HUMAN DARTBOARDS\n\tin the eye.\n\n\t\t\t\tHUMAN DARTBOARD\n\t\tAaaaaaaaaaaah!\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tThen again, the beauty of Dad retiring\n\t\tis what he says doesn't matter anymore.\n\n\tCassius pulls out the dart.  The eye comes with it.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tI'll take that.\n\n\tCassius throws the eye on the ground and stomps it.  THWACK!\n\tIt splatters like a grape.\n\n\t\t\t\tHUMAN DARTBOARD\n\t\tWas that really necessary?\n\n\tNicky enters sheepishly.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tHey, how's Daddy's little girl doing\n\t\ttoday?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tGood, thanks.\n\n\tCassius snaps his fingers in Nicky's face.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tHey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?\n\n\tCassius' eyes start glowing red.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tActually, I'll take a rain check on0\n\n\tNicky is slammed into a nearby desk as if by an invisible\n\tforce.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tGot ya!\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\t\t(picking up his head)\n\t\tYes, you got me...\n\n\tNicky's head slams back down again.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tGot ya, again!\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\t\t(picking head up)\n\t\tGot me for sure, yes...\n\n\tHe grabs a lamp off the desk and cracks himself over the\n\thead.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tGot ya!  Now here's the big finish...\n\n\tNicky frowns as he finds his own right hand heading for his\n\town crotch.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tOh no.  Please Cassius...\n\n\tNicky's hand is being possessed.  It gets closer and closer\n\tuntil it latches on to Nicky's crotch.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY (CONT'D)\n\t\tAaaaah.\n\n\tCassius concentrates even harder, making Nicky twist his own\n\thand.  Nicky screams even louder.  Adrian smiles.  They don't\n\tnotice that DAD, wearing a sweatsuit (and with very small\n\tdevil horns), enters behind them.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tWhat are you boys doing?\n\n\tCassius releases Nicky's hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tNothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the\n\t\tfurniture.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tCassius, didn't I tell you to stay out\n\t\tof your brother's mind?\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tI forgot.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tMaybe this will help you remember.\n\n\tDad's eyes flash red and Cassius punches himself hard in the\n\tnose, sending him back against the wall and down to the\n\tfloor.\n\n\tDad gives Nicky a wink.  Nicky smiles.  Dad has an air of\n\tconfidence and power.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD (CONT'D)\n\t\tNow everybody sit down.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tHey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying\n\t\tdown my monsters of metal compilation\n\t\ttape.  I really think it's a\n\t\tmasterpiece.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tOkay, kid, we'll listen to it later.\n\n\tHe leads the boys to the throne area.  We see outside the\n\twindow the peeper staring in sexily.  Dad looks, shakes his\n\thead.  Just then, THE BIRD appears and attacks him.  Dad\n\tcloses the curtains.\n\n\tNicky, Adrian and Cassius sit on little stools at the foot of\n\this throne.  Dad lights a cigarette with his finger, the tip\n\tof which glows red like a cigarette lighter and looks down at\n\this three sons.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD (CONT'D)\n\t\tMy dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was\n\t\tthrown out of Heaven by G-d and rules\n\t\there in hell for ten thousand years.\n\t\tAnd after this ten thousand years had\n\t\tpassed, he decided to abdicate his\n\t\tthrone...\n\n\tConfused, Nicky sheepishly raises his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD (CONT'D)\n\t\t...to step aside.\n\t\t\t(Nicky lowers his hand)\n\t\t...and let me become the ruler of hell.\n\t\tThis, as some of you might know, is my\n\t\tten thousandth year as Prince of\n\t\tDarkness.  So I think the time has come\n\t\tto discuss who will succeed me.\n\n\tJimmy the Demon walks in.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIMMY THE DEMON\n\t\tKnock, knock.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tYes, Jimmy.\n\n\tHe whispers in Dad's ear.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD (CONT'D)\n\t\tNo, no, that's not what I said.  He can\n\t\tkeep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta\n\t\tgo.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIMMY THE DEMON\n\t\t\t(turning to leave)\n\t\tOh, and don't forget, you're shoving a\n\t\tpineapple up Hitler's ass at four\n\t\to'clock.\n\n\tDad nods, and Jimmy shuffles out.  Dad turns his attention\n\tback to his sons.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tThis was a very difficult decision,\n\t\tbecause I have three wonderful sons.  I\n\t\tmean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless.\n\t\tAnd Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And\n\t\tNicky, so...so...\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tDon't worry about coming up with\n\t\tanything.  It's cool.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tSuch a sweet boy.  But after much\n\t\tthought and careful consideration, I've\n\t\tdecided that the ruler for the next ten\n\t\tthousand years is going to have to\n\t\tbe...me.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS AND ADRIAN\n\t\t\t(dumbfounded)\n\t\tWhat!?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tHallelujah.\n\n\tThey all look at Nicky.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY (CONT'D)\n\t\tI mean...tough break.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tThe important thing for the stability of\n\t\tour rule is to maintain the balance\n\t\tbetween good and evil.  And I don't\n\t\tthink any of you are ready for that\n\t\tresponsibility yet.  You need the wisdom\n\t\tthat comes only with the passage of\n\t\ttime.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tDad!  This is Hoyashit.\n\n\tDad glares.  Cassius goes FLYING BACK.  One of the Human\n\tDartboards laughs.  Cassius whips a dart and hits him in the\n\ttongue.  Jimmy enters and points at his watch.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tRight.  Right.  Send him in.\n\t\t\t(to the boys)\n\t\tI'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back\n\t\tto work.\n\n\tNicky, Cassius and Adrian start filing out.  Adrian stops.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tYou sure about this decision, Dad?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tI'm telling you, pal, it's the right\n\t\tthing to do.\n\n\tHITLER (in a French maid's outfit), is being brought in by\n\tJimmy.  They head towards the closet.\n\n\tInside the closet is a crate of pineapples.  Hitler picks out\n\ta relatively small one.  Dad shakes his head \"no.\"  Dad walks\n\tover to the closet.  Hitler picks out a really big pineapple.\n\tDad nods \"yes.\"  Hitler sadly hands it to Dad.  Jimmy bends\n\tHitler over and as Dad raises the fruit...\n\n\tCLOSE ON HITLER'S EYES\n\n\tAs the pineapple's jammed up his ass.\n\n\t\t\t\tHITLER\n\t\tHoly schnit!!\n\n\tEXT. HIGHWAY TO HELL - DAY\n\n\tCassius and Adrian are standing by the road still flowing\n\twith souls.  Both are pissed.  There's a big, ugly, Bigfoot\n\tlooking MONSTER hanging out with them, kind of nodding along.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tYou work your ass off for ten thousand\n\t\tyears, hurting people, helping others\n\t\thurt people, then you get a decision\n\t\tlike that.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tAnd he's dead serious.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tIt's just such a slap in the face.\n\n\tAdrian turns to the Monster.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tUm, excuse me, we're having a private\n\t\tconversation here.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tYeah, get out of here!  Beat it!\n\n\tCassius insanely snaps his fingers in the Monster's face.\n\tThe Monster shrugs and walks off.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tTwenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa\n\t\tLucifer said, \"It is better to rule in\n\t\thell than serve in heaven.\"  Well, I'm\n\t\tgetting tired of serving in Hell.  We\n\t\tneed a place where we can rule.\n\n\tCassius throws a rock at the Monster.  He yelps, then turns\n\taround, motioning like he's thinking about coming back.\n\tCassius sees this and gets enraged.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tOh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it\n\t\ton!! Let's see what you got!\n\n\tThe Monster, upon further reflection, throws his hands up in\n\tan \"aw phooey\" gesture and continues walking away.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS (CONT'D)\n\t\tThat's what I thought!\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\t\t(to Cassius)\n\t\tCould you concentrate for five seconds?\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tI am concentrating.  Where can we rule?\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tWhat do you think about...Earth?\n\n\tCassius seems to think this isn't a bad idea.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN (CONT'D)\n\t\tWe could create our own hell there.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\tYou saying we go up there and kill\n\t\teveryone?\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tEventually, Cassius.  But first we\n\t\tcorrupt as many as we can so that when\n\t\twe do destroy them...\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS\n\t\t...their damned souls will be ours.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tIt's our time, brother.\n\n\tThe two look at each other.  They start running toward the\n\tfire wall.  Knocking souls out of their way.\n\n\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER\n\t\tHey, what are you doing?!?\n\n\tThey get closer to the fire.\n\n\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\tYou can't go through there.  The fire\n\t\tflows in, not out.\n\n\tThey dive through the fire wall.  It FREEZES.\n\n\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\tYou know something?  You guys suck!  You\n\t\treally suck!\n\n\tSirens go off.  Dogs start barking.  Lights flash.  And we\n\thear the sound of DAMNED SOULS hitting the back of the\n\tfirewall hard.\n\n\tINT. THRONE ROOM - SHORTLY AFTER\n\n\tDad and Nicky are listening to one of Nicky's metal mix\n\ttapes.  We hear the end of Pink Floyd's \"Comfortably Numb.\"\n\tPause.  Dad exhales.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tNow that was an experience.  \"You are\n\t\tonly coming through in waves.\"  That\n\t\tline blows my mind every time.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tDefinitely.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tI don't care what kind of mood you're in\n\t\tat the start of that song.  When it's\n\t\tover, that mood has been altered.  Wow.\n\t\tGreat shit.  What's next?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tWell, I thought that after messing with\n\t\tyour head, I'd give you a little kick in\n\t\tthe keester.\n\n\tHits the tape player.  \"Enter Sandman\" blasts.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tWho is this, Metal-lick-a?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tMetallica, Dad.  Come on.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tI was just playing with you.\n\n\tDad and Nicky dance to the song.\n\n\tINT. THRONE ROOM - LATER\n\n\tCLOSE ON DAD.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tI'm sorry.  After careful consideration,\n\t\tI regretfully have to decline.\n\n\tON PERSON HE'S TALKING TO: DAN MARINO.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAN\n\t\tC'mon, man, I'm just asking for one\n\t\tSuperbowl ring.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tIn exchange for eternal damnation of\n\t\tyour soul?  You're too nice of a guy for\n\t\tme to want to do that to you, Mr.\n\t\tMarino.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAN\n\t\tYou did it for Namath.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tYeah, but Joe was coming here anyways.\n\t\tJust go back to Earth and enjoy your\n\t\trecords and the Hall of Fame and the\n\t\tbeautiful family and all that.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAN\n\t\tThis is bullshit, man.\n\t\t\t(gets up to leave)\n\t\tI'm gonna win the Superbowl this year,\n\t\twith or without you!\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tNow you're talking.\n\n\tDan exits.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tYou're a good devil, Dad.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tAnd I also happen to be a Jets fan.\n\n\tNicky and Dad share a laugh which is interrupted by faint\n\tsirens.  The Gatekeeper enters in a hurry and falls to his\n\tknees.\n\n\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER\n\t\tYour highness, Cassius and Adrian have\n\t\tescaped from hell.  They went through\n\t\tthe fire, and they broke it.  I think\n\t\tthey took the New York tunnel.  I tried\n\t\tto stop them, but they overpowered me,\n\t\tsir.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tOh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off\n\t\tyour knees.\n\n\tThe Gatekeeper stands up.\n\n\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER\n\t\tThanks for being so understanding, your\n\t\tworship.  You're the man.  You've always\n\t\tbeen the man.\n\n\tDad's EYES GLOW RED as the Gatekeeper stands up.  Two huge\n\tboobs grow out of either side of the Gatekeeper's head.  We\n\tonly see them from the front for a second.\n\tFrom behind the gatekeeper, we see the boobs but not the\n\tnipples as he talks to Nicky.\n\n\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER (CONT'D)\n\t\t\t(to Nicky)\n\t\tI'm lucky to get away with just the head\n\t\tboobs, right?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tCoulda been much worse.\n\n\t\t\t\tGATEKEEPER\n\t\tThat's what I'm thinkin'...\n\n\tDad is staring off.  He looks shaken.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tThis is bad, Nicky.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tHow bad?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tI'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are\n\t\tbroken, no new souls can get in, which\n\t\tmeans I'll start to deteriorate into\n\t\tnothing.\n\n\tGRANDPA LUCIFER enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIFER\n\t\tWhat's with all the whoo-whoo noises?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tEverything's fine, pop.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIFER\n\t\tLast time you said that the renaissance\n\t\thappened.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tPlease, pop, just go back to your room.\n\n\t\t\t\tLUCIFER\n\t\t\t(regarding gateskeeper)\n\t\tCan I take him with me and have sex with\n\t\this head?\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tSure, pop.

GATES OF HELL - SHORTLY AFTER\n\n\tWe see the coals are cooling down on the road and the DAMNED\n\tSOULS in hell are sneaking off.\n\n\tThe DEMONS are baffled and don't quite know what to do.\n\n\tDad, Jimmy and Nicky walk to the frozen fire.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAMNED SOULS (O.S.)\n\t\tWhat's going on?  Where are we?\n\n\tWe keep HEARING people hit behind the frozen fire with loud\n\tthuds.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIMMY THE DEMON\n\t\tNothing's getting through that.

The process has already\n\t\tbegun.\n\n\tDad holds up his hand.  His pink is hanging by a thread.  We\n\tsee the bigfoot MONSTER grunt disgusted by the sight.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tSo go get 'em, Jimmy!\n\n\t\t\t\tJIMMY THE DEMON\n\t\tI'm just a demon, Nicky.  I don't got\n\t\tdevil blood in me.  I'd last two minutes\n\t\tup there with your brothers.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tYou're not saying it's up to me?\n\n\tThe MONSTER puts his hands over his eyes shaking his head as\n\tif to say, \"oh no.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY (CONT'D)\n\t\tI've never been to Earth.  I've never\n\t\teven slept over at some other dude's\n\t\thouse!\n\n\t\t\t\tJIMMY THE DEMON\n\t\tYou're the spawn of Satan.

Get them drunk from this.  One\n\t\tsip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once\n\t\tyou've got both of them, you bring the\n\t\tflask back through the gate.\n\n\tDad's pinky is hanging.  Jimmy pulls it off and examines it.\n\tThe Monster gags.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIMMY THE DEMON\n\t\tYour ol' man's got less than a week.\n\n\tNicky looks petrified.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tNo.  This can't be happening.\n\n\t\t\t\tDAD\n\t\tSon, just do your best.\n\n\tNicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster,\n\twho runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire.\n\n\tNicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster\n\ttaps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, \"gotta get\n\ta move on.\"\n\n\tINT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY\n\n\tA SIGN: 42ND ST.

GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY\n\n\tNicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and\n\thops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is\n\tstopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side.\n\tIn his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to\n\tidentify their passengers at the airport.

Now what?\n\n\t\t\t\tBEEFY\n\t\tPut it in your mouth.\n\n\tNicky puts it in his mouth.  Holds it there.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEEFY (CONT'D)\n\t\tMove your teeth up and down.\n\n\tNicky does.

GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER\n\n\tThe Monster is rubbing the gatekeeper's boobs.  The\n\tgatekeeper is wearing a modified bra.  He seems to be\n\tenjoying it.  We hear a THUD.  They look down to see Nicky on\n\tthe ground.  (We didn't see him flying through this time.)\n\n\tThe Monster and Gatekeeper immediately stop.

As soon as his\n\tback is turned, the monster pantomimes to the Gatekeeper, \"I\n\tlove your boobs.\"  The Gatekeeper gives a flirtatious laugh\n\t(we don't see him morph back through the wall here.).\n\n\tEXT.

The night\n\t\tReagan was elected, I said to my mother,\n\t\t\"Is this man going to blow up the world,\n\t\tMommy?\"  Then we both cried for like an\n\t\thour.\n\t\t\t(knock at the door)\n\t\tSomebody's here.  Call you later.\n\n\tTodd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by\n\this side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tHello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I\n\t\tunderstand you're seeking a roommate, as\n\t\tper your advertisement in the Village\n\t\tVoice.

Both\n\tnod imperceptibly.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tYes.  What is rent?\n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tEight-hundred, split down the middle.\n\t\tTuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with\n\t\tmy scene partner so the living room will\n\t\tbe off limits.\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tOff limits.\n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tRight.  And as far as household items:\n\t\twe can share the soap, but we'll split\n\t\tthe cost 60/40.\n\t\tCause the person who physically goes out\n\t\tand buys the soap shouldn't have to pay\n\t\tas much as the other guy.\n\t\t\t(looks at Nicky)\n\t\tAren't you boiling in that outfit?\n\n\t\t\t\tNICKY\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tIt's like eighty degrees in this\n\t\thallway.

NICKY'S ROOM\n\n\tNicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully\n\tclothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that\n\tfamiliar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we\n\thear disturbing \"speaking-in-tongues\", Exorcist-style voices.\n\n\tSLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands,\n\tlooking concerned.\n\n\tEXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING\n\n\tWe HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a\n\tlarge church.\n\n\tINT. CATHEDRAL\n\n\tCLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the\n\tsteps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation.\n\tWe see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He\n\tgins his homily.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARDINAL\n\t\tIn today's gospel, the Lord tells us who\n\t\twe are to live if we wish to attain the\n\t\tsplendor of Heaven... or something like\n\t\tthat.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in\n\t\tthe Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that.\n\t\tAbraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.\n\n\tThe crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is\n\tstanding on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box\n\twith the top open.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARDINAL (CONT'D)\n\t\tYep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of\n\t\thibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really\n\t\tdone anything for us?  Has he ever put a\n\t\tJaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever\n\t\tgiven any of my enemies the herpes?  No.\n\t\tHe hasn't done a damn thing for any of\n\t\tus.\n\n\tA MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIDDLE-AGED WOMAN\n\t\tThe Lord gave my son the strength to get\n\t\toff drugs.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARDINAL\n\t\tMa'am, I know your son, and believe me,\n\t\the was better off on drugs.  He's a\n\t\tbore.

He helped her\n\t\tconceive it all night long.\n\n\tFitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the Wife, starts\n\tto \"raise the roof.\"  Then thinks better of it.  The Cardinal\n\tpoints to a well-dressed man in the front pew.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARDINAL (CONT'D)\n\t\tHow about you, Mr. Mayor?  The Lord ever\n\t\tdo anything for you?\n\n\tThe Mayor has tinfoil on his feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAYOR\n\t\t\t(standing)\n\t\tWell, I wish I could think of something,\n\t\tCardinal, but to be honest with you, I\n\t\tcan't.  Kind of makes you wonder if\n\t\tthere even is a Lord.  If there is any\n\t\tultimate punishment for our so-called\n\t\t\"sins.\"  Maybe we should all just have\n\t\tfun and do whatever the hell we want.\n\n\tA hubbub is raised by the crowd.  Fitzie raises the roof\n\tagain, this time energetically.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARDINAL\n\t\tAmen to that.  Let the sin begin!\n\n\tThe hubbub grows to a roar.  Several PEOPLE start fighting\n\tover the money in the collection plate.\n\n\tThe Cardinal smiles knowingly at the Mayor.  We hear the\n\tCardinal's thoughts - in Adrian's voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN (O.S.)\n\t\tOh, this is delicious.\n\n\tON MAYOR\n\n\tHe's smirking.  WE HEAR his telepathic response.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(laughing)\n\t\t\"Let the sin begins\" - that was a good\n\t\tone.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN (O.S.)\n\t\tWell, we must get people sinning if we\n\t\twant to fill up our New Hell.  How are\n\t\tthings going down at City Hall?\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS (O.S.)\n\t\tI lowered the drinking age to ten.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN (O.S.)\n\t\tBrilliant.  This is so much fun.  I\n\t\tnever want it to end.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIUS (O.S.)\n\t\tWhy should it end?  Who's gonna stop us?\n\n\tThe Mayor/Cassius laughs.  As he does, his eyes slowly cross.\n\n\tEXT.

To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes\n\tit and drinks.  Nothing happens.  Nicky is baffled.  He tries\n\tto take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  Finally he\n\tgrabs it away from him.  The man starts throwing garbage at\n\tNicky as he walks away.\n\n\tINT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY\n\n\tBeefy is looking around for Nicky.

They get closer and closer until... Nicky makes a\n\tlast second right turn into an alley.

ALLEY - DAY\n\n\tNicky is panicking, out of breath.  A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up\n\tout of his cardboard box.  The bum raises his bottle and\n\tthunks Nicky on the head.

Then he fits\n\this hand up there.  Soon his whole arm is up his nostril as\n\the searches for something.  John and Peter are impressed.\n\tThe chief grabs something and starts to pull.  Then out of\n\this nose comes Adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the\n\tchief's body slumps to the ground.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tTa-da.

They all wait for him.\n\n\t\t\t\tLADY\n\t\t\t(mumbling to herself)\n\t\tFood stamps?\n\t\tThey should call 'em \"dude stamps.\"\n\t\tCause ever time I get one, some dude\n\t\ttakes it away...\n\n\tWe see the HOMELESS LADY down the platform stumbling her way\n\ttowards them, drunk.

Nicky stands up and the cottage seems to be floating\n\tdown to him.\n\n\tEXT. BIRTHDAY CAKE - DAY\n\n\tThe cake lands softly in front of him, the door ajar.
