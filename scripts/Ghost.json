An eerie \n               netherworld envelops us. Strange ghostly forms appear and \n               disappear in the distance. They seem like apparitions.\n\n               Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky \n               light. We see hints of a huge demolished space.\n\n               An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary blips \n               of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are heard \n               dimly in the distance.\n\n               With startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explodes \n               out of nowhere. The wall shudders.\n\n               HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarring. \n               The wall buckles.\n\n               Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with new \n               swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW. \n               Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the \n               atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of \n               wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the \n               air.

MOLLY \n               JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and \n               a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her \n               eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his \n               late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong \n               forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his \n               brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's, \n               removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a \n               fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               ANGLE\n</b>\n               BLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD. Suddenly a shaft of light \n               penetrates the darkness. Another thud and more light. We see \n               a hole. The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with \n               something around the edges. Then, with a tug and a loud yank, \n               a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. Huge \n               clouds of dust fly into the air.

She reaches out and superimposes an armless female \n               torso over his. His stomach jumps sensually as she touches \n               it. Molly pulls back to admire her work. He looks like a \n               Greek statue.\n\n<b>                                     CARL\n</b>                         I'll never wash again.\n\n               Molly laughs.\n\n<b>               ANGLE\n</b>\n               Sam, Molly, and Carl are holding their sledgehammers.

A massive section of plaster \n               and metal topples to the ground. New clouds of dust fill the \n               air. Suddenly, Sam spies an old jar lying on the floor. \n               Something rattles inside it, a penny.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                         Hey, look what I found.

Carl looks at the two of them \n               and grins.\n\n               As the dust settles we see, for the first time, the outlines \n               of the space they are working in. It is a huge loft over \n               four thousand square feet. Banks of windows run east and \n               west.

Sam watches the sensual movement of her fingers, \n               molding and forming the clay. She is forceful, assured, \n               gifted. The clay responds to her slightest effort. Slowly, \n               almost unconsciously, Sam reaches for her shoulders and begins \n               kissing them.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         You notice Carl's eyes today?

The arm hovers over the record and then \n               descends. It begins to play.

Wads of packing \n               paper swirl sensuously around their feet.\n\n               Molly runs her fingers down Sam's naked back. The moment is \n               sweet and erotic.

Their stomachs touch and part and touch again. She \n               bites her lip. Sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his \n               chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the \n               curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his \n               jeans.\n\n               Sam leans into Molly and nips at her neck.

A blinding tunnel spirals in an infinite \n               vortex behind them. Sam is awed and confused. We sense that \n               the light is enchanting him.

Sam, deeply troubled, hesitates for a \n               moment. He is torn between Molly and the light. Then, in a \n               painful, but conscious gesture, he turns from the light and \n               walks toward Molly. At that instant, the light behind him \n               disappears with the sound of a pneumatic door closing. There \n               is a sense of terrible finality as the tunnel evaporates \n               into the void. Sam is left on the dark pavement.

He \n               seems excited to have survived and is very pleased with \n               himself.\n\n<b>               EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY\n</b>\n               The Mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward \n               the subway. A patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his \n               eye.\n\n               Sam starts after the man but instantly freezes. Hordes of \n               people crowd the sidewalk. The crush of humanity is \n               frightening. Two lovers, holding hands, are coming right at \n               him. Before Sam is able to move, we hear the sound of their \n               arms cutting through his ghostly form.\n\n               Sam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people \n               approach him from all angles.\n\n               We hear a BABY CARRIAGE roll through Sam's feet and he nearly \n               falls over trying to avoid it. His instincts will not let \n               go.\n\n               A barrage of images and SOUNDS assaults Sam. It is more than \n               he can handle. Still, he refuses to give up. He stays close \n               to the Mugger.\n\n<b>               EXT.

SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY\n</b>\n               The Mugger gets onto a crowded subway car. Sam stands near a \n               corner of the train watching him.\n\n               Suddenly, Sam notices that something odd is happening. One \n               of the riders at the other end of the car is walking toward \n               him. As he approaches the Mugger, he does not stop, but passes \n               right through him. It takes Sam a moment to realize what is \n               happening, but then it is too late.\n\n<b>               ANGLE - THE OTHER GHOST\n</b>\n               With unholy fury the New Ghost charges into Sam. The attack \n               is so unexpected and ferocious that Sam has no sense of how \n               to defend himself. With unexpected power, the Ghost grabs \n               hold of him and slams him into the subway door. Sam's head \n               plows right through it.\n\n<b>               ANGLE\n</b>\n               on Sam's head sticking outside of the car as the subway tunnel \n               rushes past him. There is a panicked look on his face. The \n               look intensifies as he turns and sees another train barreling \n               down on him.\n\n<b>               ANGLE\n</b>\n               on Sam's body inside the car still struggling with the Ghost \n               as the other train shoots by the window. With a huge gasp, \n               Sam shoots back into the car, and wrests himself free of the \n               Ghost's hold. The Ghost flies after him, screeching.\n\n               Sam surges through the door at the end of the train and finds \n               himself on the bridge between the subway cars. The subway \n               Ghost stares at him through the window with a wild, insane \n               look.\n\n<b>                                     GHOST\n</b>                         Stay off!

To Sam's terror and amazement, the window SHATTERS. \n               The Ghost smiles. Passengers scream and Sam dives for cover. \n               Sam stares at the broken glass with fascination and confusion. \n               Suddenly, the train moves from the darkness of the tunnel \n               into broad daylight.\n\n<b>               EXT.

The streets are \n               lined with old apartment buildings. Many windows are boarded \n               up. TWO MEN, standing on the corner, are slamming a piece of \n               heavy machinery onto the pavement.\n\n               Sam hears GOSPEL MUSIC coming from a storefront church and \n               notices a sign, \"SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, \n               ADVISOR.\" He looks up to a third story window and sees a \n               similar sign with day-glo arrows pointing to the entrance on \n               the street. He seems curious, but then realizes that the \n               Mugger is nearly halfway down the block. He turns and rushes \n               after him.\n\n<b>               EXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY\n</b>\n               Sam and the mugger approach a tenement building at 321 \n               Prospect Place.\n\n<b>               INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\n               Sam follows the Mugger into the building and watches as he \n               opens the mail box for APT. 4D. The name scribbled across it \n               is WILLIE LOPEZ. There's no mail.\n\n<b>               INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n</b>\n               Sam enters Willie's apartment. It is a squalid affair. Peeled \n               paint chips litter the floor. The bed is unmade.\n\n               Willie pulls open a drawer in a small nightstand and drops \n               in the keys to Molly's loft. Sam sees his wallet. His driver's \n               license, bank ID, and a photo of Molly are there, too. \n               Furious, Sam lunges for Willie but then holds his punch, \n               knowing it will have no effect. He turns instead to a window \n               and, like the Ghost on the subway, smashes it with his fist. \n               Nothing happens.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                         Damn!\n\n               Willie dials the phone.

I'll go \n                         back.\n\n               He hangs up. Sam stares at him in wild confusion.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                         Get what?

He is seething inside.\n\n               Suddenly Sam looks up. An old BAG LADY is walking down the \n               street talking loudly to a SHORT WOMAN tagging along beside \n               her. As they approach a street pole, the Bag Lady swerves to \n               the side. The Short Woman, however, walks right through it. \n               Passersby laugh at the Old Lady talking to herself. Sam, \n               unsettled, rushes away.\n\n               As Sam rounds a corner, a sudden blast of MUSIC explodes out \n               of nowhere. Sam jumps into the street, gasping. A phonograph \n               needle SCRATCHES across a record and the MUSIC STOPS. A \n               woman's voice booms out:\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN'S VOICE\n</b>                         Sorry 'bout that.\n\n<b>               PANNING SHOT\n</b>\n               to a pair of loudspeakers in a storefront window. The MUSIC \n               blares out once more and SOUNDS of gospel fill the street.\n\n               Sam looks up. He is back in front of the storefront church \n               with the sign for SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, \n               ADVISOR, hanging overhead. Below it is another sign. \"Contact \n               the dearly departed. $20.00\".\n\n               Sam stares at the sign with curiosity. The MUSIC is \n               compelling. After a moment's hesitation, he goes in the open \n               door.\n\n<b>               INT.

A number of people are sitting there, mostly \n               women. One gets the sense that this is a cross between a \n               waiting room and a meeting hall. A black WOMAN steps up on \n               the platform and calls out:\n\n<b>                                     WOMAN\n</b>                         Rosa Santiago.\n\n               MRS.

A paisley bedspread is tacked over \n               the window.\n\n               In the center of the room is a round seance table. Two \n               heavyset sisters, CLARA (39), and LOUISE (36), are standing \n               beside an open closet.

Like magic, \n               ODA MAE BROWN, 41, appears standing inside. She is a black \n               woman in a white tunic. The whiteness of her garment makes \n               it look as if she is glowing in the dark. Mrs. Santiago is \n               wide-eyed.

Neither \n               can Oda Mae.\n\n               Mrs. Santiago reaches into her purse. A twenty dollar bill \n               changes hands. Sam watches, amazed at it all. Oda Mae sits \n               down and goes back into her trance.

Slowly, he guides his \n               lips to her neck and kisses it, too. It is all hateful and \n               sensual at the same time. Sam turns away.\n\n               Molly feels Carl's tenderness, needs it. She does not notice \n               his hand reaching for the cord on her robe and slowly pulling \n               it toward him. With a little tug the cord unravels and the \n               robe falls open. Molly is confused, aroused, not sure what \n               to do. She starts to pull it closed. He holds her hand. For \n               a moment they do nothing. Then his fingers reach for her \n               thigh. Her body quivers. Carl feels her openness and pulls \n               closer, his hand rising gently up her naked body.\n\n               Molly's eyes close.

Carl looks up \n               and sees an empty chair moving. He stares at it in confusion, \n               and then goes back to the screen. He seems desperate.

Willie \n               spins around in total dismay.\n\n               Summoning all of his force, Sam slams into Willie. Willie \n               recoils in unexplainable pain. He seems very disoriented. \n               His gun falls to the floor. He reaches for it and Sam pushes \n               it away. Willie jumps up, afraid.

Grabbing his gun, Willie \n               runs into the bathroom and locks the door. Suddenly the hot \n               water faucet turns on by itself.\n\n               Willie is terrified. Steam rises from the sink. Willie tries \n               to get out, but Sam approaches him from behind and appears \n               to dig his hands into his neck.

Carl, \n               running down the corridor, rushes after him. Willie drops \n               his gun. Carl picks it up.\n\n<b>               EXT.

No one stops.\n\n               Willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the \n               street. Suddenly, he recognizes that it is his own dead body \n               lying there. He begins to scream.\n\n               A bizarre and frightening CLICKING SOUND fills the air. Sam \n               looks up.

Sam can barely breathe. He seems totally absorbed \n               in the experience, the sensation of human flesh.\n\n               His eyes are absolutely still and full of light. He seems to \n               be glowing.\n\n               Gently, Molly takes Sam's arm and guides him to his feet. \n               Effortlessly, she draws him to the center of the huge loft. \n               With great tenderness, she puts her arms around him and before \n               he knows what is happening, they are dancing. It is a strange, \n               touching image, reminiscent of their first night in their \n               new home. Sam reaches out and slowly draws his fingers down \n               over her face, caressing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips. \n               She stands motionless. Her face shines.

Carl screams \n               and jumps back, tripping over Oda Mae. Sam is standing there.\n\n               In total panic, Carl scrambles to get up. Horrified, he SHOOTS \n               his gun blindly into the air. Molly and Oda Mae dive for \n               cover. The bullets have no impact. Sam musters all his \n               strength and shoves Carl again. White with fear, Carl grabs \n               Molly and aims his gun at her head.\n\n<b>                                     CARL\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         I'll kill her.

Sam?\n\n               In a wild explosive fury, Sam charges at Carl and smashes at \n               his gun. The weapon flies out of Carl's hand. Empowered by \n               an anger we have not seen before, Sam smashes into Carl with \n               a violent force. Carl's body careens into walls and \n               floorboards. Wiring snaps. Two-by-fours crack.\n\n               Carl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the \n               floor. With a wild rush, he grabs for it and shoots at the \n               door. The lock explodes and the door flies open.\n\n               Carl tries to run for it, but Sam cuts in front of him. With \n               growing power, Sam sends Carl flying back into the apartment, \n               colliding into a tall scaffold. Bags of plaster topple to \n               the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air. The \n               apartment looks like a scene from another world.\n\n               Carl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from \n               Sam. The dust obscures his escape. Like a trapped insect, he \n               scrambles furiously to the fire escape window. Sam cannot \n               see him.\n\n               Carl shoves at the window. It is stuck. With a supreme effort, \n               he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass. \n               Half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing \n               the window. Shards of glass fly in all directions. Sam turns \n               and sees Carl. He surges after him, but knows he cannot get \n               to him in time.\n\n               Carl is halfway out the window when Sam's fist slams into an \n               electrical box attached to a dangling BX cable. It goes flying \n               toward the window. To his amazement, it hits the frame. A \n               huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down. Carl \n               looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his \n               chest. Before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs \n               and slices into his heart. His body quivers.\n\n               Carl's eyes bulge from their sockets. His body begins to \n               spasm. He can't get up. A look of abject terror flashes \n               through his eyes. He tries to scream. There is no sound. He \n               tries to breathe. There is no breath.\n\n<b>               ANGLE\n</b>\n               With one last effort, Carl lurches forward. To his amazement, \n               his body stands up and pulls away from the window. He looks \n               down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is \n               gone. There is no blood. Excited and confused, he turns around \n               and sees Sam. For a moment, he cannot comprehend what is \n               happening.\n\n<b>                                     CARL\n</b>                         Sam?\n\n               There is a strange, silent moment between them.\n\n               Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a terrible CLICKING sound is \n               heard. Frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness. \n               Carl looks behind him and gasps. Past the figures coming \n               toward him, he sees his own dead body. It is pinned to the \n               window sill.\n\n               Before Carl can cry out, the dark figures swoop down and \n               envelope him. In a flash, his spirit is caught and surges \n               with the dark forces back into the shadows. Far in some \n               invisible distance, we can barely hear him scream.\n\n               And then it is silent. It is over.\n\n<b>               ANGLE\n</b>\n               Molly is crouched in the corner, her back pressed tightly \n               against the wall. She is staring into space. The room is \n               filled with plaster dust. Slowly, emerging from the dust, we \n               see Sam approaching Molly. He gazes at her with terrible \n               longing.\n\n               Suddenly, a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling \n               and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze. Sam \n               turns to look at it. His eyes are full of surprise and wonder. \n               The spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him. As he \n               looks down, he notices that his hands are growing transparent. \n               His body is beginning to fade. A faint smile forms on his \n               face. He leans down toward Molly, staring at her for a long, \n               silent moment.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                         Goodbye, Moll.\n\n               Molly's head lifts up. She looks around.\n\n<b>                                     MOLLY\n</b>                         Sam? Is that you?\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                              (stunned)\n                         Molly?!\n\n<b>                                     MOLLY\n</b>                         I hear you, Sam.\n\n               She starts to cry.\n\n               Gradually, we notice that the dust in the air near Molly is \n               beginning to shimmer with a subtle glow. To her astonishment, \n               Sam's spirit is reflected in the floating particles.\n\n<b>                                     MOLLY\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         Oh God!\n\n               Sam's luminous form appears before her. Molly is overwhelmed \n               by the sight of him. The two of them gaze at one another \n               without moving. They know it is for the last time. It is a \n               silent exchange, charged with emotion.\n\n               Slowly, the two bodies reach forward. As their lips touch, \n               the plaster dust swirls sensuously through Sam's vaporous \n               image and he begins to disappear. Molly pulls back from him \n               as though from a cloud. His voice rises from the mist.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                         I can't stay anymore.\n\n               Tears roll down her cheek.\n\n               The brilliant light intensifies. It is beautiful, like a \n               sunrise, saturating the room with a warm, comforting glow. \n               Molly looks up and sees it all. Oda Mae sees it, too.\n\n<b>                                     ODA MAE\n</b>                         They're waiting for you, Sam.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                              (smiling)\n                         I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae.\n                              (with deep felt \n                              gratitude)\n                         Thank you. Your mama would be proud.\n\n               Oda Mae smiles warmly.\n\n               Sam turns to Molly. She is gazing at the last remaining \n               moments of him. Her eyes brim over with tears and love.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                         I love you, Molly.

A sweet smile emerges on \n               his lips.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                         It's so amazing, Moll...\n\n               His face fills with joy.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         The love inside.\n\n               He whispers, almost crying.\n\n<b>                                     SAM\n</b>                              (continuing)\n                         You take it with you.\n\n               They are his last words. His spirit dissolves within its \n               ghostly moorings and begins to evaporate. Molly looks up \n               silently for a moment, her face filled with love.\n\n<b>                                     MOLLY\n</b>                         See ya.\n\n               We see Sam's spirit rise from the room. It passes effortlessly \n               through the ceiling and, in seconds, he is gone. The room \n               grows dark.\n\n               Molly sits quietly on the floor. There is a look of awe and \n               wonder in her eyes. After a moment, Oda Mae reaches down to \n               help her up. Molly looks at her lovingly and then gently \n               takes her hand. Arm in arm, supporting one another, they \n               walk quietly from the room.\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Ghost</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Bruce Joel Rubin\" title=\"Scripts by Bruce Joel Rubin\">Bruce Joel Rubin</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Ghost Script.html#comments\" title=\"Ghost comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:06:13.636256"}
