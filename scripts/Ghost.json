TRIBECA LOFT - DAY\n\n               The CAMERA TRACKS slowly through clouds of moving dust. Shafts \n               of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere. An eerie \n               netherworld envelops us. Strange ghostly forms appear and \n               disappear in the distance. They seem like apparitions.\n\n               Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky \n               light. We see hints of a huge demolished space.\n\n               An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary blips \n               of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are heard \n               dimly in the distance.\n\n               With startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explodes \n               out of nowhere. The wall shudders.\n\n               HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarring. \n               The wall buckles.\n\n               Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with new \n               swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW. \n               Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the \n               atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of \n               wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the \n               air. We hear voices talking.\n\n                                     MOLLY (O.S.)\n                         What a mess!\n\n                                     SAM (O.S.)\n                         I told you!\n\n               Through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on \n               the other side of the wall, all wielding SLEDGEHAMMERS.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I can't breathe.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Use your mask, dummy.\n\n               One of the figures adjusts something over his face. Isolated \n               rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in \n               the air.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (singing)\n                         \"Volga boat..., man.\" Whoomph!\n\n               His hammer pounds the wall. Molly laughs.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               The CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY \n               JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and \n               a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her \n               eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his \n               late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong \n               forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his \n               brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's, \n               removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a \n               fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               BLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD. Suddenly a shaft of light \n               penetrates the darkness. Another thud and more light. We see \n               a hole. The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with \n               something around the edges. Then, with a tug and a loud yank, \n               a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. Huge \n               clouds of dust fly into the air. Molly looks up, astonished.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Sam, look, there's a whole eight \n                         feet up there.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         And about eighty years of dust.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         We have all this height, Sam. We \n                         could add a second floor and put our \n                         bedroom upstairs. That would leave \n                         all this space.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (eyeing her curiously)\n                         For what?\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         For space. Just space.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Be great for bumper cars.\n\n               Carl laughs as he looks at Sam. Their bodies, covered with \n               white powder, appear as strange, ghostly figures.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Sam, this may be none of my business, \n                         but I'm concerned you're doing too \n                         much coke.\n\n               Sam glances down at his white body. They all laugh.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Hey, Sam, turn around.\n\n               Sam obeys. Molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and \n               the outline of a tuxedo jacket. Her lines are quick, \n               accomplished, and subtly erotic.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (offering his body)\n                         How 'bout me?\n\n               Molly nods. She reaches out and superimposes an armless female \n               torso over his. His stomach jumps sensually as she touches \n               it. Molly pulls back to admire her work. He looks like a \n               Greek statue.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         I'll never wash again.\n\n               Molly laughs.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Sam, Molly, and Carl are holding their sledgehammers. Molly \n               begins to count.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         All together now. One,\n                              (they strike the wall \n                              with their hammers. \n                              The wall shakes)\n                         two,\n                              (they pound again. \n                              The wall begins to \n                              give)\n                         three.\n\n               In unison, they hit it once more. A massive section of plaster \n               and metal topples to the ground. New clouds of dust fill the \n               air. Suddenly, Sam spies an old jar lying on the floor. \n               Something rattles inside it, a penny.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Hey, look what I found. There's a \n                         penny inside.\n                              (he hands it to Molly)\n                         For luck in our new loft. It's a \n                         good omen.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (shaking her head, \n                              disagreeing)\n                         You're the good omen.\n\n               She glances at him lovingly. Carl looks at the two of them \n               and grins.\n\n               As the dust settles we see, for the first time, the outlines \n               of the space they are working in. It is a huge loft over \n               four thousand square feet. Banks of windows run east and \n               west. Molly steps back and admires the room.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         It's gorgeous.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         You guys lucked out.

MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\n               It is morning rush hour. Sam and Carl, both wearing suits \n               and ties, exit the Wall Street subway station and approach \n               the Headquarters of Market Security Bank & Trust.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move \n                         your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so \n                         you could squeeze in Gary Alan.

BANK HEADQUARTERS, ELEVATOR - DAY\n\n               Sam and Carl are standing on a crowded elevator. It is deadly \n               quiet. Suddenly Carl elbows Sam and winks. There is something \n               he wants him to do. Sam hesitates a moment, annoyed, and \n               then relents. He clears his throat.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         So Carl, what did the doctor say?\n\n                                     CARL\n                         He said it was contagious.

BANK HEADQUARTERS, EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY\n\n               Sam and Carl, laughing, walk through a large office area \n               bustling with activity. Employees, in various cubicles, are \n               talking on telephones and punching information into computers.\n\n               Sam heads into his executive office.

He \n                         said they need $900,000 transferred \n                         to Albany by noon.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Noon? Damn!\n\n               He hurries over to Carl's cubicle. He is on the phone. Carl \n               cups the mouthpiece.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Hold on.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in \n                         Albany by noon. Can you transfer it \n                         to his payroll account?\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Sure. Just let me have your MAC code.\n\n               Sam pulls out his wallet and extracts a small address book. \n               He jots the code numbers on a piece of paper and hands it to \n               Carl.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Discretion, huh?\n\n                                     CARL\n                         You bet. I'll do it right away.\n\n               INT. WELL-APPOINTED EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - DAY\n\n               Sam and a group of fifteen somber Japanese businessmen are \n               sitting around a large granite conference table. Sam stands \n               up and speaks a simple greeting to them.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (in Japanese)\n                         Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf \n                         of Market Security Bank & Trust, I \n                         welcome you to our city.\n\n               The men smile happily and nod their heads in unison.\n\n                                     MEN\n                         Arigato.\n\n               They look to Sam, expecting more. Uncomfortable, he clears \n               his throat.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I'm afraid that's the only Japanese \n                         I know. But I realize it's not our \n                         language fluency, or lack of it, \n                         that brings you to Market Security. \n                         Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking \n                         expertise, our ability to represent \n                         and anticipate all of your banking \n                         needs. As you know, we are not the \n                         largest banking establishment in New \n                         York.\n                              (his throat goes dry \n                              and he takes a sip \n                              of water)\n                         But, with combined assets of over \n                         200 billion dollars, we have a firm \n                         commitment to the international \n                         marketplace.\n\n               A SECRETARY enters the room and hands Sam a piece of paper. \n               It reads \"MOLLY ON LINE 2. URGENT.\" She hands him a phone.\n\n               Sam looks surprised. He nods apologetically to his guests.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Excuse me.\n                              (he picks up the \n                              receiver)\n                         Hello?\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               MOLLY\n\n               dressed in a long, clay covered smock. She is in a potters \n               studio. SEVERAL OTHER POTTERS are in the background working \n               at their wheels. A five-foot high ceramic vase stands beside \n               Molly. It is still wet. She toys with it as she speaks into \n               the phone.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         A man and a woman are lying in bed \n                         when the woman's husband suddenly \n                         comes home.

The man, running \n                         naked along the street, sees some \n                         joggers approaching.\n\n               The entire contingent of Japanese men is staring at Sam.\n\n                                     MOLLY (V.O.)\n                              (continuing)\n                         One of the joggers calls out. \"Hey, \n                         do you always go jogging naked?\" And \n                         the man says, \"Yes, always.\"\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Okay.\n\n                                     MOLLY (V.O.)\n                         And then the other jogger says, \"And \n                         do you always wear a condom?\" The \n                         man looks down, embarrassed, and \n                         replies, \"Only when it's raining.\"\n\n               Sam squelches a smile.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Well, that's just fine.\n\n                                     MOLLY (V.O.)\n                         Now just relax and have fun, okay? \n                         It's not the end of the world if you \n                         lose this account.

A short smile \n               crosses his face.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A CARVED WOODEN ANGEL\n\n               eight feet tall, ascending into an afternoon sky. As the \n               CAMERA PULLS BACK we see that we are inside a building and \n               that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above \n               the street.\n\n               A group of workmen grab for the angel, but have difficulty \n               bringing it in. Suddenly Molly steps INTO the FRAME.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Where you guys from, the New York \n                         City Ballet?\n\n               With a gutsy maneuver, Molly leans out over the sidewalk and \n               tries to grab hold of the ropes. She can't reach them. \n               Suddenly a pair of hands grabs her around the waist. She \n               screams.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Saved your life.\n\n               Sam laughs as he pulls her back into the loft. She does not \n               think it is funny.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         You bastard. Don't do that to me. \n                         You scared me half to death.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Better than seeing this gorgeous \n                         body splattered all over the street. \n                         Here, look out.\n\n               Sam jumps up, grabs hold of the door's top molding, and swings \n               out over the sidewalk. Molly gasps. Sam's feet push at the \n               angel and send it swinging away and then back toward the \n               loft. Quickly he jumps back, grabs hold of it, and brings it \n               in. The workmen applaud. Molly eyes him with admiration.\n\n               Suddenly we hear a voice call out.\n\n                                     CARL (O.S.)\n                         Sam? Molly?

Hi, Sam. So, how's it goin?\n\n               Before they can answer, a WORKMAN turns to Molly.\n\n                                     WORKMAN (V.O.)\n                         Where do you want this?\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         In the bedroom.\n\n               INT. LOFT - DAY\n\n               As the angel pulls away from camera, we see the newly \n               decorated loft for the first time. It is painted now in lovely \n               pastels. The floor, a huge gymnasium-like expanse, is \n               lacquered with polyurethane. Furniture and boxes are piling \n               up along the walls. Dominating the space, with a kind of \n               surreal presence, are a large number of Molly's sculptures \n               and ceramics. There is also a vintage jukebox. Carl is \n               impressed.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Wow! The place looks great.

Molly sees it.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Sam, you kept that chair?\n\n                                     SAM\n                         What do you mean?

Molly smiles.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN - DAY - LATER\n\n               Sam, Molly, and Carl are sprawled out on the floor, eating \n               from Cartons of Chinese food. Frank, a gray cat, eats beside \n               them. Unpacked boxes are scattered everywhere.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         It was the middle of December.

MOLLY'S STUDIO - NIGHT\n\n               Molly, dressed only in a T-shirt, is sitting at her potters \n               wheel throwing a series of pots. Sam enters the studio. He \n               is barefoot, shirtless, wearing jeans.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         What are you doing?\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         I felt inspired.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         At 2:00 am?\n\n               She nods and presses her hands into a pot that is forming in \n               front of her. Sam watches the sensual movement of her fingers, \n               molding and forming the clay. She is forceful, assured, \n               gifted. The clay responds to her slightest effort. Slowly, \n               almost unconsciously, Sam reaches for her shoulders and begins \n               kissing them.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (continuing)\n                         You notice Carl's eyes today?

Sam, let me \n                         tell you something. He's not even \n                         looking at me. It's you he idolizes. \n                         He doesn't see me at all... Anyway, \n                         he's not my type.\n\n               Sam reaches over her and gently adds his fingers to the clay. \n               Molly looks up at him.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (continuing)\n                         What are you doing?\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I feel inspired.\n\n               His hands dig into the clay. Molly smiles. Their fingers \n               seem to dance together. After a moment, she reaches up to \n               him, her clay-covered fingers streaking his face and curving \n               down to his chest. Sam grins and reaches down to her.\n\n                                                              MATCH CUT TO:\n\n               SAM'S FINGER\n\n               as it presses two buttons on his jukebox. We watch as the \n               mechanical arm selects a record and slowly, sensuously, lowers \n               it to the turntable. The arm hovers over the record and then \n               descends. It begins to play. The song is \"Unchained Melody\" \n               by the Righteous Brothers.\n\n               SAM AND MOLLY\n\n               are dancing in the middle of the dark loft. Moonlight pours \n               through the windows and shines off the floor. Wads of packing \n               paper swirl sensuously around their feet.\n\n               Molly runs her fingers down Sam's naked back. The moment is \n               sweet and erotic. We watch as Sam slowly draws his fingers \n               down over Molly's face, gently caressing her forehead, her \n               eyes, her lips.\n\n               Sam slides his hands under Molly's T-shirt, slowly moving \n               them toward her breasts. Her breathing slows. They dance \n               silently, her hair swaying in the soft light.\n\n               We hear the sounds of their bare feet on the highly polished \n               floor.\n\n               Sensuously, Molly's shirt lifts above her navel as Sam presses \n               into her. Their stomachs touch and part and touch again. She \n               bites her lip. Sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his \n               chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the \n               curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his \n               jeans.\n\n               Sam leans into Molly and nips at her neck. She stops dancing. \n               Her eyes close. She stands absolutely still. Sam's hands \n               move to her backside. He pulls her closer.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n               LIVINGROOM - NIGHT\n\n               SAM AND MOLLY, making love on the livingroom carpet. Paper \n               and packing materials crumble beneath them and scatter across \n               the floor. For all their sensuality, it is their hands and \n               eyes that are most expressive, revealing a tenderness that \n               is deeply moving. Their lovemaking is full of love.\n\n               JUKEBOX\n\n               The song ends. The jukebox arm retracts and gently slides \n               the record back into its slot.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Sam and Molly are lying together silently.

Sam jumps up, grabbing \n               the remote control unit from under his buttocks. Molly laughs \n               as he turns the SOUND DOWN. The news is on and they are \n               showing the remains of an airline disaster.

He jerks awake. \n               Molly grins.\n\n               EXT. SPRING STREET REPERTORY - NIGHT\n\n               Bright marquee lights sparkle overhead as Sam and Molly exit \n               the theatre. It is a beautiful brisk night.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I loved it.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         I could tell.\n\n               She smiles and squeezes his arm. They walk silently down a \n               dark street, heading toward their loft. The pavement is full \n               of shadows.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (continuing)\n                         Did I tell you what Marcia said?\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Six times.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Six? No I didn't. Sam, don't be so \n                         blas\u00e9. I'll have two major pieces in \n                         the show. The New York Times reviews \n                         her gallery all the time. This could \n                         be huge.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Molly, the \"New York Times\" is some \n                         frustrated little critic with pimples \n                         on his ass who flunked out of art \n                         school. Who cares what The New York \n                         Times thinks?\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Eight million readers, that's who.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Your work's beautiful. That's a fact, \n                         Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone \n                         thinks.\n\n               We can tell from the expression on Molly's face that it does. \n               Sam puts his arm around her. She nestles close to him. Then, \n               suddenly, she stops and looks up. There is an unexpected \n               seriousness in her voice.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (continuing)\n                         I want to marry you, Sam.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (taken aback)\n                         What?\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         I've been thinking about it for days. \n                         More than thinking. I want to do it. \n                         I want to jump in whole hog...\n                              (she pauses)\n                         What is that look for?\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (staring at her)\n                         It's just been so long since...

It's not the same.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         People say \"I love you\" all the time. \n                         It doesn't mean anything.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Sometimes you need to hear it.\n\n               Sam stops and stares at Molly. He pauses quietly. He is about \n               to speak when A MAN'S FACE emerges from the shadows behind \n               him. Molly gasps. Sam spins around.\n\n               AN INTENSE LOOKING MAN\n\n               is standing in the darkness between two buildings. He stares \n               at the couple for a moment and then steps onto the sidewalk. \n               Sam and Molly stand motionless. The man hesitates and then \n               begins walking the other way. Molly exhales a deep breath.\n\n               Sam takes Molly's arm and they continue briskly down the \n               street. Suddenly they hear FOOTSTEPS coming after them.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         What should we do?\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Let me handle this.\n\n               Sam stops abruptly and turns around. A gun is staring him in \n               the face. Molly screams.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Your wallet!\n\n               Sam waits a beat.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Give it to him!\n\n               Sam reaches for his jacket. The Mugger grabs his wrist and \n               then carefully pulls the wallet out himself.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Take the money. Just leave the wallet \n                         and my...\n\n               He swipes Sam across the head. Molly screams. The Mugger \n               whacks her across the face. Sam explodes, plowing into the \n               mugger with all his might.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Sam, No!\n\n               There is a wild, all out brawl. Sam fights like a mad man. \n               Suddenly the GUN goes off. The Mugger panics and takes off \n               running. Sam charges after him.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Sam!!!!!\n\n               The two men run down the dark street, but the Mugger is \n               already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows.\n\n               Sam gives up. Slowly he turns and begins walking back toward \n               Molly.\n\n               We can see Molly dimly at the end of the block as Sam \n               approaches. She is screaming for help. Frightened, Sam calls \n               out.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Molly!\n\n               She doesn't answer. Sam tenses and starts running toward \n               her. He is just three feet away when suddenly he stops. An \n               expression of pure terror overwhelms his face.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               CLOSEUP - MOLLY\n\n               drenched in blood. Her eyes are glazed, on the verge of shock. \n               Panting, she stoops down to the curb as THE CAMERA TRAVELS \n               WITH HER. She grabs hold of something lying in the shadows \n               and pulls it toward her.\n\n               It is Sam's dead body she is holding in her arms.\n\n               Sam's ghostly form, still solid to all appearances, stands \n               beside Molly. His eyes are awash in horror and confusion. He \n               seems unable to move. THE CAMERA HOLDS on his face as the \n               full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes.\n\n               Suddenly he lets out a blood-curdling scream.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         No!!!!!!\n\n               He jumps down toward his body and reaches out to grab hold \n               of his motionless form. His hands make a strange SOUND as \n               they pass right though it. It is terrifying. Sam jumps up, \n               crazed, frenzied, and begins circling Molly. It is as though \n               he is trying to undo what has been done.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (continuing)\n                         This isn't happening. It's not \n                         happening.\n\n               He reaches out to Molly for help. His hand cuts through her \n               shoulder. He screams.\n\n               FOOTSTEPS. People are running down the street. The sound of \n               SIRENS can be heard in the distance. Two MEN run toward Sam. \n               He yells out at them.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (continuing)\n                         Help me!\n\n               They run right through him. He gasps in stunned terror.\n\n               Sam watches helplessly as they reach his body. Molly looks \n               up and begins screaming hysterically. One of the Men grabs \n               her as the other goes for Sam's wrist. There is no sign of \n               life.\n\n               The first Man holds Molly back as his friend stoops down and \n               begins some form of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. There is \n               no response. Sam bends down, trying desperately to help. It \n               is a futile gesture.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Do it! Do it!\n\n               The Man bangs on Sam's chest. Blood gushes from the wound. \n               Molly recoils. He bangs again.\n\n                                                           CUT ABRUPTLY TO:\n\n               INT. LOFT - NIGHT\n\n               Sam shoots up in bed, panting. It is dark. He stares around \n               the loft in sudden confusion. With a lurch he flicks on the \n               night light. Molly is lying beside him, her head buried \n               beneath a pillow. Sam seems stunned.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Molly?

Sam reaches out for her.\n\n               As she turns around, we see A SKELETEL VERSION OF HER HEAD \n               staring at the camera. It speaks.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (mocking him)\n                         What is it, honey?\n\n               Sam bolts upright, screaming. It is a scream so consumed by \n               terror that one fears it will never stop.\n\n                                                       CUT UNEXPECTEDLY TO:\n\n               CLOSE-UP OF SAM\n\n               asleep in bed. He is thrashing at his pillow and moaning.\n\n               Suddenly, a hand reaches out and touches his shoulder. Sam \n               jumps straight up in bed and kicks wildly at the sheets.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               SAM'S P.O.V.\n\n               Molly is sitting on the bed looking at him, afraid.\n\n               Sam stares down at her. He is breathing heavily, not trusting \n               his own senses. His hands clutch at the wall.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         What's happening to me?!\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Suddenly, a brilliant white light shoots into the room as a \n               host of glowing forms, radiating an intense inner light, \n               float before us. A blinding tunnel spirals in an infinite \n               vortex behind them. Sam is awed and confused. We sense that \n               the light is enchanting him. The entire room begins to \n               disappear in the light.\n\n               Molly screams.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Don't leave me. I need you, Sam.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Sam turns and sees Molly, only she is not in the bed. She is \n               back on the street. To his amazement, he is on the street, \n               too, still bathed in the soothing light. Frightened, he calls \n               out to her.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Molly!\n\n               She does not hear him. He calls again.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (continuing)\n                         Molly.\n\n               There is no response. Sam, deeply troubled, hesitates for a \n               moment. He is torn between Molly and the light. Then, in a \n               painful, but conscious gesture, he turns from the light and \n               walks toward Molly. At that instant, the light behind him \n               disappears with the sound of a pneumatic door closing. There \n               is a sense of terrible finality as the tunnel evaporates \n               into the void. Sam is left on the dark pavement. He stands \n               there a moment, as if in shock, and then begins running toward \n               Molly. An AMBULANCE is rounding the corner.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT\n\n               Swirls of light speed toward the ambulance as car headlights \n               and streetlamps merge in a wild dizzying rush. The SIREN \n               wails into the night.\n\n               INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT\n\n               Sam's body is lying in the back of the ambulance as a \n               PARAMEDIC applies electric paddles to his chest in an effort \n               to save him. After a moment, he looks up at Molly. We can \n               tell from the expression in his eyes that it is hopeless. \n               Sam yells.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Don't stop! I'm not dead!\n\n               Molly, kneeling over Sam's body, grabs him and begins to cry \n               in long terrible sobs.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               A DOCTOR, comforting Molly, accompanies her from one of the \n               emergency operating rooms and leads her through a pair of \n               swinging doors into a separate waiting area. We see TWO \n               POLICEMEN and TWO DETECTIVES stand up and approach her.\n\n               Sam doesn't want Molly to go and begins to follow her, but \n               then seems torn, afraid to leave his body. He turns back \n               just as his corpse, covered in a green sheet, is wheeled \n               into the corridor and parked alongside the wall. Sam seems \n               stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it.\n\n               A wrinkled OLD MAN approaches Sam and joins him on the bench. \n               He begins talking.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         So, what happened to you?\n\n               Sam is startled, amazed that the man can see him.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         What?\n\n                                     MAN\n                         You're new, huh? I can tell.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Are you talking to me?\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Relax. It ain't like before, you \n                         know. It's a whole new ball-a-wax.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Who are you?\n\n                                     MAN\n                         I'm waiting for my wife. She's in \n                         4C. Cardiac wing. She's fighting it.\n\n               The man sticks his head into the green sheet covering Sam's \n               body. His head disappears. Sam is terrified.\n\n                                     MAN\n                              (continuing)\n                         Shot, huh? That'll do it every time. \n                         Poor bastard. Well, get used to it. \n                         You could be here a long time.\n                              (leaning in close)\n                         I'll tell you a secret. Doors ain't \n                         as bad as you think. Zip zap. They \n                         ain't nothin' at all. You'll see. \n                         You'll catch on.\n\n               Suddenly there is a loud COMMOTION and we see several \n               PHYSICIANS operating furiously on an Old Man lying on the \n               table beside them. It is a life threatening situation and \n               they seem to be failing.\n\n                                     MAN\n                              (continuing)\n                         He ain't gonna make it. I've seen it \n                         a million times. He's a goner. See? \n                         Here they come. Lucky bastard. Could \n                         have been the other ones. You never \n                         know.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Before Sam can understand what is happening the entire room \n               fills with a strange preternatural light. Suddenly he looks \n               up and freezes.\n\n               The amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating \n               down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the \n               operating table. They are emitting a powerful light.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         Hurry, we're losing him.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         What'd I tell you? Bingo!\n\n               The glowing forms take hold of the man's spirit and help \n               extract it from his body. His physical form changes instantly \n               from a solid object into an ethereal substance.\n\n               Sam stares in amazement as the strange beings carry the spirit \n               upward. They evaporate through the ceiling.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         He's gone.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               The light in the room grows dull instantly. Nurses cover the \n               dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away. Sam \n               turns to the Old Man.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Who are you? What's happening...?\n\n               The Man isn't there. An Orderly approaches the gurney with \n               Sam's body and begins pushing it toward the elevator. Sam \n               jumps in front of him.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (continuing)\n                         No!\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               SAM'S P.O.V.\n\n               as the stretcher begins to roll right through him. The \n               penetration of his physical space is horrifying to Sam. He \n               stands, almost paralyzed, as the body of the Orderly \n               intersects with his. It is a stunning moment of extraordinary \n               strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of the \n               Orderly's body passing through his. It is like a glimpse of \n               ultimate chaos, the universe within.\n\n               Then, in a flash, the Orderly has passed through, but Sam is \n               still shaking. He stares up at the ceiling.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Oh God, help me.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               SAM'S P.O.V.\n\n               as the ceiling lights and acoustical tiles begin to blur. \n               The hallway grows dark. It is as though Sam is blacking out.\n\n               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY\n\n               Slowly, images begin to emerge out of the blackness. It takes \n               a moment to realize that they are scenes from Sam's funeral.\n\n               The CAMERA TRACKS along rows of mourners as seen from SAM'S \n               P.O.V. He seems to be floating among them. We hear snippets \n               of conversations. It all seems strangely odd and disjointed. \n               Time seems unfixed, malleable.\n\n               We see a MINISTER standing beside the grave.\n\n                                     MINISTER\n                         As we say farewell to our friend Sam \n                         Wheat, we are reminded of his \n                         kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy \n                         of spirit...\n\n               The CAMERA KEEPS MOVING. Sam's associates from the bank are \n               among the mourners.\n\n                                     MINISTER\n                              (continuing)\n                         All that we treasure, our friends, \n                         our loved ones, our body, our mind, \n                         are but on loan to us. We must \n                         surrender them all. We are all \n                         travelers on the same road which \n                         leads to the same end.\n\n               Sam notices a WOMAN in a fancy print dress comforting one of \n               the mourners. The woman looks up at him, smiles, and waves. \n               Sam is surprised. He looks behind him, but no one is there.\n\n               As he turns back, the woman is walking away. She appears \n               just like any normal person until she approaches a large \n               gravestone and passes right through it. Sam is shocked.\n\n                                     MINISTER\n                         As our loved one enters eternal life, \n                         let us remember that love, too, is \n                         eternal, that although we will miss \n                         him, our love will light the void \n                         and dispel the darkness.\n\n               Suddenly, Molly ENTERS THE FRAME. Sam spots her. The CAMERA \n               STOPS.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Molly.\n\n               She does not respond. RUTH, her sister, leans over to her. \n               Tears form in Molly's eyes. A hand reaches out to give her a \n               tissue. Molly looks up. It is Carl. She gives him her hand. \n               He squeezes it with affection.\n\n                                     MINISTER\n                         ...and into Your hands we commend \n                         his spirit. May he rest in peace. In \n                         the name of the Father, the Son, and \n                         the Holy Ghost. Amen.\n\n               The casket is lowered into the ground. Molly approaches the \n               grave. She us a little unsteady. Carl takes her elbow. A \n               shovel is placed in her hands. With great emotional effort \n               she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket. \n               It lands with a REVERBERATING finality. Sam shudders.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n               LONG SHOT - PEOPLE\n\n               leaving the cemetery. We hear them talking.\n\n                                     VOICES\n                         What time you going back to work?... \n                         What's the buzz on Digital? It's \n                         sad. He was so young... How's your \n                         new Honda?... Going away this weekend?\n\n                                                               CUT BACK TO:\n\n               CLOSEUP - SAM\n\n               desperately alone. Down the hill, people are getting back \n               into their cars. Sam can see Molly being let into a limousine. \n               He stands there staring at his own casket, grieving. Then, \n               after a moment, he turns away. Separating from his body, \n               from his own grave site, he runs after her.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n               INT. LOFT - DAY\n\n               Molly is sitting on the couch in the middle of the loft \n               surrounded by FRIENDS and WELL WISHERS. A young GIRL, her \n               niece, cuddles in her lap. People are eating and milling \n               around. Slowly THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN. It ends on Sam, \n               standing alone in a corner. In the midst of all the activity \n               he is lost and alone.\n\n                                                             FADE TO BLACK:\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Raw clay on a potter's wheel spins hypnotically, sensuously. \n               Molly's wet hands press in, shaping it, molding it. A bowl \n               begins to appear. The camera pulls back and reveals Sam. He \n               is sitting on the floor behind her, knees pressed to his \n               chest, rocking aimlessly.\n\n               Molly looks away from the bowl she is forming. It distorts \n               and bends. Angry, she digs her finger into it. The bowl \n               disintegrates. Tears form in her eyes.\n\n               Frank jumps up on the bench beside her. Molly stares sadly \n               around the room. Quietly, she begins talking to herself, to \n               the air.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Oh God, Sam...\n\n               Sam looks up.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (continuing)\n                         I picked up your shirts this morning. \n                         I don't know why. Mr. Reynolds said \n                         to tell you hello. I broke into tears. \n                         It's so hard...\n\n               Sam walks over to Molly. Desperate for contact, he reaches \n               out to touch her cheek, but then hesitates and pulls back.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (continuing)\n                         I think about you every minute. It's \n                         like you're still here, like I can \n                         feel you, Sam.\n\n               He stares at her, hoping, wondering.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I am here, Moll. I am.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Suddenly, as if hearing Sam's voice, the cat begins to hiss. \n               Molly spins around. The cat scans the room. Unexpectedly, \n               Sam's and the cat's eyes meet... With a wild SCREECH, the \n               cat jumps from the bench and takes off running. Sam recoils. \n               Molly stands up.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Frank, what's wrong? Frank?\n\n               The cat is nowhere to be seen. All of a sudden, Molly freezes. \n               Sam is standing right beside her. It is almost as though she \n               senses his presence.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (continuing; whispering)\n                         Sam?\n\n               She holds very still for a moment. Sam watches breathlessly, \n               loving her, wanting her. Then quietly, hopefully, he reaches \n               out. It is a useless gesture. In a moment of great poignancy, \n               Molly shakes her head and walks right through him. He remains \n               IN THE FRAME, alone.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Sam, stands in the corner of a large, walk-in closet, watching \n               as Molly goes through his effects. Boxes, scattered underfoot, \n               are filling up with his life's possessions. Molly reaches \n               for a shirt.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my \n                         favorite...\n\n               She tosses it into a box and then takes down a sweater. It \n               is obviously handmade, about four sizes too big.

Then, in a surprising \n               outburst, she cries out and begins flailing at the shelves. \n               Everything comes flying off.

KITCHEN - DAY\n\n               Molly and Carl are standing over the kitchen table folding \n               piles of Sam's clothes and placing them into boxes. As Molly \n               lifts one of Sam's jackets, something falls from a side \n               pocket. It is his small black leather address book. Sam stares \n               at it with recognition. Carl sees the book fall and stoops \n               to pick it up but Molly gets it first.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Sam's address book.\n\n               She skims through it a moment, but the memories it evokes \n               are too powerful for her. She places it carefully into a box \n               labeled \"Sam's Things -- Valuable\" and continues packing. \n               She finds the old jar with the penny in it. It's marked \"For \n               Luck\". She holds it tenderly for a moment and then places it \n               on the nightstand beside the bed.\n\n               Carl discovers some old ticket stubs in another of Sam's \n               jackets.

Sam \n               groans.\n\n               Carl finds a half used package of Rolaids. Molly takes them \n               from his hand and puts them in the box, too.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Oh, you want to save those?\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Rolaids?

Sam jumps up and runs after them.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Hey, Molly! Wait!\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               The door slams shut. Sam is locked inside. Frightened and \n               desperate, he rushes for the door knob. His hand sinks through \n               it. There is a strange sound, like ELECTRICAL STATIC, as it \n               penetrates the metal and wood. Frightened, he yanks it back.\n\n               Sam circles the space several times and then returns to the \n               door. Clenching his teeth, he reaches out again. As his hand \n               pushes up against it, we sense that he experiences a subtle \n               resistance. The hairs on the back of his hand vibrate as his \n               ghostly form presses into it. We sense Sam's fear as his \n               entire arm DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW. The grating ELECTRICAL SOUND \n               shudders up his spine.\n\n               The sight of his amputated limb is unsettling but Sam does \n               not pull back. Slowly he edges in and presses his face into \n               the molecules of the wood.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               SAM'S P.O.V.\n\n               as atoms and electrons spin past him at frightening speed. \n               There is a sense of a universe in total chaos.

He is sitting in a corner singing quietly to \n               himself.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         \"Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie. \n                         Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the \n                         levy was dry.

He sits \n               silently, staring at the wall.\n\n               Suddenly, there is a SOUND at the door. Sam's eyes shoot up. \n               The door begins to open.\n\n               Sam stands up. His face begins to tighten. We know instantly \n               that something is wrong. His eyes fill with a fury we have \n               not seen before.\n\n               The Mugger, the man who killed Sam, is entering the loft. He \n               has a key in his hand and puts it in his pocket. Sam is \n               stunned. The Mugger locks the door.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Sam goes wild. He shoots at the man with all his might, \n               attacking him unceasingly, but with no effect. His hands and \n               feet pass right through him.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         You motherfucking bastard!

What are \n                         you doing?\n\n               The Mugger, unaware that anything is going on, glances around \n               nervously as he moves through the vast space.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Entering the bedroom, the Mugger goes to the dresser and \n               quickly examines the drawers. He is very neat, careful to \n               leave no sign that he was there. He seems to be looking for \n               something but cannot find it.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Suddenly we hear a KEY TURNING in the front door. The Mugger \n               seems startled. He dashes from the bedroom and hides quickly \n               behind one of the large sculptures. We hear the door OPEN. \n               Molly is standing there.\n\n               Sam goes crazy.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Molly, no! Get out!\n\n               Molly closes the door and locks it shut. Sam freezes as she \n               heads for the bedroom. She walks right past the Mugger. To \n               Sam's horror she stops and turns to look around. There is a \n               curious expression on her face. Seeing nothing she continues \n               through the loft.\n\n               The Mugger pulls out his gun. Sam looks on in absolute terror.\n\n               Molly's purple blouse hits the floor as she begins to remove \n               her clothes. She turns on the radio.\n\n               Sam doesn't know what to do. The Mugger seems excited by \n               Molly's semi-nudity. He begins skirting the edges of the \n               loft, moving toward the bedroom. Sam is crazed.\n\n               Suddenly, out of nowhere, Frank appears at the Mugger's feet. \n               Sam's eyes light up. He drops to his knees, crawls over to \n               him, glares into his eyes, and screams.\n\n               ANGLE - THE CAT\n\n               SCREECHES and jumps straight up. His claws shoot out at the \n               mugger's face, ripping into the flesh near his eye.\n\n               Blood appears. The mugger sees it dripping through his \n               fingers. The sight of it upsets him. He grabs the cat angrily \n               by the neck. It SQUEALS. Molly in her bra, peers from the \n               bedroom.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Frank, what's wrong?\n\n               The Mugger holds the cat's mouth shut. Seeing and hearing \n               nothing, Molly steps back into the bedroom.\n\n               The Mugger takes the cat and throws it across the floor. \n               Holding his eye, he gets up and rushes for the exit. Sam \n               runs after him, but the door closes before he can get through. \n               He is left inside.\n\n               ANGLE - SAM\n\n               stares at the closed door in a wild panic. He doesn't know \n               what to do. Then, summoning all of his courage, he takes a \n               blind, running slow motion leap and charges through it.\n\n               SAM'S P.O.V.\n\n               There is a brief sense of passing through a molecular force \n               field, a miniature universe inside the door.\n\n               ANGLE - SAM\n\n               as he emerges from the door and lands on the other side. He \n               seems excited to have survived and is very pleased with \n               himself.\n\n               EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY\n\n               The Mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward \n               the subway. A patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his \n               eye.\n\n               Sam starts after the man but instantly freezes. Hordes of \n               people crowd the sidewalk. The crush of humanity is \n               frightening. Two lovers, holding hands, are coming right at \n               him. Before Sam is able to move, we hear the sound of their \n               arms cutting through his ghostly form.\n\n               Sam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people \n               approach him from all angles.\n\n               We hear a BABY CARRIAGE roll through Sam's feet and he nearly \n               falls over trying to avoid it. His instincts will not let \n               go.\n\n               A barrage of images and SOUNDS assaults Sam. It is more than \n               he can handle. Still, he refuses to give up.

SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY\n\n               The Mugger gets onto a crowded subway car. Sam stands near a \n               corner of the train watching him.\n\n               Suddenly, Sam notices that something odd is happening. One \n               of the riders at the other end of the car is walking toward \n               him. As he approaches the Mugger, he does not stop, but passes \n               right through him. It takes Sam a moment to realize what is \n               happening, but then it is too late.\n\n               ANGLE - THE OTHER GHOST\n\n               With unholy fury the New Ghost charges into Sam. The attack \n               is so unexpected and ferocious that Sam has no sense of how \n               to defend himself. With unexpected power, the Ghost grabs \n               hold of him and slams him into the subway door. Sam's head \n               plows right through it.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               on Sam's head sticking outside of the car as the subway tunnel \n               rushes past him. There is a panicked look on his face. The \n               look intensifies as he turns and sees another train barreling \n               down on him.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               on Sam's body inside the car still struggling with the Ghost \n               as the other train shoots by the window. With a huge gasp, \n               Sam shoots back into the car, and wrests himself free of the \n               Ghost's hold. The Ghost flies after him, screeching.\n\n               Sam surges through the door at the end of the train and finds \n               himself on the bridge between the subway cars. The subway \n               Ghost stares at him through the window with a wild, insane \n               look.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         Stay off!

To Sam's terror and amazement, the window SHATTERS. \n               The Ghost smiles. Passengers scream and Sam dives for cover. \n               Sam stares at the broken glass with fascination and confusion. \n               Suddenly, the train moves from the darkness of the tunnel \n               into broad daylight.\n\n               EXT.

BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY\n\n               Sam follows the Mugger down a long covered staircase to the \n               street.\n\n               EXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY\n\n               The Mugger heads toward 321 Prospect Place. The streets are \n               lined with old apartment buildings. Many windows are boarded \n               up. TWO MEN, standing on the corner, are slamming a piece of \n               heavy machinery onto the pavement.\n\n               Sam hears GOSPEL MUSIC coming from a storefront church and \n               notices a sign, \"SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, \n               ADVISOR.\" He looks up to a third story window and sees a \n               similar sign with day-glo arrows pointing to the entrance on \n               the street. He seems curious, but then realizes that the \n               Mugger is nearly halfway down the block. He turns and rushes \n               after him.\n\n               EXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY\n\n               Sam and the mugger approach a tenement building at 321 \n               Prospect Place.\n\n               INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               Sam follows the Mugger into the building and watches as he \n               opens the mail box for APT. 4D. The name scribbled across it \n               is WILLIE LOPEZ. There's no mail.\n\n               INT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Sam enters Willie's apartment. It is a squalid affair. Peeled \n               paint chips litter the floor. The bed is unmade.\n\n               Willie pulls open a drawer in a small nightstand and drops \n               in the keys to Molly's loft. Sam sees his wallet. His driver's \n               license, bank ID, and a photo of Molly are there, too. \n               Furious, Sam lunges for Willie but then holds his punch, \n               knowing it will have no effect. He turns instead to a window \n               and, like the Ghost on the subway, smashes it with his fist. \n               Nothing happens.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Damn!\n\n               Willie dials the phone. Someone comes on the line.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         She came home. I couldn't get it. \n                         Give me a couple of days. I'll go \n                         back.\n\n               He hangs up. Sam stares at him in wild confusion.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Get what? Who the hell are you? What \n                         were you doing at Molly's? What the \n                         hell's going on?\n\n               Willie grabs a bottle of wine from the nightstand and lies \n               down. After a moment he reaches over and takes Molly's photo \n               from the drawer. He studies it slowly.\n\n               Sam stands by the door in a state of motionless rage. There \n               is nothing he can do.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (continuing)\n                         Stay away from her!\n\n               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY\n\n               Sam storms down the street. His movements seem undirected, \n               utterly aimless. He is seething inside.\n\n               Suddenly Sam looks up. An old BAG LADY is walking down the \n               street talking loudly to a SHORT WOMAN tagging along beside \n               her. As they approach a street pole, the Bag Lady swerves to \n               the side. The Short Woman, however, walks right through it. \n               Passersby laugh at the Old Lady talking to herself. Sam, \n               unsettled, rushes away.\n\n               As Sam rounds a corner, a sudden blast of MUSIC explodes out \n               of nowhere. Sam jumps into the street, gasping. A phonograph \n               needle SCRATCHES across a record and the MUSIC STOPS. A \n               woman's voice booms out:\n\n                                     WOMAN'S VOICE\n                         Sorry 'bout that.\n\n               PANNING SHOT\n\n               to a pair of loudspeakers in a storefront window. The MUSIC \n               blares out once more and SOUNDS of gospel fill the street.\n\n               Sam looks up. He is back in front of the storefront church \n               with the sign for SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, \n               ADVISOR, hanging overhead. Below it is another sign. \"Contact \n               the dearly departed. $20.00\".\n\n               Sam stares at the sign with curiosity. The MUSIC is \n               compelling. After a moment's hesitation, he goes in the open \n               door.\n\n               INT. STOREFRONT - DAY\n\n               A record player is sitting near the storefront window, a \n               makeshift microphone placed in front of it.\n\n               Several rows of folding chairs face a raised platform with \n               nothing on it. A number of people are sitting there, mostly \n               women. One gets the sense that this is a cross between a \n               waiting room and a meeting hall. A black WOMAN steps up on \n               the platform and calls out:\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Rosa Santiago.\n\n               MRS. SANTIAGO tucks a Spanish paperback romance into her \n               purse and heads to a door at the rear of the hall. Sam follows \n               after her.\n\n               INT. SEANCE ROOM - DAY\n\n               Mrs. Santiago enters a dark room with a window and door \n               leading to a side street. A paisley bedspread is tacked over \n               the window.\n\n               In the center of the room is a round seance table. Two \n               heavyset sisters, CLARA (39), and LOUISE (36), are standing \n               beside an open closet. It is empty.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Please be seated.\n\n               Mrs. Santiago sits at the table. She seems apprehensive. \n               Clara steps into the closet and taps on each of the walls as \n               though demonstrating that they are solid.\n\n                                     CLARA\n                         My sister will be with us soon.\n\n               She steps back out and closes the door. Louise inserts a \n               tape into a boom box and then steps forward.\n\n                                     LOUISE\n                         Sister Oda Mae. Grant us the gift of \n                         your all-seeing presence. Appear for \n                         us now.\n\n               ANGLE FAVORING CLOSET\n\n               She turns back to the closet and opens the door. Like magic, \n               ODA MAE BROWN, 41, appears standing inside. She is a black \n               woman in a white tunic. The whiteness of her garment makes \n               it look as if she is glowing in the dark. Mrs. Santiago is \n               wide-eyed. Sam smiles as Oda Mae steps into the room.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Mrs. Santiago.\n\n                                     MRS. SANTIAGO\n                         Buenos dias.\n\n               She takes a twenty dollar bill from her purse and hands it \n               to Oda Mae. Clara graciously intercepts the money.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         I understand you are hoping to contact \n                         your husband.\n\n                                     MRS. SANTIAGO\n                         Si. Si.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Well, I believe he's gonna be with \n                         us today.\n\n                                     MRS. SANTIAGO\n                         Oh, tsank you, tsank you.\n\n               Tears well up in her eyes. She crosses herself several times.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         But there's no telling about the \n                         other world. You gotta cast out all \n                         doubt. You gotta believe. Do you \n                         believe?\n\n                                     MRS. SANTIAGO\n                              (nodding her head \n                              vigorously)\n                         Si. Si. I believe. I believe.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         And remember, we don't make no \n                         promises. I can phone up there till \n                         I'm blue in the face,\n                              (she points to the \n                              ceiling)\n                         ...but it don't necessarily mean \n                         he's gonna be home. Them folks go \n                         shopping, they play bingo. It's just \n                         like here. You can't always get 'em.\n\n               Mrs. Santiago, utterly fascinated, nods understandingly.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Sure lady!\n\n               Oda Mae's eyes glance up curiously for a second, as though \n               she heard something, and then she continues.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Okay, let's get ready then.\n\n               Sam steps back as the sisters get up and position themselves \n               behind Oda Mae. The moment feels rehearsed, theatrical. Oda \n               Mae raises her hands into the air and closes her eyes. There \n               is a hush in the room. Her body begins to tremble. Mrs. \n               Santiago clutches her chair. Suddenly Oda Mae breaks out of \n               her trance.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         We got a problem here. I don't think \n                         he's in. Wait. I feel something. Did \n                         he know someone who's passed over, \n                         someone named Anna... Mary... \n                         Consuela... Maria?\n\n                                     MRS. SANTIAGO\n                         Si, si! His mama. She's Maria.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Ah! I knew it. He's with his mama.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (sarcastic)\n                         Oh my God...\n\n               Oda Mae's eyes dart uncomfortably around the room.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         I'm afraid this is gonna be too hard. \n                         Now I got two souls I gotta contact. \n                         I don't know about that. It's \n                         difficult, you know. The pain. The \n                         effort.\n\n                                     MRS. SANTIAGO\n                         I pay more. How much? How much?\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Twenty dollars.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Way to go. Milk her for every penny.\n\n               Oda Mae jumps up and stares at her sisters. They look back \n               at her curiously. They can't figure out what's wrong. Neither \n               can Oda Mae.\n\n               Mrs. Santiago reaches into her purse. A twenty dollar bill \n               changes hands. Sam watches, amazed at it all. Oda Mae sits \n               down and goes back into her trance. Her eyeballs roll up \n               into their sockets.\n\n                                     CLARA/LOUISE\n                         Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.\n\n               Oda Mae is beginning to shake again. The two women grab her \n               shoulders to keep her from falling out of the chair. Suddenly \n               her whole body stiffens.\n\n                                     CLARA/LOUISE\n                              (continuing)\n                         Have mercy! Have mercy!\n\n               Mrs. Santiago stares on in amazement. After a moment Oda \n               Mae's body collapses in a heap. Then, like a phoenix rising \n               from the ashes, she pulls herself up in her chair and assumes \n               a normal pose.\n\n               After several seconds to get her bearings, Oda Mae begins to \n               speak. Only now she has an entirely new voice. It sounds \n               deep and hoarse, like an old man's. For all its put on \n               theatricality, it is strangely convincing.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Welcome, Rosa Santiago. You are \n                         fortunate today. The channel is clear. \n                         Many spirits are gathering.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (scanning the room)\n                         Yeah? Where?\n\n               Oda Mae jerks. Her eyes dart nervously around the room.\n\n                                     MRS. SANTIAGO\n                         My husband?\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                              (a bit uneasy)\n                         I can feel his vibration. Yes, yes, \n                         he is drawing toward us now. I can \n                         see him coming.\n\n                                     MRS. SANTIAGO\n                         Julio! Julio! How is he?

Oda Mae is \n               standing in the street looking up. She is calling out at the \n               top of her lungs. Molly pulls back.

Is everything \n                         a joke? You were supposed to steal \n                         his wallet. You weren't supposed to \n                         kill him. Was that a joke?\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                              (casually)\n                         I did you a favor. Freebee.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Jesus!\n                              (sickened)\n                         These are drug dealers, man.\n                              (pause)\n                         Don't blow this for me, Willie. I've \n                         risked my job here. I could go to \n                         jail. A hundred thousand of that \n                         money goes to me. Now give me Sam's \n                         key. I'll get that address book \n                         myself.\n\n               Willie goes to the desk drawer and takes out Sam's key. Sam, \n               unable to control himself, explodes in a fit of rage. Hauling \n               back, he slugs Carl with all his might. His fist has no \n               impact.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         You killed me, Carl. You had me \n                         killed. Look what you've done to me! \n                         Look what you've done!\n\n               EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Carl is on the street heading back to his car. Sam is beside \n               him, yelling right into his face.\n\n               He is screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs but Carl \n               doesn't hear him.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         You fucker! You mother fucker! I had \n                         a life, Goddamn you. I had a life!\n\n               From the distance, we see Sam smashing into Carl. It is like \n               hitting the air. For all of his rage and bluster, there is \n               nothing he can do.\n\n               EXT. LOFT BUILDING - DAY\n\n               Molly, neatly dressed, exits her building and hails a cab. \n               She hops inside. Seconds later she hops out again, yelling.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         You white fascist bigot. Who do you \n                         think you are? Bed Stuy's part of \n                         New York, you know. This is America.\n\n               The driver speeds off. Molly gives him the finger.\n\n               EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - ELEVATED TRAIN - DAY\n\n               Molly exits a subway station and walks toward 131st Street. \n               She is the only white woman on the block and heads turn as \n               she passes.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin'?\n\n               Molly pays no attention. Children run up to her, stare, and \n               run away.\n\n               TRACKING SHOT\n\n               When Molly turns down 131st Street, the crowds disperse and \n               she is all alone. There is a sense of menace in the air. A \n               group of young men sitting on a stoop watches as she walks \n               by. One of them whistles. Molly keeps walking.\n\n               EXT./INT. WILLIE'S BUILDING\n\n               Molly sees Willie's building. She walks into the dank lobby. \n               It is dark and full of shadows. Leaning close, she examines \n               the mail boxes. Willie's name is there. She backs away, \n               afraid.\n\n               INT. LIVINGROOM - DAY\n\n               A dresser drawer opens and a box labeled \"Sam's Things -- \n               Valuable\" is slowly pulled out. A hand reaches inside it and \n               extracts Sam's address book. As THE CAMERA PULLS BACK, we \n               see that it is Carl standing in Molly and Sam's livingroom. \n               Carl opens the book and quickly jots down a series of code \n               numbers he finds in the back. His eyes sparkle with \n               excitement.\n\n               INT. POLICE STATION - DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Molly is sitting in a room opposite DETECTIVE SERGEANT THOMAS \n               BEIDERMAN, 48, and SERGEANT DOROTHY WALLACE, 29. Both officers \n               are staring at her as she speaks. She seems very \n               uncomfortable.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Look, you've gotta believe me. I \n                         don't even believe this stuff, myself. \n                         But this is real. Do you think I'd \n                         come here if it wasn't real? You \n                         told me to come if I had any new \n                         information. Well, here I am.\n\n               The officers don't respond.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (continuing)\n                         Don't look at me like that. You guys \n                         use psychics all the time.\n\n               There is dead silence.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (continuing)\n                         Damn it. I know how this sounds. I \n                         hear myself saying it and I want to \n                         cringe. But this woman knew things \n                         she couldn't have known, intimate \n                         details.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         How intimate?\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Things Sam only said to me.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                              (smirking)\n                         Okay, let me get this straight. \n                         According to this psychic lady, there \n                         are ghosts and spirits all over the \n                         place, watching us all the time, \n                         huh?...\n                              (she stands up)\n                         I'm sorry. I've got important things \n                         to do.\n\n               She leaves the room. Molly gives her a dirty look and turns \n               to Beiderman.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         I'm telling you. The killer's name \n                         is Willie Lopez. I've got his address. \n                         You've got to check it out.\n\n               Sgt. Beiderman gets up and looks over to Molly.\n\n                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN\n                         Okay. You just wait here. Let me see \n                         if this guy's got a record.\n\n               He heads out of the room. Molly sits back with an air of \n               enormous relief and gratitude. Sergeant Wallace comes into \n               the room again and picks up a folder. Molly waits nervously. \n               After a moment Sergeant Beiderman returns with a police file \n               in his hands. Molly looks up at him, and then smiles at \n               Wallace as she sees it. She feels vindicated. He lays the \n               thick folder on the desk and opens it up. She hurries over \n               to him.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               MUG SHOTS OF ODA MAE\n\n               and reams of police paperwork. WIDEN as Molly stares at it \n               all in sudden shock.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         What are you doing? Where's your \n                         file on Willie Lopez?\n\n                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN\n                         There's no file for a Willie Lopez. \n                         He was probably some old boyfriend \n                         she was trying to get even with. \n                         This psychic woman's record goes \n                         back a long way. Fraud, numbers \n                         rackets, you name it. She's a real \n                         pro.\n\n               CUT BACK AND FORTH between the records and Molly's stunned \n               reaction. We see recent photos of Oda Mae and others going \n               back to her youth. They are fascinating and revealing. We \n               even see photos of her mother and grandmother. In addition, \n               there are pages of arrest records and prison files.\n\n                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN\n                              (continuing)\n                         1967. Shreveport, Louisiana. Forgery, \n                         selling false ID. Served one year. \n                         1971. Baton Rouge. Arrested for fraud, \n                         numbers racketeering. Served ten \n                         months. 1974. Hattiesburg, \n                         Mississippi. Fraud, seven months. \n                         1984. Albany, New York. Petty larceny. \n                         It goes on and on.\n\n               Molly is overwhelmed by the evidence.\n\n                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN\n                              (continuing)\n                         This woman's a charlatan. You can't \n                         believe anything she said.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         This isn't possible. There were words, \n                         private things. How could she have \n                         known all that?\n\n                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN\n                         They have ways.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Ways? What ways?\n\n                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN\n                         They've got a million cons. A lot of \n                         times they read the obits. All she \n                         had to do was see the word \"banker\". \n                         Hell, they even go through your \n                         garbage to find things they can use, \n                         letters, old papers. They don't need \n                         much.\n\n               Molly turns away.\n\n                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN\n                              (continuing)\n                         I bet you threw stuff out, huh? It \n                         could have been anything. What about \n                         that underwear she knew all about?\n\n               Molly's eyes widen.\n\n                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN\n                              (continuing)\n                         Green underwear. I'll bet she zeroed \n                         right in on that.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         No! She was real. She said things. \n                         She knew about a sweater I knitted, \n                         about songs we sang... She knew about \n                         this place we went, Montego Bay...\n\n               Molly begins to cry.\n\n                                     SGT. BEIDERMAN\n                         I'm sorry. I know this is hard. People \n                         want so much to believe. They're \n                         grieving, vulnerable. They'd give \n                         anything for one last moment... money, \n                         insurance policies. Believe me, these \n                         people know what they're doing. Look, \n                         I know how you must feel. You know, \n                         you can press charges.\n\n               Molly shakes her head no. Sgt. Beiderman closes the file. \n               Molly sits for a long time. She is in terrible pain.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Oh God, I wanted it to be Sam.\n\n               Sgt. Beiderman nods his head compassionately and then turns \n               away.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON (THE SAME DAY)\n\n               Molly is sitting in her bedroom. The glow of the late \n               afternoon sunlight casts long shadows across the bed. She \n               seems deeply depressed and alone. Gradually her gaze falls \n               on a jar sitting on the nightstand. In it is the penny Sam \n               found when they were first working on the loft. A label on \n               the jar says, \"For Luck!\" In a moment of sudden rage, she \n               picks it up and throws it against the wall. It SHATTERS on \n               the floor.\n\n               INT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n               The code from Sam's address book, jotted on a piece of paper, \n               is sitting beside Carl.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (excitedly)\n                         God, let this be it!\n\n               Anxiously, Carl punches the code into a computer and, \n               suddenly, Sam's old accounts appear on the screen. A look of \n               relief wafts across Carl's face.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Oh God, yes!\n\n               Carl is staring at the same accounts Sam was examining the \n               afternoon before he was killed, the accounts with too much \n               money in them.\n\n               Carl picks up the phone and punches a number. Someone answers.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Tony, this is Carl. I'm all set. \n                         We're fine. Everything's fine. Just \n                         tell me what you want me to do.\n\n               A VOICE on the other end begins to speak.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         We want you to transfer the money \n                         from the 12 separate accounts into a \n                         single account under the name \"Rita \n                         Miller\".

He seems deeply relieved.\n\n               REVEAL SAM\n\n               He is standing in front of Carl, watching. Quickly, Carl \n               begins punching commands into the computer. He is setting up \n               the dummy account. Rita Miller, #926-31043.\n\n               INT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT\n\n               Molly, in a short terrycloth robe, is sitting in a chair. A \n               magazine is on her lap but she is staring vacantly into the \n               loft. She seems lost in the vast space. Sam is pacing back \n               and forth. There is a melancholy look in his eyes.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Why can't you hear me, Molly? I need \n                         you.\n\n               Suddenly the BELL rings. Molly jumps.\n\n               Molly's finger is on the intercom. She seems unsettled.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Who's there?\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Molly, it's Carl. Can I come up?\n\n               Sam freezes. Molly is surprised. She hesitates a moment and \n               then pushes the buzzer to let him in. We hear Carl bounding \n               up the stairs.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Don't open it. He's a murderer, Moll!\n\n               There is a KNOCK. Molly opens the door. Carl seems buoyant, \n               almost celebratory. He has a bag of fruit in his hand. He is \n               still in a suit and tie.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Hi. Thanks. I know it's late. I'm \n                         sorry to disturb you. I felt bad \n                         about last night. This supernatural \n                         stuff just makes me so uncomfortable. \n                         I don't even read horoscopes.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Don't worry.

You needed me to hear \n                         you and I didn't and that was wrong. \n                         I want you to know that I'm your \n                         friend, Moll.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         You were never our friend.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (holding out a paper \n                              bag)\n                         Hey, I brought you some Japanese \n                         apple pears.

I've had one of \n                         those days. Maybe a cup of coffee?\n\n                                     SAM\n                         No, Moll. Don't do it. Don't let him \n                         in!\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (hesitating)\n                         Sure.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               INT. LIVINGROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Carl, in shirt sleeves and Molly in her robe, are sitting on \n               the couch drinking coffee. We notice that Carl is wearing \n               yellow suspenders. Sam is beside himself, watching them.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Are you alright? You look nervous, \n                         upset.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (glancing at her thighs)\n                         What can I tell you. It's been tough. \n                         Hell, you know. It still hurts so \n                         much.\n                              (he poses sadly)\n                         Then on top of it all... it's the \n                         responsibilities. They've given me \n                         my own accounts, but I've had no \n                         time to adjust. My mind has been \n                         reeling.\n\n               Molly reaches out and pats his arm. There is an awkward pause.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Where were you this morning? I thought \n                         you were coming to the bank to sign \n                         those papers.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         I didn't have time.\n                              (beat)\n                         I went to the police, Carl.\n\n               Sam looks at her, amazed. Carl, on the other hand, stiffens. \n               He laughs nervously.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         You're kidding. You really did it? I \n                         don't believe... What did you tell \n                         them?

I was a fool. I don't believe \n                         anything anymore. Why would people \n                         do such things?\n\n               Sam is devastated.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (milking it)\n                         It's hard to face reality, Moll, the \n                         hard cold facts of it. What you have \n                         to remember is the love you felt. \n                         That's what's real. You have to \n                         remember how good Sam was. How much \n                         he loved you.\n\n               Molly holds back tears. Carl reaches out tenderly and strokes \n               her hair.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         You were everything to him, Molly. \n                         You were his life.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (finally crying)\n                         I feel so alone.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         You're not alone. You're young. You've \n                         got so much talent. You're \n                         fantastically gorgeous.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (appreciating his \n                              words)\n                         Oh God, I don't know what's real \n                         anymore.

Think about \n                         what he meant to you, the years you \n                         had together, how wonderful they \n                         were.\n\n               Carl glides his hand slowly, lovingly across her cheek.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Let your feelings out.\n\n               Almost imperceptibly, his hand moves down to the nape of her \n               neck. As she moves, her robe opens slightly. Carl notices, \n               glimpsing her nakedness beneath it. Sam notices, too. He \n               freezes.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Life turns on a dime, Moll. People \n                         think they have forever, that they'll \n                         always have tomorrow. But it's not \n                         true. Sam taught us that. We have to \n                         live for now, for today.\n\n               Molly can barely contain her tears. Carl moves toward her \n               moist cheeks and kisses them gently. Slowly, he guides his \n               lips to her neck and kisses it, too. It is all hateful and \n               sensual at the same time. Sam turns away.\n\n               Molly feels Carl's tenderness, needs it. She does not notice \n               his hand reaching for the cord on her robe and slowly pulling \n               it toward him. With a little tug the cord unravels and the \n               robe falls open. Molly is confused, aroused, not sure what \n               to do. She starts to pull it closed. He holds her hand. For \n               a moment they do nothing. Then his fingers reach for her \n               thigh. Her body quivers. Carl feels her openness and pulls \n               closer, his hand rising gently up her naked body.\n\n               Molly's eyes close. She says nothing.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         No!!!\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Sam charges wildly at the couch and begins flailing \n               uncontrollably at the two of them. Unexpectedly his foot \n               kicks out and hits a framed photograph of him and Molly that's \n               sitting on an end table. The picture CRASHES to the floor, \n               the glass SHATTERING.\n\n               Molly jumps up, the mood suddenly broken. She sees the photo \n               and recoils. Carl reaches for her. She backs away.\n\n               Sam is stunned by what has happened. He jumps up and tries \n               kicking over another picture but nothing moves. His foot \n               goes right through it.\n\n               Molly looks at Carl, drying her tears.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. It's \n                         too soon... You've been great Carl, \n                         but... I need you to leave. Please. \n                         I need you to.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Sure. It's okay. I understand. I \n                         really do.\n\n               She reaches out and takes his hand.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Look, what if we have dinner tomorrow \n                         night? Just talk. Can I interest you \n                         in that?\n\n                                     SAM\n                         NO!!!\n\n               Molly hesitates a moment and then nods her head \"yes\". Carl \n               smiles.\n\n               INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\n               Sam rushes madly down a flight of stairs into a subway \n               station. A train is just leaving. He jumps on board.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT\n\n               Sam begins quickly casing the aisles, looking for something. \n               It is not there. Another train can be seen speeding past the \n               window. Sam takes a running leap and jumps onto it, passing \n               through the walls.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               ANGLE - SAM\n\n               disappointed. Suddenly, an express train passes alongside \n               his local. Sam sticks his face inside it. Suddenly, he smiles \n               and rushes onto it.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Sam does not have to stand there long. Within seconds, the \n               terrifying Ghost he had seen before comes charging at him. \n               We notice him more clearly now. He is wearing a dark blue \n               pea coat. There is a grizzled look about him. He has stained \n               teeth and seems perpetually unshaven.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         Get off my train!\n\n               This time Sam does not back away. He holds his ground. The \n               Ghost lets fire every trick in his arsenal. Posters come \n               flying off the walls. A bag of groceries topples from a \n               woman's arms, an old man's cane flies across the aisle, a \n               boy's Mets cap flips off his head. People on the train move \n               quickly to other cars.\n\n               Unable to frighten him, the Ghost kicks Sam in the stomach. \n               Sam recoils, feeling it, but gets back up again. He is angry \n               now. He begins raging at the other Ghost. The Ghost is \n               shocked.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Teach me how you do that! I want to \n                         learn! I'm not leaving til you teach \n                         me!\n\n               The Ghost, exhausted, looks up at him and smiles with \n               appreciation.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         You stubborn asshole.\n\n               Sam nods in agreement.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               SAM AND THE GHOST\n\n               sitting in the corner of a deserted subway station. Sam is \n               trying desperately to push a bottle cap with his finger.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                              (continuing)\n                         What are you doing? What are you \n                         doing? You can't push it with your \n                         finger. You're dead.\n\n               The Ghost demonstrates, kicking a garbage pail onto its side. \n               Sam can't quite tell how he did it.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I don't get it.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         It's your mind, you idiot. It's all \n                         in the mind. The problem is you think \n                         you're still real, that you're \n                         standin' on the floor, that you're \n                         wearin' those clothes. Bullshit! You \n                         don't even have a body anymore. It's \n                         all up here. You wanna move things, \n                         you gotta use your mind. You gotta \n                         focus! You hear what I'm saying?\n\n                                     SAM\n                         How do you focus?\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         I don't know how you focus! You just \n                         focus!\n\n               With surprising energy, the Ghost flicks a bottle cap and \n               sends it shooting across the subway platform.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                              (continuing)\n                         It's all in the anger. You gotta \n                         direct it. You gotta channel it.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I'm angry all the time. It doesn't \n                         do a thing.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         Cause you're angry all over. You \n                         gotta be angry here, in the pit of \n                         your stomach. Bring it down here. \n                         Let it explode.\n                              (he makes an explosive \n                              gesture)\n                         It's like a reactor, you know. Pow!\n\n               He kicks a Coke can toward Sam. Sam tries to kick it back \n               and misses. The Ghost laughs. Sam gets angry. He tries again \n               and falls on his head. The Ghost laughs louder. Now Sam is \n               really angry. We see him forcing the anger down into his \n               stomach. He holds still for a moment and then kicks at the \n               can with all his might. To his shock and amazement, it sails \n               right through the Ghost's head. The Ghost smiles.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I did it!\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         Way to go.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               SAM\n\n               practicing. He smashes at an abandoned tennis shoe with his \n               fist. Nothing happens.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         From your gut. What do I keep tellin' \n                         you?\n\n               Sam's stomach bulges. He tries again. Nothing.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                              (continuing)\n                         Give it time! What else have you \n                         got?\n\n               Undaunted, Sam tries once more. This time the tennis shoe \n               moves. The Ghost nods his head approvingly. Sam is thrilled.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         How long have you been here?\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         Since they pushed me.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Someone pushed you?\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         Yeah, someone pushed me!\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Who?\n\n                                     GHOST\n                         What? You don't believe me? You think \n                         I fell? You think I jumped? Well, \n                         fuck you!\n                              (an unexpected rage \n                              starts to build)\n                         It wasn't my time!

Suddenly he rams a \n               cigarette machine full force with his head. The glass SHATTERS \n               and packs of cigarettes scatter everywhere. He throws himself \n               on top of them with terrible longing.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                              (continuing)\n                         I'd give everything for a drag. Just \n                         one drag.\n\n               He rolls and wallows in terrible frustration, tossing the \n               cigarettes in all directions. Suddenly he looks up and sees \n               Sam. He is unable to control his fury.\n\n                                     GHOST\n                              (continuing)\n                         Who the hell are you? Why are you \n                         hounding me like this? Leave me alone.\n\n               AN EXPRESS TRAIN\n\n               is shooting through the station. The Ghost throws himself \n               into it and in an instant he is gone.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\n               Sam, all alone, walks through the station. Suddenly, he \n               reaches out and pushes a garbage can lid. It swings back and \n               forth. He is delighted. A beer can is sitting on a bench. He \n               pushes it off, watching it roll across the platform with \n               childlike glee.\n\n               Looking up, Sam sees an advertisement for Market Security \n               Bank and Trust. He stares at it with great interest. \"Special \n               Banking for Special People. We make it easy for you.\" \n               Something registers in Sam's eyes. He yells and jumps straight \n               up, hitting a subway sign with his finger. With great \n               excitement, he runs for the stairs and rushes from the \n               station.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               ORTISHA JONES, a black woman with brassy red hair, is sitting \n               at Oda Mae's seance table surrounded by several of her \n               relatives. Clara and Louise stand behind Oda Mae helping \n               with the ritual. Oda Mae goes into her trance.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               A GROUP OF GHOSTS is milling behind Oda Mae.

He is not sure what to do. He \n               notices a stack of deposit forms on the counter she is about \n               to pass. He hurries to it and flicks the entire stack, a \n               hundred sheets, flying up into the air. Molly, confused, \n               thinks she is responsible and stoops to pick them up. Sam, \n               delighted, flicks another stack.\n\n               Oda Mae is talking a blue streak when Sam returns to her.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                              (continuing)\n                         Then my mother took all the money \n                         from the oil wells and put it in \n                         gasoline pumps.

Unfortunately, Oda Mae steps onto an elevator before \n               Molly can catch up. The doors close. Molly stops for a moment \n               and then looks back across to the executive area.

We sense \n               that every word is a torment for her. The nuns politely avert \n               their eyes from the check.\n\n                                     NUN\n                         Bless you, child.\n\n               Oda Mae gives her a dirty look and hands the check over.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I'm proud of you.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Don't you talk to me.

Friends?\n\n               She turns on her high heels and wobbles away.

In the background we see the nuns secretly \n               peeking at the check. One of them, wide-eyed, faints dead \n               away. The other nun stoops down and fans her face in an \n               attempt to revive her.\n\n               INT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n               It is after hours. Almost everyone on the floor has gone. \n               Carl, hunched over his computer, is typing furious commands \n               on the keyboard. He looks haggard and worn.\n\n               Sequence after sequence of coded numbers flash past on the \n               monitor screen. Sam, sitting in a desk chair, watches, \n               smiling.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Search, you bastard! You'll never \n                         find it. It's gone.\n                              (he smiles)\n                         They'll kill you for this, Carl. You \n                         and Willie. They'll wipe you off the \n                         face of the earth.\n\n               In a moment of childish delight, he pushes his feet against \n               the wall and the chair shoots across the room. Carl looks up \n               and sees an empty chair moving. He stares at it in confusion, \n               and then goes back to the screen. He seems desperate. Nothing \n               is working.\n\n               Panicked and frightened, Carl flicks off the machine and \n               storms furiously around the room. Sam approaches the computer, \n               hesitates a moment, and then pushes the power switch. The \n               computer CLICKS back on. Carl spins around. He stares at the \n               computer curiously for a moment and then turns it back off. \n               Sam, enjoying this, reaches for the switch and FLICKS it \n               back on again. Carl stares at it.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         What the...?\n\n               Carl watches as the keys seem to depress themselves and \n               letters begin appearing on the screen. He sits down, \n               mesmerized by what is happening. Then his face grows tense. \n               The word \"M-U-R-D-E-R-E-R\" is emerging before him.\n\n               Carl flies out of his chair, frantically running around to \n               see who else is on the floor. He yells out like a madman.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Who's doing that?\n\n               There is no one there. He hears the computer beginning to \n               type again and hurries back to look at the screen. One word \n               appears. \"S-A-M\".\n\n               Carl gasps and smashes the computer with his fist. It crashes \n               to the floor. Electrical sparks go flying as Carl gasps for \n               breath.\n\n               Sam cannot hold himself back any longer. With a horrifying \n               scream, he charges at Carl, jamming his fist hard into his \n               ribs.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         You bastard! You goddamn bastard!\n\n               Carl grabs his side.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Ah!\n\n               He hits Carl again. Carl gasps in inexplicable pain.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         It's dinner time, Carl. Don't you \n                         have a date with Molly, you creepy \n                         son-of-a bitch?\n\n               Sam keeps hitting deeper into Carl's mid-section. Carl doubles \n               over as though he's going to throw up.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Jesus! Oh God!\n\n               Sam is flushed with excitement. Carl kneels beside his desk. \n               He cannot understand what is happening to him. His face goes \n               stark white as the attack continues.\n\n               Then, unexpectedly, the assault stops. Sam, exhausted, stares \n               hatefully at his old friend cowering on the floor. Slowly \n               and dizzily, Carl gets up. He looks fearfully around the \n               office and then, holding his stomach, hurries from the room.\n\n               INT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT\n\n               Molly, all dressed to go out, is sitting in Sam's easy chair, \n               asleep. Suddenly Carl arrives knocking at her door. He does \n               not look well. Sam is with him.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Carl? Where were you?

Furgeson says \n                         she was taking out money. It turns \n                         out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown. \n                         It's Rita Miller or something.\n\n               Carl turns white. His eyes bulge. He feels sick.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (continuing)\n                         What's wrong?\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Stomach.

Carl jerks forward in intense pain and \n               begins flailing at the air.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         What are you doing to me.

Quickly he turns on the gas. He \n               looks crazed. Turning to the air, he begins whispering loudly.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         You touch me again and I'll set her \n                         on fire.

Stay away!\n\n               Sam jabs at the knob on the stove and begins to turn it off. \n               Carl sees it move. Shocked and frightened, he grabs it and \n               pulls it off, leaving only the tiny stem in place.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Go on, try it again.

He pulls back, shaken. Carl stands \n               there waiting for a blow that doesn't come.

ODA MAE'S LIVINGROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Willie moves quickly through Oda Mae's apartment, his gun \n               pointed, ready to fire. He seems furious when he realizes no \n               one is there.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Looks like someone just left.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         I'll check the building.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               He rushes back out and down the stairs. Willie stays in the \n               apartment. Suddenly, the doorbell RINGS. Willie rushes over \n               and opens the door a crack. There is no one there. Confused, \n               he backs away. The doorbell rings again. Completely mystified, \n               he aims his gun and opens the door all the way. The hallway \n               is empty.\n\n               As Willie stands there, wondering what is happening, Sam \n               steps inside and pushes the door closed. It slams shut. Willie \n               nearly jumps out of his skin.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Damn!\n\n               He stares at the door in total bewilderment. At that instant, \n               a collection of picture frames flies off the breakfront and \n               crashes into his legs. He backs away, spooked.\n\n               Suddenly, the T.V. flicks ON at full volume and then the \n               STEREO and the RADIO. Lights begin flashing on and off. Willie \n               spins around in total dismay.\n\n               Summoning all of his force, Sam slams into Willie. Willie \n               recoils in unexplainable pain. He seems very disoriented. \n               His gun falls to the floor. He reaches for it and Sam pushes \n               it away. Willie jumps up, afraid. His eyes dart around the \n               room. Sam laughs.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                              (continuing)\n                         Who's there?

Grabbing his gun, Willie \n               runs into the bathroom and locks the door. Suddenly the hot \n               water faucet turns on by itself.\n\n               Willie is terrified. Steam rises from the sink. Willie tries \n               to get out, but Sam approaches him from behind and appears \n               to dig his hands into his neck. Willie crumples to his knees.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Oh God!\n\n               There is a SQUEAKING SOUND and Willie looks up. Letters are \n               appearing in the fogged mirror. He stares in disbelief as \n               the word \"B-O-O!\" emerges before him. He cries out.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                              (continuing)\n                         Let me outta here!\n\n               Shaking uncontrollably, Willie FIRES his gun at the mirror. \n               Glass and tiles EXPLODE. Willie is cut and bleeding. He grabs \n               hold of the door and yanks it open.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY\n\n               Willie rushes to the hallway, charges for the back stairs \n               and stumbles down the three flights to the street. Carl, \n               running down the corridor, rushes after him. Willie drops \n               his gun. Carl picks it up.\n\n               EXT. BROOKLYN STREET -- NIGHT\n\n               Willie runs from the building and careens down the sidewalk. \n               People clear a path as he hurls past them like a madman. \n               Carl, confused, runs after him.\n\n               Sam, too, races after Willie, unwilling to let him get away.\n\n               Suddenly, a man obstructs his way. Willie goes flying over \n               him and lands face down on the cement. Before he can get up, \n               Sam is all over him and does not let up. People stand back \n               to watch as Willie does battle with himself. Panicked, he \n               calls out to a bystander.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Help me!\n\n               People back away. Carl watches in terror. He understands \n               exactly what is happening.\n\n               EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Willie, blinded by his own hysteria, runs wildly into the \n               street. Cars are bearing down on him from all directions. He \n               does not get out of their way.\n\n               One driver sees Willie coming and swerves to avoid him. His \n               car skids. Another car brakes to avoid a collision and \n               suddenly both cars crash right into him.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Look out!\n\n               Willie's body is crushed instantly between the two vehicles \n               as his spirit is catapulted into the air still screaming and \n               writhing. His ghostly form reaches out to people for help as \n               they rush past. No one stops.\n\n               Willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the \n               street. Suddenly, he recognizes that it is his own dead body \n               lying there. He begins to scream.\n\n               A bizarre and frightening CLICKING SOUND fills the air. Sam \n               looks up. A group of strange dark figures has emerged from \n               the shadows.\n\n               With a loud, terrifying shriek, the dark forms swoop down \n               and grab hold of Willie. Sam freezes. In an instant they are \n               dragging Willie, kicking and screaming, down through the \n               sewer grates into the bowels of the earth.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Sam backs against a wall in absolute horror. Carl, standing \n               in the crowd, turns and runs.\n\n               INT. OLD LADY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Oda Mae and her sisters are huddling with the old woman in \n               the entryway to her apartment. They all appear frightened. \n               The door is opened a crack and they can see people gathering \n               in the hall outside.\n\n               Sam walks up to Oda Mae.

She turns to Sam.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Who's Carl?\n\n               INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT\n\n               Sam and Oda Mae are in a taxi speeding downtown.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Tell him to hurry!\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Can't you hurry up?\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Listen, lady, I'm going as fast as I \n                         can.\n\n               Sam leans forward and pushes at the gas pedal. The cab shoots \n               forward. The driver seems shocked.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Problems?\n\n               He gives her a dirty look.\n\n               INT. LOFT - NIGHT\n\n               There is a KNOCK at the door. Molly goes to it. Fastening \n               the latch, she opens it a crack.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Carl, is that you?\n\n               Oda Mae wedges her foot inside.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Molly, it's Oda Mae. I know what you \n                         think of me, but your life is in \n                         danger. You have to listen to me. \n                         Sam's here, too. You gotta let us \n                         in.\n\n               Molly tries to slam the door but hits Oda Mae's foot.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Get the hell out of here.

He was \n                         murdered, Molly. Carl was laundering \n                         money at the bank. Sam found out. \n                         He's dangerous. He tried to kill me. \n                         He'll kill you, too.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (screaming)\n                         Why are you doing this to me?

You're just a fake. \n                         Leave me alone!\n\n               We see Sam's inside the room with Molly. He gazes at her \n               lovingly for a moment and then calls back to Oda Mae.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Tell her she's wearing the blouse I \n                         spilled the Margarita on and the \n                         earrings I gave her for Christmas.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Sam says you're wearin' the blouse \n                         he spilled the Margarita on and the \n                         earrings he gave you at Christmas.\n\n                                                               CUT BACK TO:\n\n               MOLLY\n\n               grabbing hold of her beads.

On the floor. Now.\n\n               Oda Mae obeys. A pile of coins falls on the floor.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (continuing)\n                         Push a penny under the door.\n\n               Oda Mae obeys and a penny slides into the loft. Molly sees \n               it. Sam tips it carefully so it lands upright against the \n               bottom of the door. Pushing gently, he moves the penny up \n               the door until it's eye level with Molly. She watches it, \n               amazed.\n\n               Then, to her astonishment, the penny floats away from the \n               door and hovers in the air. There is a look of wonder in \n               Molly's eyes as it floats toward her.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (continuing; calling \n                              to Oda Mae)\n                         Tell her it's for luck.\n\n                                     ODA MAE (O.S.)\n                         Sam says it's for luck.\n\n               Molly stands there dumbfounded. Her face is completely white. \n               After a moment she reaches for the penny. It falls into her \n               hand. There are tears in her eyes.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               HALLWAY\n\n               Oda Mae standing in the hallway as the door to the loft begins \n               to open. Slowly Molly steps out onto the landing and stares \n               at her, nervously, uncomprehendingly. She hesitates for a \n               long moment and then invites Oda Mae in.\n\n               INT. LOFT - NIGHT\n\n               Molly is on the phone. Oda Mae is beside her.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Right. Yes, it's right on the corner. \n                         We're a red brick building with the \n                         entrance on the left side. Please \n                         hurry.

Sam meets her hand. She \n               flinches for a second but does not pull back.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (fingering the air)\n                         Can you feel me, Sam?\n\n                                     SAM\n                         With all my heart.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         With all his heart, he says.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I'd give anything to be alive again, \n                         just to feel you once more.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         He wishes he could touch you, just \n                         one more time.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Oh, Sam.\n\n               Oda Mae looks away uncomfortably. The CAMERA HOLDS on her \n               face. After a moment she turns around and addresses the air.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Okay, damn it, you can use me if you \n                         want.\n\n               Sam looks oddly at Oda Mae.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                              (continuing)\n                         Come on. Before I change my mind.\n\n               Suddenly he understands what she means.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               JUKEBOX\n\n               Sam's finger presses down two keys. We see a record slide \n               out of its slot and move toward the turntable. We know what \n               it is going to play.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Oda Mae closes her eyes. \"Unchained Melody\" begins to play. \n               Sam hesitates for a moment and then cautiously, awkwardly \n               slides his ghostly body into her solid form. We sense Oda \n               Mae's discomfort gradually give way as Sam emerges inside \n               her. After a second her body turns slowly toward Molly.\n\n               Oda Mae's hand reaches out and with slow, deliberate gestures, \n               touches Molly's hand. Molly swallows hard. She closes her \n               eyes.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Sam. It is as though he alone is there with Molly. His eyes \n               are full of tears. He can barely move. His hand glides slowly \n               down Molly's cheek. He seems to be in a state of ecstasy and \n               pain.\n\n               The experience is more than he can bear. He pulls back.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Sam!\n\n               Molly reaches out, takes Sam's hand, and guides it to her \n               soft lips. Sam can barely breathe. He seems totally absorbed \n               in the experience, the sensation of human flesh.\n\n               His eyes are absolutely still and full of light. He seems to \n               be glowing.\n\n               Gently, Molly takes Sam's arm and guides him to his feet. \n               Effortlessly, she draws him to the center of the huge loft. \n               With great tenderness, she puts her arms around him and before \n               he knows what is happening, they are dancing. It is a strange, \n               touching image, reminiscent of their first night in their \n               new home. Sam reaches out and slowly draws his fingers down \n               over her face, caressing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips. \n               She stands motionless. Her face shines. She knows beyond all \n               doubt that it is him.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         I love you so much.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               A LOUD JARRING SOUND. It takes a moment to realize that it \n               is someone KNOCKING at the door. The light slams back into \n               its shadowy substance and Sam comes shooting back into his \n               ghostly form. Oda Mae is standing with Molly in the center \n               of the room. Sam is beside them. He appears shaken and dizzy.\n\n               There is a another loud POUNDING at the door.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         The police!\n\n               Molly heads for the door. Sam calls out. He can barely speak.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         No!\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                              (to Molly)\n                         Wait!\n\n               Sam tries to go instead. To his amazement and ours he is \n               extremely weak, barely able to move.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         What's happening to me?\n\n               His ghostly functions are diminishing.\n\n               There is another KNOCK and a voice rings out.\n\n                                     CARL (O.S.)\n                         Molly, open up.

STAIRWELL - NIGHT\n\n               Carl is standing on the landing. He is holding a gun. He \n               aims it at the lock and FIRES. The door to the loft flies \n               open.\n\n               INT. LOFT - NIGHT\n\n               Carl moves rapidly through the huge space.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Molly!\n\n               It is obvious that no one's home.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Sam, with great effort, rushes at Carl and attacks him with \n               his fists. To his great shock, he has no impact. Carl walks \n               right through him.\n\n               EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT\n\n               Molly and Oda Mae are climbing the fire escape.\n\n               INT. LOFT - NIGHT\n\n               Carl runs to the fire escape window. He looks out just in \n               time to see Oda Mae go into the 7th story window.\n\n               INT. NEW LOFT - NIGHT\n\n               Molly and Oda Mae run through a new loft that is under \n               construction. It is a maze of tangled wires and broken walls. \n               The fire escape window slams shut and nearly scares them \n               half to death. They rush blindly toward the front door. It \n               won't open.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Back to the fire escape. Head for \n                         the roof.\n\n               Oda Mae reaches the fire escape window just as Carl appears \n               on the other side. She screams. Carl tries shoving the window \n               open. It won't budge.\n\n               Molly sees some scaffolding leading to the skylight. There \n               is an opening at the top.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         This way!\n\n               Molly quickly climbs the scaffolding and makes it to the \n               roof.\n\n               With a huge shove, Carl opens the window and rushes inside. \n               The window slams behind him.\n\n               Oda Mae rushes back toward Molly, but her foot catches on a \n               loose cable and she falls to the ground.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Help us, Sam!\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               ODA MAE\n\n               A hand falls on Oda Mae's shoulder. She spins around. Carl \n               is standing behind her. She screams as he knocks her to the \n               floor.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         I want the check. Just give me the \n                         check.\n\n               Molly looks down from the scaffolding and begins to scream.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (screaming)\n                         God almighty, Carl! What are you \n                         doing? What have you done!?\n\n               She descends quickly and runs toward Carl.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Don't interfere! She's a thief. It's \n                         not her money.\n\n               Carl kicks Oda Mae. Molly rushes at him, attacking him \n               violently. Carl aims his gun at her.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Keep out of this, Molly!\n\n               He grabs Oda Mae by the hair.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Where is it?\n\n               Oda Mae cries out.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         In my purse.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Where?\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         Over there.\n\n               She points across the room.\n\n               Carl sees the purse and yanks Oda Mae toward it. Yanking it \n               off the floor, he tears through it like a wild man. There is \n               no check. He grabs Oda Mae.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Where is it, goddamn it? Where is \n                         it?\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         I gave it away.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         You're lying! Don't lie to me!\n\n               He aims his gun at her eye and is about to FIRE when, \n               suddenly, something shoves him to the floor. Carl screams \n               and jumps back, tripping over Oda Mae. Sam is standing there.\n\n               In total panic, Carl scrambles to get up. Horrified, he SHOOTS \n               his gun blindly into the air. Molly and Oda Mae dive for \n               cover. The bullets have no impact. Sam musters all his \n               strength and shoves Carl again. White with fear, Carl grabs \n               Molly and aims his gun at her head.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         I'll kill her. You touch me and I'll \n                         kill her. I mean it, Sam. Just give \n                         me the check.\n\n               The gun is cocked at her temple. No one moves. Slowly the \n               camera dollies toward Carl.\n\n                                     CARL\n                              (continuing)\n                         Sam, please. I didn't mean for him \n                         to kill you. It's not my fault. Come \n                         on, Sam, give me the check. Give it \n                         to me and I'll leave her alone.\n\n               Nothing happens. Carl looks nervous.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Sam? Sam?\n\n               In a wild explosive fury, Sam charges at Carl and smashes at \n               his gun. The weapon flies out of Carl's hand. Empowered by \n               an anger we have not seen before, Sam smashes into Carl with \n               a violent force. Carl's body careens into walls and \n               floorboards. Wiring snaps. Two-by-fours crack.\n\n               Carl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the \n               floor. With a wild rush, he grabs for it and shoots at the \n               door. The lock explodes and the door flies open.\n\n               Carl tries to run for it, but Sam cuts in front of him. With \n               growing power, Sam sends Carl flying back into the apartment, \n               colliding into a tall scaffold. Bags of plaster topple to \n               the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air. The \n               apartment looks like a scene from another world.\n\n               Carl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from \n               Sam. The dust obscures his escape. Like a trapped insect, he \n               scrambles furiously to the fire escape window. Sam cannot \n               see him.\n\n               Carl shoves at the window. It is stuck. With a supreme effort, \n               he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass. \n               Half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing \n               the window. Shards of glass fly in all directions. Sam turns \n               and sees Carl. He surges after him, but knows he cannot get \n               to him in time.\n\n               Carl is halfway out the window when Sam's fist slams into an \n               electrical box attached to a dangling BX cable. It goes flying \n               toward the window. To his amazement, it hits the frame. A \n               huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down. Carl \n               looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his \n               chest. Before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs \n               and slices into his heart. His body quivers.\n\n               Carl's eyes bulge from their sockets. His body begins to \n               spasm. He can't get up. A look of abject terror flashes \n               through his eyes. He tries to scream. There is no sound. He \n               tries to breathe. There is no breath.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               With one last effort, Carl lurches forward. To his amazement, \n               his body stands up and pulls away from the window. He looks \n               down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is \n               gone. There is no blood. Excited and confused, he turns around \n               and sees Sam. For a moment, he cannot comprehend what is \n               happening.\n\n                                     CARL\n                         Sam?\n\n               There is a strange, silent moment between them.\n\n               Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a terrible CLICKING sound is \n               heard. Frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness. \n               Carl looks behind him and gasps. Past the figures coming \n               toward him, he sees his own dead body. It is pinned to the \n               window sill.\n\n               Before Carl can cry out, the dark figures swoop down and \n               envelope him. In a flash, his spirit is caught and surges \n               with the dark forces back into the shadows. Far in some \n               invisible distance, we can barely hear him scream.\n\n               And then it is silent. It is over.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Molly is crouched in the corner, her back pressed tightly \n               against the wall. She is staring into space. The room is \n               filled with plaster dust. Slowly, emerging from the dust, we \n               see Sam approaching Molly. He gazes at her with terrible \n               longing.\n\n               Suddenly, a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling \n               and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze. Sam \n               turns to look at it. His eyes are full of surprise and wonder. \n               The spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him. As he \n               looks down, he notices that his hands are growing transparent. \n               His body is beginning to fade. A faint smile forms on his \n               face. He leans down toward Molly, staring at her for a long, \n               silent moment.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         Goodbye, Moll.\n\n               Molly's head lifts up. She looks around.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Sam? Is that you?\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (stunned)\n                         Molly?!\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         I hear you, Sam.\n\n               She starts to cry.\n\n               Gradually, we notice that the dust in the air near Molly is \n               beginning to shimmer with a subtle glow. To her astonishment, \n               Sam's spirit is reflected in the floating particles.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                              (continuing)\n                         Oh God!\n\n               Sam's luminous form appears before her. Molly is overwhelmed \n               by the sight of him. The two of them gaze at one another \n               without moving. They know it is for the last time. It is a \n               silent exchange, charged with emotion.\n\n               Slowly, the two bodies reach forward. As their lips touch, \n               the plaster dust swirls sensuously through Sam's vaporous \n               image and he begins to disappear. Molly pulls back from him \n               as though from a cloud. His voice rises from the mist.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I can't stay anymore.\n\n               Tears roll down her cheek.\n\n               The brilliant light intensifies. It is beautiful, like a \n               sunrise, saturating the room with a warm, comforting glow. \n               Molly looks up and sees it all. Oda Mae sees it, too.\n\n                                     ODA MAE\n                         They're waiting for you, Sam.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (smiling)\n                         I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae.\n                              (with deep felt \n                              gratitude)\n                         Thank you. Your mama would be proud.\n\n               Oda Mae smiles warmly.\n\n               Sam turns to Molly. She is gazing at the last remaining \n               moments of him. Her eyes brim over with tears and love.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         I love you, Molly. I've always loved \n                         you.\n\n               Molly swallows hard and wipes her eyes.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         Ditto.\n\n               The light inside Sam intensifies. A sweet smile emerges on \n               his lips.\n\n                                     SAM\n                         It's so amazing, Moll...\n\n               His face fills with joy.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (continuing)\n                         The love inside.\n\n               He whispers, almost crying.\n\n                                     SAM\n                              (continuing)\n                         You take it with you.\n\n               They are his last words. His spirit dissolves within its \n               ghostly moorings and begins to evaporate. Molly looks up \n               silently for a moment, her face filled with love.\n\n                                     MOLLY\n                         See ya.\n\n               We see Sam's spirit rise from the room. It passes effortlessly \n               through the ceiling and, in seconds, he is gone. The room \n               grows dark.\n\n               Molly sits quietly on the floor. There is a look of awe and \n               wonder in her eyes. After a moment, Oda Mae reaches down to \n               help her up. Molly looks at her lovingly and then gently \n               takes her hand. Arm in arm, supporting one another, they \n               walk quietly from the room.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nGhost\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Bruce Joel Rubin\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Romance\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:52.627090"}
