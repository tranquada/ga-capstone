TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT\n\nDolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket \nfull of coins into a trough.

TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY\n\nCamera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and \nwalking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's \ncage.

We see inside the count room from NANCE'S \npoint of view.\n\nIt looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A \nlarge room, windowless, decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, \nopened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS in \nwhite shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and \nsorting paper money.)\n\n                      ACE (V.O.)\n          Now this place was off limits.\n\n                      COUNTER #1\n          Verify two thousand.\n\n                      ACE (V.O.)\n          Even I couldn't get inside, but it \n          was my job to keep it filled with \n          cash. That's for sure.\n\n                      NICKY (V.O.)\n          They had so much fuckin' money in \n          there, you could build a house out \n          of stacks of $100 bills. And the \n          best part was that upstairs, the \n          board of directors didn't know what \n          the fuck was going on.\n\nAt one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and \nrapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera follows \na cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. He \npours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a \nvideo camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and \nannounces:\n\n                      COUNTER #2\n          Five thousand.\n\n                      NICKY (V.O.)\n          I mean, to them everything looked on \n          the up and up. Right? Wrong.\n\nThe first counter recounts the cash.\n\n                      COUNTER #1\n          Verify five thousand.\n\n                      NICKY (V.O.)\n          The guys inside the counting room...\n\nStacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room \nto another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats \nthe figure and writes it down on a master list.\n\n                      COUNT ROOM EXEC\n          Five thousand.\n\nWe move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of \n$100 bills. He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with \ncash. As he does this, the workers studiously look in other \ndirections.\n\n                      NICKY (V.O.)\n          ...were all slipped in there to skim \n          the joint dry.  They'd do short \n          counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd \n          even take cash right out of the drop \n          boxes. And it was up to this guy \n          right here [NANCE], standin' in front \n          of about two million dollars, to \n          skim the cash off the top without \n          anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or \n          anybody.\n\n                      COUNTER #1\n          Verify two hundred.\n\nNANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters \ndumps another container of money on the table.\n\n                      NICKY (V.O.)\n          Now, notice how in the count room \n          nobody ever seems to see anything. \n          Somehow, somebody's always lookin' \n          the other way. Now, look at these \n          guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy, \n          right?  They're countin' money. Who \n          wants to bother them? I mean, God \n          forbid they should make a mistake \n          and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're \n          in and you're out.\n\nNANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of \nthe casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door.\n\n                      NICKY\n          Past the jag-off guard who gets an \n          extra c-note a week just to watch \n          the door.  I mean, it's routine. \n          Business as usual: in, out, hello, \n          goodbye. And that's all there is to \n          it. Just another fat fuck walkin' \n          out of the casino with a suitcase. \n          Now, that suitcase was goin' straight \n          to one place: right to Kansas City \n          ...which was as close to Las Vegas \n          as the Midwest bosses could go without \n          gettin' themselves arrested.\n\nNANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the \ncurb.\n\nEXT.
