You here?\n\n          \n          We PAN over to a couch - where BETH is wrapped in a throw\n          blanket, watching TV. She's got her hair in a messy bun.\n\n          \n\n                                  BETH\n                    Hey honey.\n\n          \n          He joins her on the couch.        And sees that the TV is off.\n\n          \n\n                                 NEIL\n                    Everything OK?\n\n          \n\n                                  BETH\n                    Yeah.   Just got off the phone.\n\n          \n          Neil gets up again.\n\n          \n\n                                 NEIL\n                    You want some tea or something?\n\n          \n\n                                 BETH\n                    It was my baby sister.        She's getting\n                    married.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                       11\n\n          \n\n          7/20/7                                                12.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                 NEIL\n                    That's great. I've always liked that\n                    Devon guy. That's really great.\n\n          \n          Beth looks at him.    She doesn't look that happy.\n\n          \n\n                                 BETH\n                    Do you think it's great?\n\n          \n\n                                   NEIL\n                    Yeah.\n\n          \n\n                                 BETH\n                    So, you think it's great that they're\n                    getting married, but you never feel like\n                    we're going against nature or something\n                    by not getting married?\n\n          \n\n                                   NEIL\n                    No, babe.\n\n          \n          He sits back down, puts his arms around her.\n\n          \n\n                                 NEIL (CONT'D)\n                    Going against nature is like that cat who\n                    started nursing that monkey.

Look at my parents -\n                    all marriage got them was thirty two\n                    years of misery and joint checking.\n\n          \n\n                                 BETH\n                    Yeah, I know. I get that.\n\n          \n\n                                 NEIL\n                    Like I've always told you - I love you -\n                    and we don't need a marriage certificate\n                    to legitimize our relationship.\n\n          \n\n                                   BETH\n                    Yeah.\n\n          \n\n                                 NEIL\n                    Lemme get you some tea.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                       12\n\n          \n\n          7/20/7                                                 13.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n          He exits. Beth starts to CRY, but quickly dries her\n          tears, and forces herself to pull it together.\n\n          \n\n          EXT.

She checks herself in a vintage mirror,\n          straightens it a tad, then heads down the stairs to find\n          GIGI, on her cell phone.

And\n                    the rule is that guys - like Neil - who\n                    are with girls - like me - for seven\n                    years without getting married - are never\n                    getting married.\n\n          \n          Beth is serious.   Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack.\n\n          \n\n                                 GIGI\n                    No. No, no, no. That's not what I'm\n                    saying. This has absolutely nothing to\n                    do with you. I was just talking, you\n                    know, about me. Specifically.\n\n          \n          Off Beth, knowing it's about her, too.\n\n          \n\n          INT.

You'd think I'd\n                    be pissed, but I literally could not stop\n                    myself from liking him.\n\n          \n\n                                 MARY\n                    But he's married.\n\n          \n\n                                 ANNA\n                    I realize that. I keep trying to force\n                    myself to picture him in some church\n                    saying vows to some woman, and even that\n                    doesn't cool it off.

There was this guy who worked in my\n                    dad's printing business. Married for\n                    fifteen years to a nice lady. And then\n                    he meets this woman at some church event.\n                    And he told my dad he just had never felt\n                    anything like it before. I mean, he had\n                    finally met the love of his life. So, he\n                    divorced his wife, and he's been with\n                    this other woman for 22 years and they\n                    are blissfully happy. I mean, what if\n                    you meet the love of your life - but you\n                    already married someone else? Are you\n                    supposed to pass them by?\n\n          \n\n                                 ANNA\n                    You're right.

He asked\n                    me to marry him on the phone, because\n                    he's just so different and cool like\n                    that. Said he'd eventually get me a\n                    ring, which he didn't, but he did buy\n                    himself a ring because isn't that so\n                    hilarious and cool that the guy is\n                    wearing the ring?

And that's when\n          we see - there seems to be a party and SPEECH underway.\n\n          \n\n                                 COUSIN\n                    Now, I know when my cousin Paige says\n                    those vows tomorrow, there are going to\n                    be hearts breaking all over the world.\n\n          \n          Beth's sister, Paige, smiles.\n\n          \n\n                                 COUSIN (CONT'D)\n                    So, keep in mind, her sister Beth is\n                    still on the market.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                      56\n\n          \n\n          7/20/7                                                57.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n          The cousin WINKS at Beth.   Beth goes white.\n\n          \n\n                                 COUSIN (CONT'D)\n                    Sure, she's an older model, but she's\n                    still got a lot of miles left in her.\n                    But don't stay on the lot too long,\n                    Bethie, or next year's models will --\n\n          \n          KEN MURPHY, 60s, nearly tramples guests to grab the mic.\n\n          \n\n                                 KEN\n                    OK - that's enough of the speeches. Time\n                    to eat. So enjoy the crab. And the\n                    yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the\n                    crab's hepatopancreas.\n\n          \n          Mixed reaction from the crowd as Ken puts the mic down.\n          He starts to return to his table - when he sees Beth\n          trying to make a sneaky exit. He catches up to her.\n\n          \n\n                                 KEN (CONT'D)\n                    Bethie, your cousin Jay has always been a\n                    jackass.\n\n          \n\n                                   BETH\n                    I know.

You never\n                    did anything the way every one else did\n                    it, and that's what I've always thought\n                    was so great about you.\n\n          \n\n                                 BETH\n                    I'm your oldest daughter, and I'm the\n                    only one not married. If this was\n                    Fiddler on the Roof you'd have to\n                    sacrifice me or something.\n\n          \n          Ken laughs and puts his arm around Beth.\n\n          \n\n                                 KEN\n                    Honey, look. When everyone else was just\n                    going to camp at the Y, you borrowed my\n                    New York Times, found some arts camp in\n                    the Berkshires, wrote away for\n                    information, then got accepted on your\n                    own. You were nine. You never did\n                    things the way everyone else did.\n\n          \n\n                                  BETH\n                    Why not?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                      57\n\n          \n\n          7/20/7                                                   58.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                   KEN\n                      Because that's you.

VERNON ROW HOUSE - DAY\n\n\n          \n          TWO WELL BUILT MEN (SKIP and LARRY) sip from bottles of\n          Volvic water as they wander through a kitchen, inspecting\n          the cabinetry. Conor comes into to frame, wearing a\n          toned down version of his \"gay friendly\" clothes.\n\n          \n\n                                 CONOR\n                    Hello, my name is Conor. Please sign in\n                    whenever you get a chance.\n\n          \n          He gestures to a guest book on the kitchen island - next\n          to which Anna stands. Conor joins her.\n\n          \n\n                                 ANNA\n                    This is insane.

Your friend Mary's a genius.\n\n          \n          The house is TEEMING WITH GAY COUPLES - opening closets,\n          admiring floors, munching on complimentary cookies.\n\n          \n\n                                  ANNA\n                    Alright.

It's awkward. She leaves,\n          Conor tries to play it off, looks around the room.\n\n          \n          Skip and Larry look at him sympathetically.\n\n          \n\n                                 CONOR (CONT'D)\n                    What?\n\n          \n\n                                 SKIP\n                    She's holding out on you, isn't she?\n\n          \n\n                                 CONOR\n                    I'm not sure I get your meaning.\n\n          \n\n                                 LARRY\n                    It's obvious.

Literally.     I'm dying.\n\n          \n          Skip and Larry move closer, Larry grabs a plate.\n\n          \n\n                                 LARRY\n                    Here, have a cookie.\n\n          \n\n                                 CONOR\n                    I just - I have no idea what she's doing.\n                    I cannot read her signals - at all. We\n                    used to sleep together - all the time.\n                    Well, that's not true, I don't know why I\n                    said that, it wasn't all the time. But\n                    it did happen - I know I'm not making\n                    this up. And then, out of nowhere, it\n                    stops. But she still calls, she stops\n                    by, she sleeps on my couch, she wants a\n                    massage, she leaves cute messages - but\n                    it never goes ANYWHERE. I mean, what is\n                    she doing?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                    64\n\n          \n\n          7/20/7                                                   65.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                 LARRY\n                    Honestly - we may not have the best\n                    insight.

Gay or\n                    straight, you're not going to get\n                    anywhere by being inactive. She clearly\n                    likes you - maybe she just wants you to\n                    be a man and do something. So the next\n                    time you're in the position - don't take\n                    no for an answer.\n\n          \n          Skip looks at Larry, concerned.\n\n          \n\n                                 SKIP\n                    That sounds like felonious advice.\n\n          \n\n                                 LARRY\n                    You're right.

I\n                    found him in bed with his big breasted\n                    secretary when I came home early from the\n                    Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel\n                    sorry for him. My second husband was a\n                    pinch more creative. Cheated on me with\n                    my sister - but made me believe that I\n                    was insane for being suspicious. At last\n                    - some intrigue, some mind games - though\n                    my sister's two year old eventually gave\n                    them up. But my last husband -- he was a\n                    gem. A veritable master at covering his\n                    tracks. I poured over his phone records,\n                    intercepted his credit card bills, had\n                    him followed on countless occasions - and\n                    never found a single shred of evidence.\n                    It wasn't until he died that I found out\n                    about the property he owned with his\n                    Austrian mistress. But the real master,\n                    I have to say -- is me. Three husbands --\n                    countless boyfriends, and I haven't been\n                    caught yet.\n\n          \n\n          INT.

They SHOUT over the music.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                      115\n\n          \n\n          7/20/7                                                116.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                  NATTILY DRESSED GAY\n                     This is Conor.

I'm Mary.\n\n          \n           Conor looks at Mary and SMILES. All of the gay men\n           around them start to DANCE. LIKE REALLY, REALLY DANCE.\n\n          \n\n                                  MARY (CONT'D)\n                     It's so great to finally meet you in\n                     person.\n\n          \n\n                                    CONOR\n                     You, too.\n\n          \n           They look at each other.

As everyone freaks\n           around them, they smile and dance in each others' arms.\n\n          \n\n           EXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n\n          \n           Ben walks into the house and looks around - no Janine.\n\n          \n           As he heads to the stairs, he stops in his tracks. At\n           the bottom of the stairs - ALL OF HIS CLOTHES are\n           stacked, neatly folded into piles. He approaches, then\n           sees a CARTON OF CIGARETTES on top of one pile -\n\n          \n\n                                    BEN\n                     Shit...\n\n          \n           - and a NOTE taped onto the carton: BEN - KNOCK YOURSELF\n\n           OUT. - JANINE P.S.

HARBOR - DAY\n\n\n          \n           A beautiful sunny day on the harbor. Anna's song fades\n           out, and the sound of Gigi's voice fades up.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                      116\n\n          \n\n          7/20/7                                                   117.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                  GIGI (V.O.)\n                     Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing\n                     up.

BOAT - DAY\n\n\n          \n           Out on the sparkling water, Neil's boat. As we get\n           closer, we see garlands on the rails, on the bough. Even\n           closer and we see - Beth on the arm of her father. He\n           escorts her down a mini aisle. On the bough of the boat -\n           is a TINY WEDDING. About six guests. And Neil, waiting\n           for Beth at the altar.\n\n          \n\n                                  GIGI (V.O.)\n                     And someday you will meet a wonderful guy\n                     and get your very own happy ending.\n\n          \n\n           INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n\n          \n           Mary sits at her desk, typing on her laptop.   ON THE\n\n           SCREEN: MARY'S MYSPACE PROFILE.\n\n          \n\n                                  GIGI (V.O.)\n                     Every movie we see, every story we're\n                     told, implores us to wait for it. The\n                     third act twist...the man who couldn't\n                     get it together finally figuring it\n                     out...the unexpected declaration of\n                     love...\n\n          \n           Mary hits a button and a box comes up, which reads: ARE\n           YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS MYSPACE PROFILE? Mary\n           clicks \"YES\". MYSPACE PROFILE DELETED appears.\n\n          \n           Then, a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Mary gets up, grabs her\n           little purse, and opens the door. IT'S CONOR. Mary\n           smiles, her face barely able to contain her happiness.\n\n          \n\n           INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n\n          \n           Gigi and Alex sit close on her couch, watching a movie.\n\n          \n\n                                  GIGI (V.O.)\n                     ...the exception to the rule.\n\n          \n           We PAN over to the TV to find that they are watching:\n           SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL. Watts and Keith finally KISS.\n           Gigi can't suppress her smile as Alex pulls her close.\n\n          \n\n                                  GIGI (V.O.)

EDDIE'S OF ROLAND PARK - DAY\n\n\n          \n           Ben heads to the checkout line - holding a six pack of\n           beer and a bag of chips. As he's about to put his stuff\n           down, a PRETTY GIRL gets in line behind him.\n\n          \n\n                                  GIGI (V.O.)\n                     How to tell the ones who want us from the\n                     ones who don't. The one's who'll stay\n                     from the one's who'll leave.\n\n          \n           He lets her go ahead of him. She smiles, takes him up on\n           it. The cashier rings her up, she pays for her stuff,\n           without giving Ben so much as a look. Ben gives his\n           stuff to the cashier, along with a weak smile.\n\n          \n\n           EXT. BUTCHER'S HILL BROWNSTONE - EVENING\n\n\n          \n           From the outside looking in a ground floor window - we\n           can see the living room of the lower apartment. Boxes\n           fill the room - clearly a new tenant moving in.\n\n          \n           Janine enters, carrying two boxes. She opens one, and\n           pulls out the ANTIQUE MIRROR (now with new glass).\n\n          \n\n                                  GIGI (V.O.)\n                     And ultimately, we're not taught the one\n                     thing that could save ourselves, our\n                     friends, our families countless hours of\n                     confusion, despair, and speculation.\n\n          \n           She hangs the mirror, straightening it slightly. She\n           steps back, seems pleased. Then, IN FRONT OF CAMERA walk\n           two people - the CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM down the sidewalk.\n\n          \n           We see it's Anna, walking with a NEW GUY - it's clear\n           it's a first date. They stop at the corner, exchange an\n           awkward hug. As they turn to go their separate ways -\n\n          \n\n                                  NEW GUY\n                     It was nice meeting you.\n\n          \n           Anna smiles - the New Guy turns and heads off. Anna\n           watches him go, and then turns and walks away from us.\n\n          \n\n                                  GIGI (V.O.)\n                     That sometimes the happy ending...is just\n                     moving on.\n\n          \n           Anna walks down the hill, the skyline of Baltimore in\n           front of her.\n\n          \n\n                                   THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's Just Not That Into You\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Abby Kohn\u00a0\u00a0Marc Silverstein\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:26:38.820629"}
