He only used me\n                    for rides, yet I continued to stalk him\n                    for most of 1998. Then there was Don,\n                    who broke up with me every Friday so he\n                    could have his weekends free.

And\n                    the rule is that guys - like Neil - who\n                    are with girls - like me - for seven\n                    years without getting married - are never\n                    getting married.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Beth is serious.

And then\n                    he meets this woman at some church event.\n                    And he told my dad he just had never felt\n                    anything like it before.

I\n                    found him in bed with his big breasted\n                    secretary when I came home early from the\n                    Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel\n                    sorry for him. My second husband was a\n                    pinch more creative. Cheated on me with\n                    my sister - but made me believe that I\n                    was insane for being suspicious. At last\n                    - some intrigue, some mind games - though\n                    my sister's two year old eventually gave\n                    them up. But my last husband -- he was a\n                    gem. A veritable master at covering his\n                    tracks. I poured over his phone records,\n                    intercepted his credit card bills, had\n                    him followed on countless occasions - and\n                    never found a single shred of evidence.\n                    It wasn't until he died that I found out\n                    about the property he owned with his\n                    Austrian mistress. But the real master,\n                    I have to say -- is me. Three husbands --\n                    countless boyfriends, and I haven't been\n                    caught yet.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          INT.
