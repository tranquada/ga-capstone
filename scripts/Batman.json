CITYSCAPE - NIGHT</u>\n\n     The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.\n\n     The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, \n     dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and \n     concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its \n     aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and \n     kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready \n     to burst.\n\n     <u>EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT</u>\n\n     Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic \n     anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned -- \n     long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.\n\n     On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from \n     their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch \n     over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the \n     Gotham night.\n\n     One of them is moving.\n\n     <u>EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT</u>\n\n     The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of \n     big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness. \n     Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high-\n     fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to <u>know</u>\n     each other... with one conspicuous exception:\n\n     A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring \n     straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the \n     main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks \n     over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and \n     now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in \n     the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street.\n\n<b>                              MOM\n</b>               For God's sake, Harold, can we\n               please just get a <u>taxi</u>??\n\n<b>                              DAD\n</b>               I'm <u>trying</u> to get a --\n                     (shouting)\n<b>               TAXI!!\n</b>\n     Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in \n     frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map.\n\n<b>                              JIMMY\n</b>               We're going the wrong way.\n\n     Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys \n     them nervously, gestures toward the subway map.\n\n<b>                              DAD\n</b>               Put that away. We'll look like\n               tourists.\n\n     TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night \n     souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER. \n     The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.  JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks \n     him off down the street and glowers at DAD.\n\n                              DAD (cont.)\n               We'll never get a cab here. Let's\n               cut over to Seventh.\n\n<b>                              JIMMY\n</b>               Seventh is <u>that</u> way.\n\n<b>                              DAD\n</b>               I know where we are!\n\n     <u>EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</u>\n\n     A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of \n     stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath \n     and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them.\n\n<b>                              VOICE\n</b>               Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar?\n\n     The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, \n     acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm \n     uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.'\n\n     MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then \n     move on -- pretending not to hear.\n\n<b>                              DERELICT\n</b>               Mister. How about it. One dollar?\n                     (standing up)\n               One <u>dollar</u>, man. Are you <u>deaf</u>?\n               Are you <u>deaf</u>? -- Do you speak\n               <u>English</u>??\n\n     By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street. \n     Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.\n\n     They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE \n     in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand \n     brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.\n\n     DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick \n     wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across \n     the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's \n     already searching for DAD's wallet.\n\n     MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to \n     snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his \n     gun on JIMMY.\n\n<b>                              STREET PUNK\n</b>               Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't\n               scream.\n\n     The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her \n     face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to \n     shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street.\n\n     The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle, \n     slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.\n\n     <u>EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT</u>\n\n     Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down \n     on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take.\n\n<b>                              NICK\n</b>                     (emptying the wallet)\n               All right. The Gold Card.\n                     (tossing the credit card\n                     in EDDIE's face)\n               Don't leave home without it.\n\n     A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the \n     cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct \n     CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up.\n\n<b>                              EDDIE\n</b>               Let's beat it, man. I don't like\n               being up here.\n\n<b>                              NICK\n</b>               What, scared of heights?\n\n<b>                              EDDIE\n</b>               I dunno, man.

No big\n               loss.\n\n<b>                              EDDIE\n</b>               That ain't what I heard.

Shut up... \n\n<b>                              EDDIE\n</b>               Five stories, straight down. There\n               was <u>no blood</u> in the body.\n\n<b>                              NICK\n</b>               No shit. It was all over the\n               pavement.\n\n     NICK has no patience with campfire tales -- but here on the \n     roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight \n     tingle at the base of his spine... \n\n<b>                              EDDIE\n</b>               There was no blood, man.\n                     (beat)\n               My brother says... all the bad things\n               you done... they come back and\n               <u>haunt</u> you... \n\n<b>                              NICK\n</b>               Listen to this.

You shouldn'ta --\n\n<b>                              NICK\n</b>               Do you want this money or <u>don't</u>\n               you? Now shut up! Shut <u>up</u> --\n\n     BOTH PUNKS FREEZE at the sudden, inexplicable sound of \n     BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS \n<b>     DROP.\n</b>\n     Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a \n<b>     BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.\n</b>\n     EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his \n     throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK \n     FIGURE advances, spreading  its arms. Or rather, its WINGS: \n     GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.\n\n     NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.\n\n     And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate, \n     menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval \n     yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness... \n\n     NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure \n     is knocked bodily to the roof.\n\n     Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He \n     whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --\n\n                              NICK (cont.)\n               I'm gettin' outta here.\n\n     -- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a \n     strange, pre-verbal squeal... \n\n     ... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET, \n<b>     NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.\n</b>\n     Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters \n     out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of \n     the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches \n     for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to \n     the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.\n\n     EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face \n     drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes \n     out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --\n\n<b>     -- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --\n</b>\n     -- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a \n     brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken, \n     weightless puppet.\n\n<b>     THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES \n</b>     NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES \n     past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape... \n\n     A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches \n     forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming \n     now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming \n     figure of the BAT at his heels... \n\n     ... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against \n     the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He \n     has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.\n\n     Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he \n     could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling \n     on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to \n     pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails... \n\n     THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with \n     supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air.\n\n                              NICK (cont.)\n               Don't kill me... don't kill me... \n\n     When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is \n     standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at \n     arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.\n\n     The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               I won't kill you. I want you to do\n               me a favor.\n\n     NICK looks down. Far, far below, CARS wink silently past.\n\n     He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where \n     BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own \n     stricken face.\n\n                              BATMAN (cont.)\n               Tell your friends. Tell all your\n               friends.\n\n     NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves \n     him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually, \n     without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE \n<b>     ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.\n</b>\n     Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over... \n     finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.\n\n     NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow \n     globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:\n\n                              <u>BATMAN</u>\n\n<b>                                                 CUT TO:\n</b>\n     <u>INT. GOTHAM CITY DEMOCRATS' CLUB - NIGHT</u>\n\n     An oversized CAMPAIGN POSTER fills one wall: \"A NEW GOTHAM. \n     HARVEY DENT FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY\". We TILT DOWN to find \n     the man himself, determined, dynamic HARVEY DENT, \n     addressing a crowd from behind his podium.\n\n<b>                              DENT\n</b>               ... it is no longer enough to go\n               after the small-time punks and petty\n               criminals who infest the streets of\n               Gotham City. Crime and corruption\n               must be attacked at the root!\n\n     <u>ANOTHER ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE</u>\n\n     Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery. \n     They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled \n     out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're \n     going to <u>enjoy</u> this.\n\n     Tuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling \n     water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING -- \n     the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has \n     laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up.\n\n     The engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON DENT</u>\n\n<b>                              DENT\n</b>               If elected, my first act as district\n               attorney will be to return an\n               indictment against <u>Boss Carl</u>\n               <u>Grissom</u>!\n\n<b>                                                 CUT TO:\n</b>\n     <u>INT.

The place \n     reeks of money.\n\n     In the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured.\n     Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle \n     with extraordinary finesse.\n\n     In the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, \n     with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech.\n\n<b>                              DENT\n</b>                     (on the TV screen)\n               Together we can make Gotham city a\n               safe place for decent people to live\n               and work and play.\n\n     THE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, \n     turns up four aces off the top.

His features are delicate, almost \n     feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his \n     appearance. He is also absolutely merciless.\n\n     He trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA \n     HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides \n     over in her negligee and snuggles up.\n\n<b>                              ALICIA\n</b>               Anything new?\n\n<b>                              JACK\n</b>               The usual gas.

Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the \n     dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS.\n\n     ECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction. \n     He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the \n     block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered \n     up alongside him.\n\n     ECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it \n     quickly in his coat.\n\n<b>                              JACK\n</b>               You didn't show up.\n\n<b>                              ECKHARDT\n</b>               We had another bat sighting.\n\n<b>                              JACK\n</b>               I'm sure that was vitally important.\n               Listen: things are heating up.\n               Someone is leaking information to\n               Harvey Dent.\n\n     ECKHARDT bristles.

The \n     fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK.\n\n     JACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back \n     full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an \n     all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant.\n\n     By now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows. \n     ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun.\n\n<b>                              JACK\n</b>               Here.

VICKI's off in another \n     group, looking luscious, drawing compliments from big shots \n     and envious, furtive glances from their wives. And, in a \n     corner of the room, all alone in his cheap suit, stands \n     ALEXANDER KNOX -- staring inquisitively up at the ceiling.\n\n     A butler, ALFRED, appears alongside KNOX with a trayful of \n     champagne glasses.

ECKHARDT circulates among his ARMED SWAT TEAM, handing \n     out xeroxed copies of a PHOTOGRAPH.\n\n     The PHOTOGRAPH is a full-face shot of JACK NAPIER.\n\n<b>                              ECKHARDT\n</b>               Shoot to kill.\n\n     <u>INT.

Behind him, JACK'S HOODS are \n     at work on the filing cabinets.\n\n     The SAFECRACKER kills his blowtorch and opens the metal \n     door of the safe, giving JACK a good look at its contents:\n\n<b>                              SAFECRACKER\n</b>               ...

If this place is\n               cleaned out already, what do we need\n               five men?\n\n     JACK shakes his head. His boys are antsy, ready to mutiny. \n     By now it's depressingly obvious: they've been set up.\n\n     Then, as if they needed any proof -- a SIREN blares \n     outside.\n\n     <u>EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - NIGHT</u>\n\n     ECKHARDT'S SWAT TEAM goes wide-eyed as a CONVOY OF POLICE \n     BLACK-AND-WHITES roars into the Ace parking lot. UNIFORMED \n     COPS pile out of their squad cars, relieving the SWAT TEAM. \n     ECKHARDT goes livid as COMMISSIONER GORDON approaches.\n\n<b>                              ECKHARDT\n</b>               What are you trying to do, blow the\n               collar?\n\n<b>                              GORDON\n</b>                     (to SWAT TEAM)\n               You men are dismissed.

ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     JACK and his HOODS ducking out of the office. It's two \n     stories above the refinery floor, accessible by a network \n     of steel ladders and CATWALKS running between the walls.\n\n     Down below, a CORRUGATED METAL DOOR begins to rise.\n\n<b>                              COP\n</b>               Freeze!\n\n     One hood goes into a crouch and OPENS FIRE. Half of his \n     colleagues dive back into the office, looking for a rear \n     exit. The others take off across the CATWALKS.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON GORDON</u>\n\n     standing in the doorway as his MEN rush into the building \n     and take their places behind heavy machinery.

They're almost at the end of the hall when \n     a CAPED BLACK SHADOW steps into their path.\n\n     It stands there, motionless. EXTENDS ITS ARMS -- like giant \n     WINGS -- revealing the yellow-and-black insigne on its \n     massive chest. BATMAN.\n\n     One millisecond later, the shocked HOODS are racing back in \n     the opposite direction.\n\n     THE BATMAN flings a handful of STEEL BALL-BEARINGS across \n     the tiled floor. HOOD I tumbles to the floor and lands \n     hard, losing his breath. HOOD II rolls and pulls a GUN.\n\n     BATMAN hurls a BOOMERANG -- its edges scalloped, like a \n     bat's wing. HOOD II finds his gun hand PINNED TO THE WALL \n     by the twin prongs of the BATARANG.\n\n     THE BATMAN strides briskly toward them, businesslike, \n     taking his time. He grabs a handful of HOOD I's hair, lifts \n     his head off the floor, KNEES HIM IN THE FACE.\n\n     He turns to the petrified HOOD II. CHROME-STEEL TALONS \n     spring out of his fingertips. He strolls past HOOD II,\n     reaching out casually to give him a QUICK NICK on the chin.\n\n     HOOD II slumps against the wall, unconscious.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON JACK</u>\n\n     down on the floor, racing along a wall, THROWING SWITCHES \n     -- anything to create a diversion. With every switch he \n     throws, ANOTHER GIGANTIC MACHINE roars to life. CENTRIFUGES \n     SPIN. HUGE POLYMER EXTRUDERS spit out thick strands of \n     plastic gunk. OVERHEAD CHEMICAL TANKS rotate into place \n     over giant basins.\n\n     JACK SEES a squad of COPS on his tail, moving from machine \n     to machine, keeping covered. He SHOOTS AND RUNS.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON CATWALKS</u>\n\n     BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated \n     walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them \n     starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up.\n\n     BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED \n     HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS \n     HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk.\n\n     HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his \n     ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support. \n     A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He <u>does not fall</u>.\n\n     HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a \n     miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES... \n     planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON COPS</u>\n\n     staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk.\n\n<b>                              COP\n</b><b>               LOOK!\n</b>\n<b>                              GORDON\n</b>               My God... it's <u>him</u>.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON CATWALK</u>\n\n     HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind. \n     BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III \n     with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side.\n\n     He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once \n     through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF.\n\n     Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the \n     HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB \n     UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE \n     STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK \n     to the factory floor forty feet below!\n\n     <u>INT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall; \n     STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking \n     lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting \n     for JACK to make his move.\n\n     No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team \n     -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind \n     a forklift and darts into the adjacent room.\n\n     <u>INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER</u>\n\n     JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the \n     metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out \n     onto the floor in streams. The streams run together... \n     begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE.\n\n     COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last \n     pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK.\n\n     AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet.\n\n     <u>INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER</u>\n\n     COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses \n     out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN \n     FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor.\n\n     JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The \n     cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine, \n     hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE \n     begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate \n     opens on the East River. It's the waste dump!\n\n     Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If \n     JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting \n     shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to \n     his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor.\n\n     JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he \n     does --\n\n     BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! \n     His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in \n     diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The \n     plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT.\n\n     An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm \n     around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED \n     STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK... \n\n<b>                              VOICE\n</b><b>               HOLD IT!\n</b>\n     In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind \n     the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT \n<b>     COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD.\n</b>\n<b>                              HOOD V\n</b>               Let him go or I'll do it.\n\n     BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to \n     himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he \n     strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the \n     back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks.\n\n     All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move. \n     HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he \n     waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range.\n\n     ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his \n     side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the \n     Commissioner <u>plugged</u>.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON JACK</u>\n\n     at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk. \n     He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a \n     supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling \n     black currents of the East River... and freedom.\n\n     He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38 \n     AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor \n     of the catwalk mere yards away.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR</u>\n\n     The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the \n     Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door.\n\n<b>                              HOOD V\n</b>               Nobody makes a move. We go out\n               clean.\n\n<b>                              JACK'S VOICE\n</b><b>               ECKHARDT!!\n</b>\n     ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands \n     poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops \n     ECKHARDT cleanly.\n\n     The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a \n     NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at \n     the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE -- \n     a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE.\n\n     The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor, \n<b>     DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY.\n</b>\n     AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above. \n     JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS. \n     BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers.\n\n     <u>JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE</u>.\n\n     A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized \n     pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE.\n\n<b>                              GORDON\n</b><b>               NO!!\n</b>\n     But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins, \n     totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The \n     COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN \n     into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING \n<b>     ALL THE WAY.\n</b>\n                              GORDON (cont.)\n               Goddammit, we <u>had</u> him. We --\n\n     And suddenly, with JACK out of the picture, all attention \n     focusses on THE BATMAN. COPS reach for their guns, circle \n     warily around him. Cornered now, he backs off slowly, HANDS \n<b>     ON HIS BELT.\n</b>\n                              GORDON (cont.)\n               Hold it right there, Mister.\n\n     THE BATMAN raises his hands in a gesture of surrender. Then \n     -- as the COPS advance -- he flicks TWO TINY CAPSULES onto \n     the factory floor.\n\n     A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. COLORS BURST in a wild \n     pyrotechnic display. COPS stumble backwards, momentarily \n     dazzled, as a THICK WALL OF BLACK SMOKE conceals BATMAN \n     from view.\n\n     A TINY GRAPPLING HOOK rockets out of the dense curling \n     cloud and CATCHES on a catwalk overhead.\n\n<b>                              COP\n</b><b>               LOOK!\n</b>\n     The COPS are firing wildly into the smoke. But it's too \n     late. At the end of a cord, THE BLACK MAJESTIC FIGURE OF \n     THE BATMAN whips upward, rising out of the smoke like an \n     avenging angel -- and DISAPPEARING into the shadowy \n     heights, safely out of range.\n\n<b>                              GORDON\n</b><b>               HOLD YOUR FIRE!\n</b>\n<b>                              COP\n</b>               ...

Although \n     most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA \n     #1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above \n     the orchestra seats.

He doesn't know what to do with himself.\n\n     He looks at VICKI. She's terribly lovely. But despite all \n     that, we can't shake the feeling that BRUCE... would really \n     rather be somewhere else.\n\n<b>                                                 CUT TO:\n</b>\n     <u>EXT.

He's using a smaller towel to dry his \n     hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up \n     figure at his desk.\n\n                              GRISSOM (cont.)\n               Who the hell are you?\n\n<b>                              JACK\n</b>               It's me. \"Sugar Bumps.\"\n\n<b>                              GRISSOM\n</b>                     (recognizing his voice)\n               Jack?\n                     (advancing cautiously)\n               Thank God.

Nearby, ANOTHER MIME \n     reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN.\n\n     SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers.\n\n     VICKI turns to BRUCE.

No go. He's out in \n     the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's \n     just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT.\n\n     He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN, \n     CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. <u>No privacy</u>. He's \n     practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible \n     anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified.\n\n     A BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS</u>\n\n     BODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON BRUCE</u>\n\n     his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood \n     as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza.

VICKI \n     emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the \n     wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him.\n\n     As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS -- \n     with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks \n     up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so \n     desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b><b>               BRUCE!!\n</b>\n     He blinks rapidly.

Every wrinkle on her face is plainly \n          visible.\n\n<b>                              ANCHORWOMAN\n</b>                  Hair spray -- eyebrow pencil --\n                  moisturizing cream --\n\n     -    A LARGE DRUGSTORE.

ALICIA HUNT'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     A BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is \n     at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying \n     pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered \n     cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human.\n\n     In all the city, he's the only person still using \n     cosmetics.\n\n     A DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes:\n\n<b>                              ALICIA\n</b>               Jack? Who was that?\n\n     As he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of \n     ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are \n     unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is \n     COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               Get dressed. We're going out.\n\n     <u>INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - EVENING</u>\n\n     A Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something \n     Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open \n     atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along \n     the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You \n     walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings.\n\n     <u>INT. FLUEGELHEIM - ROOFTOP TEA ROOM - EVENING</u>\n\n     The upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern-\n     filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly \n     matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI \n     enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in \n     hand.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I'm meeting Mr. Wayne.

TEA ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - EVENING</u>\n\n     VICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A \n     WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper, \n     bearing a single word: URGENT.\n\n<b>                              WAITER\n</b>               Miss Vale, this just arrived for\n               you.\n\n     As the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is \n     a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON.\n\n<b>               DEAR V. VALE,\n</b>                    PUT THIS ON <u>RIGHT NOW</u>.\n\n     Unsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find \n     a MINIATURE GAS MASK.\n\n     She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN \n     SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent.\n\n     TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART \n     LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad.\n\n     VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth. \n     Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room.\n\n     <u>INT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN \n     toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS \n     lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold.\n\n     The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open \n     and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his\n     street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT.\n\n     A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are \n     carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a \n     \"CLOSED\" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE \n<b>     CANS OF BLACK PAINT.\n</b>\n     The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with \n     an appreciative eye.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds.\n\n     He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a \n     pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT \n     RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas.\n\n     He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons, \n     pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water \n     lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment. \n     Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING \n     BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed.\n\n     He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's \"THE SCREAM.\"\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               I kinda like this one. Leave it.\n\n     <u>INT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING</u>\n\n     VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as \n     hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark. \n     The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               I think it's safe to take that off.\n\n     VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes \n     the gas mask, tries to gather her wits.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               You're quite beautiful.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               ...

A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry \n     Lewis-style, as he lights the candles.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know\n               who <u>I</u> am. -- Is this your\n               portfolio?\n\n     She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of \n     VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the <u>Globe</u>, at first.\n     Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities. \n     Artier B&amp;W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap... \n               Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye.\n\n     He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               The panic. The bloody skulls. The\n               armless screaming fellows... you\n               know, the <u>atrocities</u>.\n                     (smirking)\n               Somehow, when you shoot it, it all\n               comes out so clean, so <u>lovely</u>.\n\n     VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate \n     the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               I guess I'm just an old cornball,\n               but... I <u>live</u> for beauty.

Kind\n               of a big makeover.\n                     (enraptured)\n               Miss Vale, I finally realized that\n               one man <u>can</u> make a difference. You\n               know the saying. \"In his image... \n               created he them\"?\n\n     VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary, \n     getting more frightened by the minute.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               And you want a --\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               A visual record, yes. A before-and-\n               after kind of thing.\n                     (leaning closer)\n               This could <u>make</u> your reputation.\n\n     Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the \n     impulse. She <u>won't</u> run... not until she gets this maniac\n     on film. She reaches for her camera bag.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               Maybe we should start with a\n               portrait of the artist. People might\n               like to see the face behind the\n               makeup.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>                     (momentarily puzzled)\n               ... <u>Behind</u> the makeup?\n\n     Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened \n     restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse \n     job, he looks practically <u>normal</u>. VICKI must think she's\n     looking at his real face!\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               Oh. Yes. I see what you mean.\n\n     He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very \n     carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then -- \n     suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER:\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               Silly little TWIT -- I can't take\n               you ANYWHERE!\n\n     He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly \n     nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes.\n\n     He obviously wants her to <u>do</u> something, but she hasn't\n     got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he \n     POINTS at the WATER GLASS:\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               Well? What are you waiting for??\n\n     Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS \n     ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE.\n\n     His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked \n     Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to \n     wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE.\n\n     His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the \n     running makeup, he LEERS at her.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               You see, Miss Vale -- that <u>was</u> my\n               makeup.\n                     (leaning forward)\n               What do you think?\n\n     VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I've seen worse. <u>Much</u> worse.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               Strong stomach, huh? I like that in\n               a woman. -- Maybe we can do business\n               after all.\n\n     He seems to have calmed down a bit. It's almost as if he's \n     coming on to her. But just then, a tiny BELL sounds behind \n     them... and a VOICE intrudes:\n\n<b>                              VOICE\n</b>               Jack?\n\n     The JOKER turns. ALICIA steps out of a ROOFTOP ELEVATOR and \n     moves toward them, drugged, wraithlike.

VICKI sighs in relief. BATMAN -- still \n     alert, his muscles tensed -- puts a restraining hand on her \n     arm. He looks overhead, sees a catwalk spanning the width \n     of the alleyway five stories up.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               How much do you weigh?\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               ...

They STOP. They DANGLE IN MIDAIR as the Joker's \n     goons advance. BATMAN wriggles, twists. They lurch upward \n     another few feet -- and stop again. VICKI SCREAMS.\n\n     <u>Her additional weight is too much for the reel mechanism</u>.

Before she has a \n     chance to protest, he LETS GO.\n\n     VICKI rockets upward at blinding speed, shrieking all the \n     way. BATMAN, his cape billowing, PLUMMETS DOWNWARD.\n\n     VICKI slams up into the catwalk and BOBS on the end of the \n     line as BATMAN lands with a loud crash, overturning a row \n     of garbage cans. The GOONS are on him in a flash -- one per \n     limb. Random kicking and flailing. BATMAN manages to slam \n     two GOONS into a wall, but before he can get to his feet --\n\n     -- GOON #3 slams a lead pipe into the back of his skull.\n\n     BATMAN is down for the count. The THUGS dust themselves off \n     and circle around his prostrate form, still wary.\n\n     The LEAD THUG holds his colleagues back, draws his gun, and \n     fires TWO SHOTS, point-blank, at the yellow-and-black \n     INSIGNE on BATMAN's chest. The body jerks.\n\n     They move closer. And stop.\n\n<b>                              GOON I\n</b>               ... <u>No blood</u>.\n\n<b>                              GOON II\n</b>               Jesus.\n\n<b>                              GOON III\n</b>               Wait a minute.\n\n     GOON III screws up his courage and crouches beside the \n     body.

ROOFTOP - ON VICKI</u>\n\n     Five stories overhead, VICKI has pulled herself up onto the \n     roof of the adjacent building. She watches transfixed as \n     the THUGS bend over to remove BATMAN's cowl. But at this \n     height -- and this angle -- she can't see his face. On a \n     sudden impulse she reaches for her CAMERA BAG.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON GOONS</u>\n\n     peering-down open-mouthed at the unconscious face of BRUCE \n     WAYNE. Blood seeps from BRUCE's left nostril.\n\n<b>                              GOON I\n</b>               Well?...

A \n<b>     FLASH GUN EXPLODES OVERHEAD.\n</b>\n     Startled, the THUGS look up. ANOTHER CAMERA FLASH.\n\n<b>                              GOON III\n</b>               Goddam, it's the redhead!\n\n     <u>ON VICKI</u>\n\n     A chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the \n     GOONS OPEN FIRE. She ducks back behind the overhang, holds \n     the camera out over the ledge, and KEEPS ON FLASHING.\n\n     <u>ON BRUCE</u>\n\n<b>     HIS EYES WINK OPEN.\n</b>\n     <u>ON VICKI</u>\n\n     momentarily idle. She's used up her roll. The GOONS KEEP \n     SHOOTING as she reaches in her bag for new film. She finds \n     it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity -- and \n     then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a \n     TELEPHOTO LENS. All the better to see you with, Batman... \n\n     <u>ON THE THUGS</u>\n\n     No response from VICKI. They begin to relax a little.\n\n<b>                              GOON II\n</b>               Did you hit her?\n\n<b>                              GOON I\n</b>               Who cares? Wax that freak.\n\n     They turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes \n     out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL \n     and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas \n     pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened.\n\n     In one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body \n     THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage \n     can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall.\n\n     GOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the \n     way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut.\n\n     Four seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the \n     alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at \n     BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger.\n\n     BRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.\n\n     Through all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised \n     on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH \n     GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl.\n\n     <u>ON VICKI</u>\n\n     She finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons \n     everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up, \n     grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet \n     her.\n\n     VICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S \n     FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the \n     roll, then drops it down her blouse.\n\n     But BATMAN is likely to <u>want that roll</u>. So she straightens \n     her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the \n     alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there.\n\n     It's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI \n     clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous \n     glance over her shoulder every couple of steps.\n\n     Then, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out \n     how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               ... Not even a 'thank you'?\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               Well -- I think you might consider\n               thanking <u>me</u>. You were good as\n               dead.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               That's because you lied about your\n               weight.\n                     (a long pause)\n               Thank you.\n\n     VICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm.\n\n                              BATMAN (cont.)\n               I'll have to ask you for that film.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I just wanted to distract them. I\n               wasn't trying to get a picture of\n               <u>you</u>.\n\n     BATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The \n     telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               Please.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I won't let you have it.\n\n     THE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly.\n\n                              VICKI (cont.)\n               I know you can break my neck and\n               take it. But the Joker's on that\n               same roll. I --\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               The Joker is a murderer. And <u>you</u>\n               were as good as dead. So --\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               Look, I appreciate what you did for\n               me. But this is my job. And I'm\n               keeping those pictures.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               All right, here's a compromise. I'll\n               develop the photos. You keep the\n               Jokers and I'll keep the rest.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               How do I know you won't keep them\n               all?\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               Because I'll take you with me.\n\n     He reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His \n     voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy \n     from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to \n     him.\n\n     Still cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands \n     over a roll of film. The <u>original</u> roll -- not the telephoto\n     shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.\n\n                              BATMAN (cont.)\n               Thank you, Vicki.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               ...

Brushes back her hair, runs one hand \n     delicately along the line of her cheek... \n\n     ... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS \n     into BATMAN's arms.\n\n<b>                                                 CUT TO:\n</b>\n     <u>EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT</u>\n\n     Street level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in \n     his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at \n     the BATMOBILE two blocks down.\n\n     The car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact. \n     But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL \n     OVER the fearsome machine.\n\n     BATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON \n     CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the \n     Batmobile.\n\n     He's about to get <u>towed</u>. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER\n     from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               Shields open.\n\n     <u>EXT.

He takes VICKI in his arms \n     and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING \n<b>     HEADLIGHTS.\n</b>\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b><b>               STOP!\n</b>\n     BRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN \n     and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL.\n\n     SIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible \n     behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's \n     powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL \n     THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph.\n\n<b>                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n     <u>EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT</u>\n\n     A deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on \n     either side. The BATMOBILE roars past.\n\n     <u>INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT</u>\n\n     VICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               ... How long have I been out?\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               Quite a while. I took the scenic\n               route.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>                     (gazing around her)\n               Well, I've certainly enjoyed it.\n               What's that?\n\n     He's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               Garage door.\n\n     <u>EXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</u>\n\n     At the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by \n     underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a \n     SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare.\n\n     Doing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds \n     later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place.\n\n     <u>INT. BATMOBILE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT</u>\n\n     As they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S \n     FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I meant to ask you. Up on the roof\n               -- how did you know my name?\n\n     BATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him.\n\n                              VICKI (cont.)\n               I'm serious. How did you know?\n\n     No reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and \n     SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL \n<b>     LOOMING DEAD AHEAD.\n</b>\n     Wide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE \n     GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON CLIFF WALL</u>\n\n     One second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES \n     ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF \n<b>     AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN.\n</b>\n     The Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL \n     -- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION -- \n     winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern.\n\n     <u>INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT</u>\n\n     We all know this place. Although we haven't had time to \n     acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant \n     penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of \n     blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully-\n     equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the \n     biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for.\n\n     BATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips \n     off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are \n     TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest.\n\n     VICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and \n     picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to \n     examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               What is this stuff? Kevlar?\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               Better. It's not on the market yet.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               It doesn't protect your head,\n               though.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               That's why I wear a target on my\n               <u>chest</u>.\n\n     THE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his \n     futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost \n     flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more \n     carefree, than some guys we could name... \n\n     ... like Bruce Wayne.\n\n     VICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping \n     at millions of dollars' worth of equipment.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               How'd you find this place?\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               Stumbled across it when I was a boy.\n\n     VICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses \n     overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers.\n\n                              BATMAN (cont.)\n               They don't come down here. They're\n               afraid of the lights.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I don't like bats. Not that kind.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               They used to terrify me. But I\n               forced myself to keep coming back,\n               and --\n                     (smiling)\n               -- I guess I became the thing I\n               feared the most. I'll do your photos\n               now.\n\n     He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the \n     kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the \n     roll.\n\n     VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She \n     kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound.\n\n     She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair \n     of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is <u>dedicated</u>.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               Who pays for all this?\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               I have sponsors.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               The computers?\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               I'm running a check on the tainted\n               products. There <u>is</u> a pattern.\n               Beauty products. Personal hygiene.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll\n               <u>all</u> be showing our true faces now.\n\n     She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request. \n     But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               I've tracked all the records. Every\n               shipment, every warehouse, every\n               loading dock. Nothing. No\n               opportunities for tampering. Somehow\n               the Joker is supplying tainted\n               ingredients... at the source.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               Wait. You can just tap into any\n               corporate database you want?\n               Anywhere?\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then\n               I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos\n               are ready.\n\n     He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out \n     the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               You could've killed him, you know.\n               You could have killed the Joker.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               I had to save <u>you</u>, Vicki.\n                     (turning to face her)\n               Here you go. I think I'll let you\n               keep the whole set.\n\n     She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four \n     shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but \n     there's no clean angle on his face.\n\n     VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling.\n\n                              BATMAN (cont.)\n               Care for an autograph?\n\n     He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her \n     with the inscription: \"TO VICKI. LOVE, B.\"\n\n     Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is \n     trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto \n     roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind \n     him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               ... Bruce?\n\n     HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then:\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               Are you talking to me?\n\n     He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a \n     SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw \n     on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing.\n\n                              BATMAN (cont.)\n               Maybe we've had enough for one\n               night. I'll take you home.\n\n     Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the \n     BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his \n     utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE.\n\n                              BATMAN (cont.)\n               Do you want to do it this time?\n\n     VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as \n     he walks over to the driver's side and gets in.\n\n                              BATMAN (cont.)\n               Don't be afraid. I'm here.\n\n     She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the \n     mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP.\n\n     FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after-\n     burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW \n     fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we\n\n<b>                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n     <u>EXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)</u>\n\n     The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE: \n     liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless \n     cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays \n     underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters \n     emerge from the opening of a hit musical.\n\n     In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, \n     his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son \n     BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep, \n     head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.\n\n     THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the \n     sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts \n     an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.\n\n     IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES \n     are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and \n     MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle \n     BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF \n     JOY. And then, without warning --\n\n     A HANDGUN enters frame.\n\n     The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps \n     protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet, \n     begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.\n\n     MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at \n     her throat.\n\n     The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But \n     MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.\n\n     The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.\n\n     The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The \n     pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward \n     the sidewalk.\n\n     A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.\n\n     THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek \n     we cannot hear --\n\n     -- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.\n\n     BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a \n     handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's \n     purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the \n     boy.\n\n     Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his \n     parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny \n     glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around \n     them.\n\n     He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the \n     GUNMAN turns and runs.\n\n     AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-\n     winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics \n     with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped \n     tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.\n\n     There's only one difference. BRUCE's head is turned away \n     from us. <u>We can't see his face</u>.\n\n     And now a HAND enters the frame. Much like the GUNMAN's \n     hand, but feminine, beckoning. BRUCE, hearing his name, \n     LOOKS UP; then, agonized, ashamed, he BURIES HIS FACE in \n     GORDON's side. GORDON gestures angrily at the intruder.\n\n     But the hand keeps beckoning. And ultimately BRUCE turns. \n     <u>Showing us the tear-stained face from the famous photo</u>. A\n     face slack with horror. The horror of his parents' death... \n     and more importantly, <u>the horror that someone would dare to</u>\n     <u>violate this most private and terrible of moments</u>.\n\n     At last we see what BRUCE sees: a WOMAN crouched on the \n     sidewalk nearby. The WOMAN is holding a camera. The WOMAN \n     is smiling prettily at BRUCE.\n\n     The WOMAN is VICKI VALE.\n\n     A FLASHBULB EXPLODES. FILLING. THE SCREEN with its blinding \n     white light, SCORCHING OUT THE IMAGE as a HARSH RINGING \n     SOUND cuts through the silence.\n\n<b>                                                 CUT TO:\n</b>\n     <u>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT</u>\n\n     VICKI AWAKENS. She sits up in bed, tremulous, distraught. \n     The bedside phone is ringing. She reaches for it, but her \n     hand freezes in midair. She knows who's calling.\n\n     Three rings later, she manages to lift the receiver. To her \n     amazement, she finds she cannot speak. Finally, she hears a \n     VOICE at the other end of the line.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE (V.O.)\n</b>               Vicki... ?\n\n     <u>INT.

So we just pretend none of this\n               ever happened. We never met. We --\n                     (frightened)\n               You're going to get yourself killed,\n               Bruce. You know that, don't you?\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               It wouldn't matter much.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I don't understand it. You can do so\n               much good for people. <u>As Bruce</u>\n               <u>Wayne</u>.\n\n     He sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the \n     same argument with himself a thousand times.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               Money makes money, Vicki. The\n               foundation runs itself. -- I'm\n               extraneous to the process.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               You're one man.

She stands \n     up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY:\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               Bruce, at the rate you're going, you\n               can't even save yourself.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>                     (staring right at her)\n               Sometimes... I don't know if there's\n               enough of me left to save.\n\n     VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               Oh, God. I've got to have some\n               coffee or <u>something</u>.\n\n     A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting. \n     Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door.\n\n     VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on \n     his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               Are you expecting anyone?\n\n     She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door.\n\n                              BRUCE (cont.)\n               Who's there?\n\n     THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY.\n\n<b>                              DELIVERY BOY\n</b>               Package tor Miss Vale.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               Set it down by the door. On the\n               left-hand side.\n\n     The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off, \n     tipless, muttering something about \"cheap shits.\" After a \n     moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick \n     up the mysterious package.\n\n     Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b><b>               BRUCE!\n</b>\n     He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets \n     it down on the kitchen counter.\n\n                              VICKI (cont.)\n               It's just like the last time. He\n               sent me a present before he --\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.\n\n     As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds \n     his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a \n     LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then \n     lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               Oh, Bruce.

But it could be rigged.\n               Wait in the next room.\n\n     He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then \n     SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife.\n\n     Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is \n     full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into \n     the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR.\n\n     In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal.\n\n     BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the \n     counter.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               ...

It's going to be this\n               weekend.\n\n     The KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver. \n     Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over.\n\n     <u>INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     ALICIA, in her porcelain mask, on the phone.\n\n<b>                              ALICIA\n</b>               I thought you ought to know -- he's\n               coming for you... \n\n     <u>ON BRUCE AND VICKI</u>\n\n     Faces pressed together as they listen in. BRUCE covers the \n     mouthpiece with one hand.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               Keep her on the line!\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               ... Where are you calling from?\n\n     As VICKI struggles to keep the conversation alive, BRUCE \n     rushes into the living room and crouches beside his LAPTOP \n     COMPUTER. He plugs it in, flips open the screen, punches up \n     a telecommunications program.\n\n     A moment later VICKI enters from the kitchen.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I'm sorry, she hung up.

BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     MASSIVE COMPUTERS click and whir. At BRUCE's prodding, \n     INFORMATION comes up on the monitor: a number, a name -- \n     ALICIA HUNT -- and an East Side address.\n\n     <u>INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - EVENING</u>\n\n     THE SAME INFORMATION scrolls across BRUCE's screen.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               Got it!\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               What now!\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               Hang on. I have to leave a message.\n\n     HE FREEZES. He's heard something in the hallway outside.\n\n     <u>INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     ELEVATOR DOORS open on THREE THUGS. One of them uses a key \n     to lock the car in place on VICKI's floor. The key is on \n     the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys.\n\n     The KEY RING belongs to a DOORMAN, who's riding in the \n     elevator with the JOKER's trio of thugs. He's dead, alas. \n     The THUGS dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall \n     and march toward VICKI's apartment.\n\n     <u>INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER</u>\n\n     BRUCE is nowhere in sight. VICKI is at the sink washing \n     dishes, acting nonchalant. She pretends not to hear the \n     DOOR unlocking behind her.\n\n     She turns -- and faces the THREE ADVANCING THUGS.\n\n<b>                              THUG I\n</b>               Hi, Miss Vale. Let's not put up a\n               fight, huh? 'Cause we'd hate to have\n               to --\n\n     BRUCE steps into the doorway behind them. With a single \n     sweep of the arm, he flings THREE DRUG-TIPPED NINJA WHEELS \n     at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the \n     shoulder, one in the hip. They COLLAPSE in quick \n     succession.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               There's a garage in this building?\n\n     VICKI nods yes. BRUCE -- all business now that he's in his \n     element -- disappears into VICKI's bedroom.\n\n     She peeks around the corner. He reemerges carrying a BLACK \n     NYLON STOCKING, which he stuffs into his pocket. VICKI is \n     full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.\n\n                              BRUCE (cont.)\n               I've got to take him out now.\n\n     He stoops down beside the THUGS and pulls the elevator key \n     off the key ring -- which he then tosses to VICKI.\n\n                              BRUCE (cont.)\n               Pick an apartment and <u>stay there</u>.\n               And listen: call the police. Give\n               them that address. <u>Every available</u>\n               <u>man</u>.\n\n     He starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a \n     dumbfounded VICKI in his arms for a kiss.\n\n     <u>INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING</u>\n\n     THE JOKER'S VAN, bearing the Monarch Playing Card logo. TWO \n     ARMED GOONS lean against the hood. They watch as the \n     elevator opens and an ordinary fellow in a suit steps out.\n\n     BRUCE pulls car keys from his pocket and strolls past the \n     thugs, head down, whistling. As he walks around the van, \n     his hand brushes against it -- leaving a MAGNETIZED HOMING \n     DEVICE, almost too tiny to notice, stuck to the fender.\n\n     He walks another six paces, then stops short. He feels \n     around in all his pockets, making a big show of having\n     <u>forgotten</u> something.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               Oh, hell!\n\n     The GOONS eye him curiously as he strides back toward the \n     elevator. The doors are closing before it strikes them that \n     something is amiss.\n\n<b>                              GOON\n</b>               Hey, boss, something's up. The\n               elevator's working.\n\n     <u>INT. VAN - ON JOKER</u>\n\n     Frustrated, snarling, ready to throw a tantrum.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               DAMMIT! You can't get good help\n               these days. -- Let's move out.\n\n     <u>EXT. STREET - EVENING - OVERHEAD ANGLE</u>\n\n     From high above the street we see the JOKER'S VAN pulling \n     out of VICKI's building. We're up on the roof, with BRUCE. \n     He hits a button on his utility belt, and a RED SIGNAL \n     LIGHT begins to flash.\n\n     BRUCE clamps the utility belt around his waist. Pulls the \n     BLACK NYLON STOCKING over his head. And suddenly, he's \n     BOUNDING ACROSS THE ROOFTOPS in pursuit of the JOKER.\n\n     <u>EXT. CROSS STREET - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING</u>\n\n     The VAN turns right at the intersection. Nothing unusual. \n     But for some reason, PEDESTRIANS are pointing at the sky, \n     staring goggle-eyed at the rooftops.\n\n     Far above them, a MAN -- dressed in a suit, a tie, a yellow \n     belt and a BLACK STOCKING MASK -- is gliding across the \n     intersection on a ROPE.\n\n     <u>INT. VAN - A MOMENT LATER</u>\n\n     The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on \n     either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS:\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               Slow down, you <u>maniac</u>!\n\n     <u>EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING</u>\n\n     As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist. \n     His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just \n     about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING \n     MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands \n     directly behind him on the horse's back.\n\n     BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only <u>one</u> rider. \n     The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through \n     the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off.\n\n     <u>INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below, \n     UNMARKED CARS are converging.\n\n     <u>INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They \n     see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building.\n\n<b>                              DRIVER\n</b>               Boss! Jesus! They've --\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               They'll be sorry. <u>They'll be</u>\n               <u>sorry</u>. -- GET OUT OF HERE!\n\n     <u>EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING</u>\n\n     BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones, \n     drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the \n     FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt.\n\n     <u>EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING</u>\n\n     A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph.\n\n     <u>INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     We can't see the driver. But we <u>do</u> see, on the seat \n     beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the \n     city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect \n     sync with the one on BRUCE's belt.\n\n     <u>EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING \n     TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its \n     hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past --\n\n     -- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE, \n     neatly tied in string.\n\n     BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick \n     salute -- and the BUG is gone.\n\n     <u>INT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING</u>\n\n     The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the \n     southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are \n     everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for \n     the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               MOVE! Can't you <u>do</u> something??\n\n<b>                              DRIVER\n</b>               It's some kind of detour. They're\n               backed up for blocks!\n\n     The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view \n     mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               Oh my God. How does he <u>do</u> it... ?\n\n     <u>EXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n<b>     THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET \n</b>     ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around \n     the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER.\n\n     <u>INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS, \n     RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first \n     opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO \n<b>     GOTHAM PARK ITSELF.\n</b>\n     BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on \n     the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from \n     overhead.\n\n     <u>EXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING</u>\n\n     CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the \n     FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone:\n\n<b>                              EMCEE\n</b>               -- the most spectacular, most death-\n               defying aerial stunt ever devised.\n               Tonight -- for the first time\n               anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS!\n\n     He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying \n     side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS</u>\n\n     ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the \n     twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING \n     GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled \n     red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other \n     in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters.\n\n     <u>EXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL</u>\n\n     PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the \n     crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly.\n\n     On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He \n     lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly \n     against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN -- \n     driving it off the access road down into the brush, where \n     it nearly topples over sideways.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS</u>\n\n     GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair, \n     landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're \n     swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make \n     the return leap back to his own trapeze.\n\n     <u>INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen, \n     compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents, \n     he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's \n     got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase.\n\n<b>                              PILOT\n</b>               Ready to go, Dick?\n\n<b>                              DICK\n</b>               What's all the ruckus down there?\n\n     <u>EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     The VAN bounces over rocks and bushes, narrowly avoiding \n     trees, with BATMAN in hot pursuit.\n\n     <u>INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     At the foot of a hill, the JOKER spies a truck. On its \n     side, in bright red letters, a WARNING: \"DANGER - \n<b>     FIREWORKS. FLAMMABLE LOAD.\"\n</b>\n     The JOKER reaches into the back for a HIGHWAY FLARE.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               Head for the truck!\n\n     <u>INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     Hovering over the chase scene, DICK catches sight of the \n     JOKER. He GASPS IN SHOCK as a LIT FLARE flies from the back \n     of the VAN... directly into the FIREWORKS TRUCK.\n\n     <u>EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - A MOMENT LATER</u>\n\n     THE BATMAN is thrown off his horse by the shock of a \n     massive EXPLOSION. All at once, THE SKY IS FULL of \n<b>     BURSTING, INCANDESCENT COLORS!!\n</b>\n     THE JOKER hangs out of the rear of the van, looking up, an \n     expression of PURE DELIGHT on his face.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               I <u>love</u> fireworks!\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS</u>\n\n     LURCHING AND SPINNING IN THE SKY as FIREWORKS rocket past. \n     One of them takes a dead hit on the rotor. JOHN GRAYSON \n     falls to his death instantly; a moment later, the COPTER \n     plummets into the trees with a resounding, fiery CRASH.\n\n     MARY GRAYSON hangs from the second copter as it bobs and \n     weaves out of control. ONLOOKERS SCREAM IN TERROR.\n\n     <u>EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     THE JOKER'S VAN bursts out of the park and speeds up a \n     wide, cordoned-off avenue. Overhead, THE SECOND COPTER \n     veers wildly, out of the park now, swinging dangerously \n     close to the tall buildings along the avenue.\n\n     <u>INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     DICK GRAYSON at the mouth of the bay, hanging on by a \n     canvas strap.

And then -- before \n     THE PILOT can make a move to stop him -- DICK HAS JUMPED \n<b>     OUT OF THE COPTER.\n</b>\n     <u>ANGLE ON DICK</u>\n\n     With astonishing physical grace, he DIVES. GRABS A \n     FLAGPOLE. Executes a perfect somersault. FLIPS onto a \n     nearby fire escape. VAULTS to the next fire escape down. \n     And LEAPS OUT OVER THE STREET --\n\n     -- MAKING A PERFECT TWO-POINT LANDING on his intended \n     target... THE ROOF OF THE JOKER'S VAN!!\n\n     <u>INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     THE JOKER hears a THUNK overhead.

DICK rises up \n     into a crouch just in time to see a sign which reads \n     \"DANGER -- LOW CLEARANCE.\" He's about to get his head taken \n     off!\n\n     ONE SECOND BEFORE IMPACT a BLACK-CAPED SHADOW swings across \n     the street and SCOOPS DICK OFF THE ROOF OF THE VAN.\n\n     <u>EXT. STREET - NIGHT</u>\n\n     BATMAN AND DICK tumble to the pavement. THE VAN knocks over \n     a fire hydrant and STOPS. DICK is already on his feet, \n     ready to CHARGE THE VAN, when BATMAN throws a powerful arm \n     around his waist.\n\n<b>                              DICK\n</b><b>               LET ME GO!

The JOKER and his HOODS -- guns still aimed at the \n     crowd -- back away and race off on foot, vanishing into the \n     night.\n\n     DICK BREAKS FREE and BOLTS AFTER THEM.

DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps, \n     then climbs out and towels himself off.\n\n     He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable \n     in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could \n     drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order.\n\n     <u>INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY</u>\n\n     An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed.

Without warning, the \n     kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding \n     speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up \n     spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL.\n\n     DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a \n     <u>move</u> or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him.\n\n     A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with \n     a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of \n     motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's \n     chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.\n\n     <u>INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up \n     curiously at the ceiling.

Behind him, hanging back discreetly in the \n     shadows, is his loyal butler ALFRED.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               Where's the boy?\n\n<b>                              ALFRED\n</b>               Upstairs. He's quite docile.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               I know that feeling. It won't last.\n\n     BRUCE takes a moment to survey the Batcave as ALFRED looks \n     on tremulously.\n\n                              BRUCE (cont.)\n               He's a long way ahead of where I was\n               at his age.\n                     (taking ALFRED's\n                      shoulders)\n               I want you to treat him just as if\n               he were me. Promise.\n\n<b>                              ALFRED\n</b>               Yes, sir.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               He'll be taken care of financially.\n               Beyond that... you know what to do.\n               Don't let all this go to waste.\n\n     Their eyes lock for a long moment. ALFRED is unable to \n     speak. Finally BRUCE turns and starts slowly up the long \n     circular stairway which leads from the Batcave to Wayne \n     Manor. On the third step he pauses:\n\n                              BRUCE (cont.)\n               Alfred? -- Thank you.\n\n     As BRUCE disappears up the stairs, a shaken ALFRED steadies \n     himself against a lab table, fighting back tears.\n\n     <u>INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - EVENING</u>\n\n     BRUCE draws the curtains, sets an alarm clock. The current \n     time is 7:09 PM.\n\n     He sits cross-legged on the floor, slumps forward slightly, \n     and closes his eyes. He inhales, exhales, taking deep, \n     regular breaths. His muscles relax. Ten seconds later, \n     BRUCE has plunged into DEEP SLEEP.\n\n     Time passes. The clock shows 7:19, 7:32.\n\n     At 7:44 we TRACK IN on BRUCE's unconscious face, drawing \n     closer and closer until HIS EYELIDS FILL THE FRAME, \n     twitching with the irregular movement characteristic of \n     R.E.M. sleep. Without warning his EYES SNAP OPEN.\n\n     HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the \n     clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with \n     its grating electronic WHINE.\n\n<b>                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n     <u>EXT.

COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie-\n     talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the \n     Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as \n     the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's \n     just another part of the celebration.\n\n     At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a \n     microphone:\n\n<b>                              GOVERNOR GILROY\n</b>               As Governor of this great state, it\n               is now my honor to unveil for you a\n               very special lady -- a lady who\n               stands tall for life and liberty --\n               America's <u>favorite</u> lady...

GILROY hoists a pair \n     of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon: \n     hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the \n     canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face... \n\n     ... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. <u>LADY GOTHAM IS</u>\n     <u>WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN</u>!!!\n\n     Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE \n     SEARCHLIGHTS DIE.

HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS \n     try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another \n     in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT \n     DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb \n     out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR.\n\n     DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED \n     COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS, \n     DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled \n     subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks.\n\n     On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a \n     field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless \n     against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING.\n\n     FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats \n     and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of \n     an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies... \n     only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a \n     SHOTGUN BLAST. <u>THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE</u>.\n\n     <u>EXT.

But on the \n     street itself, a bizarre PARADE is taking place, just as if \n     nothing's wrong. Rumbling up the avenue at two-block  \n     intervals, moored to floats, are DOZENS OF ENORMOUS \n     BALLOONS in the shapes of cartoon characters and historical \n     figures. It's like a hellish Thanksgiving's day procession.\n\n     The LEAD-OFF BALLOON is a gigantic, grotesque CLOWN -- \n     smiling ghoulishly, dressed in white pierrot frills. We \n     TILT DOWN to the FLOAT BENEATH IT... \n\n     ... and there, atop a mountain of roses where the prom\n     queen should be, sits the JOKER -- smiling, waving daintily \n     at the rioters and looters, presiding over the carnage like \n     some demented parade marshal.\n\n<b>                                                 CUT TO:\n</b>\n     <u>EXT.

And then -- A \n     STREAKING BLACK SHADOW ENTERS FRAME, overtaking the TRUCKS.\n\n     THE BATWING! A phenomenal ULTRALIGHT AIRCRAFT, swift, \n     sleek, jet-black and infinitely maneuverable, it SOARS \n     EASILY past the trucks, swooping low just long enough to \n     release a BOMB over a concrete bridge.\n\n     <u>EXT.

PUZZLED DRIVERS climb out of their cabs and \n     wonder what to do next.\n\n     They spot the BATWING in the distance -- banking, doing a \n     sharp 180. For a moment they gape in disbelief. Then they \n     HEAD FOR THE TREES as the BATWING DIVES DIRECTLY AT THE \n     TRUCKS, firing THREE ARMOR-PIERCING SHELLS... and \n     destroying the JOKER's lethal cargo once and for all.\n\n     <u>ANGLE ON BATMAN</u>\n\n     in the cockpit, his jaw set, not even looking back at the \n     wreckage as his plane screams off toward the Gotham \n     skyline.\n\n     <u>EXT.

GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT</u>\n\n     In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea.\n\n     <u>EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT</u>\n\n     THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue, \n     past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the \n     one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear \n     through a CONCEALED HATCH.\n\n     WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE \n     mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the \n     parade decorations. And one moment later... \n\n     A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue!\n\n     <u>INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a \n     burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank, \n     leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops \n     low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he \n     streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range.\n\n     <u>INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR-\n     SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The \n     JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can <u>hear</u>\n     him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons.\n\n     <u>EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     The TANK TURRET swings wildly. A HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE rips \n     through the night, narrowly missing the BATWING... and \n     BLOWING A HOLE in the side of a skyscraper.\n\n     <u>INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     THE BLAST all but knocks the BATWING out of the sky. BATMAN \n     stabilizes the plane, climbs for the clouds. When he's \n     clear of the buildings, he grits his teeth and rolls out.\n\n     <u>He's coming back for more</u>!\n\n     <u>INT.

BROAD AVENUE - ON BATWING</u>\n\n     The black ultralight hurtles down Broad Avenue at full \n     speed, on a suicide mission. MISSILES streak past on either \n     side. MACHINE GUN FIRE peppers the dome of the cockpit. The \n     REAR STABILIZER WING takes a direct hit... and BURSTS INTO \n<b>     FLAME!\n</b>\n     The BATWING, trailing thick black smoke, bears down on the \n     tank like a kamikaze plane. BOMB BAYS OPEN as BATMAN dumps \n     the last of his high explosives DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF \n     THE TANK. The BATWING takes a hard bounce off the top of \n     the tank and CRASHES TO THE STREET.\n\n     And suddenly a GAPING CHASM opens underneath the tank as \n     the bombs go off -- and BROAD AVENUE BEGINS TO SPLIT WIDE \n<b>     OPEN!\n</b>\n     <u>INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     BROKEN CONCRETE SLABS rain down on a SUBWAY CAR stalled in \n     the tunnel DIRECTLY BENEATH BROAD AVENUE. SUPPORT GIRDERS \n     groan and GIVE WAY as the STREET ITSELF COLLAPSES -- and \n     the front end of the TANK drops through, CRUSHING THE \n<b>     SUBWAY TRAIN BENEATH IT!\n</b>\n     <u>EXT. BROAD AVENUE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</u>\n\n     The rear end of the TANK projects out through the rubble. A \n     hatch pops open. The JOKER crawls out through the smoke and \n     pulls himself up to the street.\n\n     He's down to his last three GOONS. He points to the \n     BATWING: bent, broken, WEDGED ON ITS SIDE in the asphalt \n     SEAM running up Broad Avenue -- half in, half out of the \n     tunnel.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               <u>You</u> do him. I'm outta here.\n\n     The GOONS look on in dismay as the JOKER scurries off. They \n     sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the \n     Batwing. Through the cockpit dome they can see BATMAN... \n     inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead.\n\n     A JET OF FLAME drives them back momentarily. They reach for \n     their guns, move in warily... \n\n<b>                              VOICE\n</b>               Yo.\n\n     The frightened GOONS turn in unison. An abrupt flurry of \n     motion -- feet and fists flying -- quick flashes of red and \n     green --\n\n     -- and THREE GOONS lie paralyzed on the street. The only \n     one left standing is a fifteen-year-old boy garbed in a \n     red-and-green aerialist's uniform... DICK GRAYSON.\n\n     <u>INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     BATMAN slumps at the controls. Beneath him, asphalt SHIFTS \n     and BUCKLES. The Batwing lurches to the right, drops a foot \n     or two into the tunnel. Metal braces collapse and the \n     plexiglass dome of the cockpit SHATTERS LIKE AN EGGSHELL.\n\n     TONGUES OF FIRE lick at his face. He's helpless, pinned in \n     place. He manages to look up -- and SEES, through a dream-\n     like haze, A HAND extended toward him:\n\n<b>                              DICK\n</b><b>               HEY! COME ON!\n</b>\n     And suddenly DICK is clambering down into the flaming \n     wreckage. He gets an arm around BATMAN's chest and with an \n     extraordinary effort HAULS HIM OUT OF THE BATWING.\n\n     <u>EXT. STREET - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT</u>\n\n     They stagger across the ruptured street. BATMAN grimaces in \n     agony. His right leg -- shattered -- is like rubber beneath \n     him. His ribs are crushed. He's barely conscious.\n\n<b>                              DICK\n</b>               Now we're even, huh?

He's <u>mine now</u>.\n\n     DICK snatches an abandoned .38 off the pavement.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b><b>               DICK!\n</b>\n     THE BATMAN tries to pull himself erect. The pain is \n     unendurable. His body has finally failed him.\n\n     He collapses on the pavement, powerless to intervene, as \n     DICK races off with murder in his eyes.\n\n     <u>EXT. GOTHAM CATHEDRAL - NIGHT</u>\n\n     A BELLTOWER's jagged spire, jutting up into the night sky, \n     piercing the moon. Down at street level, the JOKER is \n     scrambling up the marble steps at the entrance to the old \n     abandoned cathedral. He pulls a WALKIE-TALKIE off his belt.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               Gotham cathedral. Come and get me.\n\n     HEAVY PANELED DOORS groan on tired hinges as THE JOKER \n     forces his way inside. A beat. Then DICK GRAYSON appears, \n     hot on his trail, sprinting up the steps two at a time.\n\n     <u>INT. CATHEDRAL - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT</u>\n\n     Ancient and creepy. A huge pipe organ, shattered stained\n     glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all \n     forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. The JOKER wanders \n     about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons.\n\n     DICK enters silently behind him. He kneels behind a rear \n     pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off THREE QUICK SHOTS \n     at the JOKER. The JOKER dives, takes cover, and RETURNS \n     DICK'S FIRE. Then: silence.\n\n     In a crouch, groping his way along the wall, THE JOKER \n     finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden \n     stairway, leading to the belltower. He ducks inside and \n     starts up.\n\n     DICK'S GUN drops with a thud. His hand slips from the back \n     of the pew. In the second before he slumps to the floor, \n     unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a TINY BLACK NINJA \n     WHEEL, imbedded in the flesh of his leg.\n\n     Behind him -- framed in the arched doorway -- A RAGGED \n     BLACK GHOST begins his final unholy march down the center \n     aisle of the old cathedral.\n\n     <u>INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT</u>\n\n     A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the \n     wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed.\n\n     The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on \n     the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie:\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               I'm in the belltower. Don't land.\n\n     <u>INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT</u>\n\n     A PILOT replies through his radio headset.\n\n<b>                              PILOT\n</b>               E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on.\n\n     The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc.\n\n     <u>INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</u>\n\n     BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls \n     himself up the steps one at a time. <u>He should be dead</u>.\n     Dried blood cakes his face, his chest.\n\n     Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps \n     against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his \n     utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule \n     back onto his dry, swollen tongue.\n\n     Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and \n     TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten \n     wood of the belltower stairs.\n\n     THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him. \n     And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN \n     MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step.\n\n     It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the \n     fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING, \n     vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell.\n\n     Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away. \n     His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN \n<b>     INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS.\n</b>\n     For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED \n     WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching, \n     trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last \n     ounce of strength.\n\n     The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile. \n     BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it.\n\n     He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility \n     belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making \n     earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at \n     his side.\n\n     THE BATMAN is out like a light.\n\n     <u>INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT</u>\n\n     The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering \n     what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves \n     cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... \n     just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.\n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               ... Batman?\n\n     No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little \n     snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of \n     his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on \n     his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS \n     BATMAN up into the belltower.\n\n     He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. \n     The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- \n     pats his face.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               Batman? Batman?\n\n     THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               I thought you'd be more comfortable\n               here in the belfry.\n                     (chuckling to himself)\n               Before I kill you I'd like to see\n               who you are. Would that be okay?\n\n     BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes \n     and reaches over to undo his cowl.\n\n     BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The \n     JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, \n     moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               Oh my, aren't we pretty.\n                     (brightening suddenly)\n               I know you! You're the rich boy!!\n\n     The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps \n     his hands together in sheer glee.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               My goodness, what in the world made\n               you <u>do it</u>? It must've been\n               something pretty terrible!\n\n     He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               You know, we should've sat down and\n               had us a little heart-to-heart. I\n               bet we would have got on famously.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               Mad... man... \n\n<b>                              JOKER\n</b>               Well now, you're not exactly the\n               picture of mental health, are you.\n\n<b>                              BATMAN\n</b>               ...

Think\n               how many people you've killed by\n               letting me live.\n\n     A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his \n     helicopter approaching in the distance.\n\n     BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his \n     utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins.\n\n     The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens \n     it gingerly.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               I have to do it now, Bruce, but it\n               won't even hurt. Now relax. The\n               bat's in his belfry, all's right\n               with the world... \n\n     He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE \n     reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER \n     is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               Why, <u>Bruce</u>... \n\n     Then he hears ticking.\n\n     Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt. \n     0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds.\n\n     He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR.\n\n     BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch \n     convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.\n\n     BRUCE is wearing a great big Joker smile.\n\n                              JOKER (cont.)\n               <u>IT'S NOT FUNNY</u>!!!\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               No... sense... of humor?\n\n     The JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks \n     better of it and retracts his shaking hand.\n\n     He can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the \n     clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his \n     signal beacon. 0:20 and counting.\n\n     The JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on \n     the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down \n     the stairs in a frenzy.\n\n     <u>There are no stairs</u>. They've collapsed. 0:16 and \n     counting.\n\n     Screaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and \n     makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly \n     overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly.\n\n     <u>EXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT</u>\n\n     The helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a \n     windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD \n     LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air.\n\n     <u>INT. BELLTOWER</u>\n\n     The JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost \n     losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures \n     wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go.\n\n     <u>EXT. BELLTOWER</u>\n\n     A maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves \n     -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of \n     the old cathedral --\n\n     -- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING <u>BATS</u>!!

Six seconds remain. <u>There is still time</u> if \n     he makes his choice now.\n\n     Surrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body \n     working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt.

TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT</u>\n\n     AN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL.\n\n<b>                              ANCHORWOMAN\n</b>               As the details of the Joker's\n               heinous plan become known, a city's\n               gratitude goes out to the mysterious\n               Batman. His whereabouts remain\n               unknown, but Batman -- if you're\n               alive -- if you're listening --\n               thank you.\n\n     <u>EXT. CEMETERY - DAY</u>\n\n     VICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT \n     in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine \n     it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping \n     flowers.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I loved you too.\n\n     As soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she \n     gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes.\n\n     The headstone reads: \"ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987.\"\n\n     <u>INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY</u>\n\n     ALFRED, in his apron, on the phone.\n\n<b>                              ALFRED\n</b>               No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm\n               afraid he's quite unreachable.\n\n     <u>INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY</u>\n\n     The glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized \n     SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling.\n\n     In the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE. \n     Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping \n     him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I don't know why I'm doing this.

Do you love half of me? Or\n               all of me?\n\n     A hard question for VICKI to answer. She thinks it over for \n     several beats, then SMILES... SLOWLY, SADLY.\n\n<b>                              VICKI\n</b>               I guess you did it, didn't you. You\n               saved everyone.\n                     (pause)\n               Almost.\n\n     For a moment he stares deeply into her eyes. Then he pulls \n     her over, takes her in a tight embrace.\n\n<b>                              BRUCE\n</b>               I don't know how to explain this so\n               it makes sense... but <u>you</u> saved\n               <u>me</u>.\n\n     <u>INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - DAY</u>\n\n     DICK GRAYSON stands at the brink of the bottomless pit and \n     looks up at the GYMNAST'S RINGS suspended overhead. He sets \n     his jaw and then -- with only a moment's hesitation -- \n<b>     LEAPS INTO THE VOID.\n</b>\n     His hands find the rings. He launches himself HIGH INTO THE \n     AIR and does a spectacular TRIPLE SOMERSAULT, catching the \n     rings on his way down.\n\n     Exhilarated, he makes a perfect landing on the edge of the \n     pit. 10-point-0. A SMILE OF PLEASURE comes to his lips.\n\n<b>                                                 CUT TO:\n</b>\n     <u>EXT. ROOFTOP - GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT</u>\n\n     A dark, moonless night. LIGHTS OF THE CITY sparkle in the \n     distance. CAMERA DRIFTS across the rooftop, settling \n     finally on the broad back of a BLACK-CAPED FIGURE poised at \n     the edge of the roof, gazing down on the streets below.\n\n     A SECOND FIGURE enters frame. We get a brief glimpse of his \n     RED-AND-GREEN SUIT in the seconds before our EYES TURN \n     SKYWARD... to the SEARING YELLOW SPOTLIGHT sweeping through \n     the clouds. In its center: the VAST BLACK SILHOUETTE of a \n     BAT, wings extended, DOMINATING the night sky.\n\n     We HOLD on the GLARING BAT-SIGNAL as BATMAN and ROBIN \n     vanish over the edge of the roof, plunging down toward new \n     adventures.
