A JEEP, LEBANON - DAY\n</b>\n     And we're in a speeding SOVIET JEEP...  Two men in front,\n     shouldering assault rifles.  HEZBOLLAH SOLDIERS...  And there\n     are three MEN in the back.  A middle-aged Man wearing a tired\n     suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.  And on either\n     side of him, two Men, blindfolded.  The man on one side is in\n     his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled\n     black-leather jacket...  A stocky man, with the edge of a\n     J.D. Salinger character, he's seen everything at least once.\n     But even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here,\n     turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of Arabic music\n     that disappears behind him...  He's LOWELL BERGMAN.  On the\n     other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a\n     voltmeter around his neck, NORMAN.\n\n<b>     EXT. THE BEQA'A VALLEY, BAALBEK, LEBANON - DAY\n</b>\n     The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese\n     village.  It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each\n     carrying personnel armed with AK's and a few RPG's...  And in\n     the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening\n     Lebanese soldiers.  And as the speeding convoy passes a\n     captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with\n     Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are\n     the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah\n     religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah...  And, suddenly the\n     convoy skids to a stop...  And blindfolded Lowell and Norman\n     are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the\n     cloud of dust without sight...  The lanky cameraman is\n     stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men\n     guarding a small stone house, and inside...\n\n<b>     INT. A HOUSE IN LEBANON - DAY\n</b>\n     A round-faced Man in his mid-forties, with large-framed\n     glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a\n     dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table...\n     It's the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from\n     walls.  A Gunman cradling an AK-47 sits in an incongruous\n     purple armchair in a corner.  A torn poster of the Seychelles\n     is on one wall.  Another Gunman stands by a window.  Lowell\n     is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table...\n\n<b>                         THE SHEIKH\n</b>               Coffee?\n\n<b>                         LOWELL\n</b>               Yeah...

A steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse\n     is put down.\n\n<b>                         THE SHEIKH\n</b>               Please to explain, why I should agree to\n               interview...with pro-Zionist American\n               media?\n\n<b>                         LOWELL\n</b>               Because I think Hezbollah is trying to\n               broaden into a political party right now.\n               So you care about what you're thought of\n               in America.  And in America, at this\n               moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a\n               face.\n                   (confident)\n               That's why.\n\n     And we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come\n     here voluntarily.\n\n<b>                         THE SHEIKH\n</b>               Perhaps you <u>prove</u> journalism <u>objectivity</u>\n               and I see the questions first.

He hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold...  He\n     lifts it.  And he sees the Sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone.\n     The house empty.  Only his Cameraman, the lanky man, left\n     there, standing by the door still in his blindfold...\n\n<b>                         LOWELL (CONT'D)\n</b>               Norman.\n\n<b>                         NORMAN\n</b>               What?

Baalbek and the Beqa'a Valley below gold-domed\n     mosques.  A moment of triumph.  He dials his cell phone...\n\n<b>                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)\n</b>               Hello?\n\n<b>                         LOWELL\n</b>                   (into phone)\n               Mike, it's me.

OUT OF FOCUS LAB\n     TECHNICIANS, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset Black\n     woman's birthday...  Half her presents are opened.  Balloons,\n     incongruous, floating above the lab...  And there's a sense\n     that somebody is watching...  And from the waist up, a\n     disembodied figure comes into FOCUS behind a glass partition,\n     as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless MAN in his\n     late forties, watching them...\n\n<b>     INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\n     The office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing,\n     their lips moving.  His hair not yet settled on grey, his\n     face is changing, always interesting.  Born in the Bronx,\n     educated in Upstate New York, he retains little of the accent\n     and much of the directness.  He's JEFFREY WIGAND.  He turns\n     to resume gathering things from his desk...some technical\n     books, a medical text on asthma...putting them in his\n     briefcase.  And as he leaves the office, the silent party\n     like a bizarre mime behind him...\n\n<b>     INT. LOBBY, BROWN &amp; WILLIAMSON BUILDING - DAY\n</b>\n     Briefcase in hand, Jeffrey appears from the elevator from\n     ABOVE, from WIDE and in FRONT, his eyes, frozen pools...  And\n     like a bad dream, a broad-shouldered Man, leaning against the\n     wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable\n     in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel\n     microphone after Jeffrey's passed.\n\n<b>     INT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUSIVILLE - DAY\n</b>\n     Light mottled through trees reflects off the car window...\n     Jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and\n     shadow...down this tasteful, suburban Louisville street of\n     neat houses and manicured lawns...  He pulls into driveway\n     behind a 3 series BMW.  It's a grey French provincial\n     replica...\n\n<b>     INT.

Debbie?\n\n     He looks outside.  A Woman is sitting on the back porch\n     drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine.\n     There's something like a Hockney painting about her against\n     the manicured lawns.  Right now the Woman comes in.  She's\n     pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to\n     wear on your arm.  LIANE WIGAND.

DEBORAH WIGAND is having a severe\n     asthmatic attack...\n\n<b>                         WIGAND\n</b>               Sweetheart, c'mon.

We don't know why yet...\n\n     Deborah's chest heaves.  She's scared.  Jeffrey gets in front\n     of her and talks to her to arrest her attention.\n\n                         WIGAND (cont'd)\n               Here we go.

Now she\n     takes Deborah's hand and exchanges a look with Jeffrey.\n     Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver.\n\n                         WIGAND (cont'd)\n               Okay, baby?\n\n<b>     INT.

And the Man in the suit right then,\n     with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a\n     golf ball...  The ball slamming into the steel net.  And the\n     lights SUDDENLY go out.  The range closing for the night.\n     The \"insect\" comes to a stop.  And it's quiet, dark.  Jeffrey\n     gathers up his clubs.  He crosses, his golf shoes, the metal\n     cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the PARKING LOT.\n     And there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind\n     him.  He turns.  And the stocky Man in the suit, carrying a\n     golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him.\n     Jeffrey comes to the parking lot.  It's empty.  Just\n     Jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car,\n     purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his.  He crosses\n     to his car, getting in...\n\n<b>     INT.

They look at each other.  The\n     Man, in no hurry, lights a cigarette, relaxes.  It's\n     malevolent as hell.  And Jeffrey, suddenly, grabbing a golf\n     club, jumps out of his car...\n\n<b>     EXT.

I\n               constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur\n               indicating I could not in conscience\n               continue with coumarin in a product that\n               we now knew, we had documentation, was\n               similar to coumadin, a lung-specific\n               carcinogen...\n\n<b>                         MIKE WALLACE\n</b>               And you sent the document forward to\n               Sandefur?\n\n<b>                         WIGAND\n</b>               I sent the document forward to Sandefur.\n               I was told that we would continue to work\n               on a substitute, we weren't going to\n               remove it as it would impact sales, and\n               that that was his decision.\n\n<b>                         MIKE WALLACE\n</b>               In other words, you were charging\n               Sandefur and Brown &amp; Williamson with\n               ignoring health considerations\n               <u>consciously</u>...\n\n<b>                         WIGAND\n</b>               Most certainly.\n\n<b>                         MIKE WALLACE\n</b>               And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of\n               Brown &amp; Williamson had you fired.  And\n               the reason he gave you?\n\n<b>                         WIGAND\n</b>               Poor communication skills.\n\n<b>                         MIKE WALLACE\n</b>               And, do you wish you hadn't come forward?\n               You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?\n\n<b>                         WIGAND\n</b>               Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't\n               done it.  There are times I feel\n               compelled to do it.  If you asked me\n               would I do it again?  Do I think it's\n               worth it?

And all she\n     really wants him to do is say, \"I need you...\"  But he\n     can't...  And like ships that pass in the night, nothing's\n     said.  It's quiet.

He passes a small\n     Filipino Woman in a nurse's uniform and a Man in clerical\n     garb, who hands him a small American Flag, asking for\n     donations.  And, now, he passes through the metal detector.\n     He nods thanks and walks towards us, relaxing, looking behind\n     every so often to see if anybody is following him.
