Check this address:\n                 1537 Paper Street.  You'll find the\n                 body of Robert Paulson buried in the\n                 garden.

Paraffin is iffy at best.\n\n     Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts\n     pacing.  Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.\n\n<b>                             TYLER\n</b>                 Damn it!

He reaches\n     into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.\n\n<b>                             TYLER\n</b>                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)\n                 ... Codename Rooster.

The GUN is knocked away.  Jack\n     STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles\n     off...\n\n     Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it.  Tyler's getting to\n     his feet, sees the gun, annoyed.  Jack stands.\n\n<b>                             TYLER\n</b>                 Haven't we already done this?\n\n     Jack SHOOTS TWICE.  Bullets pass right thorough Tyler.\n     Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the\n     floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.\n\n<b>                             JACK\n</b>                       (pointing)\n                 How'd you do that?!

There's no walkie-\n     talkie there.  Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE\n     CRUSHED under his own foot.\n\n<b>                             JACK\n</b>                 Oh...

His eyes bulge.\n     BLOOD flies out from his head.  The WINDOW behind him\n     SHATTERS.  SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts.\n\n     RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack...\n\n     Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...\n\n<b>                             TYLER\n</b>                 What's that smell... ?\n\n     Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls...\n\n     Tyler hits the ground.  The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN\n     OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.\n\n     Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room,\n     moving forward to Jack.  TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.\n\n<b>                             TALL SPACE MONKEY\n</b>                 Are you all right, sir... ?!\n\n     Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole\n     blown in his CHEEK.

Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.\n\n<b>                             JACK\n</b>                 Get to the rendezvous point.

Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES\n     into a massive cloud of dust.  Jack and Marla are\n     silhouetted against the SKYLINE.  Jack looks to Marla,\n     reaches to take her hand.\n\n<b>                             JACK\n</b>                 I'm sorry... you met me at a very\n                 strange time in my life.\n\n     Marla looks at him.  ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES\n     inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER...\n\n     The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING\n     SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING\n     BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS.  Then, the IMPLODING\n     BUILDING again.
