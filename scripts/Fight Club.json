SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT\n\n     TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand\n     holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.\n     Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.\n\n     They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler\n     is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a\n     dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 One minute.\n                       (looking out window)\n                 This is the beginning.  We're at\n                 ground zero.

For a second,\n                 I totally forgot about Tyler's whole\n                 controlled demolition thing and I\n                 wondered how clean this gun is.\n\n     Tyler checks his watch.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 It's getting exciting now.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 That old saying, how you always hurt\n                 the one you love, well, it works both\n                 way.\n\n     Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 We have front row seats for this\n                 Theater of Mass Destruction.

In two minutes, primary\n                 charges will blow base charges, and\n                 those buildings will be reduced to\n                 smoldering rubble.

It's pressed against TWO LARGE\n     BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is\n     engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Bob had bitch tits.\n\n     PULL BACK to wide on...\n\n     INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.\n     Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: \"REMAINING MEN TOGETHER.\"\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 This was a support group for men with\n                 testicular cancer.  The big moosie\n                 slobbering all over me was Bob.\n\n                             BOB\n                 We're still men.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Six months ago, Bob's testicles were\n                 removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He\n                 developed bitch tits because his\n                 testosterone was too high and his\n                 body upped the estrogen.  That was\n                 where my head fit -- into his huge,\n                 sweating tits that hung enormous, the\n                 way we think of God's as big.\n\n                             BOB\n                 They're gonna have to open my pec's\n                 again to drain the fluid.\n\n     Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.\n\n                             BOB\n                 Okay.  You cry now.\n\n     Jack looks at Bob.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.\n\n     INT.

COPY ROOM - DAY\n\n     Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup\n     sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 With insomnia, nothing is real.\n                 Everything is far away.  Everything\n                 is a copy of a copy of a copy.\n\n     Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.\n     Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.\n\n     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME\n\n     Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the\n     floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 When deep space exploration ramps up,\n                 it will be corporations that name\n                 everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere.\n                 The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet\n                 Starbucks.\n\n     Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks\n     cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.\n\n                             BOSS\n                 I'm going to need you out-of-town a\n                 little more this week.

Must've had his\n                 grande latte enema.\n\n                             BOSS\n                 Here are your flight coupons.  Call\n                 me from the road if there are any\n                 snags.  Your itinerary...\n\n     Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.\n\n     INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT\n\n     Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips\n     through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy\n     magazines and other catalogs nearby.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Like everyone else, I had become a\n                 slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (into phone)\n                 Yes.

PAN OVER to wall...\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Even the Vild hall clock of\n                 galvanized steel, resting on the\n                 Klipsk shelving unit.\n\n     The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I would flip through catalogs and\n                 wonder, \"What kind of dining set\n                 defines me as a person?\"  We used to\n                 read pornography.  Now it was the\n                 Horchow Collection.\n\n     A dining room set APPEARS.  Jack, the cordless phone still\n     glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.\n\n                             JACK\n                 No, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that\n                 sounds nice.  Apricot.\n\n     Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I had it all.  Even the glass dishes\n                 with tiny bubbles and imperfections,\n                 proof they were crafted by the\n                 honest, simple, hard-working\n                 indigenous peoples of wherever.\n\n     He rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically\n     empty.  Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses\n     a butter knife to eat it.\n\n     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who\n     studies him with bemusement.\n\n                             INTERN\n                 No, you can't die of insomnia.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Maybe I died already.

FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all\n     listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The SPEAKER\n     has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.\n\n                             SPEAKER\n                 I... wanted three kids.  Two boys and\n                 a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and\n                 one boy.  We never could agree on\n                 anything.\n\n     The Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to\n     lighten the mood.\n\n                             SPEAKER\n                 Well, she had her first child a month\n                 ago, a girl, with her new husband...\n                 And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her,\n                 because she deserves...\n\n     The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.\n\n     Jack watches.  A couple of the men go up to the speaker,\n     comforting him, leading him away.  A LEADER takes the stand.\n\n                             LEADER\n                 Everyone, let's thank Thomas for\n                 sharing himself with us.\n\n     Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:\n\n                             EVERYONE\n                       (in unison)\n                 Thank you, Thomas.\n\n                             LEADER\n                 I look around this room and I see a\n                 lot of courage.  And it gives me\n                 strength.  We give each other\n                 strength.\n\n     Jack looks around.  Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.\n     Jack squirms in his seat.\n\n                             LEADER\n                 It's time for the one-on-one.  Let's\n                 follow Thomas's example and open\n                 ourselves.\n\n     Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.\n     Jack stands, uncomfortable.\n\n                             LEADER\n                 Can everyone find a partner?\n\n     Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack,\n     shuffling his feet.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 The big moosie, his eyes already\n                 shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees\n                 together, invisible steps.\n\n     Bob takes Jack into an embrace.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You\n                 know that chest expansion program you\n                 see on TV?  That was his idea.\n\n                             BOB\n                 ...using steroids.  I was a juicer.\n                 Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for\n                 racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm\n                 bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids\n                 won't return my calls...\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Strangers with this kind of honesty\n                 make me go a big rubbery one.\n\n     Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder\n     and completely covering Jack's face.  After a long beat of\n     crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.\n\n                             BOB\n                 Go ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry.\n\n     They look at each other.  Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Then... something happened.

The walls\n                 were solid concrete.  A foot of\n                 concrete is important when your next-\n                 door neighbor lets her hearing aid go\n                 and has to watch game shows at full\n                 volume...\n\n     The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the\n     building.  A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-\n     OUT SECTION of the fifteenth floor.  FIRETRUCKS, POLICE CARS\n     and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 -- Or when a volcanic blast of debris\n                 that used to be your furniture and\n                 personal effects blows out your floor-\n                 to-ceiling windows and sails flaming\n                 into the night.\n\n     EXT.

Jack starts for the elevator.\n\n                             DOORMAN\n                 There's nothing up there.\n\n     Jack presses the button.

His feet CRUNCH glass.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 How embarrassing.\n\n                             DOORMAN\n                 Do you have somebody you can call?\n\n     Jack comes to his REFRIGERATOR lying on its side.

Seventeen-hundred square feet\n                 with high ceilings, for days and days.\n\n     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING\n\n     Jack replaces the receiver.  He pockets Marla's number, digs\n     out a small FILOFAX.  He flips through the pages for phone\n     numbers and addresses.  Most of the pages are blank.\n\n                             DOORMAN\n                 Many young people feel trapped and\n                 desperate.\n\n     INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Then, the refrigerator's compressor\n                 could have clicked on...\n\n     Click.

It\n     RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.  Jack sighs and hangs up the\n     phone.

PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT\n\n     Jack, in the foreground, FACES CAMERA.  In the BACKGROUND,\n     Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual FRAMES cut from\n     movies.  Near him, a PROJECTOR rolls film.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Tyler was a night person.  He\n                 sometimes worked as a projectionist.\n                 A movie doesn't come in one big reel,\n                 it's on a few.  In old theaters, two\n                 projectors are used, so someone has\n                 to change projectors at the exact\n                 second when one reel ends and\n                 another reel begins.

SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n\n     Jack turns and WE PAN to Tyler, standing by a CART with a\n     giant SOUP TUREEN.  His hands are at his open fly and he's\n     in position to piss into the soup.\n\n                             JACK\n                 He was the guerrilla terrorist of the\n                 food service industry.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Don't watch.

Tyler punches Jack in the stomach.  Tyler and\n     Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  They breathe heavier,\n     drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.\n\n     EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER\n\n     Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights\n     on the nearby freeway.  Their eyes are glazed with endorphin-\n     induced serenity.

Well, I knew\n                 him, till I was six.  He went and\n                 married another woman, had more kids.\n                 Every six years or so he'd do it\n                 again -- new city, new family.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 He was setting up franchises.  My\n                 father never went to college, so it\n                 was really important that I go.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I know that.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 After I graduated, I called him long\n                 distance and asked, \"Now what?\"  He\n                 said, \"Get a job.\"  When I turned\n                 twenty-five, I called him and asked,\n                 \"Now what?\"  He said, \"I don't know.\n                 Get married.\"\n\n                             JACK\n                 Same here.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 A generation of men raised by women.\n                 I'm wondering if another woman is the\n                 answer we really need.\n\n     Another pause.  Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.\n\n                             JACK\n                 We should do this again sometime.\n\n     Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.\n\n     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT\n\n     A street sign: \"PAPER STREET.\"  A PAPER MILL stis on one\n     side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other.  The rest of the\n     land is grass and weeds.  It's a grand, old three-story,\n     long abandoned.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Where's your car?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What car?\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I don't know how Tyler found the\n                 house, but he'd been there for half\n                 a year.\n\n     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT\n\n     Tyler leads Jack through the FRONT DOOR...\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 It looked like it was waiting to be\n                 torn down.  Most of the windows were\n                 boarded up.\n\n     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER\n\n     Tyler and Jack climb CREAKY STAIRS to the 2ND FLOOR LANDING.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 None of the doors locked.  The stairs\n                 were ready to collapse.  I didn't\n                 know if he owned it or he was\n                 squatting.\n\n     Tyler opens the door to a ROOM...\n\n     INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Jack enters, stis on the creaky BED.  Dust drifts upwards.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Neither would have surprised me.\n\n     INT. SHOWER - MORNING\n\n     Jack turns on the water.  LOUD VIBRATIONS from the walls.\n     Water spits in starts.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing\n                 leaked.  Turning on a light meant\n                 another light in the house went out.\n\n     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n     All the tavern's lights are off.  Tyler and Jack FIGHT.\n     FIVE GUYS stand around watching.\n\n     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n     Jack, his face showing NEW BRUISES AND CUTS, makes coffee\n     with a wire-mesh strainer.  Tyler shuffles in, wearing a\n     flannel bathrobe.  He spears pieces of bread on a fork,\n     starts roasting them over a burner.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 There were no neighbors.  Just\n                 warehouses and the paper mill.  The\n                 fart smell of steam, the hamster cage\n                 smell of wood chips.\n\n     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Jack sits watching as Tyler SWINGS an old GOLF CLUB --\n     THWACK -- sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 At night, Tyler and I were alone for\n                 half a mile in every direction.\n\n     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n     All the lights are off.  TEN GUYS YELL, standing around Jack\n     and Tyler, who FIGHT.  THREE CARS are parked in the lot.\n\n     INT. BASEMENT - DAY\n\n     Jack sits on basement stairs, watching as Tyler, knee-deep\n     in water, works at an open FUSEBOX, flipping breakers in a\n     certain order, showing Jack how it's done.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 When it rained, we had to kill the\n                 power.  By the end of the first\n                 month, I didn't care about TV.  I\n                 didn't mind the warm, stale\n                 refrigerator.\n\n     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     CANDLES BURN.  Tyler and Jack are seated across from each\n     other on the buckled floor, reading MAGAZINES.  Rain DRIPS\n     from the ceiling.  No furniture.  THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 The previous occupant had been a bit\n                 of a shut-in.\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (of magazine)\n                 Hum.\n\n                             JACK\n                 What?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Oh, a new riot control grenade...\n                       (reading)\n                 \"...the successful combination of\n                 concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash-\n                 blasts and simultaneous high-velocity\n                 disbursement of...blah, blah, blah...\"\n\n     Tyler begins RIPPING the ARTICLE from his magazine.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (\"Reader's Digest\")\n                 \"I am Joe's Lungs.\"  It's written in\n                 first person.  \"Without me, Joe could\n                 not take in oxygen to feed his red\n                 blood cells.\"  There's a whole\n                 series -- \"I am Joe's Prostate.\"\n\n                             TYLER\n                 \"I get cancer, and I kill Joe.\"\n\n     Tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles,\n     chooses another magazine.\n\n                             JACK\n                 What are you reading?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Soldier of Fortune.

In the background are EIGHT PARKED CARS.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I should have been haggling with my\n                 insurance company.  I should have\n                 been looking for a new condo...\n\n     EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n     Jack walks along.  He stops, looking at a CHURCH with\n     SUPPORT-GROUP-PEOPLE milling around the entrance, drinking\n     coffee and sodas.  Marla's there, amongst them, smoking.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 .... I should have been upset about\n                 my nice, neat, flaming little shit.\n\n     Jack's face shows no reaction.  He continues to walk.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 But I wasn't.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n     Jack, in work clothes, interlocks his fingers and POPS his\n     knuckles, picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips.  Tyler,\n     in waiter's uniform, comes to have Jack straighten his tie.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Most of the week, we were Ozzie and\n                 Harriet.\n\n     Jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday\n                 night...\n\n     EXT.

Walter's next SLIDE: a\n     COMPUTER SCREEN.\n\n                             WALTER\n                 The basic premise of cyber-netting\n                 your office is -- make things more\n                 efficient.\n\n                             BOSS\n                 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?\n\n                             WALTER\n                 Absolutely.\n\n     Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's V.O.:\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Walter, the Microsoft account exec.\n                 Walter, with his smooth, soft hands.\n                 Maybe he was thinking about the free-\n                 range potluck he'd been to last\n                 weekend, or his church-group car-wash\n                 fund-raiser.  Or, probably not.\n\n     Walter moves to Jack and slaps him in the shoulder.\n\n                             WALTER\n                 I showed this already to my man here.\n                 You liked it, didn't you?\n\n     Jack smiles.

LOU'S TAVERN - SAME\n\n     The men, including Jack and Tyler, enter and stand against\n     the back wall, waiting.  The bartender, IRVINE, calls out:\n\n                             IRVINE\n                 Drink up people.  We're closing.\n\n     Irvine flicks on the LIGHTS.  Drunken customers squint and\n     get the message.  They plop down money, leaving.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 It was right in everyone's face.\n                 Tyler and I just made it visible.\n\n     Irvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power.  Members\n     of the waiting army begins to share secret looks.  Finally,\n     one buy locks the door.  Two other guys close the blinds.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 It was on the tip of everyone's\n                 tongue.

Everyone brims with\n     eagerness, but tries to act cool.  CHATTER gets LOUDER.\n     Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Every week, Tyler gave the rules that\n                 he and I decided.\n\n     PEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER\n     DIES.  A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 The first rule of fight club is --\n                 you don't talk about fight club.  The\n                 second rule of fight club is -- you\n                 don't talk about fight club.  The\n                 third rule of fight club is -- when\n                 someone says \"stop\" or goes limp, the\n                 fight is over.  Fourth rule is --\n                 only two guys to a fight.  Fifth\n                 rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth\n                 rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  Seventh\n                 rule -- fights go on as long as they\n                 have to.  And the eighth and final\n                 rule -- if this is your first night\n                 at fight club, you have to fight.\n\n     Tyler steps back.  A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN\n     take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --\n                 couldn't remember whether you ordered\n                 pens with blue ink or black ink ...\n\n     The two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES...\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 But Ricky was a god for ten minutes\n                 last week when he trounced an actuary\n                 twice his size.\n\n     Harder, faster PUNCHES between the two.

The two of them briefly make eye contact.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Who you were in fight club is not who\n                 you were in the rest of the world.\n\n     INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY\n\n     Jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light.\n     He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an\n     apron, push a supply cart.  Ricks nods at Jack.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 You weren't alive anywhere like you\n                 were there.  But fight club only\n                 exists in the hours between when\n                 fight club starts and when fight club\n                 ends.\n\n     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Jack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from\n     his mouth with a handkerchief.

You can deal with anything.\n\n                             BOSS\n                 Have you finished those reports?\n\n                             JACK\n                       (handing him reports)\n                 Yes.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 The people who had power over you\n                 have less and less.\n\n     Jack looks at Boss.

As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back,\n     Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS...\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 We all started seeing things\n                 differently.  Wherever we went.\n\n     They hold hand grips.  Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a\n     CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I felt sorry for all the guys packing\n                 into gyms, trying to look like what\n                 Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said\n                 they should.\n\n     Tyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Self-improvement is masturbation.\n                 Self-destruction is the answer.\n\n     A MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes.  The\n     Man takes a handle, close by.  Jack's pissed, staring at the\n     man, who stares back.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (to Tyler, so the\n                        Man can hear)\n                 You could take him.\n\n     Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man.\n     Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 The trick is not to care.\n\n     Tyler stares forward.\n\n     INT.

The\n     surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them...\n\n     Tyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips\n     his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him.  Tyler\n     turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN...\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n     Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach --\n     brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw.\n     Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.\n\n     Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching\n     appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Fight club wasn't about winning or\n                 losing.  It wasn't about words.\n\n     The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack\n     snakes his arm into a counter headlock.  They wrestle like\n     wild animals.  The crowd CHEERS maniacally.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 They hysterical shouting was in\n                 tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.\n\n     Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER.\n     The Opponent SMASHES Jack's head to the floor, over and over.\n\n                             JACK\n                 ... stop...\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 When the fight was over, nothing was\n                 solved, but nothing mattered.\n\n     Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  Tyler pushes\n     through the crowd.  Others lift Jack up.  They turn their\n     attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face --\n     similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Cool.\n\n     Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.\n\n                             OPPONENT\n                 How about next week?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Look at me.

I've\n                 never heard a woman talk like that...\n\n     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\n\n     Tyler smokes, post-coital.  Marla puts her lips to his ear.\n\n                             MARLA\n                       (whispering)\n                 I want to have your abortion.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)\n\n     Tyler laughs, shakes his head.  Jack's gripping his Reader's\n     Digest just a little too tight.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 How could Tyler not go for that?\n                 Night before last, he was splicing\n                 sex organs into \"Little Mermaid.\"\n\n     Tyler sits, studies Jack's face.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You're okay with this?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I'm fine.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Put a gun to my head and paint the\n                 wall with my brains.\n\n     Tyler smokes.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay\n                 away from that one.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Oh, and my pace is more librarians.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Hey... don't knock librarians.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Marla doesn't need a lover.  She\n                 needs a case worker.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 She needs an exorcist.  This isn't\n                 love.  This is sport-fucking.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 She'd invaded my support groups, now\n                 she's invading my home.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Listen... do me a favor... sit here\n                 a minute...\n\n     Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it.  Jack puts\n     down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair.\n\n                             JACK\n                 What?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You've gotta understand something\n                 about me.  I have a little rule,\n                 okay?  Don't ever talk to her about\n                 me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind\n                 of shit.\n\n     Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 If you ever say anything about me or\n                 about what happens here in this\n                 house, to her or anyone -- I will\n                 find out.  And you'll never see me\n                 again.  Promise me.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Okay.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Promise you won't.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Yes, I promise.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Promise?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I said I promise!\n\n                             TYLER\n                 That was three times you promised.\n\n     Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves.  Jack sits smoldering.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 If only I had wasted a couple of\n                 minutes and gone to watch Marla die,\n                 none of this would have happened.\n\n     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Jack watches TV at HIGH VOLUME.  SOUNDS of SEX from upstairs.\n\n     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Jack lies calmly on his bed, staring at the ceiling.  Sounds\n     of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall.\n\n                             MARLA'S VOICE\n                       (muffled through wall)\n                 Miserable fucking discharge!\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I could've moved to another room, one\n                 on the third floor -- so I wouldn't\n                 have heard them.  But I didn't.\n\n     INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     SOUNDS of RAIN.  Jack flips FUSES off, then walks upstairs.\n\n     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME\n\n     Jack walks, HEARS Marla SCREAM in orgasm.  He reaches the\n     landing.  Tyler's door is ajar.  Jack peeks in...\n\n     Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed.  The door PUSHES OPEN\n     WIDER -- Tyler, naked, stands CLOSE TO CAMERA.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What are you doing?\n\n     Jack steps back.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I... uh... just going to bed.\n\n     Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You want to finish her off?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Uh... nah...\n\n     Jack continues toward his room.\n\n     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Jack brushes his teeth.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I became the calm, little center of\n                 the world.  I was the Zen master.\n\n     CLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR\n\n     Haiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font.\n\n                              \"Worker bees can leave\n                               Even drones can fly away\n                               The queen is their slave\"\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I wrote little haiku poems.\n\n     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD.  He sits\n     in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I faxed them around to everyone.\n\n     He hits \"SEND,\" gets the \"ERROR CHIME\" SOUND.  He presses\n     this key over and over.  Boss enters.\n\n                             BOSS\n                 Is that your blood?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Some of it, yes.\n\n     Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.\n\n                             BOSS\n                 Take the rest of the day off.  Come\n                 back tomorrow with clean clothes.\n                 Get yourself together.\n\n     INT. HALLWAY - SAME\n\n     Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS\n     who coldly stare at him.  His face is totally passive.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I got right in everyone's hostile\n                 little face.  Yes, these are bruises\n                 from fighting.  I'm comfortable with\n                 them.  I am enlightened.\n\n     EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET\n\n     Jack walks toward the HOUSE.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 You give up the condo life, give up\n                 all your flaming worldly possessions,\n                 go live in a dilapidated house in the\n                 toxic waste part of town...\n\n     INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET\n\n     Jack walks in.  SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA\n     from upstairs.  Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 ... and you come home to this.\n\n                             TYLER'S VOICE\n                       (laughing)\n                 You fucking slut!!\n\n                             MARLA'S VOICE\n                 Thank you, sir, may I have another!\n                 Thank you sir, may I have another... !\n\n     Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants.  He runs water in\n     the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood\n     stains.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers it.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Yeah.  Speaking.\n\n     INTERCUT WITH...\n\n     INT.

The gas,\n                 it seems, was just a detonator.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Who do you think could've done this?\n\n                             DETECTIVE STERN\n                 I'll ask the questions, son.\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (whispering in Jack's ear)\n                 Tell him...\n\n     Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler\n     standing right next to him.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Huh?\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (overlap w/below)\n                 \"The liberator who destroyed my\n                 property has re-aligned my paradigm\n                 of perception.\"\n\n                             JACK\n                 Shhhhhh!\n                       (into phone,\n                        overlap w/above)\n                 I don't know what to make of this,\n                 sir, I really don't...\n\n                             DETECTIVE STERN\n                 Do you know anyone who'd have the\n                 expertise or motive to do something\n                 like this?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 \"I reject the basic assumptions of\n                 civilization, including material\n                 possession.\"\n\n     Jack pushes Tyler away, cups the receiving.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (into phone)\n                 No.  No, sir.

You\n                 could be beautiful, rich and famous.\n\n     Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants.  Marla's\n     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs...\n\n     Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing\n     water.  He turns, sees Marla enter.  Tyler is GONE.  Marla\n     lights a cigarette.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Except for their humping, Tyler and\n                 Marla were never in the same room.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 I got this dress at a thrift store\n                 for one dollar.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (keeps scrubbing)\n                 Worth every penny.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 My parents pulled this exact act for\n                 years -- one came in, the other\n                 disappeared.\n\n     Marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to\n     Jack.

Someone\n                 loved it intensely for one day, then\n                 tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree --\n                 so special, then, bam -- it's\n                 abandoned on the side of the road,\n                 tinsel still clinging to it...\n\n     Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses\n     against the counter.  Marla pulls her hemline further up.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Like sex crime victims, underwear\n                 inside-out, bound with electrical\n                 tape.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (coldly)\n                 It suits you.\n\n     She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:\n\n                             MARLA\n                 You can borrow it sometime.\n\n     Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing.  Marla blows smoke\n     in his face.  Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the\n     sink.  Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS.\n\n                             TYLER (O.S.)\n                 Get rid of her.\n\n     Jack turns to see Tyler in the doorway.\n\n                             JACK\n                 You get rid of her.\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (pointing at Jack)\n                 Don't mention me.\n\n     Marla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS.  Jack looks to the\n     archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE.  Marla enters, shoes\n     and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something\n     on the junk strewn table.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I'm six years old again, passing\n                 messages between my parents.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I, uh... think you should go now.\n\n     Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things,\n     pushing other things off to the floor.\n\n                             JACK\n                 It's time for you to leave.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Don't worry, I'm leaving.\n\n     Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes.  She\n     moves up into Jack's face.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 You're such a nutcase, I can't even\n                 begin to keep up.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Goodbye.\n\n     She laughs, spins on her heels.  As she exits the back door,\n     she sings \"This Merry-Go-Round\" from \"Valley of the Dolls.\"\n     Jack watches her through the kitchen window.\n\n                             TYLER (O.S.)\n                 Nice work.\n\n     Jack turns.  Tyler's right behind him.  Through the window,\n     Marla can be seen walking away.  Tyler picks up the remnant\n     of SOAP Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 To make soap, first we have to render\n                 fat.\n\n     Jack looks at Tyler.\n\n     CLOSE UP - SIGN: \"DANGER - BIOHAZARD.\"\n\n     EXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT\n\n     Tyler stands inside the fence.  Jack's atop the fence,\n     struggling to cross BARBED WIRE.  He wobbles, gets over,\n     snags his shirt.  Jack falls, RIPPPPP.  Tyler helps.\n\n     FOOTSTEPS.  A FLASHLIGHT BEAM.  Tyler pulls Jack behind a\n     DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS.  A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD\n     moves along the perimeter, flashlight first.  He walks away.\n\n     MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding.  Tyler\n     eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 The best fat for making soap --\n                 because the salt balance is just\n                 right -- comes form human bodies...\n\n     Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.\n\n                             JACK\n                 What is this place?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 A liposuction clinic.\n\n     From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized,\n     thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Paydirt.  From society's richest\n                 asses and thighs.\n\n     TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying\n     BAGS of fat.  One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down\n     the chain-link fench.  Jack slips and slides.  Tyler laughs.\n     Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Jack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 As the fat renders, the tallow floats\n                 to the surface.  Remember the crap\n                 they taught you in Boy Scouts.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll\n                 mix it back in when we make the soap.\n\n     Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the\n     glycerin layer.  Then, he crabs a can, opens it.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Lye -- the crucial ingredient.\n                       (adding lye to mix)\n                 Ancient peoples found their clothes\n                 got cleaner if they washed them at a\n                 certain spot in the river.  Why?\n                 Because, human sacrifices were once\n                 made on the hills above this river.\n                 Year after year, bodies burnt.  Rain\n                 feel.  Water seeped through the wood\n                 ashes to become lye.  The lye\n                 combined with the melted fat of the\n                 bodies, till a thick white soapy\n                 discharge crept into the river.\n\n     Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet.  He takes\n     Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 The first soap was made from the\n                 ashes of heroes.  Like the first\n                 monkeys shot into space.\n\n     The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss.  Tyler pours a\n     bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Without sacrifice, without death, we\n                 would have nothing.\n\n     Jack's whole body JERKS.  Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand\n     and arm.  Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 This is a chemical burn.  It will\n                 hurt more than you've ever been\n                 burned and you will have a scar.\n\n     Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of\n     Tyler's kiss.  Jack's face spasms.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the\n                 back of my hand.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Look at your hand.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Guided meditation worked for cancer,\n                 it could work for this.\n\n     SHOT OF A GREEN MAPLE LEAF, GLISTENING WITH DEW.

Don't shut\n                 this out.\n\n     Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away.  Tyler\n     keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I tried not to think of the words\n                 \"searing\" or \"flesh.\"  I imagined my\n                 pain as a ball of healing white light.\n\n     SHOT OF A FOREST, IN GENTLE SPRING RAINFALL.

I\n                 need you to check and see if there's\n                 a lump in my breast.

See you around.\n\n     EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     Jack emerges from the lobby.  He looks up at Marla's window,\n     watches her silhouette.  He walks away, right into -- Big\n     BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice.\n\n                             BOB\n                 Cornelius!

I hear all kinds of things.\n                 Supposedly, he was born in a mental\n                 institution.  They say he only sleeps\n                 one hour a night.  You know about\n                 this guy?  Tyler Durden?\n\n     INT.

BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER\n\n     Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none\n     of these guys before - it's a new chapter.  Jack and Bob\n     Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape.  They both grin\n     with religious serenity.  Bob hugs Jack.\n\n                             BOB\n                 Thank you.  Thank you.\n\n     Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a\n     sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.\n\n                             JACK\n                 You're welcome.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Fight club -- this was mine and\n                 Tyler's gift... our gift to the world.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING\n\n     Jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at PAPERWORK.\n     Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink.  Jack\n     takes out a cigarette, lights up.

Blood starts to trickle.\n     He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by\n     the force of the punch, SLAMS against a framed picture and\n     SHATTERS the glass.  He falls to the floor.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge.\n\n     Jack gets back to his feet.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Please... don't hit me again, please.\n                 I'm your responsibility...\n\n     He PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again.\n     He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents\n     flying.  He hits the floor.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 For some reason, I thought of my\n                 first fight -- with Tyler.\n\n     Jack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Please... give me the paychecks like\n                 I asked for.

And we're\n                 learning that fact.  And we're very,\n                 very pissed-off.\n\n     The crowd erupts into a DEAFENING CHORUS of agreement.  Jack\n     looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 We are the quiet young men who listen\n                 until it's time to decide.\n\n     A fat, MIDDLE-AGED MAN stomps down the stairs, pushing into\n     the crowd, followed by a TALL, HEFTY THUG who holds a GUM.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Who are you?\n\n                             FAT MAN (LOU)\n                 Who am I?!  There's a sign on the\n                 front that says \"Lou's Tavern.\" I'm\n                 fucking Lou.  Who the fuck are you?!\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Tyler Durden.\n\n     Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou SLAPS it away.\n\n                             LOU\n                 Who told you motherfuckers you could\n                 use my place?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.\n\n                             LOU\n                 Irvine?

He looks up, turns his\n     head, looking to Jack.  Jack watches, wide-eyed.\n\n     Tyler straightens, facing Lou.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.\n\n     Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face.  Some of the guys move\n     forward, but the Thug points his gun.  Jack-runs forward\n     anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face.\n\n     More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 We really need to use this place.\n\n     Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his\n     face, his stomach.  Tyler collapses to the floor.  Lou\n     starts KICKING his.  Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 That's it.... that's good.  Get it\n                 all out.  You'll feel better.\n\n     Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more.  Finally,\n     sweating, bewildered, Lou stops.  He looks to the Thug, who\n     is just as bewildered.\n\n     Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and\n                 this whole fucking world...\n\n     Tyler's blood spatters on Lou.  Lou tries to shake Tyler\n     off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE.  The Thug grabs Tyler\n     and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou.  Lou\n     slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  Tyler\n     spits and shouts through clenched teeth...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You don't know where I've been.\n\n     Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor.  Tyler rubs his\n     bloody face into Lou's face.  The Thug lifts Tyler.  Tyler\n     clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 We need this place.  We need it.\n                 Please let us keep it, please...\n\n     Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou.\n\n                             LOU\n                 What are you doing?!\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Pleeeeeease!\n\n                             LOU\n                 Okay!

Thank you, sir...\n\n                             LOU\n                 Let go of me!!\n\n     Tyler lets go of Lou's belt.  Lou scrambles away.  The Thug\n     drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  Lou gets to\n     his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  He\n     and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind.\n\n     Fight club surrounds Tyler.  They help him up, move him to\n     a crate.  Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his\n     breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs\n     and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 This week, each of you has a homework\n                 assignment.

The Seminarian grabs\n     the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it.  The Mechanic\n     shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH.\n     The Mechanic purposely takes it.  The Seminarian starts to\n     run away.  The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the\n     Seminarian in the back of the neck.  They fight.\n\n     INT.

Get the hell out of here.\n\n     Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.  Jack\n     and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.\n\n                             JACK\n                   I feel sick.\n\n                             TYLER\n                   Imagine how he feels.\n\n     Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger --\n     CLICK.

He finally\n     turns back, following after Tyler.\n\n     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n     SLOW MOTION: in the deserted office, gasoline filled\n     COMPUTER MONITORS begin to EXPLODE...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM... !\n\n     EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING\n\n     Luxury AUTOMOBILES are parked, splattered with BIRD SHIT.\n\n     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN\n\n     VIEWED OUT 3RD STORY WINDOW: Tyler uses a RAKE, dragging it\n     across rocks and dirt.  He stops a moment, rake on his\n     shoulder, staring off.  Then, back to work...\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (muttering quietly)\n                 ... You are not how much money you\n                 have in the bank.  You are not the\n                 shoes you wear.\n\n     Tyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of\n     the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You are not the contents of your\n                 wallet...\n\n     INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT\n\n     The DRIVER has a broken nose.  The bus is empty, except for\n     Jack, in the very last seat, sleepy.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 He had a plan.  Maybe you just didn't\n                 see it till it hit you between the\n                 eyes.\n                       (pause)\n                 But, it started to make sense... in\n                 a Tyler sort of way.  No fear.  No\n                 distractions.  The ability to let\n                 that which does not matter truly\n                 slide.\n\n     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT\n\n     Jack gets off the bus.  As the bus pulls away, we see it\n     dropped Jack off right in front of the house.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     Jack enters.  Tyler, dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with\n     PAINT, grabs BEERS from the refrigerator.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Hey.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Hey.\n\n     Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table.  Tyler\n     comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Go on in.  We're celebrating.\n\n     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers.  Tyler does NOT\n     follow.  BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in\n     front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed\n     in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT.\n\n                             RICKY\n                 You are not your job.\n\n                             OTHERS TOGETHER\n                 You are not your job.\n\n                             RICKY\n                 You are not how much money you have\n                 in the bank.\n\n                             BOB\n                 Shhhh, wait... they're back to it...\n\n     Bob goes to turn up the TV.  One guy, sixteen years old with\n     an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack.\n\n                             ANGEL FACE\n                       (to Jack)\n                 Great, thanks.\n\n     Angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts.\n\n                             BOB\n                 Shhhhh!  Watch!\n\n     Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the \"PARKER\n     MORRIS BUILDING.\"  The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE\n     PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames\n     pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water.\n\n                             REPORTER (V.O.)\n                 Police Commissioner Jacobs has just\n                 arrived... just a second... excuse\n                 me, Commissioner, could you tell us\n                 what you think has happened?\n\n     COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera.\n\n                             COMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.)\n                 We believe this is related to the\n                 recent acts of vandalism around the\n                 city.  It's some kind of organized\n                 group, and we are coordinating a\n                 rigorous investigation.\n\n     Jack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him.  Tyler\n     tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight.\n\n                             JACK\n                 What did you guys do?\n\n     They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER.  They look at Jack and shake\n     their heads.  Jack doesn't get it.  Suddenly, the guys'\n     faces turn to stone.  Bob sits rigid.\n\n                             BOB\n                 The first rule of Project Mayhem\n                 is... you do not ask questions.\n\n     Jack stares at them.\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n     INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT\n\n     A luxurious BANQUET.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne.\n     He rises and starts out of the room.  Jack, in a WAITER'S\n     UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB...\n     RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look.\n\n     INT. HALLWAY\n\n     Jacobs saunters down an empty hall.  He stops to check his\n     tie in a mirror.  He pushes open the door of the MEN'S\n     BATHROOM -- face to face with TYLER.\n\n     INT. BATHROOM\n\n     Tyler GRABS Commissioner Jacobs, pulling him into the\n     bathroom.  He slaps a piece of tape over Jacobs' mouth.  The\n     OTHER \"WAITERS\" rush in.  Jack stays back to keep the door\n     shut.  Tyler and the others hold Jacobs, pulling down his\n     pants.  Bob snaps a rubber band -- reaches to Jacob s crotch.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Wrap it around the top of his hackie-\n                 sack.\n\n                             BOB\n                 Man, his balls are ice cold.\n\n     Ricky produces a KNIFE, moves it down to Jacob's testicles.\n     Jacobs is bug-eyed.  Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You're not going to continue your\n                 \"rigorous investigation.\"  You will\n                 publicly state that there is no\n                 underground group.  Or -- imagine,\n                 the rest of your life with your\n                 scrotum flapping empty.\n\n                             JACOBS\n                       (mouth taped)\n                 ... no... please, no...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 We'll send one to the New York Times\n                 and one to the Los Angeles Times.\n                 Press release style.  Your nuts will\n                 be bicoastal.  Understood?  The\n                 people you're after are everyone you\n                 depend on.\n                             (more)\n\n                             TYLER (cont)\n                 We do your laundry, cook your food\n                 and serve you dinner.  We guard you\n                 while you sleep.  We drive your\n                 ambulances.  Do not fuck with us.\n\n     Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife, causing Jacobs to\n     JUMP -- Ricky holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.\n\n     EXT. HOTEL - LATER\n\n     Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back SERVICE\n     ENTRANCE.  Tyler gives Angel Face a hearty slap on the back.\n     Angel Face smiles at Tyler, nods, grinning.\n\n     Jack sees this, his eyes narrowing, stops walking.\n\n     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Fight club in full swing.  Jack battles Angel Face, BEATING\n     the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I felt like putting a bullet between\n                 the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't\n                 screw to save its species.\n\n     The crowd shouts maniacally, save Tyler, who watches with an\n     inscrutable stone face.\n\n     Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack POUNDS too hard.  Blood\n     flies.  The crowd begins to grow QUIETER.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I wanted to open the dump valves on\n                 oil tankers and smother all the\n                 French beaches I'd never see.\n\n     Finally, Angel Face lies still, unconscious.  Jack stops,\n     stares down, numb.  Jack walks away -- the crowd parts to\n     let him pass.  Jack scans faces... finds Tyler.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I felt like destroying something\n                 beautiful.\n\n     EXT. STREET NEAR LOU'S TAVERN - LATER\n\n     RAINING.  Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.\n     A idling car HONKS.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.

STOLEN CAR\n\n     Tyler gets in the driver's seat.  Jack gets into the front\n     passenger seat.  Ricky and the mechanic are in back.\n\n     EXT.

STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER\n\n     RAIN GUSHES down.  Jack stews, silent.  The car moves down\n     a HIGHWAY, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Something on your mind?\n\n                             JACK\n                 No.\n\n     Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Why wasn't I told about \"Project\n                 Mayhem?\"\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What should I have told you?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Why wasn't I involved from the\n                 beginning?

We are all part\n                 of the same compost heap...\n\n                             JACK\n                 Tyler...\n\n     Tyler steers back into the proper lane.  The other CAR flies\n     past, HORN SOUNDING...\n\n                             JACK\n                 What the hell ... ?!\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You choose your level of involvement.\n                 I won't make decisions for you.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I'm not asking you to.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You're asking questions that don't\n                 have answers.  You know just as much\n                 about Project Mayhem as anybody else.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I don't think that's true.\n\n     Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up.\n     Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Tyler... what is this... !\n\n     Jack fights\tto turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What will you wish you'd done before\n                 you died?\n\n                             RICKY\n                 Paint a self-portrait.\n\n                             MECHANIC\n                 Build a house.\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (to Jack)\n                 And you?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I don't know!  Nothing!\n\n                             TYLER\n                 If you died right now, how would you\n                 feel about your life?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I would feel nothing about my life?\n                 Is that what you want to hear?!\n\n     The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS.  It moves\n     to the other side of the road.  Tyler steers there, too.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 I want to hear the truth.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck\n                 you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of\n                 this.  How's that?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Why do you think I blew up your condo?\n\n                             JACK\n                 What?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend\n                 retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You\n                 have to forget everything you know,\n                 everything you think you know --\n                 about life, about friendship, about\n                 you and me.\n\n     Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his\n     hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the\n     wheel... the car swerves...\n\n     The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING.\n\n     Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air.  Jack looks at\n     Tyler with dead eyes.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Okay, okay... fine...\n\n     Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air.\n     Tyler studies Jack face, impressed.  Tyler makes no move to\n     take the wheel.\n\n     THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of\n     the road, surrounded by flares.\n\n     Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the\n     shoulder... heading for the stalled car.  Their faces are\n     illuminated by the light of the flares.  Tyler smiles.\n\n     They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE!  The\n     back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass-\n     over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill...\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I'd never been in a car accident.\n                 This must've been what all those\n                 statistics felt like before I filed\n                 them into my reports.\n\n     The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.\n\n     EXT. OVERTURNED CAR\n\n     Tyler crawls from the passenger side.  He walks around...\n     opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the\n     mud.  Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear\n     window.  Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 We just had a near-life experience.\n\n     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT\n\n     Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the\n     ceiling.  Tyler sits in a nearby chair.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 In the world I see -- you're stalking\n                 elk through the damp canyon forests\n                 around the ruins of Rockefeller\n                 Center.  You will wear leather\n                 clothes that last you the rest of\n                 your life.  You will climb the wrist-\n                 thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears\n                 Tower.  You will see tiny figures\n                 pounding corn and laying-strips of\n                 venison on the empty car pool lane of\n                 the ruins of a superhighway.\n\n     Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat.\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (leaving)\n                 Feel better, champ.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee.  He's pale, dazed,\n     seems broken.  He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and\n     HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from.\n\n     Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the\n     counter.  Her back is to Jack as he looks at her.  She pours\n     ccffee and lights a cigarette.  A beat of silence, then:\n\n                             MARLA\n                 I'll be out of your way in a sec.\n\n     She seems to be as weak as Jack.\n\n                             JACK\n                 You... don't have to... leave.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Whatever.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Really... I mean it.\n                       (pause)\n                 Have you been going to your groups?\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Chloe's dead.\n\n                             JACK\n                 When?\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Do you care?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I don't know.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 It was the smart move on her part.\n\n     Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face.\n     There's a BRUISE on her ARM.  Jack gets up, moves closer.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Why are we both... caught up like\n                 this... with... ?\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I came so close to saying Tyler's\n                 name, I could feel it vibrate inside\n                 my mouth.\n\n     Marla looks a him, waiting.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I don't understand.  Why does a weak\n                 person have to go out and find a\n                 strong person... to hang onto?\n\n                             MARLA\n                 What do you get out of it?\n\n     Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING.  Jack can't quite\n     figure where it's coming from.\n\n                             JACK\n                 You hear that?\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Hear what?\n\n                             JACK\n                 That... sawing and hammering.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Have we been talking too long?  Must\n                 we change the subject?\n\n     Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door,\n     Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs.\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (harsh whisper)\n                 You're not talking about me, are you?\n\n     Jack reacts, turns back to Marla.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (to Marla and Tyler)\n                 No.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 That day you came over to my place to\n                 play doctor... what was going on\n                 there?\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (still a whisper)\n                 What are you talking about?\n\n                             JACK\n                       (to Marla and Tyler)\n                 Nothing.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Nothing?  I don't think so.\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (whisper)\n                 This conversation...\n\n                             JACK\n                 This conversation...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 ... is over.\n\n                             JACK\n                 ... is over.\n\n     Marla comes to touch Jack's hair.  Jack closes the basement\n     door.  Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his\n     hand.  Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 What is this?  Who did this?\n\n                             JACK\n                 ... A person.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Guy or girl?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Why would you ask if it's a guy or a\n                 girl?!\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Why would you get bent if I asked?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Let go of me...\n                       (pulls his hand free)\n                 Leave me alone.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 You're afraid to say.\n\n     Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with\n     frustration.  She leaves out the back door, not looking back.\n\n     Jack leans against the wall.  After a moment, he opens the\n     basement door, heads downstairs...\n\n     INT. BASEMENT STAIRCASE\n\n     Tyler walks upstairs, passing as Jack continues down...\n\n     INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Jack looks around.  TRIPLE-DECKER BUNKS clutter the\n     basement, as many as can fit into the space.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (calling upstairs)\n                 Tyler... ?  What's this for?\n\n     From upstairs, the SOUND of the DOORBELL.\n\n     INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     Jack opens the door.  Ricky stands on the porch, staring\n     ahead in subordinate military style.  He's in black pants,\n     black shirt, black shoes, holds a PAPER BAG, with an army\n     surplus MATTRESS rolled-up at his feet.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Um... what can I do for you, Ricky?\n\n     Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You're too young.  Sorry.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Wait a minute...\n\n     Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.\n\n                             JACK\n                 \"Too young?\"\n\n                             TYLER\n                 If the applicant is young, we tell\n                 him he's too young.  Old, too old.\n                 Fat, too fat.\n\n                             JACK\n                 \"Applicant?\"\n\n                             TYLER\n                 If the applicant waits at the door\n                 for three days without food, shelter\n                 or encouragement, then he can enter\n                 and begin training.\n\n                             JACK\n                 \"Training?\"  Tyler...\n\n     EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets,\n     unsure.  Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Uh, look.  You're too... young to...\n                 train here.  You should probably be\n                 on you way.\n\n     No response from Ricky, who remains at attention.  Jack goes\n     back inside.  Tyler closes the door.\n\n     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT\n\n     Ricky remains at attention.  Jack bursts out with a BROOM,\n     knocks the brown bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it away.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Are you deaf?!  I told you to leave!\n                 You will never get inside this house!\n\n     EXT. PORCH - MORNING\n\n     Ricky's still there.  Tyler comes out, friendly.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Look, friend, I'm sorry for the\n                 misunderstanding.  It's not the end\n                 of the world.  Just go away.  You're\n                 trespassing and I will call the\n                 police.  Nothing personal.\n\n     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT\n\n     Ricky, same spot.  Jack bursts outside with the broom again.\n\n                             JACK\n                 You're never getting through this\n                 door, you stupid little weasel!  Look\n                 at me when I talk to you... !\n\n     He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder with the broom.\n\n                             JACK\n                 What is your major malfunction!?\n\n     INT. JACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n     At the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the\n     PORCH below.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Sooner or later, we all became what\n                 Tyler wanted us to be.\n\n     EXT. PORCH - MORNING\n\n     Ricky's there.  Bob is now next to him, in black, with a\n     paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.  Tyler steps out.\n     Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.  To all the\n     following questions, Ricky answers \"Sir!\" --\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You have two black shirts?  Two pair\n                 black trousers?  One pair black\n                 boots?  Two pair black socks?  One\n                 black coat?  Three hundred dollars\n                 personal burial money?  Go inside.\n\n     Ricky goes in.

He picks up his mattress and\n     starts away.  Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes.  Jack\n     follows Bob...\n\n                             JACK\n                 Bob...

Ricky comes\n     out the front door with the BROOM...\n\n                             RICKY\n                       (to Bob)\n                 You're too fucking old, fatty!

THREE SPACE MONKEYS\n     work -- one SCRUBBING the FLOOR, one WASHING DISHES, one\n     SCRUBBING the walls.  Jack walks out.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 In Tyler We Trust.\n\n     INT.

Jack stares.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 He was gone.\n\n     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n     Jack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS.\n\n     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Jack enters.  Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  They\n     pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix.  They add VODKA.  Off\n     to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE.  On the\n     wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's\n     LICENSES; a sign above it: \"HUMAN SACRIFICES.\"\n\n                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY\n                 \"You are not a beautiful and unique\n                 snowflake.

TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 The house became a living thing, wet\n                 inside from so many people sweating\n                 and breathing.  So many people\n                 moving, the house moved.\n\n     Jack walks out.\n\n     INT. OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Jack enters.  Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart.\n     Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS.  Walls are\n     lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under\n     SIGNS: \"Mischief,\" \"Disinformation,\" \"Arson.\"\n\n     Jack's eye lingers on \"Arson.\" He starts flipping through\n     a file.  Angel Face comes to take the file from him.\n\n                             ANGEL FACE\n                 That wouldn't interest you.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Where's Tyler?\n\n                             ANGEL FACE\n                 The first rule of Project --\n\n                             JACK\n                 Right, right.\n\n     As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE-\n     BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.\n\n     EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT\n\n     Jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.  In the BACKGROUND, a\n     Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM.  It's a\n     ritual; no words.  Other Space Monkeys tend the garden.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I'm all alone.  I Am Jack's Broken\n                 Heart.\n\n     Jack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.  A\n     Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Get away from me!\n\n                             MARLA'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                 Who are all these people?\n\n     Jack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag.\n\n                             JACK\n                 The Paper Street Soap Company.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Can I come in?\n\n                             JACK\n                 He's not here.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 What?\n\n                             JACK\n                 He's not here!

Jack watches her go.\n     There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING.\n     Jack heads to the back door...\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Jack enters.  Ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to\n     the LEG.  Space Monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating\n     the wound.  Other Space Monkeys carry in a DEAD BODY in\n     BLACK CLOTHES and SKI MASK, putting it on the table.\n\n                             JACK\n                 What's going on?\n\n     Space Monkeys stare at the body.

Now\n                 look what you've done!\n\n                             JACK\n                 This isn't possible...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 We're going to have to do something\n                 about Marla...\n\n                             JACK\n                 What... what are you saying?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 It's okay.  We okay... a little\n                 codependent, sure, but...\n\n     Jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial...\n\n                             JACK\n                 No!  This isn't true.  We... we were\n                 around other people, together, both\n                 of us...\n\n                                  TYLER\n                 You never talked to me in front of\n                 anyone else.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Wrong, wrong -- what about the car\n                 crash... the two guys in the backseat?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What about them?  They're lunatics.\n\n                             JACK\n                 You took me to the house.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 The house is rented in your name.\n\n                             JACK\n                 You have jobs.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.\n\n                             JACK\n                 What about Marla?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What about Marla?\n\n                             JACK\n                 She's... you... you're fucking her.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Um, well... technically, no.\n\n     Jack stands, trying to absorb, feeling ill, trying to find\n     words, then -- he suddenly FAINTS to the floor, OUT COLD.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 It's called a \"changeover.\"  The\n                 movie goes on, and nobody in the\n                 audience has any idea.\n\n     INT. HOTEL ROOM - PRE-DAWN\n\n     Jack's eyes snap open.  He sits up, alone.  He remembers the\n     previous night... looks at himself in the mirror... looks at\n     the clock -- 4:35am.\n\n     INT. HALLWAY\n\n     The room door SLAMS OPEN as Jack bursts out of the room,\n     carrying his suitcase, SPRINTING for the STAIRWELL...\n\n     INT. STAIRWELL\n\n     Jack races down, three steps at a time, dragging his\n     suitcase - BOOM, BOOM, BOOM - behind him...\n\n     INT. LOBBY\n\n     Jack hurries to the front door, his suitcase half-broken\n     open, passing the front desk.  A DESK CLERK calls after him.\n\n                             DESK CLERK\n                 Sir... sir?  Are you checking out?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Yes.\n\n     The clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a PAPER.\n\n                             DESK CLERK\n                 Please initial this list of phone\n                 calls.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Bill me!\n\n     Jack goes out the door, freezes.  He rushes back in, going\n     to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many NUMBERS.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Wait...when were these made?\n\n                             DESK CLERK\n                 It says right there, sir... between\n                 two and three-thirty this morning.\n\n     Jack looks at the clerk, at the bill, at the clerk.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I need a copy of this.\n\n     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - DAY\n\n     Jack stares out the window, his face set hard.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Had I been going to bed earlier every\n                 night?  Have I been sleeping later?\n                 Has Tyler been in charge longer and\n                 longer?\n\n     EXT. PAPER STREET - DAY\n\n     A TAXI halts.  Jack leaps out, points to the GRUNGY CABBIE.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Wait here.\n\n     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     Jack walks in to find the place EMPTY and DESERTED.  He\n     continues on into the KITCHEN, gawks at BATHTUBS and\n     CANISTERS holding vast amounts of liquid.  There are HOSES,\n     GAS MASKS, BEAKERS, TEST TUBES and PUMPS.\n\n     He picks up a BOTTLE labeled \"NITRIC ACID.\"\n\n     INT. TYLER'S ROOM\n\n     Jack sits by the PHONE, pulls out the HOTEL BILL, runs his\n     finger up and down the list of PHONE NUMBERS...\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 Deja vu, all over again...\n\n     Jack finger stops on a NUMBER.  He dials, phone to his ear.\n\n                             VOICE\n                       (from phone)\n                 Eighteen-eighty-eight.\n\n     Jack sees a file on the wall: \"1888 CENTURY PARK EAST.\"\n\n                             JACK\n                 Who is this?\n\n                             VOICE\n                 Maintenance.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Listen, something is going to happen,\n                 something terrible...\n\n                             VOICE\n                 Very good, Sir.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Excuse me?\n\n                             VOICE\n                 Don't worry about us, sir.  We're\n                 solid.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Now wait, there's been a mix-up.\n                 Everything's changed...\n\n                             VOICE\n                 You told me you'd say that.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Abort the plan.\n\n                             VOICE\n                 You told me you'd say that, too.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist\n                 dickhead?!\n\n                             VOICE\n                 Well, sir, you said you might.\n\n     Jack HANGS UP, desperately dials the next number on the bill.\n\n                             DIFFERENT VOICE\n                       (front phone)\n                 Twenty-one-sixty.  Maintenance.\n\n     Jack sees a file: \"2160 PICO BOULEVARD.\"  He throws the\n     phone, pocketing the bill.  He grabs up all the FILES.\n\n     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET\n\n     Jack's TAXI halts.  Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees\n     Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files...\n\n                             JACK\n                 Marla!\n\n     Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  Jack follows,\n     hugging the files to his chest, catching up.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Marla...\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me\n                 with a fucking broom.

It's\n                 going to take a tremendous act of\n                 faith on your part for you to hear me\n                 out.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.\n\n     Marla heads into a DINER.  Jack follows...\n\n                             JACK\n                 -- A little more faith than that.\n\n     INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     Marla sits in a BOOTH.  Jack sits across from her.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 I don't want to hear anything you've\n                 got to say.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Give me a minute, Marla, alright...\n                 just sixty seconds.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Absolutely, you have every right.

Sit down and give me my\n                 last fifteen seconds without opening\n                 your mouth!\n\n     Marla crosses her arms.  Jack collects himself.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I'm trying to tell you -- and this is\n                 where you have to trust me -- but, I\n                 think your life might be in real\n                 danger.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 What?\n\n                             JACK\n                 You have to get out of here.

You're sorry?  I don't\n                 believe that for a minute.\n\n     Marla gets up.  Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading\n     for the door.  Jack gathers his files, runs to follow...\n\n     EXT.

You wouldn't\n                 believe me anyway.  I'm trying to\n                 protect you...\n\n     Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races\n     past.  Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Let go of me!\n\n                             JACK\n                 Do this for me, Marla.

Get on the bus.\n                 Get on the bus.\n\n     Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus.  As\n     they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Why are you doing this?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I can't let myself see where you're\n                 going.  Go wherever it takes you,\n                 remember... keep away from major\n                 cities...\n\n     Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one\n     last look at Jack.\n\n                             MARLA\n                       (holds up the money)\n                 I'm not paying this back.  I consider\n                 it \"asshole tax.\"\n\n                             JACK\n                 Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away\n                 a couple of weeks, at least.\n\n     Jack's still covering his eyes.  Marla gets on the bus.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Tyler...\n\n     Jack finally looks to her.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 You are the worst thing that ever\n                 happened to me.\n\n     DOORS HISS SHUT.  The BUS LEAVES, heading away.  Jack seems\n     relieved.  Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA...\n\n     Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is\n     filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys.\n\n     Jack SPRINTS after the bus...\n\n     The bus speeds away.  Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla.\n\n     Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Son of a bitch!\n\n     INT. POLICE STATION - DAY\n\n     Jack RUNS to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of\n     files on the desk in front of the DESK SERGEANT...\n\n                             JACK\n                       (loudly)\n                 I want you to arrest me.  I'm the\n                 leader of a terrorist organization\n                 responsible for acts of vandalism all\n                 over the city.  Detective Stern in\n                 arson knows who I am...\n\n     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER\n\n     Detective Stern and THREE DETECTIVES stand, staring at Jack,\n     who's seated.  On the table are the phone bill and files.\n\n                             JACK\n                 There are probably several hundred\n                 members in the metropolitan area.\n                 Chapters are sprouting in at least\n                 five other major cities.  They're\n                 tightly-regimented, with many cells\n                 capable of operating without a\n                 central leader.  Check this address:\n                 1537 Paper Street.  You'll find the\n                 body of Robert Paulson buried in the\n                 garden.  You'll also find numerous\n                 tubs used to make gallons of\n                 nitroglycerin.  The plan, I believe,\n                 is to blow up these credit card\n                 headquarters and the TRW building.\n\n                             STERN\n                 Why these buildings?\n\n                             JACK\n                 You are not your job.  You are not\n                 how much money you have in the bank.\n\n                             STERN\n                       (to other detectives)\n                 Keep him talking.\n\n     Stern leaves.  A beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile\n     at Jack with REVERENCE.\n\n                             FLAT-TOP DETECTIVE\n                 I really admire what you're doing.\n                 You're a brave man to order this.\n\n                             JACK\n                 What?\n\n                             REDHEAD DETECTIVE\n                 You're a genius, sir.\n\n     They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table.\n     Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife.\n\n                             BALD DETECTIVE\n                 You know the drill.  You said if\n                 anyone ever tries to interfere with\n                 Project Mayhem, even you, we got to\n                 get his balls.\n\n     Flat-Top PULLS Jack's pants completely off, tosses them\n     aside.  Jack SCREAMS.  Flat-Top holds his legs.\n\n                             FLAT-TOP\n                 It's useless to fight.\n\n                             REDHEAD\n                 This is really a powerful gesture,\n                 Mr. Durden.  It'll set quite an\n                 example.\n\n                             JACK\n                 No... you're making a mistake!\n\n                             FLAT-TOP\n                 You told us you'd say that.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I'm not Tyler Durden!\n\n                             BALDY\n                 You told us you'd say that, too.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm\n                 ordering you to abort the mission!\n\n                             FLAT-TOP\n                 You said you would definitely say\n                 that.\n\n                             BALDY\n                 What's our best time for a \"cut and\n                 run?\"\n\n                             FLAT-TOP\n                 Four minutes.\n\n                             BALDY\n                 Is somebody timing this?\n\n                             REDHEAD\n                       (looks at his watch)\n                 Wait till the second hand gets to the\n                 twelve.\n\n     A KNOCK at the door.  Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's\n     mouth.  He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy\n     opens the door a crack.  Stern mutters:\n\n                             STERN\n                 Some of this info checks out.  Let's\n                 go to the place on Paper Street.\n\n     Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing\n     the door.  The two remaining Detectives continue.  Jack kicks\n     and screams and writhes.  The Detectives wrangle him, but\n     with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone.\n\n                             REDHEAD\n                       (checking his watch)\n                 Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up\n                 the time!\n\n     Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards --\n     Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of\n     Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting\n     off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking...\n\n     Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN\n     and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up,\n     gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises.\n\n     Jack grabs one of the files off the table.\n\n     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY\n\n     Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK\n     DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.\n\n     EXT. STREET\n\n     Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand,\n     looking like a complete madman.  Cars almost hit him.\n\n     EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER\n\n     Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads\n     toward the BUILDING with the address \"1888.\"\n\n     EXT. 1888 LOBBY\n\n     Jack tries the door.  Locked.  He lifts a cast iron bench,\n     runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.  The bench\n     immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin!\n     Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package.\n     Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass...\n\n     INT. 1888 LOBBY\n\n     Jack pushes through the broken glass.  He sprints for the\n     \"PARKING\" door...\n\n     INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING\n\n     Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS.  He bolts to the STAIRS...\n\n     INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR\n\n     Jack enters, heaving.  Again, NO CARS.  He moves from one\n     SUPPORT POST to another, searching.  He finally spies,\n     across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED.\n\n     Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it.\n     There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from \"10:05\"...\n\n     Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside..\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Could be worse...\n\n     Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You could be standing under 37\n                 stories of steel and concrete with a\n                 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped\n                 to the support... oh, maybe it\n                 couldn't be...\n\n                             JACK\n                       (points at bomb)\n                 You... you can't be serious about\n                 this.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What a ridiculous thing to say.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I can't let you...\n\n                             TYLER\n                              ...go through with this?\n                 What are you going to do?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I'm going to...\n\n                             TYLER\n                           ...stop me?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I'm not going...\n\n                             TYLER\n                            ...to let this happen!\n\n                             JACK\n                 Stop finishing...\n\n                             TYLER\n                         ...your sentences!  They're\n                 our sentences.  Get your mind around\n                 that.\n\n     Tyler gets up walks to Jack.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What are you doing running through\n                 the streets in your underpants?  We\n                 both use that body.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Since when is Project Mayhem about\n                 murder?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 The buildings were evacuated thirty\n                 minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding\n                 exactly as planned.\n\n                             JACK\n                 You don't know that.  There could\n                 still be people inside.\n\n     Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with\n                 shaved heads couldn't synchronize\n                 their watches.  Good riddance.\n\n     Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his\n     face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you\n                 know which wires, in what order...\n\n                             JACK\n                 If you know, I know.\n\n     Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go\n     through the tangle of colored wires.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I\n                 spent the whole day thinking about\n                 the wrong ones.\n\n     Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.\n\n                             JACK\n                 If I'm wrong, we're both dead..\n\n                             TYLER\n                 This is not about martyrdom.\n\n     Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I'm pulling the green wire.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Green?  Did you say green?\n\n     Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look,\n     seems genuinely concerned.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Yes...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Don't pull the green wire.  Pull\n                 anything but the green wire.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Fuck you.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.\n\n     Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers\n     trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in\n                 the nick of time, eh?\n\n     Jack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 See for yourself.\n\n     Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand,\n     keeps an eye on Tyler.  Jack looks over the railing...\n\n     BELOW, a BUS idles.  The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out,\n     kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...\n\n                             MARLA\n                 You motherfuckers...\n\n     They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE.\n\n     Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 I've got everything.  The bombs.  The\n                 army.  I've got Marla.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew\n                 a hole in his head.  Was that part of\n                 your plan?\n\n     Tyler thinks, shrugs.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Bob was a grown man.  In any great\n                 struggle, there will be casualties.\n                 Wouldn't that be implicit in the\n                 name?  Project \"Mayhem.\"\n\n                             JACK\n                 Fuck your struggle.  I want out.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 You want out?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I quit.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Not an option, for the most obvious\n                 of reasons.  You need to get with the\n                 program.\n                       (looks at his watch)\n                 Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.\n\n     Tyler's walks away.  Jack looks at the gun in his hand.  He\n     points the gun at Tyler...\n\n                             JACK\n                 Tyler...\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (still walking away)\n                 What?\n\n                             JACK\n                       (COCKS the gun)\n                 Defuse the bomb.\n\n     Tyler stops walking.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Ask me nicely.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Defuse the bomb, please.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Defuse the bomb?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Yes.\n\n     Tyler strides towards the BOMB.  Jack trains the gun...\n\n                             JACK\n                 Please.\n\n     Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it.  He grips the\n     GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS.\n\n     Jack lowers his gun.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 I did that for you.  As a gesture.\n                 Now, how fast can you run?  There are\n                 ten other bombs, in ten other\n                 buildings in the immediate area.  If\n                 you're going to get them all, you\n                 better get cracking.\n                       (looks at watch)\n                 Six minutes.  Green wires, remember.\n                 I'll be upstairs.\n\n     Jack's stunned.  Tyler walks across the parking garage, past\n     Jack, heading for the STAIRS.\n\n     Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES!\n\n     Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding...\n\n     Tyler spins to face Jack.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Whoa!  What was that all about?\n\n     Jack aims... FIRES!\n\n     Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE.\n\n     Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the\n     post... Tyler is NOT THERE.  Jack turns, takes slow steps,\n     moving the gun from side to side...\n\n     Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face.\n\n     Jack falls.  The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor...\n\n     Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE.  Jack looks to the gun,\n     scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun...\n\n     Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling.\n\n     Jack rolls, holding his chest.  He looks up, sees Tyler run\n     into the STAIRWELL.  Jack grabs the gun and follows...\n\n     INT. STAIRWELL\n\n     Jack smashes the door open.  The stairwell's empty.  Jack\n     RUNS up a flight of stairs, kicks open ANOTHER DOOR...\n\n     INT. MAIN LOBBY\n\n     Jack steps forward, gun up... TWO INTERLOCKED HANDS SLAM\n     down onto his head.  Jack drops to the floor.\n\n     Tyler backs away, laughing.  Jack gets to his feet, aims his\n     gun...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Fire at will.\n\n     Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler.\n     Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect.  Tyler raises his arms.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What did you expect?\n\n     Jack charges.  Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of\n     Jack's hand.  They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking\n     each other to the floor...\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n     INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Banks of SECURITY MONITORS sit unmanned.\n\n     ON ONE MONITOR: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor,\n     alone, wrestling himself.  He swings his left hand up,\n     punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- PUNCHING\n     himself in the side of the head...\n\n     INT. MAIN LOBBY\n\n     Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied.  Tyler manages to\n     get his hands around Jack's throat, starts BANGING Jack's\n     head against the floor...\n\n     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.\n\n     ... Jack's got his hands around his own throat, BANGING his\n     own head against the floor, over and over...\n\n     INT. MAIN LOBBY\n\n     Jack manages to break Tyler's grip, KICKS Tyler away.\n     Tyler springs to his feet, RUNS, heading for a STAIRCASE.\n\n     Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows...\n\n     ON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the\n     lobby, disappears around a corner.  Jack's right behind,\n     turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE.\n\n     Jack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head.  He\n     wheels.  Tyler isn't there.  A TAP on his shoulder.  Jack\n     turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face.  Jack falls\n     against the loft railing.  Tyler comes forward, SWINGS...\n\n     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.\n\n     Jack PUNCHES himself square in the nose!\n\n     INT. MAIN LOBBY\n\n     Jack's dazed.  Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward,\n     SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS...\n\n     Jack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head\n     on the floor.  Jack PASSES OUT...\n\n                                                     FADE TO BLACK:\n\n     INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR\n\n     CLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE.  He\n     looks around, trying to focus his eyes...\n\n     JACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from\n     where his body was dragged across to where he is how.\n\n     CLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend.  He turns his head --\n     TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S\n     MOUTH.  Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes...\n\n                                                      PULL BACK TO:\n\n     Tyler is seated in Jack's lap.  Tyler holds the gun in\n     Jack's mouth, his arm around him.  This huge room is being\n     remodeled.  Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling\n     windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY.\n\n     Tyler looks at his watch.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 One minute.\n\n                             JACK (V.O.)\n                 I think this is about where we came\n                 in.\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (looking out window)\n                 This is the beginning.  We're at\n                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a\n                 few words, to mark the occasion.\n\n                             JACK\n                 i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...\n\n     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (still distorted)\n                 I still can't think of anything.\n\n     Tyler checks his watch.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 It's getting exciting now.\n\n     Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Look what we've accomplished.\n                       (checks watch)\n                 Thirty seconds.\n                       (looks out windows)\n                 Out these windows, we will view the\n                 economic collapse.  One step closer\n                 to global equilibrium.  I'm glad\n                 you're here with me.\n\n     Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (distorted)\n                 Can't you call it off... ?\n\n                             TYLER\n                 It's out of our hands.\n                       (looks at watch)\n                 This is it.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Please...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see\n                 alright?  10... 9... 8....\n\n     Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS,\n     excited.  Jack closes his eyes, despairing.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 5... 4... 3... 2...\n\n     Out the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged.  Nothing.  A\n     long beat.  A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face.\n\n     Jack opens his eyes.  More waiting.  Tyler looks genuinely\n     surprised, pissed-off.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What the fuck -- ?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Paraffin.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What?\n\n                             JACK\n                       (relieved)\n                 Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the\n                 nitro with paraffin.

Paraffin is iffy at best.\n\n     Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts\n     pacing.  Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Damn it!  God-damn it...\n\n                             JACK\n                 Not exactly according to plan.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Do we have to do everything\n                 ourselves?!\n\n     Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust.  He reaches\n     into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.\n\n                             TYLER\n                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)\n                 ... Codename Rooster.

The GUN is knocked away.  Jack\n     STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles\n     off...\n\n     Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it.  Tyler's getting to\n     his feet, sees the gun, annoyed.  Jack stands.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Haven't we already done this?\n\n     Jack SHOOTS TWICE.  Bullets pass right thorough Tyler.\n     Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the\n     floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.\n\n                             JACK\n                       (pointing)\n                 How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking\n                 figment of my imagination... you're\n                 psychogenic fugue state...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 Fuck that, maybe you're my\n                 hallucination.\n\n     Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet.  There's no walkie-\n     talkie there.  Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE\n     CRUSHED under his own foot.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Oh...

Long silence.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Do something for me.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Appreciate something.\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Look at me...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What?\n\n                             JACK\n                 My eyes are open.\n\n     EXTREME SLOW MOTION:\n\n     Jack's finger squeezes the trigger...\n\n     KABLAM! -- Jack's cheeks INFLATE with gas.  His eyes bulge.\n     BLOOD flies out from his head.  The WINDOW behind him\n     SHATTERS.  SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts.\n\n     RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack...\n\n     Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...\n\n                             TYLER\n                 What's that smell... ?\n\n     Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls...\n\n     Tyler hits the ground.  The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN\n     OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.\n\n     Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room,\n     moving forward to Jack.  TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.\n\n                             TALL SPACE MONKEY\n                 Are you all right, sir... ?!\n\n     Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole\n     blown in his CHEEK.  He's bleeding hard, but he's alive.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I'm okay...\n\n     Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to\n     see.  TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla.  One holds a gun\n     to Marla as she struggles.\n\n                             SHORT SPACE MONKEY\n                 Are you sure?  You look terrible,\n                 sir!  What's happened?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Everything's fine.\n\n                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY\n                 Sir, you look really awful!  Do you\n                 need medical assistance?\n\n     Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...\n\n                             JACK\n                 Bring the girl to me.  The rest of\n                 you get out.  Now!\n\n     The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 What happened... ?\n\n                             JACK\n                 Don't ask.\n\n     Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply.\n     them to Jack's wound.  Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.\n\n                             JACK\n                 Get to the rendezvous point.  Move it!\n\n     Jack and Marla are left alone.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 My God, you're shot...\n\n                             JACK\n                 Yes.\n\n     Jack tries to got up.  Marla helps him.\n\n                             MARLA\n                 Who did this to you?\n\n                             JACK\n                 I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm\n                 fine...\n\n     MASSIVE EXPLOSION... the glass walls rattle...\n\n     Jack and Marla look -- OUT THE WINDOWS: a BUILDING EXPLODES;\n     collapsing upon itself.  Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES\n     into a massive cloud of dust.  Jack and Marla are\n     silhouetted against the SKYLINE.  Jack looks to Marla,\n     reaches to take her hand.\n\n                             JACK\n                 I'm sorry... you met me at a very\n                 strange time in my life.\n\n     Marla looks at him.  ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES\n     inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER...\n\n     The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING\n     SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING\n     BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS.  Then, the IMPLODING\n     BUILDING again.  SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket\n     holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED...\n\n                                                     FADE TO BLACK:\n\n                                                end\n\n     --------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nFight Club\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Jim Uhls\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:09.789574"}
