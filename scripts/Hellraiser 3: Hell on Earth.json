DERELICT STREET   TWILIGHT\n          \n          Night is falling in a forgotten part of the city.\n          \n          The street-lights are a joke - three out of four are dead.\n          Only a large moon and some cloud-streaked stars illuminate this\n          dark and derelict street.\n          \n          Once the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are\n          abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris.  Stores\n          are boarded-up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied.\n          \n          At various points, several BUMS warm their hands at trash-can\n          fires.\n          \n          ANGLE ON TWO BUMS\n          \n           - as their eyes move, following something moving down the\n          street.  Heard OFF is the sound of a smooth and powerful\n          engine.\n          \n          ANGLE ON STREET\n          \n          Down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an\n          incongruously expensive car - a Range Rover. A rich kid is\n          going shopping.\n          \n          The car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only\n          open store on the block.\n          \n          ANGLE ON STORE\n          \n          A dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the\n          store is still trading.  Its windows are grimy, its door\n          defaced.  Above the door - barely legible through the accrued\n          dirt of city years - a sign; CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES AND CURIOS.\n          \n          ANGLE ON CAR\n          \n          The side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an\n          expensive leather boot - and JP MONROE steps out.\n          \n          JP is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. His hair is slick with\n          designer-grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather\n          jacket.\n          \n          For a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous\n          glances up and down the ruined street.  He shows no anxiety at\n          being in this twilight part of town.  Cocooned in the\n          confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life.\n          Satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through\n          the doorway.\n          \n          \n          \n                                                                      2\n          \n          INT.   CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES   NIGHT\n          \n          The store itself looks like an antique - old wood panelling and\n          shelving, Victorian display cases, and faded wallpaper.  It is\n          grimy, dusty, and dimly-lit - and apparently unattended.\n          \n          It is packed with merchandise - shelves and aisles overflow\n          onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through.\n          \n          The stock is a strange surreal mix.  Discarded items from 50's\n          America (Norge fridges, toasters, Frankie Lymon albums) share\n          space with older items; framed pictures, Victorian automata,\n          wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store?) items of punishment;\n          stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips. Could that really\n          be an Electric Chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room?\n          \n          ANGLE ON JP\n          \n          He wanders through the merchandise, casting appraising glances\n          at some items.  Some he even runs his hands over - grimacing at\n          the dust and grime they leave on his fingers.  But his manner\n          suggests he is looking for something specific.\n          \n          Near the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of\n          vaudeville and travelling shows.  It is tall and broad and is\n          leaning against something behind it.\n          \n          ANGLE ON HOARDING\n          \n           - which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of\n          hyperbolic come-ons to long-dead punters:\n          \n          YOU WILL BE AMAZED! THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE! FREAKS OF NATURE!\n          AN EDUCATIONAL SHOW FOR ALL THE FAMILY PRESENTED UNDER THE\n          AUSPICES OF PROFESSOR EMMANUEL BOCKLIN, TRAGEDIAN AND\n          MENAGERIST.\n          \n          ANGLE ON JP\n          \n           - as he moves the hoarding aside.\n          \n                                     JP\n                        Wow ...\n          \n          REVEALED is a six-foot tall black rectangular pillar, covered\n          in beautifully detailed 3-D carvings all in the same matt-black\n          finish as the pillar itself.  The pillar is extremely bizarre,\n          as if a New York avant-garde sculptor has interpreted a Totem\n          Pole for jaded modern tastes.  The carvings are of dead rats,\n          copulating skeletons,  filigree-patterned boxes, and faces.\n          \n          One of these faces - recognizable to the audience but not to JP\n          - is the ossified visage of PINHEAD, the demon from the first\n          two HELLRAISER pictures.\n          \n                                                                      3\n          \n          ANGLE ON JP\n          \n           - as he leans in to study this face, already fascinated by its\n          calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom.\n          \n          A voice OFF startles him.\n          \n                                     BUM\n                        You want it?\n          \n          JP whirls round in shock.  A BUM is standing close to him.\n          \n          ANGLE ON BUM\n          \n          He has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard.\n          His eyes are a piercing, excited blue.  Otherwise he is\n          indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside \u0096\n          ragged, tatty clothes, features blackened with grime.\n          \n          ANGLE ON JP\n          \n           - as he glances round the store and past the bum to the door\n          beyond; has this character just wandered in from the street?\n          \n                                     JP\n                        Is it yours?\n          \n          ANGLE ON BOTH\n          \n          The Bum smiles, shaking his head knowingly.\n          \n                                     BUM\n                        No.  Not mine.  Yours.\n          \n          JP nods, still a little uncertain.\n          \n                                     JP\n                        How much do you want for it?\n          \n                                     BUM\n                        Whatever you think its worth.\n          \n          JP digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of\n          cash.  Without counting or checking, he proffers it.\n          \n          The Bum's hand flies out and siezes JP's, pressing the money\n          between their palms, making the exchange into a handclasp.\n          \n          In the background, OUT OF FOCUS, is Pinhead's face on the\n          pillar.\n          \n                                     BUM (OFF)\n                        Enjoy ...\n          \n          \n                                                                      4\n          \n          The FOCUS switches so that the hands in foreground BLUR and\n          Pinhead's frozen face becomes SHARP, as if he is silently\n          watching this deal take place.\n          \n          The Bum's hand moves away with the money as we\n          \n          FADE TO BLACK\n          \n          \n          INT.

In shot behind her is a quiet\n          hospital Emergency Room - no patients, no staff, just beds and\n          intensive-care equipment.\n          \n          Joanne - or JOEY, as she prefers to be called - is 23 years\n          old, an attractive and clever brunette, with a quiet sadness in\n          her eyes that she usually manages to keep almost hidden.\n          \n          Dressed in the stylish but sedate garb of a TV newsperson, she\n          holds a microphone marked with the logo of her station, W-QQY.\n          \n          Her direct address to the unseen TV camera continues.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        Most nights this inner-city Emergency\n                        Room would be a chaos of blood and panic\n                        and grace under pressure.  But tonight,\n                        as you see, it's like Death took a\n                        holiday.  It's a mystery to me ... A\n                        mystery how those assholes at\n                        Assignments knew it.  This is Joey\n                        Summerskill for W-QQY.  Emergency Room.\n                        No story.  Really, really pissed off.\n          \n          Despite the nature of her last few words, Joey has ironically\n          kept up the manner and delivery of a newscaster.  Now, she\n          breaks mood, looks away from the camera, and, with a dismissive\n          wave of the hand, begins to walk out of shot.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        Ah, break it down, Doc.  It's a bust.\n          \n          CUT TO WIDE\n          \n           - to reveal that we are not watching a broadcast at all but\n          are in the ER in real time.  As well as Joey, the room contains\n          her cameraman (\"DOC\" FISHER) and an ER NURSE.\n                                                                      5\n          \n          Doc - a 45 year old with a weight problem, a nicotine\n          addiction, and a cynical attitude - lowers a shoulder-mounted\n          Video camera and watches Joey walk to a water-cooler against a\n          wall. His expression is a mix of exasperation and sympathy.\n          \n          The Nurse is a middle-aged woman of Asian ancestry.

UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT\n          \n          CLOSE on a screaming male face, twisted as in pain or fury.\n          \n          PULL BACK rapidly to REVEAL the face belongs to the lead singer\n          of THANATOS.  He is on a nightclub stage with the rest of the\n          band, all of them dressed in that shit-poor-white-trash-on-dope\n          look favored by all such rich young businessmen with guitars.\n          \n          A tatty banner across the back of the stage proclaims: UNDER\n          THE UNDERGROUND PRESENTS THANATOS.\n          \n          The SCREAM ends, replaced with the roaring thunder of drums and\n          guitars as Thanatos kick into some thrash-metal.\n          \n          The dance-floor of the club is packed with KIDS dancing to the\n          incredibly fast, incredibly loud music.\n          \n          Many of the kids favor the same look as the band but it's not\n          exclusive; college types are there too, along with some \u0096 male\n          and female - sporting the glitz-meets-sleaze look of Terri.\n          \n          The club itself is of course dimly-lit and the basic decor is\n          black.  Where it is distinguished from hundreds of others is in\n          the bizarre sculptures and pieces of artwork that hang from the\n          ceiling and walls, all in tones of black, silver and gray:\n          \n          VARIOUS ANGLES ON SCULPTURES\n          \n          A headless, armless torso wrapped in barbed wire.\n          \n          A pair of male and female heads.  Bonsai-like trees grow out of\n          every orifice - eye-sockets, nostrils, ears, and mouths.\n          \n                                                                      14\n          \n          A human arm with the skin and flesh of its upper half peeled\n          open and pinned out to reveal inside - instead of bone and\n          sinew - an entire miniature metropolis, beautifully detailed.\n          \n          A black bird cage containing a fetal skeleton.\n          \n          VARIOUS ANGLES ON CLUB\n          \n          Kids also crowd the bar and the tables on the outskirts of the\n          dance floor.  It is a hot, sweaty, faintly aggressive\n          atmosphere - people jostling for position, shouting to be\n          heard, etc etc.\n          \n          The camera finds Joey - incongruous by dress and demeanor \u0096\n          pushing her way among the crowd.\n          \n          The music is too loud and overpowering to hear Joey's voice but\n          it is clear as she moves through the confines of the club that\n          she is approaching various people and enquiring after Terri.\n          \n          FOUR KIDS AT A TABLE\n          \n          - shake their heads and shrug.\n          \n          A PUNK\n          \n          - stares blankly and blinks.\n          \n          TWO BIMBOS\n          \n          - giggle, purse their lips, shake their heads.\n          \n          JOEY\n          \n           - catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance\n          floor and pushes through the crowd to follow.  She taps the\n          figure's arm but, as it turns, she realizes it is a man \u0096 some\n          70's revivalist GLITTER-ROCKER.  He looks quizzically at her.\n          \n          Joey's mouth moves and this time she seems to get some\n          response.  The Glitter-Rocker mouths a name.\n          \n          Joey can't hear him.  She hands him a business card and a pen.\n          \n          He scrawls a name on the back of the card and Joey nods her\n          thanks as he moves on.\n          \n          CLOSE ANGLE ON CARD\n          \n           - as Joey reads the name \"Terri\" on it.  She flips the card to\n          reveal her name and number and writes \"Terri - Please call!\".\n          \n          ANGLE ON BAR\n          \n          \n                                                                      15\n          \n           - as Joey pushes to the counter and hands the card to a BARMAN\n          who looks at it, nods, and puts it beneath the counter.\n          \n          ANGLE ON EXIT\n          \n           - as Joey makes her way out.\n          \n          ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR\n          \n          Camera moves into the tightly-packed throng on the dance floor,\n          making its way slowly toward the previously unseen center.\n          \n          The crowd parts slightly to reveal, in the direct center of the\n          floor, the tall black pillar from the opening sequence.\n          \n          The pillar is mounted on a plinth and spins as the clientele\n          dance around it.  It seems very in keeping with the decor of\n          the club but even so it is a strong unsettling presence.\n          \n          The pillar has been mounted upside down, so that it looks even\n          odder than our first glimpse of it.  Near the bottom the\n          inverted face of Pinhead, black and frozen, can be seen.\n          \n          The camera begins to spin around the pillar in contrary motion\n          to the pillar's own movement and, as it does so, draws closer\n          and closer making for a disorienting, vertiginous image.\n          \n          As this happens, the raucous sound of the band Thanatos begins\n          to fade into a whirl of ECHO and to be replaced by a whirring,\n          spinning, sound which we only recognize fully as we\n          \n          CUT TO\n          \n          \n          EXT.

Don't fucking die!\n          \n          The dialogue prompts a more furious effort on the part of the\n          POV camera.  Pushing frantically through the obscuring foliage,\n          it finally gains a clearer view and stops, looking ahead.\n          \n          In a tiny clearing, ten feet from the camera, still partially\n          obscured by the jungle, two camouflage-clad SOLDIERS lean over\n          the prone body of a third.  It is unclear due to distance but\n          there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform.\n          \n          A new sound joins the SOUND MONTAGE - a persistent, rhythmic,\n          ringing sound.  The other elements die away until only this is\n          left and we recognize it as the sound of a telephone as we\n          \n          CUT TO\n          \n          \n          INT.

Confused\n          and disoriented, her eyes fly around her darkened bedroom as if\n          she's trying to understand where she is and what is happening.\n          \n          Finally, she registers the phone and leans toward her bedside\n          table to pick it up.\n          \n          ANGLE ON BEDSIDE TABLE\n          \n           - favoring the luminous display of an alarm clock next to the\n          phone.

Another wall is taken\n          up by a huge shelf unit packed with books, videos, and CDs.\n          Joey's obsession with \"getting the whole story\" seems to be\n          true of her personal life as well as her professional.\n          \n          ANGLE ON TERRI\n          \n           - having finished her quick examination, she calls out.\n          \n                                     TERRI\n                        So ... what was your bad dream?\n          \n          Joey re-enters, carrying two mugs of coffee.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        What?\n          \n                                     TERRI\n                        Your dream.

It'd be good to\n                        see something else.  Have a nighttime\n                        life.  Be somebody different.\n          \n          Terri pauses, then smiles like she's just realized something.\n          \n                                     TERRI\n                        Hey ... this is great, isn't it?

You got a\n                        cigarette?\n          \n          Joey waits, letting herself catch up with Terri's good-natured\n          but marginally strung-out personality.  She looks around the\n          room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        Uh ...  yeah.  Yeah, somewhere.  Wait a\n                        minute.\n          \n          Joey crosses to the big shelf-unit and pulls out a concealed\n          pack of cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, and an ashtray from behind\n          a shelf of videos.  We notice that the videos are THE WORLD AT\n          WAR, volumes 1 thru 26.  She brings the smokes to Terri.\n          \n                                     TERRI\n                        Great.

Have one.  Fuck it.  You\n                        think you're going to live forever?\n          \n          She smiles and proffers the pack to Joey who shrugs, smiles,\n          and takes one.  Terri picks up the Zippo and sparks it. A huge\n          FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror\n          from Terri.  Joey pulls the lighter back from Terri and closes\n          the lid extinguishing the flame.  Terri draws a book of matches\n          from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        Sorry.

It's just someone burned me\n                        once.\n          \n          \n          \n                                                                      21\n          \n          Joey takes the book of matches from Terri's hands and lights\n          both cigarettes.  Terri takes a long, fearful look at the\n          burning flame and then takes a deep, calming drag of her\n          cigarette.\n          \n                                     TERRI\n                        Wanna know how I look at it?  Way I see\n                        it is ... you give up, right?  Three\n                        days later, you get hit by a fucking\n                        truck and you know - you just KNOW \u0096\n                        that your last thought as you go under\n                        those wheels'd be \"Jesus H.

It\n          has the same matt-black carbonized look as the pillar and is\n          recognizable as one of the \"carvings\" we saw on it.\n          \n          There is fine filigree pattern-work over each of its surfaces\n          and, to audiences familiar with the HELLRAISER movies, the box\n          is recognizable despite its black coating; it is the Lament\n          Configuration, the puzzle box that opens the doors to Hell.\n          \n          There is a stubby shard of material protruding from one side of\n          the box - presumably where the boy from ER had broken it off\n          the pillar.

The dim lighting of working hours has been\n          replaced with the sickly gleam of one or two fluorescent tubes\n          and the club has that eerie not-quite-right look that all night\n          places have when subjected to a harsher light.\n          \n                                                                      23\n          \n          Two WORKERS are in the final stages of clearing the night's\n          debris - emptying trash into big black plastic bags, wiping\n          down tables and bars etc.\n          \n          Work completed, they head to the main exit.\n          \n          One of them hits the light switches so that the fluorescent\n          clarity is again replaced by the more appropriate dim lighting.\n          The other shouts across the apparently deserted club.\n          \n                                     WORKER\n                        All done, Mr. Monroe.\n          \n          They stand a second but no response comes.

All the shelves are full.  She lays\n          them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins Joey at\n          the shelves, grabbing up the second folder.\n          \n                                                                      34\n          \n                                     TERRI\n                        What am I looking for?\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        God knows.

It's like fucking business papers\n                        for God's sake!\n          \n          Bored, Terri wanders off to lean against another shelf-unit.\n          \n          ANGLE OVER JOEY'S SHOULDER ON FOLDER\n          \n           - as she flicks through the contents.\n          \n          Terri's dismissive summary seems justified.  All Joey sees are\n          obscure and meaningless case-notes and paperwork.  Each item is\n          letter-headed THE CHANNARD INSTITUTE.\n          \n          Joey's hand reaches a large envelope.  Scrawled in hand across\n          it is the phrase DR. CHANNARD - PERSONAL PAPERS.  Joey draws\n          the contents out and begins to sift through them.\n          \n          The first item is a dusty, black-and-white photograph of an\n          officer in English Army uniform, circa 1920.  Joey blows the\n          dust from the photo.\n          \n          LOW ANGLE - ON BOX\n          \n           - which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight, the dust\n          from the photo settling next to it.\n          \n          ON JOEY\n          \n          The next photo is that of a beautiful young woman.  Joey flips\n          it over.  Gummed on the back is a type-written slip that says\n          COTTON, KIRSTY  CASE NO.  5719.\n          \n          ON BOX\n          \n          The sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard OFF\n          and then FADES as something strange begins to happen.\n          \n          Suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by\n          an invisible wind.  It is drawn up so that it forms an\n          impossible spiral in the air.  Spinning like a miniature\n          hurricane, it hovers over the box.  The sunlight seems to grow\n          brighter.  Is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or\n          is the box itself glowing and shining?\n          \n                                                                      35\n          \n          CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE\n          \n           - as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans ...\n          \n          Joey turns another item and her face registers surprise at what\n          she is seeing ...\n          \n          The next item in the folder is a Xerox sheet, a reproduction of\n          what appears to be an ancient document.\n          \n          It is a diagram, like a designer's drawing or plan.

She\n          is the same basic type as Terri; blonde, frail, young.  Too\n          young, in fact, to be legally in a club like this.\n          \n          Sandy stares at her empty glass - and stares at it wistfully\n          enough to suggest she doesn't have the money to get it\n          refilled.  She is trying to keep up a cool impassive face but\n          her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character.\n          \n          REVERSE ANGLE\n          \n          Sitting at the opposite end of the bar, his eye-line confirming\n          he is looking at Sandy, is JP Monroe.\n          \n          The bar-stool beside JP is occupied by a TEENAGE BOY who has\n          his back to the bar and is talking to a GROUP of his FRIENDS.\n          \n          JP has a speculative, predatory look on his face.  Without\n          shifting his gaze, he raises his hand and within seconds the\n          BARMAN is leaning over to hear his request.\n          \n          CLOSE on Sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her.  Laid\n          alongside the glass is a beautiful long-stemmed red rose.\n          \n          Sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight\n          at the rose.  She raises her eyes and looks across the bar.\n          \n          JP returns the smile.\n          \n          He turns to the Boy beside him and murmurs something unheard.\n          \n          The boy glances round, as if ready to argue with whoever is\n          speaking to him.  On recognizing JP, however, he vacates the\n          seat without an argument and stands to join his friends.\n          \n          JP looks back across the bar at Sandy and gestures at the empty\n          stool beside him, an attractive welcoming smile on his face.\n          \n          Sandy gets up and, carrying the drink and the rose, makes her\n          way across to sit beside JP.\n          \n          ANGLE ON JP AND SANDY\n          \n          The deafening music playing in the club means that they have to\n          lean in close to hear each other speak.\n          \n                                     JP\n                        Welcome.\n                                                                      38\n          \n                                     SANDY\n                        You're JP Monroe, right?\n          \n                                     JP\n                        Uh-huh.\n          \n                                     SANDY\n                        And this is your club.

Well,\n          maybe Sandy's making love.  JP's having sex.\n          \n          It is a selfish, phallocentric scene, concentrating on JP's\n          concern only for his own gratification.  It may be an erotic\n          sight, but it's not a pretty one.\n          \n          JP is on top.  He has hold of both Sandy's wrists in one of his\n          hands and his body is working away rhythmically.  He is half-\n          upright, looking down at her.

The\n          pillar seems to be in a process of becoming.  And the obvious\n          suggestion is that what it is becoming is Pinhead.\n          \n          Pinhead's head, arms, and torso now protrude from the pillar.\n          They are not completely free and - now that the \"eating\" of\n          Sandy is concluded - seem incapable of independent movement but\n          there is plainly a lot more of him than there was before.\n          \n          Even though the blue light has faded, Pinhead's face is\n          noticeably different.

What\n                        the Hell is going on?\n          \n                                     ELLIOTT\n                        Hell is precisely what is going on,\n                        Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I\n                        because of a special obligation, you\n                        because you're the only person who can\n                        help. And because you know what is\n                        right, and just, and true.  Will you\n                        walk with me a while?\n          \n          He gestures with his hand and they begin to walk.\n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n                                                                      72\n          \n                                     ELLIOTT\n                        There were days in this war, days right\n                        on top of each other, when the newly\n                        dead were numbered in the tens of\n                        thousands.  They called it the war to\n                        end all wars.  Though it didn't.  You\n                        know that.  There were more wars.  More\n                        dead.  Your father's war.  Your dream\n                        search for your father led you here.  To\n                        me.  Joey, we need to talk.\n          \n          Elliott does nothing dramatic - he doesn't clap his hands or\n          snap his fingers - but somehow, magically, he and Joey, without\n          moving or changing position are back in the Quonset hut.\n          \n          \n          INT.   QUONSET HUT\n          \n          The frozen Elliott is still sitting on the floor before the\n          box.  The mobile Elliott gestures at his frozen self as he\n          speaks to the bemused Joey.\n          \n                                     ELLIOTT\n                        The war pulled poetry out of some of us.\n                        Others it affected differently.  This is\n                        me a few years later.  We're in India,\n                        by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like\n                        many survivors. Lost souls with nothing\n                        left to believe in but gratification.\n                        We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many\n                        dead.  For us God, too, fell at\n                        Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And\n                        if we mourned, we mourned in silence.\n                        Thousands drank themselves to death.\n                        Others went further.  I went further.  I\n                        thought I was a lost soul.  But, until\n                        this frozen moment, I didn't even know\n                        what the phrase meant.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        And what is ... this frozen moment?\n          \n                                     ELLIOTT\n                        The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I\n                        am, what I will be ... past, present,\n                        future, all bound here at this timeless\n                        moment of decision.  I was an explorer\n                        of forbidden vices and pleasures.\n                        Opening the Box was my final act of\n                        exploration, of discovery.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        And what did you discover?\n          \n          \n                                                                      73\n          \n                                     ELLIOTT\n                        Something bad.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        And why are you back?

For decades I served\n                        Hell with no memory of my former life\n                        until a friend released me.

NIGHT\n          \n          Joey closes her door and switches on the light.  The mood is\n          suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town.

Maybe it's alright ...\n          maybe the monster isn't here ... maybe ...\n          \n          Magically, eerily, slowly, the Box begins to rise from Joey's\n          hand.

Back to the wall, quickly!\n          \n          Joey runs around then to the far wall - just in time because\n          now the pyrotechnics start.\n          \n          Elliott tightens his grip and (with a nice series of INTERCUT\n          CLOSE-UPS of these two alternative selves) the life-forces of\n          Elliott and Pinhead begin to erupt.\n          \n          ELECTRIC BLUE LIGHT begins to play over both their bodies.\n          It's apparently agonizing, both figures arching with the pain,\n          both faces grimacing.\n          \n          Joey watches, wincing in sympathetic agony.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        Elliott!

Moving on its own, linked across the\n          years to its earlier self.\n          \n          3)  Joey watching the movements in the Hut.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        Elliott? ...

I'm not\n                        really here ...\n          \n          Suddenly, small patterns of BLUE LIGHT arc across the Box,\n          shocking the Officer who drops the Box and then stares in shock\n          and fascination as ...\n          \n          On the floor, the box begins to open.\n          \n          The Officer kneels up and leans over the Box ...\n                                                                      90\n          \n          And the chains fly!  Shooting up from within and hooking\n          themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest.\n          \n          CLOSE ON the Officer's face, howling in agony.\n          \n          CLOSE ON Joey's face, sobbing in distress.  She throws up her\n          hands to hide the unbearable sight from herself and, when she\n          lowers them, ...\n          \n          \n          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.

Why should\n          she?  Everything's over.  But we notice, even if she doesn't,\n          that the Box is no longer there.  But we hardly have time to\n          register this before ...\n          \n          Joey opens the kitchen door.\n          \n                                     JOEY\n                        (SCREAMS!!!!)\n          \n          Pinhead is framed in the doorway.\n          \n          Behind him, instead of her kitchen, is the black space of Hell\n          - like the Torture Rooms in HELLRAISER and HELLBOUND, it is\n          full of shadowy pillars and chains.\n          \n                                     PINHEAD\n                        Oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years?\n          \n          Joey backs away, shaking her head in shocked denial.\n          \n          Pinhead moves forward, very leisurely.\n          \n                                     PINHEAD\n                        This will be so good, Joey.
