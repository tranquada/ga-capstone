Stores\n          are boarded-up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied.\n<b>          \n</b>          At various points, several BUMS warm their hands at trash-can\n          fires.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          ANGLE ON TWO BUMS\n</b><b>          \n</b>           - as their eyes move, following something moving down the\n          street.

A rich kid is\n          going shopping.\n<b>          \n</b>          The car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only\n          open store on the block.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          ANGLE ON STORE\n</b><b>          \n</b>          A dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the\n          store is still trading.  Its windows are grimy, its door\n          defaced.  Above the door - barely legible through the accrued\n          dirt of city years - a sign; CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES AND CURIOS.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          ANGLE ON CAR\n</b><b>          \n</b>          The side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an\n          expensive leather boot - and JP MONROE steps out.\n<b>          \n</b>          JP is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. His hair is slick with\n          designer-grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather\n          jacket.\n<b>          \n</b>          For a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous\n          glances up and down the ruined street.  He shows no anxiety at\n          being in this twilight part of town.  Cocooned in the\n          confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life.\n          Satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through\n          the doorway.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b><b>                                                                      2\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          INT.

It is\n          grimy, dusty, and dimly-lit - and apparently unattended.\n<b>          \n</b>          It is packed with merchandise - shelves and aisles overflow\n          onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through.\n<b>          \n</b>          The stock is a strange surreal mix.  Discarded items from 50's\n          America (Norge fridges, toasters, Frankie Lymon albums) share\n          space with older items; framed pictures, Victorian automata,\n          wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store?) items of punishment;\n          stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips.

Some he even runs his hands over - grimacing at\n          the dust and grime they leave on his fingers.  But his manner\n          suggests he is looking for something specific.\n<b>          \n</b>          Near the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of\n          vaudeville and travelling shows.

The pillar is extremely bizarre,\n          as if a New York avant-garde sculptor has interpreted a Totem\n          Pole for jaded modern tastes.  The carvings are of dead rats,\n          copulating skeletons,  filigree-patterned boxes, and faces.\n<b>          \n</b>          One of these faces - recognizable to the audience but not to JP\n          - is the ossified visage of PINHEAD, the demon from the first\n          two HELLRAISER pictures.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                                                      3\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          ANGLE ON JP\n</b><b>          \n</b>           - as he leans in to study this face, already fascinated by its\n          calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom.\n<b>          \n</b>          A voice OFF startles him.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                     BUM\n</b>                        You want it?\n<b>          \n</b>          JP whirls round in shock.

Lost souls with nothing\n                        left to believe in but gratification.\n                        We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many\n                        dead.  For us God, too, fell at\n                        Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And\n                        if we mourned, we mourned in silence.\n                        Thousands drank themselves to death.\n                        Others went further.  I went further.  I\n                        thought I was a lost soul.  But, until\n                        this frozen moment, I didn't even know\n                        what the phrase meant.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                     JOEY\n</b>                        And what is ... this frozen moment?\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                     ELLIOTT\n</b>                        The cusp of my life.
