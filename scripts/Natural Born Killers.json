COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n\n     A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back\n     turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We\n     hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF\n     SCREEN.\n\n     MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    What kind of pies do you have?\n\n                               MABEL\n                    Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    Which do you recommend?\n\n                               MABEL\n                    The key lime is great, but it's\n                    an acquired taste.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    I haven't had a key lime pie in ten\n                    years.\n\n                               MABEL\n                    When ya had it, did ya like it?\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    No, but that don't mean much. I was a\n                    completely different person ten years\n                    ago. Let's give key lime a day in\n                    court. And a large glass of milk.\n\n     Mabel turns to her right.\n \n                               MABEL\n                         (to someone O.S.)\n                    Should I make that two pieces?\n\n     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,\n     Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back\n     is to the camera as well.\n\n                               MALLORY\n                    Nada, Rosey.\n\n                               MABEL\n                         (annoyed)\n                    My name's not Rosey.\n                         (points at name tag)\n                    It's Mabel.\n\n     Mabel exits FRAME.\n\n                               MALLORY\n                    Whatever.\n\n     Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next\n     to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter,\n     she selects a quarter.\n\n                               MABEL\n                    Hey, what the hell do you think you're\n                    doin'?\n\n     Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes\n     follow Mallory, he loses his ball.\n\n     She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,\n     selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,\n     and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee\n     shop.\n\n     Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.\n\n                               MABEL\n                         (to Mickey)\n                    She ought not be doing that. That's\n                    for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.\n\n     CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time\n     we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    I can't take her anywhere.\n\n     Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee\n     shop. She's really cooking and smoking.\n\n     Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the\n     hell these people are.\n\n     Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his\n     pie and milk.\n\n     EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n\n     A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls\n     up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three\n     tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the\n     pickup's hood.\n\n                               EARL\n                    Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot.\n                    Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er\n                    out.\n\n     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n\n     The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in\n     their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of\n     Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.\n\n                               SONNY\n                    Good God almighty. What the hell is\n                    that?\n\n                               OTIS\n                    That's a bitch outta hell, son.\n\n     Otis and Sonny exchange looks.\n\n                               SONNY\n                    Take a run at 'er, kiddo.\n\n     Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next\n     to Mickey.\n\n                               SONNY\n                    Miller, Mabel.\n\n                               MABEL\n                    Comin' up.\n\n     Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's\n     doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see\n     him.\n\n     Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a\n     swig, enjoying the floor show.\n\n                               SONNY\n                         (to Mickey)\n                    That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't\n                    it?\n\n     Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression\n     betrays nothing.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    Her name's Mallory.\n\n     The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.\n\n     Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.\n\n                               OTIS\n                    Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar.\n                    I'm just getting warmed up.\n\n     Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to\n     Sonny.\n\n     Sonny gurgles out a laugh.\n\n                               SONNY\n                    Hey, I think she's sweet on you.\n\n     Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face\n     spinning him around.\n\n     Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.\n\n     Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the\n     table, cracking the linoleum.\n\n     Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.\n\n     Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches\n     hold of his shoulder.\n\n     Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points\n     his finger at him, threateningly.\n\n     Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife\n     out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.\n\n     Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand.\n     Blood flows from the wound.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    Just because my woman's mopping up the\n                    floor with your buddy is no reason for\n                    you to join in.\n\n     Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck\n     knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be\n     no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices\n     made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.\n\n     The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,\n     wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.\n\n     Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside\n     his jacket and FIRES.\n\n     BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It\n     HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to\n     the ground, screaming.\n\n     Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass\n     window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.\n\n     Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.\n\n     Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which\n     SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the\n     ground dead.\n\n     Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING\n     his head repeatedly on the floor.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    Honey.\n\n     Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to\n     Mickey's side.\n\n     Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his\n     cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee\n     pot, crying.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                         (to Mallory)\n                    Pick one.\n\n     Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth\n     from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.\n\n                               MALLORY\n                    Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a\n                    nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let\n                    him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My\n                    mom told me to pick the best one and\n                    you are it.\n\n     She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.\n\n                               MABEL\n                    NO!\n\n     Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot\n     Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She\n     hits the floor dead.\n\n     Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball\n     Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.\n\n                               MALLORY\n                    When you tell people what went on here,\n                    tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did\n                    this. Understand?\n\n     Pinball Cowboy nods yes.\n\n     The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths.\n     Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe.\n\n     CREDIT SEQUENCE:\n\n     INT.

JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY\n\n     WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la\n     Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail\n     visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty.\n     Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a\n     miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                         (into recorder)\n                    Testing one...two...three...\n                    testing...one...three...over,\n                    over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.\n\n     Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It\n     works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the\n     recorder in his sport coat jacket.\n\n     The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into\n     the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country\n     jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around\n     his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy\n     chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body\n     and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands\n     and feet are double cuffed.\n\n     The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in\n     half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound\n     in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.\n     Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,\n     jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,\n     intimidating, and fascinating figure.\n\n     Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                         (to himself)\n                    Showtime.\n\n     Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of\n     the glass.

And\n                    that time has definitely come.\n                         (pause)\n                    I feel it's apparent to anyone who's\n                    hip to what's going on that the prison\n                    board has thrown the constitution\n                    straight out the fuckin' window.\n                    You and Mallory may be killers, but\n                    you're not insane. You belong in a\n                    prison, not in an asylum. The prison\n                    board is blatantly railroading you into\n                    a hospital for the sole purpose of\n                    turning you into vegetables. Now some\n                    people are saying, 'So what?' I am not\n                    one of those people. If we avert our\n                    eyes while they do this to you, we give\n                    them permission to do it again whenever\n                    they see fit. Today they wipe clean\n                    your mind because they feel your\n                    actions are dangerous, tomorrow they\n                    wipe clean my mind because they feel\n                    what I say is dangerous. Where does\n                    it all stop?\n\n     No response from Mickey.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    My problem Mickey, is that you don't\n                    exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone\n                    on this. I need your help. I want\n                    what the prison board is doing to be\n                    the focus of our follow up episode.\n                    Now I have interviews with chairman of\n                    the prison board Dewight McClusky about\n                    this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,\n                    Mickey, he looks bad. The two\n                    psychologists they used for their\n                    psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk\n                    to us, which always looks bad. I have\n                    an interview with both the judge of\n                    your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the\n                    psychologist and author, Emil\n                    Reinghold, both of which discount the\n                    notion that you're insane. You put\n                    that all together, and what the state\n                    is doing becomes obvious. But the\n                    network isn't satisfied. They feel the\n                    show needs another element. It needs\n                    you. In order to put the show on the\n                    air, I need to get an interview with\n                    you. You haven't talked to the press\n                    since your trial. Now, a few days\n                    before you get transferred to an\n                    asylum, you grant an interview on\n                    television with Wayne Gayle. We're\n                    talkin' a media event here. Every son\n                    of a bitch out the with a TV set's\n                    gonna tune in to see that.\n                    We'll make their motives so blatant,\n                    we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole\n                    thing. At least for a little while,\n                    the publicity would keep them from just\n                    giving you and Mallory lobotomies.\n                    Well, whatta ya say?\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    Have you talked to Mallory about this?\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    She won't even see me, Mickey. Now\n                    you're not supposed to know anything\n                    about what's going on with her, but I'm\n                    gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you\n                    two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't\n                    spoken one word.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    She doesn't talk?\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    Not to anybody. She sings.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    She sings? What does she sing?\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The\n                    Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty\n                    Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be\n                    With You'. That's what I hear anyway.\n                    Her behaviour was the main thing the\n                    doctors' report used against you. So\n                    even if she would see me, which she\n                    won't, I couldn't put her on camera\n                    anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are\n                    you insane?' And she starts singing\n                    'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road',\n                    that blows our whole case.\n\n     Mickey cracks a smile.\n\n     The guards come over to take him away.\n\n                               DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)\n                    Time, motherfucker!\n\n     They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair.

Roger's never seen without his\n     recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie\n     always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are\n     all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's\n     stylish yuppie demeanour.\n\n     Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle.

This is Wallace with Noriega,\n                    this is Elton John confessing his\n                    bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this\n                    is the tearful reporting of the\n                    Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut\n                    setting the record straight on\n                    Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo,\n                    this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting\n                    Deep Throat in an underground parking\n                    lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The\n                    Ten Days That Shook The World', this is\n                    the hippies' bloody palms at Kent\n                    State, the Maysles brothers at\n                    Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost\n                    interviews...\n\n                               ROGER\n                    This is Raymond Burr witnessing the\n                    destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.\n\n     Everybody laughs.\n\n                               SCOTT\n                    What's the schedule, mein fuehre?\n\n     As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook.\n     She never speaks, just writes.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    We got tonight and tomorrow to get our\n                    shit together.

The last thing they\n                    expected was Mickey Knox to get up\n                    close and personal. They wanted a\n                    follow up episode and would've taken\n                    anything I had given them. I'm not\n                    gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna\n                    make him think his grey matter depends\n                    on it.

These two people\n                    can't see each other, yet they know\n                    they're there.

But\n                    I felt an operatic love story needed an\n                    operatic ending. The two of them kill\n                    for each other. They offer the death\n                    of their victims to each other like\n                    other lovers offer flowers or bon bons.\n                    So what more natural, what more\n                    organic, what more poetic than Mallory\n                    offering her death to Mickey? It's\n                    where it's been leading since day one.\n                    We worked it in the movie by using a\n                    what if they escaped situation. I\n                    think it works beautifully. You'd be\n                    surprised. People come up to me at the\n                    end of the movie in tears.\n\n     EXT.

From time to time, she sips from a coffee cup. Her name\n     appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.\n\n                               BUFFY\n                    I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I\n                    didn't play her as a butcher. I played\n                    her as a woman in love, who also\n                    happens to murder people. I didn't\n                    want her to be at arm's length from the\n                    audience or myself. If you play her as\n                    this wild maniac, the audience never\n                    has to deal with her. If you see a\n                    decapitation in a movie, you just say\n                    'Oh wow, a neat special effect.'\n                    Because you can't relate to a\n                    decapitation. It doesn't mean anything\n                    to anybody because it's not personal.\n                    Decapitations don't fall into most\n                    people's realm of life experiences.\n                    But if you show somebody in a movie\n                    getting a paper cut, the whole audience\n                    squirms. Because everybody can relate\n                    to a paper cut.\n\n                               WAYNE (O.S.)\n                    Did you meet the real Mallory Knox?\n\n                               BUFFY\n                    I tried to, but she wouldn't see me.\n                    But I read some letters she wrote to\n                    Mickey before the murder spree.

REINGHOLD\n                    Well, for one, the media has done a\n                    tremendous job of turning the husband\n                    and wife mass murderers into\n                    celebrities. But it's the country's\n                    youth who have turned the couple into\n                    the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,\n                    the very thing that makes them most\n                    lethal is the exact same thing that\n                    captures the public's hearts and\n                    minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic\n                    devotion to each other. In a world\n                    where people can't seem to make the\n                    simplest relationships work and the\n                    slightest emotional commitment is\n                    considered devastating, Mick and\n                    Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a\n                    Shakespearean magnitude. To the\n                    country's youth, 75 percent of which\n                    are coming from broken homes, that's\n                    appealing. They have an 'us against\n                    the world' posture which always appeals\n                    to youth. And they've taken that\n                    posture seventeen steps beyond.\n                    It's not 'us against the world,' it's\n                    'we're gonna kill the world.' They're\n                    exciting. I read their file and I find\n                    myself turning the page like it was a\n                    paperback. Why do disillusioned youths\n                    get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do\n                    disillusioned housewives read romance\n                    novels? Why are you filming this\n                    special? Because you know as well as I\n                    do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles\n                    Manson speaks,' everybody's going to\n                    tune in to hear what he says. Mickey\n                    and Mallory have shocked a country numb\n                    with violence. They've created a world\n                    where only two exist and anybody who\n                    inadvertently enters that world is\n                    murdered.\n\n     EXT.

SHOT of Wayne and Judge talking.\n\n                               WAYNE (V.O.)\n                    We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at\n                    his home in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n     The interview:\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    Was there any vengeance on your part\n                    with your unique sentence?\n\n                               JUDGE STEINSMA\n                    Yes, unquestionably. After they did\n                    what they did in my court, and judge\n                    worth his robe will tell you the same\n                    thing. It couldn't help but affect my\n                    decision. That's why they have judges.\n                    We're supposed to be fair to a fault,\n                    but when it's showtime, we have to make\n                    a decision. That's why we don't just\n                    input all the facts into a computer for\n                    the appropriate punishment. I couldn't\n                    give them the death penalty. See,\n                    California hops back and forth on that\n                    issue. Mickey and Mallory went to\n                    court when it was out of favor, which\n                    is actually good because it leaves more\n                    room for imagination. Anybody can give\n                    somebody the chair. When you have\n                    someone who deserves to die and you\n                    can't kill them, you have to be\n                    creative. And if the bastards had let\n                    it stand, it would of been the perfect\n                    sentence. It hit 'em right where they\n                    lived. Far more punishing than the\n                    death sentence.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    Would you please describe for our\n                    viewers what your sentence was?\n\n                               JUDGE STEINSMA\n                    Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,\n                    Mickey and Mallory are very unique.\n                    I've seen a lot of killers in my day\n                    and they're a very cold lot. They have\n                    no more feelings about taking a\n                    person's life than squashing a tiny\n                    bug. It's all the same to them. Well,\n                    Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em\n                    to watch their expression change'\n                    attitude personified. Except with each\n                    other. And, since they lived only for\n                    each other, I wanted to attack that, at\n                    its very root. So, in a nutshell, my\n                    sentence was double life for each\n                    without any possibility for parole.\n                    That would be fairly standard in their\n                    case. The twist I added was that the\n                    husband and wife would have no contact\n                    or correspondence with each other for\n                    the rest of their lives. And they\n                    would never receive any word or\n                    information about the other.\n                    So, basically once the cell door slams\n                    shut, Mickey and Mallory will\n                    completely disappear from each other's\n                    life. They'll never know when the\n                    other dies. But alas, the best laid\n                    plans of mice and men...\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.

We're the\n                    who. The why is simple. Mickey and\n                    Mallory are mentally ill and need to be\n                    under a doctor's care, where hopefully\n                    they'll receive the help they need.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    Mickey and Mallory were deemed\n                    competent in a mental examination\n                    before their trial. I'm confused.\n                    What's changed?\n\n                               MCCLUSKY\n                    Well, since that time, they've killed\n                    one person during their trail. And\n                    since their incarceration, they've\n                    killed one psychologist along with\n                    several guards and inmates.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    When they were found competent before,\n                    they had already killed fifty people.\n                    Other than the fact they're a\n                    disciplinary problem, which frankly\n                    shouldn't surprise anyone, I still\n                    don't see where this situation is any\n                    different then it was before. So, I\n                    ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's\n                    changed?\n\n                               MCCLUSKY\n                    What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our\n                    minds. We felt they were competent a\n                    year ago. A year has passed, sir, a\n                    year where they were under close\n                    observation, day in and day out, and\n                    their behaviour has led us to believe we\n                    were wrong.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    Who is we?\n\n                               MCCLUSKY\n                    The prison board and the doctors who\n                    examined them.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    Were any of the doctors who made the\n                    first evaluation on the Knoxs mental\n                    state asked to re-examine them?\n\n                               MCCLUSKY\n                    Using the same doctors is not common\n                    practice.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    I take it by your answer it was a whole\n                    new team?\n\n                               MCCLUSKY\n                    Now that you bring it up, yes. They\n                    were different men. I hadn't really\n                    thought that much about it. Since many\n                    psychiatric opinions are, by a rule,\n                    sought out for this kind of situation.\n                    What do you think normally happens?\n                    The Knoxs are assigned a family\n                    psychologist that takes care of them\n                    throughout the rest of their lives?\n                    The state doesn't work like that.\n\n     PHOTO: of DR. ALBERT RODRIGUEZ.\n\n                               WAYNE (V.O.)\n                    The two psychiatric opinions the board\n                    sought were those of Albert\n                    Rodriguez...\n\n     PHOTO: of DR. FELIX VARGUS.\n\n                               WAYNE (V.O.)\n                    ...and Dr. Felix Vargus. Both of the\n                    good doctors, for whatever reason,\n                    refused to be interviewed.\n\n     INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.\n\n                               DR. REINGHOLD\n                    It's a funny situation actually. If\n                    anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give\n                    a damn, what the prison board is doing\n                    would be considered an outrage. The\n                    prison board is basically saying, 'We\n                    can't handle these guys.' They've\n                    moved 'em around twice since their\n                    sentence started.\n                    They were a handful everywhere they\n                    went. Now the prisons they're at now\n                    want them outta there. But no other\n                    prison's gonna be stupid enough to take\n                    'em. So the prison board is left\n                    scratching their heads wondering what\n                    they're gonna do. Well, what they\n                    decided to do was to set up a kangaroo\n                    medical court that found them crazy.\n                    Then they get them transferred to\n                    Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay\n                    as it's referred to in the psychiatric\n                    circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and\n                    electro shock diet, and Mickey and\n                    Mallory cease to be a problem to\n                    anybody except the orderlies who clean\n                    out the bedpans, which if you want to\n                    see them get theirs, that's all well\n                    and good. But there's something being\n                    said here. Forget the immorality for a\n                    second. Forget the corruption and the\n                    skulduggery involved. What the board\n                    is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and\n                    Mallory ran amuck in polite society.\n                    They were put in an alternative society\n                    and they ran amuck there, too. All the\n                    powers that be, can't deal with these\n                    two kids. And whatever can't be\n                    assimilated has to be terminated.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory\n                    are not insane?\n\n                               DR. REINGHOLD\n                    Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace\n                    to living creatures, yes. But to\n                    suggest that they're insane gives the\n                    impression that they don't know right\n                    from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know\n                    the difference between right and wrong.\n                    They just don't give a damn.\n\n     FREEZE FRAME on Dr. Reinghold.\n\n     INT.

HOLDING CELL - DAY\n\n     CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The\n     cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring\n     Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind.\n\n     Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to\n     Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's\n     wrists.\n\n     Mallory's silent.\n\n     Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette.\n\n                               BINGHAM\n                    Turn around and face the wall!\n\n     Mallory does.\n\n     Bingham and Washington move to the door.\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                    Wait outside for a second, fellas.\n\n                               BINGHAM\n                    We're not supposed---\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                    Don't worry about it.\n\n     Bingham and Washington move outside.\n\n     Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before\n     they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door.\n\n     Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back\n     to him.\n\n     Scagnetti walks up behind her.\n\n     Mallory doesn't move.\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                    Want a smoke?\n\n     Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti.\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                    C'mon, I already lit one for you.

It also says that when they\n                    gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey'\n                    was the only thing you said that\n                    registered as the truth.\n\n     Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                    Who are you supposed to be?

Or does he just\n                    got a big dick?\n\n     Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear.\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                    That's it, isn't it?

You're gonna sit here for a\n                    couple hours while I finish up the\n                    arrangements. The reason they picked\n                    me to be your chaperone is they know I\n                    won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.\n                     \n     Scagnetti has Mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders.\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                    So, during our journey, if any wild\n                    hairs spring up on your ass, you'd\n                    better slap a muzzle on 'em!

As we hear the CRACKING of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a\n     horrible scream.\n\n     EXT. HOLDING CELL - DAY\n\n     Bingham and Washington fumble with the keys to open the cell\n     door.\n\n     INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY\n\n     Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti\n     face down on the ground.\n\n     Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of\n     Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break\n     his back. His body is bending like a branch, and he's\n     screaming.\n\n     The two deputies proceed to BEAT the shit out of her with their\n     shotguns.\n\n     Scagnetti rolls around in the B.G., holding his bloody nose,\n     screaming.\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                    She broke my fucking nose! That bitch\n                    broke my nose!\n\n     Washington comes over to him and helps him up.\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                         (blood down his face)\n                    She broke my nose.\n\n                               WASHINGTON\n                    I'll fix it.\n\n     He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then SNAPS it back into place.\n     Scagnetti lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down\n     from the pain.\n\n     When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down\n     from his face, looking over at Mallory.\n\n     Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun\n     barrel placed in her mouth.\n\n     CU on Scagnetti. He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled.\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                    Hold her, boys.\n\n     Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is. The shotgun\n     barrel's out of her mouth. Bingham and Washington stand on\n     either side of her, holding her in place.\n\n     Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings\n     it up to Mallory's face.\n\n     Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.\n\n     Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face,\n     eyes, and all over her body.\n\n     Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony.\n\n     TWO SHOT of Bingham and Washington looking down at Mallory on\n     the ground. We can hear Scagnetti still spraying her. They\n     can't look at this anymore.\n\n     Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her\n     all over her body.\n\n     CU of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling. We hear the SOUND of the\n     can of mace running empty. It spurts to a stop.\n\n     Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies. He hands the empty can\n     back to Washington.\n\n                               SCAGNETTI\n                    I want this filled before we leave.\n\n     The three men walk out of the holding cell, closing and locking\n     the door behind them. We can still hear Mallory's screams of\n     excruciating pain.\n\n     INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY\n\n     Mickey's sitting in a chair eating a donut. Roger's attaching a\n     microphone to his shirt.

And I\n                    ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a\n                    Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon\n                    as I held that baby in my hands, I knew\n                    what I was gonna do. It felt so good.\n                    It felt like it was a part of me. They\n                    had a mirror in the store. I looked at\n                    myself holding it, and looked so\n                    fuckin' good, I immediately bought it.\n                    Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.\n                    Turned my car around, drove to\n                    Mallory's house, we took care of\n                    Mallory's parents, packed up the car,\n                    and we were off.\n\n                                                    DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     SAME SCENE: SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:\n\n     MEDIUM CU on Mickey.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The\n                    cops, my mom, everybody. But you see,\n                    they all missed the point of the story.\n                    I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding\n                    the shotgun, it all became clear. I\n                    realized for the first time my one true\n                    calling in life. I'm a natural born\n                    killer.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    Okay, let's cut it.\n\n     BACK TO: COLOR 35mm\n\n                               WAYNE\n                         (to Scott)\n                    Did ya get that?\n\n     Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook.

I'd go\n                    straight to my buddy, the mayor, and\n                    make sure everyone of those son of a\n                    bitches down there ends up on the\n                    unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue\n                    every man down there personally. I\n                    would make it my life's ambition to\n                    bring the LA County Jail to its knees.\n                    I would do expose after expose on the\n                    brutality, and the conditions, and the\n                    inhumanity that exists here.\n\n     Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan.\n     Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape\n     around the barrel of his shotgun.\n\n                               MICKEY\n                    That's what I thought. You tell them\n                    that. When we go down those stairs, I\n                    want you to scream what you just told\n                    me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle!

What's your name?\n\n     Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape. Mallory\n     grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before\n     reading his name badge.\n\n                               MALLORY\n                    Duncan...Homolka?\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n\n     INT.

The pistol in\n     her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer.\n\n     Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he\n     monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.\n\n     NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE\n     and COLOR 35mm.\n\n     Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA\n     on Wurlitzer.

Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their\n     speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep\n     their weapons ready.\n\n     Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.\n\n                               MALLORY\n                    Don't stop!\n\n     Wayne starts up again.\n\n     The deputies are completely frustrated.

COUNTY JAIL - DAY\n\n     The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey,\n     Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open\n     air.\n\n     A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while\n     Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.\n\n     FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.\n\n     Image DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE\n     LEADER.\n\n     EXT. WOODS - DAY\n\n     The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &\n     WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being\n     filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a\n     fence post.\n\n     This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not\n     in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly\n     into the CAMERA.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and\n                    my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.\n                    This may be out of sync 'cause we are\n                    shooting with a wild camera and a\n                    standard recorder we found in the van.\n                    Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked\n                    out the front door, into my news van\n                    and made our getaway. When we were\n                    followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox\n                    killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka\n                    and tossed his body out of the back.\n                    Mickey told authorities over my police\n                    band that I would surely be next if\n                    they didn't give up the pursuit. They\n                    took Mickey at his word and called off\n                    the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't\n                    employed, I don't know. My only\n                    thought is it all happened too fast for\n                    arrangements to be made. We've just\n                    pulled off to the side of the road to\n                    do this interview. Tensions run high--\n\n     Mickey screams O.S.\n\n                               MICKEY (O.S.)\n                    We ain't got all fuckin' day!\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    Without any further ado, Mickey and\n                    Mallory...\n\n     Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting\n     his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.\n\n     CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces\n     in and out of FRAME in the B.G.\n\n                               WAYNE\n                    Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's\n                    plan?

When we got out of the\n                    stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my\n                    God. This might work.' But\n                    Mickey knew it would work all along.\n                    There wasn't any doubt in his mind.\n                    It's not like there was and he just\n                    didn't show it. He knew it would work.\n\n                               WAYNE (O.S.)\n                    What did you think then?\n\n                               MALLORY\n                    I wondered how long it would be before\n                    we'd get to be alone together.

But it won't be you starin'\n                    in the camera, looking dumb, and acting\n                    stupid. Instead, you're gonna be\n                    starin' down the barrels of our\n                    shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the\n                    triggers.\n\n     Wayne forces a chuckle.
