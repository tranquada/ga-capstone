As his eyes\n     follow Mallory, he loses his ball.\n\n     She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,\n     selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,\n     and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee\n     shop.\n\n     Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.\n\n<b>                               MABEL\n</b>                         (to Mickey)\n                    She ought not be doing that.

She's really cooking and smoking.\n\n     Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the\n     hell these people are.\n\n     Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his\n     pie and milk.\n\n<b>     EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n</b>\n     A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls\n     up to the coffee shop.

Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see\n     him.\n\n     Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a\n     swig, enjoying the floor show.\n\n<b>                               SONNY\n</b>                         (to Mickey)\n                    That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't\n                    it?\n\n     Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny.

He grabs his aching hand.\n     Blood flows from the wound.\n\n<b>                               MICKEY\n</b>                    Just because my woman's mopping up the\n                    floor with your buddy is no reason for\n                    you to join in.\n\n     Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck\n     knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be\n     no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices\n     made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.\n\n     The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,\n     wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.\n\n     Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside\n     his jacket and FIRES.\n\n     BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It\n     HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to\n     the ground, screaming.\n\n     Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass\n     window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.\n\n     Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.\n\n     Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which\n     SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the\n     ground dead.\n\n     Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING\n     his head repeatedly on the floor.\n\n<b>                               MICKEY\n</b>                    Honey.\n\n     Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to\n     Mickey's side.\n\n     Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his\n     cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee\n     pot, crying.\n\n<b>                               MICKEY\n</b>                         (to Mallory)\n                    Pick one.\n\n     Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth\n     from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.\n\n<b>                               MALLORY\n</b>                    Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a\n                    nigger by the tow.

The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot\n     Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She\n     hits the floor dead.\n\n     Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball\n     Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.\n\n<b>                               MALLORY\n</b>                    When you tell people what went on here,\n                    tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did\n                    this.

You belong in a\n                    prison, not in an asylum. The prison\n                    board is blatantly railroading you into\n                    a hospital for the sole purpose of\n                    turning you into vegetables. Now some\n                    people are saying, 'So what?' I am not\n                    one of those people. If we avert our\n                    eyes while they do this to you, we give\n                    them permission to do it again whenever\n                    they see fit.

I'm all alone\n                    on this. I need your help. I want\n                    what the prison board is doing to be\n                    the focus of our follow up episode.\n                    Now I have interviews with chairman of\n                    the prison board Dewight McClusky about\n                    this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,\n                    Mickey, he looks bad. The two\n                    psychologists they used for their\n                    psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk\n                    to us, which always looks bad. I have\n                    an interview with both the judge of\n                    your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the\n                    psychologist and author, Emil\n                    Reinghold, both of which discount the\n                    notion that you're insane. You put\n                    that all together, and what the state\n                    is doing becomes obvious. But the\n                    network isn't satisfied. They feel the\n                    show needs another element. It needs\n                    you. In order to put the show on the\n                    air, I need to get an interview with\n                    you. You haven't talked to the press\n                    since your trial. Now, a few days\n                    before you get transferred to an\n                    asylum, you grant an interview on\n                    television with Wayne Gayle.

At least for a little while,\n                    the publicity would keep them from just\n                    giving you and Mallory lobotomies.\n                    Well, whatta ya say?\n\n<b>                               MICKEY\n</b>                    Have you talked to Mallory about this?\n\n<b>                               WAYNE\n</b>                    She won't even see me, Mickey.

But it's the country's\n                    youth who have turned the couple into\n                    the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,\n                    the very thing that makes them most\n                    lethal is the exact same thing that\n                    captures the public's hearts and\n                    minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic\n                    devotion to each other. In a world\n                    where people can't seem to make the\n                    simplest relationships work and the\n                    slightest emotional commitment is\n                    considered devastating, Mick and\n                    Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a\n                    Shakespearean magnitude. To the\n                    country's youth, 75 percent of which\n                    are coming from broken homes, that's\n                    appealing. They have an 'us against\n                    the world' posture which always appeals\n                    to youth. And they've taken that\n                    posture seventeen steps beyond.\n                    It's not 'us against the world,' it's\n                    'we're gonna kill the world.' They're\n                    exciting. I read their file and I find\n                    myself turning the page like it was a\n                    paperback.

After they did\n                    what they did in my court, and judge\n                    worth his robe will tell you the same\n                    thing. It couldn't help but affect my\n                    decision. That's why they have judges.\n                    We're supposed to be fair to a fault,\n                    but when it's showtime, we have to make\n                    a decision. That's why we don't just\n                    input all the facts into a computer for\n                    the appropriate punishment. I couldn't\n                    give them the death penalty. See,\n                    California hops back and forth on that\n                    issue. Mickey and Mallory went to\n                    court when it was out of favor, which\n                    is actually good because it leaves more\n                    room for imagination. Anybody can give\n                    somebody the chair. When you have\n                    someone who deserves to die and you\n                    can't kill them, you have to be\n                    creative. And if the bastards had let\n                    it stand, it would of been the perfect\n                    sentence. It hit 'em right where they\n                    lived. Far more punishing than the\n                    death sentence.\n\n<b>                               WAYNE\n</b>                    Would you please describe for our\n                    viewers what your sentence was?\n\n<b>                               JUDGE STEINSMA\n</b>                    Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,\n                    Mickey and Mallory are very unique.\n                    I've seen a lot of killers in my day\n                    and they're a very cold lot. They have\n                    no more feelings about taking a\n                    person's life than squashing a tiny\n                    bug. It's all the same to them. Well,\n                    Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em\n                    to watch their expression change'\n                    attitude personified. Except with each\n                    other. And, since they lived only for\n                    each other, I wanted to attack that, at\n                    its very root. So, in a nutshell, my\n                    sentence was double life for each\n                    without any possibility for parole.\n                    That would be fairly standard in their\n                    case. The twist I added was that the\n                    husband and wife would have no contact\n                    or correspondence with each other for\n                    the rest of their lives. And they\n                    would never receive any word or\n                    information about the other.\n                    So, basically once the cell door slams\n                    shut, Mickey and Mallory will\n                    completely disappear from each other's\n                    life. They'll never know when the\n                    other dies. But alas, the best laid\n                    plans of mice and men...\n\n<b>                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT.

Mickey and\n                    Mallory are mentally ill and need to be\n                    under a doctor's care, where hopefully\n                    they'll receive the help they need.\n\n<b>                               WAYNE\n</b>                    Mickey and Mallory were deemed\n                    competent in a mental examination\n                    before their trial.

He's laughing.\n\n<b>                               DR. REINGHOLD\n</b>                    It's a funny situation actually. If\n                    anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give\n                    a damn, what the prison board is doing\n                    would be considered an outrage. The\n                    prison board is basically saying, 'We\n                    can't handle these guys.' They've\n                    moved 'em around twice since their\n                    sentence started.\n                    They were a handful everywhere they\n                    went. Now the prisons they're at now\n                    want them outta there. But no other\n                    prison's gonna be stupid enough to take\n                    'em. So the prison board is left\n                    scratching their heads wondering what\n                    they're gonna do. Well, what they\n                    decided to do was to set up a kangaroo\n                    medical court that found them crazy.\n                    Then they get them transferred to\n                    Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay\n                    as it's referred to in the psychiatric\n                    circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and\n                    electro shock diet, and Mickey and\n                    Mallory cease to be a problem to\n                    anybody except the orderlies who clean\n                    out the bedpans, which if you want to\n                    see them get theirs, that's all well\n                    and good. But there's something being\n                    said here. Forget the immorality for a\n                    second. Forget the corruption and the\n                    skulduggery involved. What the board\n                    is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and\n                    Mallory ran amuck in polite society.\n                    They were put in an alternative society\n                    and they ran amuck there, too. All the\n                    powers that be, can't deal with these\n                    two kids. And whatever can't be\n                    assimilated has to be terminated.\n\n<b>                               WAYNE\n</b>                    So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory\n                    are not insane?\n\n<b>                               DR.

But to\n                    suggest that they're insane gives the\n                    impression that they don't know right\n                    from wrong.

My only\n                    thought is it all happened too fast for\n                    arrangements to be made. We've just\n                    pulled off to the side of the road to\n                    do this interview. Tensions run high--\n\n     Mickey screams O.S.\n\n<b>                               MICKEY (O.S.)\n</b>                    We ain't got all fuckin' day!\n\n<b>                               WAYNE\n</b>                    Without any further ado, Mickey and\n                    Mallory...\n\n     Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting\n     his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.\n\n     CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces\n     in and out of FRAME in the B.G.\n\n<b>                               WAYNE\n</b>                    Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's\n                    plan?

When we got out of the\n                    stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my\n                    God. This might work.' But\n                    Mickey knew it would work all along.\n                    There wasn't any doubt in his mind.\n                    It's not like there was and he just\n                    didn't show it.

And I\n                    wondered if I could wait that long.\n\n<b>                               WAYNE (O.S.)\n</b>                    Did you have anything to do with the\n                    riot in the laundry room?\n\n<b>                               MALLORY\n</b>                    Haven't you been listening to a fuckin'\n                    word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry.

But it won't be you starin'\n                    in the camera, looking dumb, and acting\n                    stupid. Instead, you're gonna be\n                    starin' down the barrels of our\n                    shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the\n                    triggers.\n\n     Wayne forces a chuckle.
