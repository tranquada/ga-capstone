Dean rolls on top of her.

Dean kisses her neck.\r\n                         \r\n                          DEAN (CONT'D)\r\n           Do you... you want to have another baby?\r\n           ... I want another child.\r\n                         \r\n           Cindy bites her lip. He slides his hand between her legs.\r\n                         \r\n                          CINDY\r\n           No... Dean... Wait a second.\r\n                         \r\n           She removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues\r\n           to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy\r\n           turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand\r\n           away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms \r\n           underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over\r\n           her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her\r\n           face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She\r\n           arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis\r\n           pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into\r\n           her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his\r\n           forehead.\r\n                         \r\n                          DEAN\r\n           What!?

I'm good to\r\n           you. I'm good to Frankie. I deserve a\r\n           little affection. Do you want me to stop\r\n           loving you? Do you want me to fuck other\r\n           women?

She lifts\r\n           the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door\r\n           jam. Her arm falls over her eyes. Breathless, Dean awkwardly\r\n           moves one hand up and down her bodice.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 57.\r\n                         93 CONTINUED: (4) 93\r\n                         \r\n           He unbuckles his belt, pushes his pants and underwear down to\r\n           his knees, holds himself in his hand. He lowers onto her.\r\n           Cindy adjusts her legs higher. He rotates his hips, looks\r\n           away in concentration. Cindy's arms move around him, grabbing\r\n           the small of his arching back. His pelvis humps in a feeble\r\n           performance. A small moan. Cindy's eyes press closed harder.\r\n           The erratic motion slows... stops. Dean's raspy breathing.\r\n           His weight covers Cindy. She opens her eyes to the ceiling. \r\n                         \r\n                          DEAN (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...\r\n                         \r\n           She looks at him. His head faces away. She rolls out from\r\n           underneath and stands. She wraps her dress around her and\r\n           slips into the bedroom.\r\n                         \r\n           INT.

Her eyes\r\n           shift from despair to relief. Her gaze grows more wild. The\r\n           doorknob jiggles. A secret, crazy laugh builds in Cindy that\r\n           she suppresses. Dean presses his face into the bedroom door. \r\n           He talks to her. \r\n                         \r\n           On the other side of the door, Cindy listens. Dean's voice\r\n           cracks. A wave of confusion backs Cindy away from the door.\r\n           She searches the room for an escape. There are no windows,\r\n           the only way out is through the locked door. Trembling, she\r\n           wraps her arms around herself. She tries to make herself as\r\n           small as possible. The spaceship bed is the only place where\r\n           she can disappear. She crawls underneath the covers, curls\r\n           into a tight ball. Sadness lets loose. Cindy's body pulses\r\n           with faint, painful tears. The black walls of the room\r\n           twinkle with stars suspended in space. The cries get lost.\r\n                         \r\n           EXT. CITY.

It is\r\n           cold enough to see their breath. Their hands caress each\r\n           other, feel what is underneath the layers of clothes. Cindy\r\n           makes a move. She unbuttons Dean's Pea-Coat, feels the shape\r\n           of his chest, his abdomen, his back.\r\n                         \r\n                          CINDY\r\n           Are my hands cold?\r\n                         \r\n                          DEAN\r\n           Yes.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 58.\r\n                         95 CONTINUED: 95\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           Dean follows suit, reaching up under her jacket to touch the\r\n           skin on her lower back.

They can't keep their hands off each other. Dean makes a\r\n           bed for them on the couch where he sleeps - straightening out\r\n           a couple white sheets.

Cindy releases her laugh. Dean tries to shush\r\n           her, but he can't help laughing himself.\r\n                         \r\n                          DEAN (CONT'D)\r\n           Be quiet!

He touches the bristles of\r\n           Cindy's toothbrush, flicking up a spray of water. - He walks\r\n           to the kitchen and lights a cigarette. He coughs a little as\r\n           he pours himself a cup of coffee. Zaps it in the microwave.\r\n                         \r\n           EXT.

His stare is out\r\n           of focus. He turns on the TV. Volume comes up loud. The TV\r\n           illuminates the note left by Cindy. Dean stares at it for a\r\n           moment.

He searches for\r\n           a lighter. He lights his cigarette on the stove.

So he squeezes through the receptionist window, feels\r\n           underneath the desk for the door release button. Tony yanks\r\n           on the door.

Dean\r\n           pummels the back of Bobby's head with blind overhead rights.\r\n           It becomes clear that Bobby has the upper hand.
