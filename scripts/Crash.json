AIRFIELD -- DAY\n</b>\n               We are moving through a small airfield full of parked light \n               planes. There are no people around. We move through the \n               cluster of planes toward a hangar on the edge of the field.\n\n<b>               INT. HANGAR -- DAY\n</b>\n               We are still moving through light planes, but now we are \n               inside the hangar. Some of the planes have their engine covers \n               open, parts strewn around. Others are partially covered with \n               tarps or have sections missing. There is even a sleek \n               executive jet parked in one corner.\n\n               As we float past the planes we notice a woman leaning against \n               the wing of a Piper Cub, her chest against the wing's trailing \n               edge, her arms spread out to each side, as though flying \n               herself. As we get closer we see that her jacket is pulled \n               open to expose one of her breasts, which rests on the metal \n               of the wing.\n\n               CU breast on metal. CU hard nipple and rivets.\n\n               CU woman -- Catherine. Early thirties, dark, short hair, \n               stylish executive clothes. Her eyes are wide open but \n               unfocussed. A hand grips her shoulder from behind. We follow \n               the hand down behind Catherine and discover a man crouched \n               behind her, kissing her back.\n\n               Catherine is standing on a low mechanic's platform and her \n               skirt has been raised and hooked over the wing's flap. She \n               wears garters and stockings but no panties.\n\n               The man, handsome, cruel-looking, rises up behind her, enters \n               her, kisses her neck. Catherine half closes her eyes. She \n               rotates her pelvis gently against the thrusting.\n\n<b>               EXT. FILM STUDIO -- DAY\n</b>\n               We are floating toward the modest gates of a small film \n               studio; the sign above the gates says 'CineTerra' in Art \n               Deco script.\n\n<b>               INT. FILM STUDIO -- DAY\n</b>\n               We now float through a film set on which a commercial for a \n               mini-van is being shot. Lights are being reset, the van \n               polished for a beauty tracking shot.\n\n               We pick up an assistant director as he strides through the \n               action, looking for someone.\n\n<b>                                     AD\n</b>                         I'm looking for James.

The producer of this epic.\n\n               A dolly grip with very close-cropped hair looks up from a \n               section of dolly track which he is adjusting with small wooden \n               wedges.\n\n<b>                                     GRIP\n</b>                         I think I saw him in the camera \n                         department.\n\n<b>               INT. FILM STUDIO. CAMERA ROOM -- DAY\n</b>\n               We float toward the door marked CAMERA DEPT. Inside the room \n               we find a young woman, a camera assistant, wearing a T-shirt \n               and heavy woolen socks and work boots and nothing else. She \n               is draped across a table strewn with camera parts, stomach \n               down, head resting on a black, crackle-finish camera magazine, \n               her legs spread.\n\n               Camera parts and cases, tripods, changing bags everywhere.\n\n               A man is behind her, kissing the backs of her thighs.\n\n               We hear the sound of the AD approaching with deliberately \n               heavy footsteps. The AD pauses just outside the door.\n\n<b>                                     AD\n</b>                              (off screen)\n                         James? James, are you in there?

Be there in a minute.\n\n               The camera girl twists around on to her back and throws her \n               legs over James's shoulders.\n\n<b>                                     CAMERA GIRL\n</b>                         It'll take more than a minute.\n\n<b>               EXT. BALLARD APT. BALCONY -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Catherine stands at the railing of the balcony of the Ballard \n               apartment, which overlooks a busy expressway near the airport. \n               Her arms are spread wide as they were in the airplane hangar, \n               only now it is James, her husband, who is standing behind \n               her. They are both half naked, and he is inside her.\n\n               Their sex-making is disconnected, passionless, as though it \n               would disappear if they noticed it. An urgent, uninterrupted \n               flow of cars streams below them.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Where were you?\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         In the private aircraft hangar. \n                         Anybody could have walked in.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Did you come?\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         No. What about your camera girl?

I had to go \n                         back to the set...\n\n               Catherine turns toward James and pulls open her blouse, \n               exposing her left breast. She pulls James's face down and \n               presses her nipple against his cheek.\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         Poor darling.\n                              (pause)\n                         What can I do about Karen?

She \n                         desperately needs a conquest.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         I've been thinking about that, about \n                         you and Karen.\n\n<b>               INT. DEPARTMENT STORE. LINGERIE DEPARTMENT -- DAY\n</b>\n               James lingers among racks of nightdresses outside a changing \n               cubicle. Monitored by a bored, seen-it-all middle-aged \n               saleswoman, James glances now and then through the curtains \n               to watch Karen help Catherine try on underwear.\n\n               Karen, Catherine's secretary, a moody, unsmiling girl, is \n               methodically involved in the soft technology of Catherine's \n               breasts and the brassi\u00e8res designed to show them off.\n\n               Karen touches Catherine with peculiar caresses, tapping her \n               lightly with the tips of her fingers, first upon the \n               shoulders, along the pink grooves left by her underwear, \n               then across her back, where the metal clasps of her brassi\u00e8re \n               have left a medallion of impressed skin, and finally on the \n               elastic-patterned grooves beneath Catherine's breasts \n               themselves.\n\n               Catherine stands through this in a trance-like state, gabbling \n               to herself in a low voice, as the tip of Karen's right \n               forefinger surreptitiously touches her nipple.\n\n<b>               INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING-LOT -- DAY\n</b>\n               James sits in the car beside his wife. She watches as his \n               fingers move across the control panel, switching on the \n               ignition, the direction indicator, selecting the drive lever, \n               fastening his seat-belt.\n\n               As the car moves off, James puts his free hand between \n               Catherine's thighs.\n\n<b>               INT. FILM STUDIO. JAMES'S OFFICE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               James studies storyboards for an automotive battery \n               commercial, which are spread out over a broad architect's \n               table. He makes notes on each panel of the boards with a \n               sharp pencil.\n\n               As we move around him, we reveal his secretary, Renata, \n               sitting and watching him intently from the vantage point of \n               her corner chair, her hand poised to write down anything he \n               might say in a small, leather-bound notebook.\n\n               From her point of view, we watch James from behind as he \n               works. Every movement he makes -- bending over to correct a \n               panel, manipulating the pencil, touching the sharp point of \n               the pencil to his lip, straightening up again -- provokes a \n               different tiny response from Renata, so attuned to him is \n               she.\n\n               But he says nothing to her, and she remains poised and \n               vigilant.\n\n<b>               EXT. FILM STUDIO. PARKING-LOT -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               James settles into his car -- a boring American four-door \n               sedan -- running through his control-panel routine like a \n               pilot before driving off. This time his routine ends with \n               the switching on of the windshield wipers because it has \n               begun to rain heavily.\n\n<b>               EXT. RAINSWEPT ROAD -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Driving home from the studio, James hits a deep puddle at 60 \n               miles an hour and suddenly finds himself heading into the \n               oncoming lane. The car hits the central reservation with a \n               thump and the offside tire explodes and spins off its rim.\n\n<b>               INT. JAMES'S CAR -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               In the car, James fights desperately for control.\n\n<b>               EXT. RAINSWEPT ROAD -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               The car hurtles across the reservation and, bouncing and \n               slamming down on its suspension, heads up the high-speed \n               exit ramp. Three sedans are barreling down the ramp toward \n               James.\n\n<b>               INT. JAMES'S CAR -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               James pumps the brakes and saws away inexpertly at the wheel. \n               He manages to avoid the first two cars, but the third he \n               strikes head-on.\n\n               At the moment of impact, the man in the passenger seat of \n               the other car is propelled like a mattress from the barrel \n               of a circus cannon through his own windshield and then \n               partially through the windshield of James's car.\n\n               The propelled man's blood spatters James's face and chest, \n               his body coming to rest half inside James's car, its head \n               dangling down into the dark recess of the passenger footwell.\n\n               James's chest hits the steering wheel, his knees crush into \n               the instrument panel, his forehead hits the upper windshield \n               frame. As this happens, James is vaguely conscious of the \n               same thing happening to the woman driving the other car, as \n               though she is a bizarre mirror image.\n\n               Slammed back into their seats after the initial impact, James \n               and the woman look at each other through the shattered \n               windshields, neither able to move. The woman, handsome and \n               intelligent-looking, supported by her seat-belt, stares at \n               James in a curiously formal way, as if unsure what has brought \n               them together.\n\n               Out of the corner of his eye, James can see the hand of the \n               dead passenger, now his passenger, caught on the dashboard \n               and lying palm upwards only a few inches away from him. James \n               squints as he tries to focus on a huge blood-blister, pumped \n               up by the man's dying circulation, which has a distinct triton \n               shape.\n\n               James shifts his focus to the hood ornament of his car, \n               twisted up into the cold mercury-vapor glare of the roadway \n               lights but still intact. It is the same triton imprinted on \n               the palm of the dead passenger, the car manufacturer's logo.\n\n<b>               EXT. RAINSWEPT ROAD -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Traffic is beginning to back up behind the accident and a \n               growing circle of spectators, some of them pedestrians, some \n               drivers who have left their own cars, begins to form.\n\n               The more adventurous members of the crowd paw hesitantly at \n               the seized doors of the two cars, afraid really to yank them \n               open in case the violence of that act might trigger some \n               further unnamed catastrophe.\n\n<b>               INT. JAMES'S CAR -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Numbly watching James as she fumbles to undo her seat-belt, \n               the woman in the other crashed car inadvertently jerks open \n               her blouse and exposes her breast to James, its inner curve \n               marked by a dark, strap-like bruise made by her seat-belt.\n\n               In the strange, desperate privacy of this moment, the breast's \n               erect nipple seems somehow, impossibly, a deliberate \n               provocation.\n\n<b>               INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY\n</b>\n               We are close on a face having makeup applied to it. It is a \n               very pale, blotchy face, and the makeup is smoothing it, \n               making it appear healthy and even slightly tanned. There are \n               also some crude black stitches in this face, and we realize \n               that it is James's face, and that a very serious Catherine \n               is applying the makeup.\n\n               James's legs are up in a sling, drainage tubes coming from \n               both knees. Wounds on his chest: broken skin around the lower \n               edge of the sternum, where the horn boss had been driven \n               upwards by the collapsing engine compartment; a semicircular \n               bruise, a marbled rainbow, running from one nipple to the \n               other. Stitches in the laceration across the scalp, a second \n               hairline an inch below the original. Unshaven face and \n               fretting hands.\n\n               Catherine is dressed more for a smart lunch with an airline \n               executive than to visit her husband in hospital.\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         There, that's better.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Thank you.\n\n               James examines himself in her hand-mirror, staring at his \n               pale, mannequin-like face, trying to read its lines.\n\n               Catherine looks around her as she puts her makeup away. There \n               are twenty-three other beds in the briskly efficient-looking \n               new ward, all of them empty.\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         Not a lot of action here.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         They consider this to be the airport \n                         hospital.

I forgot to tell you.\n\n               Catherine finally succeeds in lighting the cigarette. She \n               takes a deep drag. James props himself up on his elbow, \n               breathing with transparent pain.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         That's going well, then.\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         Well, yes.\n                              (pause)\n                         You're getting out of bed tomorrow. \n                         They want you to walk.\n\n               James gestures for the cigarette.

She \n               wags a finger at James.\n\n<b>                                     STUDENT NURSE\n</b>                         No smoking, please.\n\n               As Catherine retrieves the cigarette from James and stubs it \n               out in a glass, the nurse examines Catherine's glamorous \n               figure, her expensive suit, her jewelry.\n\n<b>                                     STUDENT NURSE\n</b>                              (to Catherine)\n                         Are you this gentleman's wife?

She checks the level and, \n               satisfied, drops it back, flips over the sheets again.\n\n               Both Catherine and James watch her closely, her sly thighs \n               under her gingham, the movement of her breasts as she bends \n               to check the chart at the foot of the bed, the pulse in her \n               throat. The nurse catches them watching her, smiles \n               enigmatically back at them, and leaves.\n\n               Catherine pulls out a manila folder from her bag and slips a \n               set of storyboards for a commercial out of it.\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         Aida telephoned to say how sorry she \n                         was, but could you look at the \n                         storyboards again, she's made a number \n                         of changes.\n\n               James waves the folder away.

HOSPITAL HALLWAYS -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               James is taking his walk through the hallways, trundling his \n               IV stand along with him like an awkward pet.\n\n               A white-coated doctor -- Vaughan -- steps into the ward from \n               a room at the end of the hall. He is bare-chested under his \n               white coat. His strong hands carry a briefcase filled with \n               photographs, which he pauses to shuffle through, as though \n               checking a map.\n\n               As James approaches this new visitor, Vaughan's pockmarked \n               jaws chomp on a piece of gum, creating the impression that \n               he might be hawking obscene pictures around the wards, \n               pornographic X-ray plates and blacklisted urinalyses. He \n               sports copious scar tissue around his forehead and mouth, \n               rumpled and puckered as though residues from some terrifying \n               act of violence.\n\n               Vaughan looks James up and down, taking in every detail of \n               his injuries with evident interest.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         James Ballard?\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Yes?\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         Crash victim?\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Yes.\n\n               Vaughan shuffles his photos again. James manages to make out \n               the shapes of a few crushed and distorted vehicles caught in \n               lurid, flash-lit news style. Vaughan flips through them \n               distractedly, then with an unexpected, almost flirtatious \n               flourish slides them back into his briefcase and tucks it \n               under his arm.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         We'll deal with these later.\n\n               He flashes James an enigmatic smile, and walks off down the \n               hallway.\n\n               As James turns to continue, a young woman comes out of the \n               same room that Vaughan appeared from and moves toward him, \n               using a dark wooden walking stick. She presses her face into \n               her raised shoulder, possibly to hide the bruise marking her \n               right cheekbone.\n\n               The woman is Dr. Helen Remington, whose husband died in her \n               car crash with James.\n\n               James stops as she approaches. He speaks without thinking.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Dr. Remington...?\n\n               The woman looks up at James as she continues her approach. \n               She does not falter, but changes her grip on the cane, as if \n               preparing to thrash him across the face with it. She moves \n               her head in a peculiar gesture of the neck, deliberately \n               forcing her injury on him.\n\n               She pauses when she reaches the doorway, waiting for him to \n               step out of her way. James looks down at the scar tissue on \n               her face, a seam left by an invisible zip three inches long, \n               running from the corner of her right eye to the apex of her \n               mouth.\n\n               James is acutely aware of her strong body beneath her mauve \n               bathrobe, her ribcage partly shielded by a sheath of white \n               plaster that runs from one shoulder to the opposite armpit \n               like a classic Hollywood ball-gown.\n\n               James steps aside. Deciding to ignore him, Helen Remington \n               walks stiffly along the communication corridor, parading her \n               anger and her wound.\n\n<b>               INT.

Blood \n                         still marked the hood, streamers of \n                         black lace running toward the \n                         windshield-wiper gutters.\n\n               Catherine resoaps her right hand from the bar in the wet \n               saucer on the bed tray, a cigarette in her left. James strokes \n               her stockinged thigh as she continues her monologue.\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         Minute flecks were spattered across \n                         the seat and steering wheel. The \n                         instrument panel was buckled inwards, \n                         cracking the clock and the speedometer \n                         dials.

Two minor \n               accidents have caused a massive tail-back along the flyover \n               which crosses the entrance tunnel to the airport. In one of \n               them, a white laundry-van has bumped into the back of a sedan \n               filled with wedding guests.\n\n               James gazes raptly down at this immense motion sculpture, \n               this incomprehensible pinball machine.\n\n               Catherine comes on to the balcony, kneels down beside him, \n               begins to toy lovingly with the scars on his knees.\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         Renata tells me you're going to rent \n                         a car.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         I can't sit on this balcony forever. \n                         I'm beginning to feel like a potted \n                         plant.\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         How can you drive?

Only about a dozen cars are there; most \n               of them have been driven to work. James walks among those \n               that remain, absorbing the details of the personal things \n               left in them -- a silk scarf lies on a rear window-sill, a \n               pair of sunglasses hooked over a carpeted transmission hump.\n\n               James stops in front of the empty bay marked 'Balladr'.

At his feet lies a litter of dead \n               leaves, cigarette cartons and small drifts of safety-glass \n               crystals.\n\n               A hundred yards behind them, a dusty old Lincoln is also \n               parked on the verge. The leather-jacketed driver watches \n               James through his mudspattered windshield, broad shoulders \n               hunched against the door pillar. As James crosses the road \n               the man picks up a camera fitted with a zoom lens and peers \n               at James through the eye-piece.\n\n               Spotting the man, Renata opens the car door for James.\n\n<b>                                     RENATA\n</b>                         Who is that man?

As they approach him, he gets out of \n               his own car, ignoring them, and kneels down to study the \n               hieroglyphics of the skid marks on the road surface.\n\n               As James and Renata drive past the kneeling man, the sunlight \n               highlights the ridges of scars on his forehead and around \n               his mouth.\n\n               The man looks up at James and he recognizes Vaughan, the \n               young doctor he last saw in the hallway at the airport \n               hospital.\n\n<b>               EXT.

What he is thinking about is the \n               way that Karen's hip casually brushes against Catherine's \n               hip, without either woman seeming to be conscious of it.\n\n<b>               EXT. POLICE POUND -- DAY\n</b>\n               James enters the gate of the police pound on foot, and shows \n               his pass to the guard at the gate. His pass now stamped, he \n               hesitates for a beat before he enters.\n\n<b>               INT. POLICE POUND -- DAY\n</b>\n               Some twenty or so crashed vehicles are parked in the sunlight \n               against the rear wall of an abandoned cinema. At the far end \n               of the asphalt yard is a truck whose entire driving cabin \n               has been crushed, as if the dimensions of space had abruptly \n               contracted around the body of the driver.\n\n               Unnerved by these deformations, James moves from one car to \n               the next until he comes to his own. The remains of towing \n               tackle are attached to the front bumper, and the body panels \n               are splashed with oil and dirt. He peers through the windows \n               into the cabin, runs his hand over the mud-stained glass.\n\n               Without thinking, he kneels in front of the car and stares \n               at the crushed fenders and radiator grill.\n\n               Two policemen cross the yard with a black Alsatian dog. They \n               watch James hovering around his car as if they vaguely resent \n               his touching it. When they are gone, he unlatches the driver's \n               door and, with an effort, pulls it open.\n\n               James eases himself on to the dusty vinyl seat, tipped back \n               by the bowing of the floor. He nervously lifts his legs into \n               the car and places his feet on the rubber cleats of the \n               pedals, which have been forced out of the engine compartment \n               so that his knees are pressed against his chest.\n\n               The two policemen are exercising their dog across the yard. \n               James opens the glove compartment, forcing the shelf \n               downwards. Inside, covered with dirt and flaked plastic, are \n               a set of route maps, a mildly pornographic novel, a polaroid \n               of Renata sitting in the car near a water reservoir with her \n               breasts exposed.\n\n               James pulls open the ashtray, which promptly jumps on to his \n               lap, releasing a dozen lipstick-smeared butts.\n\n               Someone passes in front of the car. A policeman's voice calls \n               from the gatehouse. Through the windshield, James sees a \n               woman in a white raincoat walking along the line of wrecked \n               cars. The woman -- Helen Remington -- approaches the car \n               next to his, a crushed convertible involved in a massive \n               rear-end collision.\n\n               James sits quietly behind the steering wheel. Helen turns \n               from the convertible. She glances at the hood of James's \n               car, clearly not recognizing the vehicle that killed her \n               husband. As she raises her head she sees James through the \n               glassless windshield frame, sitting behind the deformed \n               steering wheel among the dried bloodstains of her husband.\n\n               Helen's strong eyes barely change their focus, but one hand \n               rises involuntarily to her cheek. She takes in the damage to \n               the car, then takes in James. Without giving away anything, \n               she turns and moves toward a damaged truck, then turns and \n               comes back as James gets out of his car.\n\n               She gestures toward the damaged vehicles, then speaks to \n               James as though continuing a conversation already in progress.\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         After this sort of thing, how do \n                         people manage to look at a car, let \n                         alone drive one?\n                              (pause)\n                         I'm trying to find Charles's car.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         It's not here.

Helen now straddles him and, awkwardly \n               meshing with the technology around them, they make love in \n               the driver's seat of the car.\n\n<b>               INT.

The two \n                         would only meet for one moment, but \n                         it was a moment that would create a \n                         Hollywood legend.\n\n               At this point Vaughan, who is dressed in light-blue cotton \n               1950s mechanics' overalls, sees James and Helen in the thin \n               crowd and waves to them, as though they were long-standing \n               aficionados of crash spectacles. He doesn't wait to see if \n               they react, but immediately steps into the passenger side of \n               the Porsche, microphone still in hand.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                              (over speakers)\n                         You'll notice that we are not wearing \n                         helmets or safety padding of any \n                         kind, and our cars are not equipped \n                         with roll cages or seat-belts.

All right, here we go. \n                         The fatal crash of James Dean!\n\n               Vaughan hands the microphone to a stills cameraman who also \n               functions as an assistant, and then sinks down into the silver \n               car.\n\n               Seagrave starts the Porsche, which settles quickly into a \n               husky idle. A few blips of the throttle, and then the Porsche \n               is reversed down to the edge of the lighted strip of road.\n\n               When the Porsche stops, the excited crowd goes quiet. An \n               assistant with a walkie-talkie kneels beside the silver car \n               on the driver's side, co-ordinating the start with his \n               opposite number standing next to the Ford over the hill.\n\n               There is a calculated pause before anything happens, and \n               then the Porsche spins its wheels and accelerates up the \n               hill.\n\n               From their vantage point in the stand, James and Helen can \n               clearly see that the Ford has also started and that the two \n               cars are headed toward each other, each in its respective \n               lane.\n\n               The Porsche accelerates hard, the Ford lumbers along at a \n               moderate pace, swaying clumsily on its soft springs.\n\n               As the cars approach each other, James notices a fresh \n               clearing at the side of the road at just about the point \n               where they seem likely to pass. Sure enough, when the cars \n               are about thirty yards apart, the Ford wanders over the center \n               line. As the Porsche approaches it, it seems to move back \n               into its own lane, but then suddenly swerves again as though \n               making a left turn.\n\n               The Porsche, in its turn, swerves to avoid the big American \n               car but they collide, the immense chrome grill punching into \n               the side of the fragile race car, crumpling it like a wad of \n               tin foil and shunting it unceremoniously off the road into \n               the clearing that has been prepared for it.\n\n               As the Porsche hobbles to a stop, Vaughan seems to stand up \n               on his seat and then throw himself out of the car, rolling \n               over what's left of the front hood on to the ground. Seagrave \n               remains slumped in the driver's seat. Vaughan lies still \n               where he lands, a few feet ahead of the crumpled nose of the \n               race car.\n\n               The door of the Ford opens and Trask stumbles out. He begins \n               to walk around in a dazed and agitated manner, and the crowd, \n               which has been buzzing, goes silent again. Trask walks away \n               from the crash site and disappears into the shadows at the \n               edge of the road.\n\n<b>               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. GRANDSTAND -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               There is no movement from either Seagrave or Vaughan. James \n               is not sure how to react, but Helen seems genuinely worried.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Is that part of the act or are they \n                         really hurt?\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         I don't know.

This is his show.\n\n               A stills cameraman runs out of nowhere and kneels beside the \n               apparently stricken Vaughan in the weeds at the side of the \n               road. It is not clear whether he is taking his picture or \n               ministering to him. It soon becomes clear that he has handed \n               him a radio microphone because Vaughan's low, melodramatic \n               growl now ripples out of the woods from the tree speakers.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                              (over speakers)\n                         Rolf W\u00fctherich was thrown from the \n                         Porsche and spent a year in the \n                         hospital recovering from his injuries. \n                         Donald Turnupseed was found wandering \n                         around in a daze, basically unhurt. \n                         James Dean died of a broken neck and \n                         became immortal.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Trask \n               emerges from the woods, waving to the now-supercharged crowd.\n\n               Seagrave tries to get out of the collapsed Porsche but is \n               jammed behind the wheel. Without missing a beat, Vaughan \n               dances over to the car and begins to haul Seagrave out of \n               his seat.\n\n<b>                                     COLIN\n</b>                         Hold me.

I think he's genuinely hurt.\n\n               Helen makes her way down the rickety grandstand steps toward \n               the road, and James follows her.\n\n<b>               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Just as James and Helen step on the road, six police cars, \n               lights flashing and sirens wailing, converge on the lit \n               stretch of road, three from each end. They screech to a halt \n               and dozens of cops pour out of the cars.\n\n               The crowd panics and streams down from the grandstand on to \n               the road. A loudspeaker mounted on one of the police cars \n               begins to blare.\n\n<b>                                     POLICE\n</b>                              (over loudspeaker)\n                         This is an illegal and unauthorized \n                         automotive demonstration which is in \n                         contravention of the Highway Traffic \n                         Act.

Disperse at once!\n\n               Because James and Helen are just in advance of the first \n               wave of spectators, they manage to link up with Vaughan as \n               he helps haul a still-groggy Seagrave off the road and into \n               the woods. Helen takes Seagrave's free arm.\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                              (to Vaughan)\n                         What's the matter with Seagrave?\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         Hit his head, I think.

They have no \n                         idea who we really are.\n\n               In the gathering darkness of the woods, it is apparent that \n               James doesn't really know who they are either.\n\n<b>               INT.

SEAGRAVE'S GARAGE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               The Lincoln turns into the forecourt of Seagrave's garage \n               and showroom. His business, which has clearly seen better \n               days, is hot-rodding and customized cars. Behind the unwashed \n               glass of the showroom is a fiberglass replica of a 1930s \n               Brooklands racer, faded bunting stuffed into the seat.\n\n               They get out of the car, helping the woozy Seagrave through \n               the door at the side of the showroom, which leads to the \n               stairway up to the apartment above the garage.\n\n<b>               INT. SEAGRAVE APT. -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               The Seagrave apartment is dirty and depressing, featuring \n               cheap, cigarette-scarred leatherette furniture.\n\n               James watches Helen and Vaughan steer Seagrave into the living-\n               room, where two people sit on a couch watching television \n               with the sound turned off: Gabrielle, a sharp-faced young \n               woman who is rolling a hash joint; and Seagrave's wife, Vera, \n               a handsome, restless woman of about thirty.\n\n               Vera stands as they come in and rushes over to the shaky \n               Seagrave.\n\n<b>                                     VERA\n</b>                         Oh, God.

James, awkwardly left \n               standing, notices long scars on Vera's thighs and legs.\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         They did the James Dean crash.

But he started \n                         to feel nauseous on the way back. \n                         I'm sure it's concussion.\n\n<b>                                     VERA\n</b>                         Ah, well... We're familiar enough \n                         with that, then, aren't we?\n\n               James watches Gabrielle and Vaughan. As she rolls a small \n               piece of resin in a twist of silver foil, Vaughan brings a \n               brass lighter out of his hip pocket. Gabrielle cooks the \n               resin, and shakes the powder into the open cigarette waiting \n               in the roller machine on her lap.\n\n               On Gabrielle's legs are traces of what seem to be gas bacillus \n               scars, faint circular depressions on the kneecaps. She notices \n               James staring at her scars, but makes no effort to close her \n               legs.\n\n               On the sofa beside her is a chromium metal cane and, as she \n               shifts her weight, James sees that the instep of each leg is \n               held in the steel clamp of a surgical support. It now becomes \n               obvious from the over-rigid posture of her waist that she is \n               also wearing a back-brace of some kind.\n\n               Gabrielle rolls another cigarette out of the machine, but \n               does not offer it to James. Instead, Vaughan gets up and \n               takes it over to Seagrave, who has managed to sit up.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         I'd really like to work out the \n                         details of the Jayne Mansfield crash \n                         with you.

The floor around the \n               enlarger is littered with half-plate prints, developed and \n               cast aside once they have yielded their images. Vaughan makes \n               a sweeping gesture that takes in all the photographs.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         And this is the new project, Ballard.\n\n               As Vaughan hunts around the central table, turning the pages \n               of a leather-bound album, James looks down at the discarded \n               prints below his feet. Most of them are crude frontal pictures \n               of motor-cars and heavy vehicles involved in highway \n               collisions, surrounded by spectators and police, and close-\n               ups of impacted radiator grills and windshields.\n\n               Vaughan opens the album at random and hands it to James. He \n               leans back against the door and watches as James adjusts the \n               desk lamp.\n\n               The first thirty pages record the crash, hospitalization, \n               and post-recuperative romance of the young woman Gabrielle --\n               a social worker, the photos suggest -- who is currently \n               getting very stoned in the next room.\n\n               By coincidence, her small sports car had collided with an \n               airline bus at the entry to the airport not far from the \n               site of James's own accident. Vaughan had obviously been \n               there, shooting film, moments after the crash. The incredibly \n               detailed photos end with her affair with her physical therapy \n               instructor.\n\n               The remainder of the album describes the course of James's \n               own accident and recovery, and includes his sexual encounters \n               with Renata, Helen Remington, and his own wife, Catherine. \n               Vaughan stands at James's shoulder, like an instructor ready \n               to help a promising pupil.\n\n               James closes the book.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         What kind of help can I possibly be \n                         to you? You seem to be everywhere at \n                         once as it is.\n\n               At that moment, there is a knock at the door, and then \n               Gabrielle enters and takes a few stiff steps into the room \n               on her shackled legs. She holds out a couple of joints to \n               Vaughan.\n\n<b>                                     GABRIELLE\n</b>                         Thought you might be missing these.\n                              (to James)\n                         So here you are at the nerve centre. \n                         Vaughan makes everything look like a \n                         crime, doesn't he?\n\n               Vaughan takes the joints and lights them both.

FILM STUDIO. JAMES'S OFFICE -- DAY\n</b>\n               James watches Renata and Catherine talking animatedly at the \n               other end of his office. He can't hear what they are saying, \n               but Renata is showing Catherine layouts of ads involving \n               images of private planes flying in formation. They touch \n               each other from time to time without seeming to notice it, \n               but James notices it.\n\n<b>               EXT. VARIOUS LARGE CITY ROADS -- DAY\n</b>\n               James and Catherine set off for home in their own separate \n               cars. At times, they are within sight of each other and James \n               watches her microscopically, as though he didn't know her, \n               as though, perhaps, she isn't human.\n\n               At one point he sees her with her hands resting on the \n               steering wheel, her right index finger picking at an old \n               adhesive label on the windshield.\n\n               And then, abruptly, James is aware of the dented fender of \n               Vaughan's Lincoln only a few feet behind Catherine's sports \n               car.\n\n               Vaughan now surges past James, crowding along the roadway as \n               if waiting for Catherine to make a mistake. Startled, \n               Catherine takes refuge in front of an airline bus in the \n               nearside lane. Vaughan drives alongside the bus, using his \n               horn and lights to force the driver back, and again cuts in \n               behind Catherine.\n\n               James moves ahead along the center lane, shouting to Vaughan \n               as he passes him, but Vaughan is signalling to Catherine, \n               pumping his headlights at her rear fender.\n\n               Without thinking, Catherine pulls into the courtyard of a \n               filling station, forcing Vaughan into a heavy U-turn. Tires \n               screaming, he swings around the ornamental flower-bed with \n               its glazed pottery plants, but James blocks his way with his \n               own car.\n\n               Heart racing, Catherine sits still in her car among the fuel \n               pumps, her eyes flashing at Vaughan.\n\n               James steps from his car and walks across to Vaughan, who \n               watches James approach as if he had never seen him before, \n               scarred mouth working on a piece of gum as he gazes at the \n               aircrafts taking off from the airport.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Vaughan, what the hell are you doing? \n                         Are you trying to create your own \n                         Famous Crash?\n\n               Vaughan hooks his gear lever into reverse.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         It excited her, Ballard.

The two vehicles veer sideways \n               towards the line of startled spectators.\n\n               The motorcyclist and his bike sail over the hood of the car \n               and strike the windshield, then careen across the roof in a \n               black mass of fragments.\n\n               The car plunges ten feet back on its hawsers and comes to \n               rest astride its rails. The hood, windshield and roof have \n               been crushed by the impact. Inside the cabin, the lopsided \n               family lurch across each other, the decapitated torso of the \n               front-seat woman passenger embedded in the fractured \n               windshield.\n\n               The engineers wave to the crowd reassuringly and move toward \n               the motorcycle, which lies on its side fifty yards behind \n               the car. But it is Vaughan -- a black-jacketed figure striding \n               on long, uneven legs -- who arrives first at the bike.\n\n               For a moment it seems that he might try to lift it up himself, \n               but he then backs away to where technicians are picking up \n               pieces of the motorcyclist's body, and then turns away \n               completely and rejoins Helen and James.\n\n               Vaughan holds up the bundle of technical hand-outs in his \n               grip.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         Get all the paper you can, Ballard. \n                         Some of the stuff they're giving \n                         away is terrific: 'Mechanisms of \n                         Occupant Ejection', 'Tolerances of \n                         the Human Face in Crash Impacts'...\n\n               Helen takes James's arm, smiling at him, nodding \n               encouragingly, as if urging a child across some mental hurdle.\n\n<b>                                     HELEN\n</b>                         We can have a look at it again on \n                         the monitors.

Vaughan drives aggressively, \n               rolling the heavy car along the access roads, holding the \n               battered bumpers a few feet behind any smaller vehicle until \n               it moves out of the way.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         I've always wanted to drive a crashed \n                         car.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         You could get your wish at any moment.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         No, I mean a crash with a history. \n                         Camus's Facel Vega, or Nathaniel \n                         West's station wagon, Grace Kelly's \n                         Rover 3500.

I \n                         take it that you see Kennedy's \n                         assassination as a special kind of \n                         car crash?\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         The case could be made.\n\n               They approach a major intersection. For almost the first \n               time on this drive, Vaughan applies the brakes.\n\n               The heavy car sways and goes into a long right-hand slide \n               which carries it across the path of a taxi. Flooring the \n               accelerator, Vaughan swerves in front of it, tires screaming \n               over the blaring horn of the taxi.\n\n               As they settle down, Vaughan reaches behind him and lifts a \n               briefcase off the back seat.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         Take a look at this and tell me what \n                         you think.\n\n               James opens the briefcase and slides out a thick packet of \n               glossy photographs, all of them marked up with coloured ink \n               pens.\n\n               The photos are culled from a variety of sources -- newspapers, \n               magazines, video stills, film frames -- blown up to uniform \n               8' x 10' size. Each one depicts a famous crash victim in the \n               prime of life, and each one has the wounds to come marked up \n               very explicitly -- lines circling their necks and pubic areas, \n               breasts and cheekbones shaded in, section lines across their \n               mouths and abdomens. Handwritten notes complement the circles \n               and arrows.\n\n               A second packet of photographs shows the cars in which these \n               famous people died. Each photo is marked to show which parts \n               of the cars destroyed or fused with which famous body part: \n               for example, a close-up of the dashboard and windshield from \n               the Camus car -- Michel Gallimard's Facel Vega -- is marked \n               'nasal bridge', 'soft palate', 'left zygomatic arch'.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         It's very... satisfying.

For the first \n                         time, a benevolent psychopathology \n                         beckons towards us. For example, the \n                         car crash is a fertilizing rather \n                         than a destructive event -- a \n                         liberation of sexual energy that \n                         mediates the sexuality of those who \n                         have died with an intensity impossible \n                         in any other form.

Using his horn, \n               Vaughan forces the drivers in the slower lanes to back up \n               and let him across on to the hard shoulder. Once free, he \n               accelerates past the lines of traffic, occasionally scraping \n               the right flank of the Lincoln against the cement divider. \n               In the distance the airport car-park looms.\n\n<b>               INT.

James just spots a sharp-faced young \n               woman in a very short skirt, an airport whore, provocatively \n               bent over a railing ostensibly to watch airplanes land and \n               take off, when Vaughan slams on the brakes and jumps out of \n               the car.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         You drive.\n\n               The startled James numbly obeys, sliding over into the \n               driver's seat as Vaughan approaches the whore and begins to \n               negotiate with her. James gingerly maneuvers the boat-like \n               car to one side to allow traffic to pass as Vaughan returns \n               with the gum-chewing whore in tow.\n\n               As the girl, with short black hair and a boy's narrow-hipped \n               body, opens the passenger door, Vaughan hands her a joint \n               and lights it for her. Then, lifting her chin, he puts his \n               fingers in her mouth and plucks out the knot of gum, flicking \n               it away into the darkness.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         Let's get rid of that.

The other \n               stands beside Catherine's car, questioning her.\n\n               James slows guiltily as both policemen begin to talk to \n               Vaughan.

JAMMED MOTORWAY -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               The Lincoln has entered an immense traffic jam, and brake-\n               lights flare in the evening air. Vaughan sits with one arm \n               out the passenger window. He slaps the door impatiently, \n               pounding the panel with his fist.\n\n               A police car speeds down the descent lane of a flyover, \n               headlights and roof-lamps flashing. Ahead, two policemen \n               steer the traffic from the nearside curb. Warning tripods \n               set up on the pavement flash a rhythmic 'Slow... Slow... \n               Accident... Accident...'\n\n               Eventually, they begin to edge past the accident site, which \n               is lit by a circle of police spotlights. Three vehicles -- a \n               taxi, a limousine and a small sports sedan -- have collided \n               where an on-ramp joins the main roadway. A crowd has gathered \n               on the sidewalks and on the pedestrian bridge that spans the \n               road.\n\n               Beside the taxi, its three passengers lie in a group, blankets \n               swathing their chests and legs. First-aid men work on the \n               driver, an elderly man who sits upright against the fender \n               of his car, face and clothes speckled with drops of blood.\n\n               The limousine's passengers still sit in the deep cabin of \n               their car, their identities sealed behind the starred internal \n               window.\n\n<b>               INT.

In some recess in \n               the back seat he has found a camera, which now swings from \n               his neck.\n\n               Siren whining, a third ambulance drives down the oncoming \n               lane. A police motorcyclist cuts in front of James and slows \n               to a halt, signalling him to wait and allow the ambulance to \n               pass. James stops the car.\n\n               Ten yards from them is the crushed limousine, the body of \n               the young chauffeur still lying on the ground beside it. \n               Three engineers work with surreal hand-tools and hydraulic \n               cutting and prying equipment at the rear doors of the \n               limousine. They sever the jammed door mechanism and pull \n               back the door to expose the passengers trapped inside the \n               compartment.\n\n               The two passengers, a pink-faced man in his fifties wearing \n               a black overcoat, and a younger woman with a pale, anemic \n               skin, still sit upright, staring blankly, in the rear seat.\n\n               A policeman pulls away the traveling rug that covers their \n               legs and waists. The woman's legs are bare, the older man's \n               feet splayed, apparently broken at the ankles. The woman's \n               skirt has ridden up around her waist, and her left hand holds \n               the window strap.\n\n               As the older man turns to the woman, one hand searching for \n               her, he slips sideways off the seat, his ankles kicking at \n               the clutter of leather valises and broken glass.\n\n               The traffic stream moves on. James eases the car forwards. \n               Vaughan raises the camera to his eye, lowering it from sight \n               when an ambulance attendant tries to knock it from his hands.\n\n               The pedestrian bridge passes overhead. Half out of the car, \n               Vaughan peers at the scores of legs pressed against the metal \n               railings, then opens the door and dives out.\n\n<b>               EXT. MOTORWAY VERGE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               As James pulls the Lincoln on to the verge, Vaughan runs \n               back to the pedestrian bridge, darting in and out of the \n               cars. James and Catherine get out of the car.\n\n               As James closes the door, he notices that the blood of one \n               of the accident victims has somehow been splashed on to the \n               door handle, and that some of it is now on his hand.\n\n               He finds a section of newspaper at the side of the road and \n               wipes the blood off his hand. When he looks up, he realizes \n               that Catherine has followed Vaughan back to the accident \n               site.\n\n<b>               EXT. JAMMED MOTORWAY -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               James walks back alone, eventually spotting them among the \n               throng of spectators, Catherine watching Vaughan's scarred \n               face intently, provocatively, as he photographs every aspect \n               of the accident.\n\n               There is a calmly festive and pervasive sexuality in the air \n               among the onlookers, and even a congregational feeling as \n               one group of engineers works on the crushed sports sedan, \n               prying at the metal roof which has been flattened on to the \n               heads of the occupants.\n\n               And now Vaughan poses an only slightly reluctant Catherine \n               against the backdrop of the stricken taxi as though she were \n               one of the shaken survivors of the accident.\n\n               When the roof of the sports sedan is levered up, the hair of \n               the driver, its only passenger, comes off with it as though \n               scalped, stuck to the roofliner with drying blood. But it's \n               soon apparent that it's not hair, but rather a cheap, tangled, \n               platinum blond wig.\n\n               Vaughan makes his way over to the sedan, intrigued by the \n               dangling 'scalp', which is almost phosphorescent in the road-\n               rescue work lights. Catherine trails obediently behind him, \n               like a harshly disciplined puppy.\n\n               When the body of the driver is exposed to the lights, the \n               effect is doubly grotesque, for not only is the driver dead \n               and partially crushed, but he is also a cross-dresser: \n               Seagrave, in Jayne Mansfield drag. His long, greasy hair is \n               tied up in a knot on his head, he is unshaven, his huge, \n               fake bosom is bloody and askew; his bloated, muscular body \n               strains against the pink 60s skirt and jacket, the blue suede \n               boots with high heels.\n\n               There is also a dead Chihuahua bitch inside the car with \n               Seagrave, which Vaughan manages to move with his foot until \n               a cop, outraged, shoos him away. The dog is stiff with rigor \n               mortis, obviously dead long before the crash.\n\n               An excited Vaughan has spotted James and now approaches him, \n               breathless.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         It's Seagrave.

So he did it himself.\n\n               Vaughan turns back to look at the wreck again, almost \n               reverent. This is Seagrave's own solitary work of art.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                              (shakes his head)\n                         The dog -- God, the dog is brilliant, \n                         perfect.

The dead \n               chauffeur of the limousine lies with a blanket over his face, \n               while a doctor and two ambulance men climb into the rear \n               compartment.\n\n               Beyond them, Vaughan begins to snap away at every possible \n               aspect of Seagrave's wreck, beginning with the dead Chihuahua.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Instead, Vaughan pulls open the rear \n               door and climbs in beside Catherine.\n\n               As they set off, Vaughan's camera lands on the front seat.\n\n<b>               INT.

She sits in the center of the back seat, elbows \n               forward on her knees, looking over his shoulder at the \n               speeding lights of the expressway. At the first traffic light, \n               she smiles at James reassuringly.\n\n               Vaughan sits like a bored gangster beside her, his left knee \n               leaning against her thigh. One hand rubs his groin absent-\n               mindedly. He stares at the nape of her neck, running his \n               eyes along the profiles of her cheek and shoulder.\n\n<b>               EXT. CAR-WASH -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Near the airport, the Lincoln joins a line of cars waiting \n               their turn to pass through the automatic car-wash. In the \n               darkness, the three nylon rollers drum against the sides and \n               roof of a taxi parked in the washing station, water and soap \n               solution jetting from the metal gantries.\n\n               Fifty yards away, the two night attendants sit in their glass \n               cubicle beside the deserted fuel pumps, reading their comic \n               books and playing a radio.\n\n<b>               INT.

Through the rear-view mirror James sees \n               that Catherine is leaning against the back seat, her shoulder \n               pressed tightly into Vaughan's. Her eyes are fixed on \n               Vaughan's chest, on the scars around his injured nipples, \n               shining like points of light.\n\n               James edges the Lincoln forward a few feet. When he turns \n               around, he sees that Vaughan is holding in his cupped right \n               hand his wife's bare breast.\n\n               James fumbles for change as Vaughan caresses Catherine's \n               nipple in the back seat. Catherine looks down at this breast \n               with rapt eyes, as if seeing it for the first time, fascinated \n               by its unique geometry.\n\n<b>               EXT. CAR-WASH -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Their car is alone in the washing bay. A voice rings out. \n               Cigarette in hand, one of the attendants stands in the wet \n               darkness, beckoning to James, who inserts his coins in the \n               pay slot and closes the window.\n\n               Water jets on to the car, clouding the windows and shutting \n               the trio into the interior.\n\n<b>               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Within their blue grotto, Vaughan lies diagonally across the \n               back seat. Catherine kneels across him, skirt rolled around \n               her waist. The light refracted through the soap solution \n               jetting across the windows covers their bodies with a \n               luminescent glow, like two semi-metallic human beings of the \n               future making love in a chromium bower.\n\n               The gantry engine begins to drum. The rollers pound across \n               the hood of the Lincoln and roar forward to the windshield, \n               driving the soap solution into a whirlwind of froth. Catherine \n               settles over Vaughan, and as the rollers drum against the \n               roof and doors, Vaughan drives his pelvis upwards, almost \n               lifting his buttocks off the seat.\n\n               In the mounting roar of the rollers, she and Vaughan rock \n               together, Vaughan holding her breasts together with his palms \n               as if trying to force them into a single globe. When his \n               hands move away to her buttocks, James can see that her \n               breasts have been bruised by Vaughan's fingers, the marks \n               forming a pattern like crash injuries.\n\n               At just this moment, Catherine looks into James's eyes in an \n               instant of complete lucidity. Her expression shows both irony \n               and affection, an acceptance of a sexual logic they both \n               recognize and have prepared themselves for.\n\n               James sits quietly in the front seat as the white soap sluices \n               across the roof and doors like liquid lace. Catherine cries \n               out, a gasp of pain cut off by Vaughan's strong hand across \n               her mouth. He sits back with her legs across his hips, \n               slapping her with his free hand. His sweaty face is clamped \n               in an expression of anger and distress. The blows raise \n               blunted weals on Catherine's arm and hips.\n\n<b>               EXT.

She \n               touches James's shoulder in a gesture of domestic affection. \n               In the mirror, James can see the weals on her cheek and neck, \n               the bruised mouth that deforms her nervous smile.\n\n<b>               EXT.

A \n               cluster of chromium treadles is fastened to a steel pivot \n               clamped to the steering column. An extension on the floor-\n               mounted gear lever rises laterally, giving way to a vertical \n               wing of chromium metal moulded into the reverse of a driver's \n               palm.\n\n               Amid this small forest of machinery, James explores \n               Gabrielle's new and strange body, feeling his way among the \n               braces and straps of her underwear, the unfamiliar planes of \n               her hips and legs, the unique culs-de-sac, odd declensions \n               of skin and musculature.\n\n               Gabrielle lies back. She lifts her left foot so that the leg \n               brace rests against his knee. In the inner surface of her \n               thigh the straps form marked depressions, troughs of reddened \n               skin hollowed out in the forms of buckles and clasps. James \n               unshackles the left leg brace and runs his fingers along the \n               hot, corrugated skin of the deep buckle groove.\n\n               The exposed portions of her body are joined together by the \n               loosened braces and straps. Through the fading afternoon \n               light the airplanes move across their heads along the east -- \n               west runways of the airport. Gabrielle's hand moves across \n               his chest, opening his shirt, her fingers finding the small \n               scars below his collarbone, the imprint of the instrument \n               binnacle of his own crashed car. She runs the tip of her \n               tongue into each of the wound-scars on his chest and abdomen.\n\n               James exposes her breasts, feeling for the wound areas which \n               surround them.

It is next to a small, private medical clinic, \n               and has the same antiseptic, untextured look of the ear, \n               nose and throat suite next door.\n\n<b>               INT.

She could be a nurse or a hospital dietician.\n\n               James sits next to them, barely acknowledged by the woman. \n               Vaughan has messy papers spread out in front of him that \n               include stylized sketches of famous crash wounds, photos of \n               Andy Warhol's scars, automotive styling-detail drawings from \n               a 50s Detroit design studio.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                              (to tattooist)\n                         You're making it too clean.\n\n<b>                                     TATTOOIST\n</b>                         Medical tattoos are supposed to be \n                         clean.\n\n<b>                                     VAUGHAN\n</b>                         This isn't a medical tattoo.

It \n               looks more like a cartoon version of a wound than a real \n               wound. We can see it because James's trousers are down around \n               his knees.\n\n               Vaughan's face comes into frame. He gently kisses the tattoo. \n               James lifts Vaughan's face to his own and kisses his mouth, \n               touches his tongue to each of the scars around Vaughan's \n               mouth.\n\n<b>               EXT.

UNDERPASS NEAR AUTO-WRECKER'S YARD -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               James steps unsteadily from the Lincoln into the roadway, \n               followed for an instant by Vaughan's uncertain arm reaching \n               for him.\n\n               He moves away from the car, along the palisade to the \n               overgrown entrance of the wrecker's yard. Above him, the \n               cars on the motorway move like motorized wrecks.\n\n<b>               EXT. AUTO-WRECKER'S YARD -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Just outside the fence of the auto-wrecker's yard, a wreck, \n               its engine and wheels removed, sits on its axles. James opens \n               the door on its rusting hinges. A confetti of fragmented \n               glass covers the front passenger seat.\n\n               James gets in and sits there for a moment, crouched over the \n               mudstreaked instrument panel, his knees tightened against \n               his chest wall. A moment or two of this strangely comforting \n               foetal security, and then James unfolds and begins to get \n               back out of the car.\n\n               An engine starts with a roar. As James steps back into the \n               roadway he is briefly aware of a heavy black vehicle \n               accelerating toward him from the shadow of the overpass where \n               he and Vaughan embraced together. Its white-walled tires \n               tear through the broken beer bottles and cigarette packs in \n               the gutter, mount the narrow curb and hurtle on toward him.\n\n               Knowing that Vaughan will not stop, will kill him, James \n               presses himself against the concrete wall. The Lincoln swerves \n               after him, its right-hand fender striking the rear wheel \n               housing of the car James has just left. It swings away, \n               ripping the open passenger door from its hinges.\n\n               A column of exploding dust and torn newspaper rises into the \n               air as it slides sideways across the access road. The Lincoln \n               remounts the curb on the far side of the road, crushing a \n               ten-yard section of the wooden palisade.\n\n               James can see Vaughan flicking a look back, his hard eyes \n               calculating whether or not he can make a second pass at him. \n               The rear wheels regain their traction on the road surface \n               and the car swings away on to the motorway above.\n\n               James leans against the roof of the abandoned car. The \n               passenger door has been crushed into the front fender, the \n               deformed metal welded together by the impact.\n\n               James retches suddenly and emptily.\n\n               Shreds of torn paper eddy through the air around him, pasting \n               themselves at various points against the crushed door panel \n               and radiator hood.\n\n<b>               EXT. BALLARD APT. BALCONY -- DAY\n</b>\n               James sits on the balcony of his apartment, watching the \n               sky. A single-engined airplane floats above the motorway, a \n               glass dragonfly carried by the sun. It seems to hang \n               motionless, the propeller rotating slowly like a toy \n               aircraft's. The light pours from its wings in a ceaseless \n               fountain.\n\n               Below it, the traffic moves sluggishly along the crowded \n               concrete lanes, the roofs of the vehicles forming a continuous \n               carapace of polished cellulose.\n\n               Suddenly, Catherine is behind him. She puts her hands on his \n               shoulders and he turns to her as though in a dream, gestures \n               toward the airplane.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         I thought that was you, up there.\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         My last lesson's next week.\n                              (pause)\n                         James... my car...\n\n               James can see now that Catherine is frightened.

Vera is dressed in a heavily \n               insulated leather jacket, as though she were about to leave \n               on an Antarctic expedition.\n\n               James calls to her from the car.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Vera!

AIRPORT ROADWAYS -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Vaughan is waiting for them at the airport flyover. He makes \n               no attempt to hide himself, pushing his heavy car into the \n               passing traffic stream.\n\n               Apparently uninterested in them, Vaughan lies against his \n               door sill, almost asleep at the wheel as he surges forward \n               when the lights change. His left hand drums across the rim \n               of the steering wheel as he swerves the Lincoln to and fro \n               across the road surface.\n\n               His face is fixed in a rigid mask as he cuts in and out of \n               the traffic lanes, surging ahead in the fast lane until he \n               is abreast of them and then sliding back behind them, allowing \n               other cars to cut between them and then taking up a watchful \n               position in the slow lane.\n\n               James can see that Vaughan's car has become even more battered \n               than it was before, scarred with many impact points, a rear \n               window broken, cracked headlamps, a body panel detached from \n               the off-side rear wheel housing, the front bumper hanging \n               from the chassis pinion, its rusting lower curvature touching \n               the ground as Vaughan corners.\n\n               When they slow down for a line of tankers, Vaughan makes his \n               move. He pulls up beside them and then cuts viciously across \n               three lanes of traffic to hit them broadside. The nose of \n               the Lincoln just nicks the tail of the light sports car, \n               which spins down the road.\n\n               The Lincoln keeps on going, its vast momentum taking it into \n               the guard rails of the exit ramp, and then over them.\n\n               Catherine and James slam spinning into the tail of a tanker \n               which has all but stopped. The traffic behind them has already \n               been slowing and thus easily avoids hitting the sports car \n               when it comes bouncing to a halt across two traffic lanes.\n\n               Catherine lies back, sprawled in her seat, eyes wide and \n               staring with fright, body rigid, bleeding from a small cut \n               on her cheekbone. James jumps out of the car, then immediately \n               slows with a limp. He continues, working his way doggedly \n               through the motionless cars to the edge of the ramp.\n\n               When he looks over the edge, James sees that Vaughan's Lincoln \n               has plunged into the top of an airline coach which was running \n               on the roadway below. With the Lincoln now inside it, the \n               coach then slewed sideways and crashed into several other \n               vehicles.\n\n               Wreckage, flames and blood are everywhere.\n\n               James's eyes are wide: not with horror, but with excitement.\n\n<b>               EXT. POLICE POUND -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Catherine and James stand at the gatehouse of the police \n               pound, collecting the gate key from the mustachioed, sharp-\n               eyed young officer there.\n\n               They then walk down the lines of seized and abandoned \n               vehicles. The pound is in darkness, lit only by the street-\n               lights reflected in the dented chromium.\n\n               They soon find Vaughan's crashed Lincoln, massive and \n               charismatic even here, even in death. James manages to wrench \n               open the passenger-side rear door enough to allow them both \n               to get inside.\n\n<b>               INT. VAUGHAN'S CAR -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Sitting in the rear seat of the Lincoln, Catherine and James \n               make brief, ritual love, her buttocks held tightly in his \n               hands as she sits across his waist.\n\n<b>               EXT. POLICE POUND -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               Afterwards, they walk among the cars. The beams of small \n               headlamps cut across their knees. An open car has stopped \n               beside the gatehouse. Two women sit behind the windshield, \n               peering into the darkness.\n\n               A pause, and then the car moves forward, its driver turning \n               the wheel until the headlamps illuminate the remains of the \n               dismembered vehicle in which Vaughan died.\n\n               The woman in the passenger seat steps out and pauses briefly \n               by the gates. It is Helen Remington. When she helps the driver \n               out of the car, James and Catherine see that it is the \n               crippled Gabrielle, her leg shackles clacking as she and \n               Helen begin to walk toward Vaughan's car.\n\n               They stroll haltingly, arms around each other, like strange \n               lovers in a cemetery visiting a favorite mausoleum. At one \n               point, Helen kisses Gabrielle's hand, and it is obvious that \n               they have become lovers.\n\n               James and Catherine circle away from the couple and make \n               their way back to the gatehouse.\n\n               In the depths of the pound, Helen helps Gabrielle into the \n               Lincoln. In the darkness of the back seat, they embrace.\n\n<b>               EXT. POLICE POUND. GATEHOUSE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n               James stands talking to the officer at the gatehouse window, \n               holding Catherine's arm around his waist, pressing her fingers \n               against the muscles of his stomach.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         I'd like to register a claim for the \n                         black 1963 Lincoln, the one that \n                         came in a couple of days ago. Is \n                         there a form I can fill out?\n\n<b>                                     POUND OFFICER\n</b>                         There certainly is, but you'll have \n                         to come back between 7:30 and 4:30 \n                         to get one. What's your attachment \n                         to that thing?\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         A close friend owned it.\n\n<b>                                     POUND OFFICER\n</b>                         Well, it's got to be a total write-\n                         off. I don't see what you could \n                         possibly do with it.\n\n<b>               EXT. CROWDED RAIN-STREAKED ROADWAY -- SUNSET\n</b>\n               We are close on the huge, battle-scarred grill of Vaughan's \n               Lincoln, now brought back to swaying, bellowing life.\n\n               The restoration of the Lincoln is as Vaughan would have wanted \n               it: just enough to get it running and nothing more, with \n               ugly brown primer slapped on to the replaced panels, and \n               whatever was cracked, scraped and crumpled still cracked, \n               scraped and crumpled -- a mobile accident rolling on badly \n               misaligned wheels.\n\n<b>               INT. VAUGHAN'S LINCOLN -- SUNSET\n</b>\n               We pull back to see James alone in the car. The road is \n               crowded and manic; James is intense, hard, exhilarated, alert -- \n               a hunter. The car is full of junk, pop cans, styrofoam \n               containers, all suggesting that he has basically been living \n               in the car for some time.\n\n               James is searching for something among the lanes of traffic, \n               threading the immense car in and out of the shifting holes \n               that appear and disappear, driving with a fluid recklessness \n               that is recognizably Vaughan's style.\n\n               Suddenly, James becomes tense, focused: he has spotted what \n               he has been looking for.\n\n<b>               EXT. CROWDED RAIN-STREAKED ROADWAY -- SUNSET\n</b>\n               Through the Lincoln's insect- and oil-smeared windshield we \n               can see the unmistakable shape of Catherine's white sports \n               car, itself winding its way aggressively through the braids \n               of vehicles.\n\n               The Lincoln lurches out on to the narrow emergency lane and \n               takes off after Catherine's car, scraping the low concrete \n               wall as it wallows from side to side, clipping the corner of \n               a truck that has made the lane too narrow.\n\n<b>               INT. CATHERINE'S SPORTS CAR -- SUNSET\n</b>\n               In her mirrors, Catherine spots the Lincoln charging toward \n               her along the emergency lane. Her demeanor is just as \n               predatory as James's, and she does not hesitate to react.\n\n               Catherine cranks the steering wheel to the right and dives \n               across two lanes of startled vehicles to fishtail down a \n               little-used utility access road.\n\n               Behind her, and closing rapidly, the lumbering Lincoln follows \n               suit.\n\n<b>               EXT. UTILITY ROAD -- SUNSET\n</b>\n               Around the decreasing-radius curve of the utility road, the \n               more nimble sports car stretches out the distance between it \n               and the Lincoln, but once the road uncurls, the booming V-8 \n               allows the American car to gobble up the ground until it is \n               nose to tail with Catherine's car.\n\n               James begins to bump the tail of the sports car, breaking \n               off the accelerator for a beat to let the white car -- which \n               looks especially fragile and delicate by comparison -- get \n               away a bit, then charging back until it makes contact.\n\n               Now the road ahead curves again, and just as Catherine enters \n               the curve, James gives her a seriously violent jolt. The \n               rear of her car slews off on to the grass verge, almost comes \n               back, then loses traction completely.\n\n               Catherine's car spins backwards off the road, then rolls \n               unceremoniously, almost gently, down a small grade, shedding \n               bits and pieces, until it finally flops to a halt on its \n               side in front of a cement culvert.\n\n<b>               INT. VAUGHAN'S LINCOLN -- SUNSET\n</b>\n               Momentum has carried James past the point where Catherine \n               has left the road. James stands on the brakes until the \n               Lincoln shudders to a halt. He jams the shift lever into \n               reverse and backs up, tires squealing and smoking in protest, \n               to where he saw her go over the edge.\n\n<b>               EXT. UTILITY ROAD -- SUNSET\n</b>\n               James jumps out of the car and stands for a beat at the edge \n               of the road on the wet grass, savoring the tableau below \n               him.\n\n               Catherine lies sprawled, half out of the car, her tight black \n               dress hiked up over her hips, one arm across her face as \n               though shielding her eyes from the sight of her ruined, \n               lightly smoking sports car.\n\n               James eagerly makes his way down the wet grass of the hill \n               toward Catherine. As he approaches her, she begins to move, \n               stretching her arms behind her head, as though awakening \n               from a deep sleep. He can now see that her dress is wet, \n               soaked by the dirty water trickling out of the culvert and \n               now dammed up by her torso.\n\n               James kneels close to Catherine.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Catherine. Are you all right? Are \n                         you hurt?\n\n               Catherine's eyes flutter open. Her mascara is smeared, as \n               though she has been crying, and there is wetness at the \n               corners of her eyes. Her upper lip is bruised and beginning \n               to purple, and there is blood on her forehead and at the \n               corner of her mouth.\n\n<b>                                     CATHERINE\n</b>                         James, I... I don't know... I think \n                         I'm all right...\n\n               James slips her panties down her legs, leaving them around \n               her left ankle when they snag on the one high-heeled shoe \n               she still has on. He gently rotates her on to her right hip, \n               undoes his fly, then lies down on the concrete with her, \n               ignoring the light, muddy stream which now begins to soak \n               the thigh of his trousers. Kissing the back of her neck, he \n               enters her from behind.\n\n<b>                                     JAMES\n</b>                         Maybe the next one, darling... Maybe \n                         the next one...\n\n               We pull up and away from the couple on the ground until we \n               lose them behind the overturned sports car, then rise and \n               pivot until we are once again watching the frantic lanes of \n               traffic hurtling by obliviously only a few meters away.\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Crash</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=J.G.
