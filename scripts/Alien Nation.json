MOJAVE DESERT - DAY (TELEVISION IMAGE)\n</b>\nA LONG LENS SHOT of a far distant metallic object hovering\njust above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away.\nThe heat waves and the light refraction off the desert-\nscape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its\ntrue shape and appearance indistinct.\n\nThe VIDEO CAMERA recording this scene zooms back, then\npans over -- revealing a semicircle of US Army vehicles\nand personnel.  Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted\nscopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the\narmed infantry.  Everyone stares off at the same point on\nthe horizon.  Waiting.\n\nThe VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it\nmoves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a\nsecond, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards\nbehind the Army.  LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck\nbeds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes\nglued to the distant object.\n\nThe VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parked\nlocal TV van, finds the object again in the distance,\nzooms in, and waits, like everyone else.\n\nAbruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box\nCHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCRAIS\n</b>\tThat was the scene in California's\n\tMojave Desert three years ago today\n\t-- the historic first view of the\n\tNewcomer ship upon its dramatic\n\tarrival.

But once they were\n\treleases from the camp and we got a\n\tchance to know them, we saw what\n\tnice, quiet people they really are...\n\n<b>WIDER\n</b>\nrevealing a MASSIVE ALIEN FIGURE in a filthy white\nbusboy's uniform.  His back is to us as he picks up two\ntrays from the counter.

Sykes jumps.  It's a NEWCOMER\nDERELICT standing there, weaving, mumbling in his own\nlanguage.  In one filthy hand holds a quart carton of\nmilk.  We know immediately what he wants.  Sykes rolls\ndown the window.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tTake a hike.\n\nSykes gets a whiff of the derelict's breath as the light\nchanges and the sedan pulls away, leaving him in the\nstreet.  Sykes grimaces at the smell.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tWhy's it have to be sour milk that\n\tthese guys get wasted on?

SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe dashboard is littered with fast-food detritus and two\ncoffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the\nwindshield.  A hand picks up one of the coffees and we\nFOLLOW IT to a face, a forty-year-old cop face that's seen\nsome wear and tear -- behind the wheel is MATT SYKES.\nBeside him is his partner of nine years, BILL TUGGLE.\nTuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tHow can I go?\n\n<b>\t\t\tTUGGLE\n</b>\tPut on your wash-and-wear suit and\n\tyour clip-on tie, have your landlady\n\ttie your shoes for you, and show up\n\tat the church.

Then he spots something that twinges his street-cop\nradar.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tUh-oh... Check it out.\n\nTHROUGH THE WINDOW Tuggle sees what Sykes sees: two ALIENS\nin long coats moving down the sidewalk, entering a mom-\nand-pop mini-mart on the corner.  One of them wears dark\nglasses and a red bandana (KIPLING): the other has on a\nblack vinyl raincoat.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tDoes that look at all suspicious to\n\tyou?\n\n<b>\t\t\tTUGGLE\n</b>\tWhatever gave you that idea?\n\n\n<b>EXT.  STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes continues up a quarter of a block, pulls to the curb\namong other parked cars.\n\n\n<b>INT.  SEDAN - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes is already pulling his gun.  Tuggle quickly reaches\nfor the radio in the glovebox.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTUGGLE\n</b>\tThis is one-Henry-seven, we've got a\n\tpossible two-eleven in progress at\n\tPorter's Mini-Mart, corner of Court\n\tand Alvarado.  Requesting backup.\n\nImpulsive Sykes is already opening his door and climbing\nout.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tLet's do it, partner.\n\nTuggle drops the radio mike and follows Sykes as the Radio\nDispatcher confirms the call.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked\ncars across the street from the mini-mart.  Through the\nstore window they see the old alien PROPRIETOR behind the\ncounter.  His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat\nand yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it\nright at him.  The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun\nand covers the door.\n\nSykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tYou got your vest?\n\n<b>\t\t\tTUGGLE\n</b>\tOf course.  Right in the trunk of\n\tthe car.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tYeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.\n\nThrough the store window the robbery continues in\npantomime.  Kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun,\nyelling orders in the alien language.  The Proprietor is\nquickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register.\nThe PROPRIETOR'S WIFE, a middle-aged alien woman, stands\nin the doorway from the back, frozen in fear.  The\nRaincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired.\n\nSykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the\nstreet from the store entrance.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTUGGLE\n</b>\tWatch the driver.  I'm going for a\n\tbetter angle on the door.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tI got him.  Don't get pinned.\n\nTuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater-\ncorner across the intersection.\n\nThrough the store window Sykes sees Kipling grab the bag\nof cash, shove it in his coat pocket.  Bills fall out, but\nhe doesn't care.  Then, without warning, Kipling whips up\nthe twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's\nchest!  The Proprietor slams back against the shelves,\nslides to the floor.  Kipling leans over the counter and\nFIRES another round into the Proprietor.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\t\t   (under his breath)\n\tAw, shit.\n\nTuggle is almost across the street when he hears the\nshots.\n\nThe human DRIVER of the getaway car (parked at the curb a\nfew doors down from the mini-mart) glances up, spots\nTuggle.  He leans on the HORN, reaches for a machine\npistol on the seat next to him.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT\n</b>\nKipling and Raincoat alien react to the horn honk.  They\nspot Tuggle through the store window and open fire --\n<b>BLASTING THROUGH THE GLASS.\n</b>\nA civilian car enters the intersection.  The engine is hit\nby shotgun fire, and the car skids to a stop in the\nintersection, steam rising from the radiator.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\nTuggle dives behind a lamp post.\n\nThe Driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine\npistol to fire at Tuggle.  Sykes sees this and opens fire\nat the Driver.  The Driver turns and fires at Sykes.\nSykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is\nsprayed with bullets.\n\nA forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between\nSykes and the Driver.  Once the truck is past, Sykes is\nstanding behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready.  He\nrapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver.\n\nTuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the\nshotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tGet outta there!\n\n<b>\t\t\tTUGGLE\n</b>\tI can't!  Do you mind!\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tI'll cover you!  Get outta there!!\n\nSykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway\ncar, firing toward the store as he goes.\n\nKipling and Raincoat dodge behind cover.\n\nTuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp\npost and runs to the stalled civilian car.  He slides\nacross the hood and drops behind the car for cover.\nTuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car\nwindow.  His gaze is met by the face of the OLD MAN driver\nwho is still inside the car.\n\n<b>\t\t\tOLD MAN\n</b>\tCan I get out now?\n\n<b>\t\t\tTUGGLE\n</b>\tMove it!\n\nSykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in\nthe store.  As he considers his next move--\n\nTuggle fires at the two aliens.  They return fire and he\nslides down to safety behind the car.  Or so he thinks.\nGlass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by\nthe shotgun blasts.  He flinches as another blast hits the\ncar.  He looks over.  There's a big exit hole in the\nfender beside him.  THE SHOT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAR.\nAnother exit hole is BLASTED, inches from his shoulder.\n\nPanicked, he scrambles along the side of the car -- BLASTS\nand exit holes following him until he reaches the front of\nthe car.  He has nowhere left to go and--\n\n-- a BLAST comes through the car and catches him squarely\nin the chest throwing him back onto the street.\n\nSykes' head jerks around -- in time to see his partner of\nnine years blown away.\n\nKipling keeps firing in Tuggle's direction until his\nshotgun CLICKS empty.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT\n</b>\nKipling grabs Raincoat and throws him toward the back exit\nof the store.  The shotgun falls from Raincoat's hands.\nThe two of them run out the back.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes runs to Tuggle's spread-eagled body.  One glance is\nenough.  Nobody ever looked deader.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tAw shit, Tug, Jesus!  Goddamn it!\n\nHe stares, shocked and incredulous.  He can't find a way\nto think or feel about this.  Then we see him going crazy\nright before our eyes, the rage revving.  He takes off\ntoward the store as SIRENS are HEARD rapidly approaching\nin background.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken\nglass, bangs through the exit.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round\nthe corner at the far end of the alley.  He takes off,\nquickly cranking up to full speed.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BACK STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes rounds the corner.  Doesn't see them anymore.  He\nslows... moves along this street with some caution.  Lots\nof shadows, lots of hiding places.  Sykes HEARS a NOISE,\nlooks up... just in time to see Raincoat on a high, huge\nbillboard.  He cuts loose with the shotgun.  Sykes dives.\nHuge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the\nnight.  Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the\ncrates.\n\nRaincoat's shotgun CLICKS empty now.  He drops it, swings\ndown off the fire escape, runs off.\n\nSykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  TUNNEL STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes rounds this second corner, races down the street.\nThe only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up\nahead.  Sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open.\n\n\n<b>INT.  TUNNEL - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves\nthrough the mouth.  He tries to control his breathing so\nhe can hear.  The only SOUND is his own shoes scuffing\nalong the asphalt.\n\nThen he HEARS -- another set of FOOTSTEPS.  Rapid\nfootsteps, coming toward him, ECHOING.  He can't tell from\nwhich direction!  He spins, just as a LARGE SHAPE lunges\nfor him with an alien CRY.\n\nIt's the wired Raincoat alien.  Sykes gets his gun up just\nin time and FIRES -- once, twice, three times.  Raincoat\nalien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the\nblasts.  Sykes approaches the body slowly.  With an\ninhuman ROAR, the alien snaps forward, lunging at Sykes\nwith outstretched arms.  Sykes jumps back, startled, and\nFIRES twice more at the pale figure.  Raincoat goes down\nand stays down.\n\nSykes relaxes for the briefest moment.  Then he HEARS\nit... a distinctive CLICKING SOUND, metal on metal.  Sykes\nlooks up and -- Kipling drops down on him from directly\nabove!  Sykes goes down in a heap.  He's managed to hold\nonto the gun and as Kipling comes for him, he swings the\ngun hand around.  Kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming\nthe gun from Sykes' hand.  Sykes tries to get to his feet,\nbut the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel.\n\nA SIREN is HEARD approaching in background.\n\nKipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace.  As he\ndraws near, Sykes HEARS that distinctive CLICKING SOUND\nagain.\n\n<b>SYKES' P.O.V.\n</b>\nThough his vision is BLURRED, Sykes still gets a good look\nat an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist.  The\nstrands of this bracelet are what make the CLINKING NOISE.\n\n<b>ANGLE\n</b>\nThe alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching\nSIREN suddenly WAILS louder as a backup patrol car swings\nonto the street heading this way.  Kipling sees this and\nleaves Sykes, running off down the dark tunnel.\n\n<b>ON SYKES\n</b>\ndazed, struggling to rise.  WE HEAR running FOOTSTEPS\napproaching.  Sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused.\n\n<b>SYKES' P.O.V.\n</b>\nAn OUT-OF-FOCUS ALIEN FACE looming over him.\n\n<b>ANGLE\n</b>\nSykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his\nweight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien\nface.  The alien, caught by surprise and off balance,\nsprawls backward OUT OF FRAME.  Sykes is grabbed by a\nhuman uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHUMAN COP\n</b>\tWhoa, whoa... hold it.  Take it easy.\n\t\t   (to alien on the\n\t\t    ground)\n\tYou okay?\n\nSykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus.  He looks at\nthe alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet\naway.  The alien is a uniformed cop... his name is JETSON.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tI am all right.\n\nHe gets up.  A trickle of purple blood runs from his nose.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHUMAN COP\n</b>\tI better call in.\n\nHe moves off.  Jetson moves toward Sykes and the Raincoat\nalien's body.  Sykes tenses, thinking Jetson might\nretaliate in some way.  But Jetson simply steps past him\nto kneel beside the dead alien.  He checks for a pulse on\nthe underside of the dead alien's upper arm.  Nothing.\nSykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain.  He\nstruggles to rise.  Jetson gets an arm around him to help\nhim up.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tYour hand will require attention.\n\nSykes roughly jerks himself free of Jetson's grip.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tGet the hell away from me!  I don't\n\tneed your goddamn help.\n\nHe almost loses his balance and has to steady himself\nagainst the tunnel wall.  Sykes leans there, the picture\nof impotent rage and frustration.  Jetson looks at him,\nwith that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit\nwhen trying to understand human nature.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT\n</b>\nOPEN on Tuggle's body, as the body bag is zipped up over\nhis face, and the litter is lifted into the back of the\nCoroner's wagon.\n\nWIDEN to reveal Sykes, standing nearby, watching.  The\nWagon pulls out, and Sykes turns, moving past all the LAPD\nblack-and-whites and forensics wagons, and COPS (two of\nthem aliens) and DETECTIVES, and RUBBERNECKERS (some\nalien).  He moves into:\n\n\n<b>INT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe CRIME SCENE TEAM is checking for prints, digging slugs\nout of the wall, photographing everything.  Several\nUNIFORMED COPS mill around.  Sykes moves aimlessly around\nthe room like a stranger at a party.\n\nThe Proprietor's Wife stands near the body in a strange\nrigid posture, a thin, mournful KEENING SOUND coming from\nher lips.  A harried female uniformed cop is trying to get\nher away from the body, but can't get her to budge.\n\nMINKLER, a ballistics guy, is tagging the pump-shotgun the\nRaincoat alien dropped here.  NATUZZI, a mean-looking\nveteran uniform cop is with him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNATUZZI\n</b>\tLooks like a standard combat pump-\n\taction.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMINKLER\n</b>\tIt is.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNATUZZI\n</b>\tSo what punched holes clear through\n\tthat car out there?\n\nMinkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box.\nInside are four unfired twelve gauge shells.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMINKLER\n</b>\tBRI Sabot slugs.

Tug might as well've been\n\thiding behind a rosebush.\n\nMinkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him.\nHe looks.  It's Sykes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNATUZZI\n</b>\tPretty heavy artillery for knocking\n\tover a liquor store.\n\nA new voice enters the conversation.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON (O.S.)\n</b>\tAn identical round was used in the\n\tshooting of a Newcomer named\n\tHubley, two days ago.\n\nSykes turns -- surprised, and not especially pleased to\nsee the voice is Jetson's.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMINKLER\n</b>\tYeah?  So why the extra fire power?\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tPerhaps because even the larger\n\tcaliber handguns aren't always\n\teffective against my people.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\t\t   (mulls this, then)\n\tYou saying there's some connection\n\tto this other homicide?\n\nBefore Jetson can say, the female cop who was talking to\nthe Proprietor's Wife steps up.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFEMALE COP\n</b>\tHey, give me a hand with this woman,\n\twill ya Jetson?

Left-over take-out Chinese food cartons.\nLeft-over take-out burger wrappers. \n\nThe answering machine message begins -- he glances over\nhis shoulder as he HEARS his daughter's VOICE.

A human HOSTESS in a slit\ndress has just finished seating Sykes and Jetson at a\ntable.  She moves off.  The two cops look up at the stage.\n\n<b>REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\nrevealing the exotic alien dancer named CASSANDRA.  She\nmoves with a feline blend of strength and grace.  Framing\nher face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a\nmane as she undulates to the MUSIC.\n\nSykes watches with fascination.

He reaches for it.  A small dispenser -- of the\nkind we saw being filled at the refinery.  Jetson studies\nit, his suspicions growing.

Jetson, on the floor, starts to rise.\n\nSuddenly somebody flies at Sykes from the side, knocking\nhim sideways down the corridor.  It's Cassandra.  Watson\nseizes the moment and shoves the off-balance Jetson into\nsome furniture and dives for the door.\n\n\n<b>INT.

It is Harcourt, standing behind the table in\na pool of light, who has opened the suitcase.  He is\nflanked by Kipling... with Quint elsewhere in the room.\nThe room is lit by track light, creating pools of light\nand dark.\n\nThe two alien Dealers' eyes widen at the sight of the\ndrug.

But when my fellow\n\tNewcomers learn they can obtain it\n\there, they will work very hard... to\n\tmake as much money as they can... to\n\tgive it to me.\n\nSuddenly, a voice from the shadows near the open door to\nthe other office:\n\n<b>\t\t\tVOICE\n</b>\tYou haven't told him all of it.\n\nHarcourt and the others react.  Quint leaps to his feet,\ncaught off guard.  Kipling reaches for his shoulder\nholster.  A silhouette beside the open door to the outer\noffice nudges Cassandra into the light of the room, then\nsteps out himself.  It is Jetson.\n\nQuint gets his gun out, is about to aim... when his eyes\ngo wide at the sight of something Jetson holds.\n\nIt is the plastic explosive charge that Quint was wiring\nto the slug-mobile.  The wires are connected and Jetson's\nfinger squeezes down hard on the detonation push-switch.\n\n<b>\t\t\tQUINT\n</b>\tHe's got the C-4 charge!\n\nJetson moves forward slowly, holding the bomb in front of\nhim.

The others quickly join him.\nHe nudges Cassandra ahead of himself, keeping her where he\ncan see her.\n\n<b>\t\t\tQUINT\n</b>\t\t   (continuing)\n\tJust take it real casual, buddy.\n\tKeep your finger on that button and\n\tdon't do nothing squirrely.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARCOURT\n</b>\tIf you release that button, you not\n\tonly kill us, but yourself.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tTo get you and that--\n\t\t   (indicates drug in\n\t\t    suitcase)\n\t-- I would do it.\n\nHe says it with such straightforward eye contact, that\nHarcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tEveryone up against that wall.\n\tVery slowly.\n\t\t   (to Harcourt)\n\tExcept you.\n\nHarcourt remains behind the desk.  Cassandra stays where\nshe is, near Jetson.  The others move to the wall.\nKipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen.\n\nJetson takes the \"sample\" dispenser from the table, tosses\nit into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it.\nAll the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARCOURT\n</b>\tOne small matter seems to have\n\tescaped your attention.

Who is Todd.\n\t\t   (then remembers;\n\t\t    smiles)\n\tAh, poor Mr. Watson.\n\nCassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said\nsinks in.  Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase.  They\nstart out.  Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's .357\nand with a KEENING WAIL, brings it up toward Harcourt's\nface.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b><b>\tNOOO!\n</b>\nJetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun.  He\nmanages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet\ngoing into the wall behind Harcourt.  Striking like a\nmongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead\nwires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart.\nJetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch...\nand nothing happens.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKIPLING\n</b>\tI got it!\n\nKipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the\nfloor.  Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her\nwith it, hard.  She drops to her knees and Quint viciously\nhits her again.\n\nMeanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet.  Kipling\nrears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm\n-- to the nerve plexus.  Jetson instantly folds over\nforward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into\nJetson's face, flipping him back.  Kipling slams him into\nthe wall face-first, pinning him there.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARCOURT\n</b>\tKill them both.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKIPLING\n</b>\tHere?\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARCOURT\n</b>\t\t   (raging)\n\tDo it!\n\nQuint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the\nbase of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger.\nThere's a loud BLAM!  and Cassandra flinches... then looks\nup.\n\nQuint is blown backward away from her.\n\nSykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the\nCasull smoking in his hand.\n\nQuint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid\nwall, but the huge window overlooking the club.  He\ncrashes through it.\n\n<b>ANGLE FROM DANCE FLOOR\n</b>\nas the wall of mirror explodes IN SLOW MOTION and Quint\ncartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds.\n\n<b>ANGLE - IN THE OFFICE\n</b>\nKipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at\nSykes.\n\nSykes dodges into the private office for cover.\n\nThe three Dealers dive behind any available furniture.\n\nHarcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door\nleading into the adjoining outer office.\n\nSykes swings around the edge of the private office door,\nstraight-arms the Casull into the office and fires.\nKipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door,\ncovering Harcourt's back.  Sykes ducks back down.\n\nAn unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and\nKipling escaping, and takes off after them.\n\nSykes straight-arms the gun into the room again... sees\nJetson disappearing through the adjoining office door.  He\nmoves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in\nsurrender, rise from behind the furniture.\n\n<b>\t\t\tALIEN DEALER\n</b>\tDon't shoot, man -- we're unarmed --\n\tlook!\n\nSykes looks at these harmless wimps... then at Cassandra.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tYou okay?\n\n<b>\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n</b>\t\t   (dazed, but all\n\t\t    right)\n\tYeah...\n\nAnd he charges out the adjoining office door.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear\nand floors it.\n\nJetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels\nout.  Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing\ncar.  One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the\nrear of the trunk, but the car keeps going.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tThis way!\n\nHe indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby.  They race to\nit, jump in... Sykes driving.  He burns rubber as he pulls\nout.\n\nA second arriving police unit pulls into the alley,\nheading straight for the slug-mobile.

It clips one of the civilian cars, causing a\npile-up of traffic behind the police unit.\n\nThe slug-mobile skids to a stop, blocked by the clog of\ntraffic in the tunnel.  Sykes is out of the drivers door\nin a flash, stand on the door frame, and yells--\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tMove your goddamned cars!\n\nPeople climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered --\nignoring Sykes.

VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT\n</b>\nThey reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto--\n\n\n<b>EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n</b>\nA clear two lane straightaway near the ocean.  Sykes\npushes the slug-mobile to its limits, pulls alongside the\npolice unit.  The two cars trade blows at 90+ MPH.\nKipling manages to send Sykes onto the dirt shoulder,\nslowing him down.\n\n\n<b>INT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT\n</b>\nKipling watches the slug-mobile in the rearview mirror,\nthen looks back out the front to see the end of the road\ncoming up fast!  Harcourt bellows to Kipling, who slams on\nthe brakes.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  END OF BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain\nlink fence where the road ends.  An abandoned drawbridge\nand the ocean are on the other side of the fence.\n\nWith nowhere else to go, Harcourt yells something at\nKipling and Kipling floors it back the way they came.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe two cars are racing for a full head-on.  At the last\ninstant, Sykes wrenches the wheel, throws the slug-mobile\nsideways, passenger side first.  The police unit smashes\ninto the rear door and fender of the slug-mobile, both\ncars skidding madly to a stop.  A fire ignites under the\nhood of the police unit.\n\n\n<b>INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes sits stunned behind the wheel.  Disoriented but\nconscious, he raises his head, looks over... sees Jetson\nout cold, his forehead gashed and bleeding.  Then he looks\nover and sees the fire growing under the police unit's\nhood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug-\nmobile -- near the gas tank.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes slides out of the driver's door, stumbles to\nJetson's door, wrenches it open, and drags the huge\nunconscious alien away from the cars.\n\nHe's still dragging Jetson away when he spots Harcourt\npulling himself through the smashed police unit window.\nBruised and bleeding, Harcourt reaches in for the\nsuitcase, then starts to run with it.\n\nWith Jetson a safe distance away from the cars, Sykes\nclambers to his feet, draws the Casull, and starts off\nafter Harcourt.\n\nHarcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the\nclosed drawbridge.  He heaves the suitcase over, then\nstarts to climb.\n\nSykes lumbers past the burning police unit.  Kipling is\nstill behind the wheel, his head slumped forward.  Sykes\nis just past the cars when they explode -- sending hoods\nand door panels and glass flying in all directions.\nHarcourt, on the other side of the fence, grabs the\nsuitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the\nabandoned drawbridge.\n\nSykes reaches the fence.  Instead of climbing, he simply\nblows the lock to hell with the Casull, and kicks open the\ngate.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  ABANDONED DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe end of the bridge is in the \"up\" position... a huge\nasphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky.  Harcourt\nruns along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the\nbridge, the black seawater drifting past beside him.  His\nfoot slips once and he almost goes over the side.\n\nSykes -- backlit by the burning cars, the big Casull a\nprominent part of the silhouette -- just keeps coming.\n\nHarcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge --\nand has nowhere to go.  He is backed into a corner, with\nseawater on two side of him.  Harcourt pivots frantically,\nsees Sykes coming this way.  Harcourt is a trapped animal.\nHis chest heaves in panic.  Then his gaze falls on the\nsuitcase behind him... and slowly... finally... a look of\nresolve comes into his eye.\n\n<b>ON SYKES\n</b>\nHe eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows\nHarcourt is.  There's some movement among the shadows, and\nSykes straight-arms the Casull, his finger white against\nthe trigger.\n\nPerspiration drips into Sykes' eye, but he doesn't blink.\nA long moment then--\n\n<b>ANGLE - THE SHADOWS\n</b>\nHarcourt emerges from the darkness.  His face is composed,\nthe superior glint is back in his eye.  His arms are held\naway from his sides at 30 degree angles, clearly in\nsurrender.\n\nSykes cat-steps forward slowly.  Harcourt stares at Sykes'\neyes, and the desire there that Harcourt will give him an\nexcuse.  Harcourt simply... smiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tMove a finger, Harcourt, and you're\n\thistory...\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARCOURT\n</b>\tNo, Sergeant -- not history...\n\t\t   (beat)\n\tEternity...\n\nAnd now Sykes sees it -- Harcourt has been holding one of\nthe one-kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind\nhis arm.  He brings it up over his head, grins at Sykes,\nthen tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open.\nThe blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin.  His\nmouth fills.\n\nHe looks back at Sykes, making eye contact... his eyes\nmad, defiant.  And -- he swallows.  Long hold -- then the\nwallop of the overdose hits him... his face contorts in\nagony as he begins to convulse.  Sykes, wide-eyed, lowers\nthe Casull and watches as Harcourt drops to the ground and\ngoes into a massive violent seizure.  His limbs hammer\nagainst the deck... his back arches fiercely.  It is a\nbrutal, agonizing ten seconds.  Then, finally, his body\nbecomes still.\n\nSykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to\nhim and takes his pulse the way he saw Jetson do it.\n\n<b>HIGH ANGLE SHOT - THE ENTIRE AREA\n</b>\nSykes stands.  He notices the suitcase nearby, latches it,\nand hefts it.  He carries it with him back toward the\ninferno of the wrecked cars, the Casull hanging heavy and\ncold in his hand.\n\n<b>ANGLE FOLLOWING SYKES\n</b>\nHe approaches the burning cars, heading for Jetson.  As he\npasses the burning cars, we have a half-second to register\nthat the driver's door of the police unit is now open\nbefore--\n\n-- a dark figure hurtles at Sykes' back from O.S.!  Sykes\nis thrown forward.  The suitcase crashes to the ground,\nand the Casull goes skittering off.  Sykes looks up -- to\nbe met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of\nKipling!  Kipling reaches down for the suitcase then Sykes\nhears it -- the telltale CLINKING SOUND.  He looks -- and\nsees the exotic silver bracelet on Kipling's wrist.  It\nconnects for him; this is the bandana alien -- the one who\nkilled Bill Tuggle!\n\nKipling brings the suitcase above his head.  He is a half-\nsecond from hurling it down on Sykes' skull when -- a GUN\nROARS.  Kipling is thrown back by the chest wound.  Sykes\nlooks.\n\n<b>ANGLE\n</b>\nJetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking Casull.\n\nKipling recovers enough to come at Sykes again with the\nsuitcase again.  Jetson, shaking but determined, fires\nagain, and again, and again.\n\nKipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase\nstill over his head... until he is blasted at last and\nforever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the\ninferno.\n\nSykes rises, makes his way to Jetson's side.  Jetson has\nlet the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground.\nSykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the\nalien's hand.  The two partners remain like this, bathed\nin the orange flickering glow of the fire.\n\n<b>HIGH WIDE SHOT\n</b>\nof the drawbridge, the debris, the carnage, and our two\ncops...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t    DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe police mop-up is winding down.  Cop cars, coroner's\nwagons, fire trucks.

He glances up as they are bathed in red\nand blue light.  A patrol car has pulled up next to them.\nInside is Wiltey, a uniformed cop.\n\n<b>\t\t\tWILTEY\n</b>\tI'll give you guys a lift to the\n\tstation.

The coroner's wagon is\nstopped at an angle in the middle of the intersection,\nheadlights and roof lights cutting into the night, the\nback doors wide open.  A patrol car is also here, on the\nother side of the wagon.  There is no movement anywhere\nnear the two vehicles.\n\nWiltey pulls the car up, his eyes like saucers at the\neerie scene.  He reaches for the radio hand mike.  Jetson\nquickly covers it with a large hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tNo!\n\t\t   (both Sykes and\n\t\t    Wiltey look at him)\n\tWe must do this alone.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tDo what?!

They reach the van and Sykes takes Wiltey's\nflashlight, shines it through the open back doors.  The\ndoors are bent outward, smashed half off their hinges.\nOne of the body bags is ripped open, literally split from\nend to end.  The blue and red lightbar on the other patrol\ncar can be seen through the wagon's front windshield.\n\nJetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car,\nSykes and Wiltey follow.  Lights all ablaze, it too is\nabandoned.  One door has been wrenched off its hinges and\nlays in the street, and the front windshield is smashed.\nOur three cops approach the car, then Wiltey spots\nsomething beyond the unit.\n\n<b>\t\t\tWILTEY\n</b>\tOh, God...\n\nSykes and Jetson look.\n\nThe bodies of the coroner wagon Driver and Attendant, as\nwell as the two OFFICERS from the patrol car, are crushed\nand beaten and stretched out on the asphalt.  Their arms\nare twisted as though by a mad force -- each pointing down\nthe street toward the dock warehouses ahead.

Wiltey eases the car\ndown the center of the street.  Sykes and Jetson, guns\nready, walk slowly along on either side of the car... eyes\neverywhere.\n\n<b>MOVING POV\n</b>\nas they move past the shadowy dock warehouses... watching\nfor any signs of movement.\n\n<b>BACK TO SCENE\n</b>\nSykes and Jetson converse across the hood of the car as\nthey walk.

Whatever it was,\nwas large and fast.  It darted into an open warehouse\ndoor.\n\n<b>\t\t\tWILTEY\n</b>\tThere he is!\n\nAnd Wiltey floors it.  Sykes and Jetson watch, unable to\nstop him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tWiltey!\n\nHe and Sykes take off running.  Wiltey skids to the left,\nrockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight.\nSykes and Jetson pour it on.  They hear a SCREECH OF\nBRAKES.  They reach the warehouse door and race through.\n\n\n<b>INT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\nLOW ANGLE, SHOOTING ACROSS the underside of Wiltey's\nstopped patrol car as Sykes' and Jetson's feet appear\naround the corner of the warehouse door.  The car is still\nrunning -- the exhaust pipe still RUMBLING and expelling\nfumes.  The feet slow... then cautiously start around the\ncar.  We PAN with them as they move around the side of the\ncar.  A dark liquid begins dripping in EXTREME F.G.  We\nMOVE UP, to a CLOSE UP of the car bumper.  The dark liquid\nis blood, dripping deep red on the shiny chrome.  We MOVE\nUP farther, and--\n\n-- there is Wiltey's severed head.  IN CLOSE UP, resting\non the hood of the patrol car.\n\nSykes and Jetson stop dead at the sight.  Wiltey's body\nlies in a heap on the floor near the car.  They both\nstare, then Sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the\nwarehouse, his expression saying: what the hell could have\ndone this so fast?\n\n<b>THEIR POV\n</b>\nThere are two paths to go.  Both dark and scary as hell.\nThe sound of a distant FOG HORN blends with the CREAKS and\nDRIPS of this waterfront building.\n\n<b>ANGLE - SYKES AND JETSON\n</b>\nJetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun\nfrom the dash mount.  He checks the chamber as Sykes\nchecks the Casull.\n\nThey exchange a knowing look... then wordlessly, they\nsplit up.  Sykes takes the path to the left, Jetson to the\nright.\n\n<b>WITH JETSON\n</b>\nAs he moves into a dark area.  He slowly picks his way\nalong a long wall, having to step over all sorts of piled\ndebris, heading toward us.  We PAN slightly to the left to\nHOLD a door in CLOSE UP.  The door, already ajar, eases\nopen slightly wider.  Jetson hears this.  He reaches the\ndoor, sets himself, then spins and kicks the door open all\nthe way.  There's nothing inside... now.\n\nJetson looks up, sees movement in the distance.  It is\nSykes, quite far away, in another section of the\nwarehouse.  Sykes leaves Jetson's field of view.\n\n\n<b>INT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes walks around a corner -- freezes, and cocks his head\nas he hears VOICES -- followed, curiously, by LAUGHTER.\nHe eases forward, peers around a bend, and sees -- a table\nand a chair.  On the table is a mini-television, tuned to\nsome local late night talk show.  There's a thermos, a\nsteaming cup of coffee, and a Twinkie with a single bite\nout of it beside the TV.  The chair is empty, except for a\njacket slung across the back, the word SECURITY stitched\non the breast.  The guard is nowhere in sight.\n\nSykes moves toward the table, taking in this eerie sight.\nHe looks around, then continues on.\n\n\n<b>INT.  WAREHOUSE - APPROACHING STAIRS - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies, comes to a\nset of stairs leading to an upper floor.  The top of the\nstairs is pitch black.  Jetson adjusts his grip on the\nshotgun, slowly starts up the stairs.\n\n\n<b>INT.  WAREHOUSE - AT FISH NETS - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets, hanging\nfrom the ceiling.  He has no alternate route -- he begins\npushing through them.\n\n<b>SYKES' POV - MOVING THROUGH FISH NETS\n</b>\nBecause of the dimness, he can't see much beyond each rack\nof nets immediately before him.  He keeps wading through\n-- it's like a house of mirrors, he can't tell now much\nfarther he has to go to get out of the nets, and the\ndeeper in he gets, the harder it would be to go back the\nway he came.  He pushes past one particular rack of nets\nand looming out of the darkness ahead of him is--\n\n-- a terrifying face!\n\n<b>ON SYKES\n</b>\nHe stumbles back, gets tangled in the nets, brings up the\nCasull, is about to fire when... he sees what the face is.\nIt's the maiden's figurehead from the bow of an old ship.\nThe wood is worm-eaten and decayed, creating a hideous\nvisage.  Sykes stands there a moment, trying to jump-start\nhis heart again.\n\n\n<b>INT.  SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson moves along the rickety planks.  He comes to a\ndoor.  He eases it open, enters.\n\n\n<b>INT.  SECOND FLOOR ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson moves into the shadowy confines.  He hears an\nincessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner.  He moves\nto it.  Turns the spigot, stopping the drip.  Other drips\nare HEARD from a dozen other hidden recesses all around\nhim.  He glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the\nwall above the sink.  Suddenly he sees the movement of\nsomething behind him.  He spins with the shotgun.  A huge\nshadow moves along the wall.  He pivots the shotgun again\n-- toward the source of the shadow.\n\nIt's a length of black tarp, torn and flapping from the\nceiling.  Jetson lets out a deep breath.\n\n\n<b>INT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nANGLE down a short passageway to an intersecting hallway.\nA strand of something hangs in FRAME in OUT OF FOCUS F.G.\nIt makes an indistinct, rhythmic CLINKING SOUND.  Sykes\nmoves along the intersecting hallway.  The CLINKING SOUND\ncatches his attention.  He stops, listens, then starts\ndown the passageway, toward us.\n\nHe comes forward into the storage room, having to get very\nclose to the strand of something before he sees what it\nis.  It's a double strand of chain, CLINKING gently\nagainst itself.  Sykes reaches out, steadies the chain,\nsilencing it.  He considers.  It could've been a natural\noccurrence... or something could have brushed against it,\nsetting it in motion.  He tightens his grip on the Casull,\nbacking away from the chain.  He senses something behind\nhim and spins.  Nothing there.  He relaxes.  However--\n\nBehind him now, in SOFT FOCUS, we glimpse movement at the\nother end of the short passageway.  It is a figure, moving\nslowly forward down the passageway, back-lit by the\nhallway light behind it, its shadow filling the passageway\nas it approaches Sykes.  It stops, inside the room now,\ndirectly behind Sykes.  Close enough to reach out and\ntouch him.  It is an alien silhouette, but larger, more\npowerful.\n\nSuddenly, Sykes senses something is there.  He turns,\nslowly, and--\n\n<b>SHOCK CUT - HARCOURT\n</b>\nas he steps from the shadows -- just like he did the last\ntime Sykes saw him on the abandoned drawbridge.  Only this\ntime it is a horribly transformed Harcourt.  His eyes are\nred-rimmed and piggish.  His head is lumpen, his skin\nthick and hard.  His neck muscles are corded -- giving him\na kind of hellish cobra's cowl.  There is still\nintelligence behind the eyes -- but it is a feral\nintelligence now.\n\n<b>\t\t\tHARCOURT\n</b>\t\t   (his voice a guttural\n\t\t    rumble)\n\tLooking for me, Sergeant?\n\nSykes stumbles back several steps, wildly brings up the\nCasull, and fires.  The powerful Casull round catches\nHarcourt in the shoulder, jerking him back.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  WORK SHED AREA - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson, in another area of the docks, hears the echoing\nblast of the Casull.  He gauges as best he can the\ndirection it came from and takes off running.\n\n\n<b>INT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nHarcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact.  The\ncloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder-\nburned, but the bullet couldn't pierce his plated skin.\nHarcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth, starts\ntoward Sykes.\n\nScared shitless, Sykes rapid-fires.  One of his shots\nmisses, shattering a crate beside Harcourt's head.  The\nremaining shots strike Harcourt full on.  Harcourt is\njerked by the impact of the bullets each time, SNARLING in\nanger -- but none of the hits stop him.  The Casull is\nempty and Harcourt keeps coming.\n\nSykes stumbles back, but Harcourt is on him in a flash.\nHarcourt grabs Sykes' arm holding the gun, yanks hard.  We\nHEAR the POP as the shoulder dislocates.  Sykes HOLLERS,\nand the gun jumps out of his hand.\n\n\n<b>INT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson races in, shotgun ready.  The last of Sykes' shots\nare still ECHOING.  Jetson looks around, frustrated,\nunable to tell exactly where they are coming from.  He\nsees the likely path and charges that way.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DOCK - AT STAIRS - NIGHT\n</b>\nOn the CUT, Sykes' body is already tumbling down these\nrickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse,\nhaving been thrown ruthlessly from above.  As Sykes' body\nsprawls on the dock, the massive figure of Harcourt\nappears at the top of the stairs.\n\nSykes, scraped and bruised, struggles to his feet.\nHarcourt moves down the stairs, then vaults over the\nrailing the last fifteen feet.  Harcourt lurches forward\nand, with a taloned grip on Sykes' shoulders, propels him\ndown the docks.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe first two arriving black-and-whites skid to stops at\nthe coroner's wagon.  The Officers leap out, flagging\nother arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes is on his feet, but his knees buckle, and he almost\ncollapses again.  Harcourt comes at him.  Then Sykes sees\nit--\n\n-- a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of\nthe jetties.  Sykes makes a break for it.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  WAREHOUSE - AT STAIRS - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs,\nfrantically scanning for any sign of Sykes.  Then, in the\ndistance, he spots the two figures running along the jetty\n-- Sykes being chased by the re-formed Harcourt.  Jetson\ngives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive\nlook, then gathers up his courage, and races down the\nstairs to help Sykes.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  JETTY - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes lumbers along the narrow jetty.  The fishing boat is\nalready passing the end of the jetty.  Harcourt is fast\nbehind Sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults\noff toward the stern of the boat -- landing on the fishing\nnet piled on the rear deck.  He yells in pain as his ankle\ntwists under his weight.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes lies there, holding his arm, breathing hard,\nrelieved that he has escaped.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  JETTY - NIGHT\n</b>\nHarcourt can't reach the boat from the same jetty Sykes\ndid, so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty, then\nonto a second jetty.  And from here, he vaults across the\nseawater onto the boat.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the\ncabin.  The fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the\nopen sea.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson sees this and is shitting bricks.  Suddenly the\nstark BEAM of a police helicopter sun-gun stabs down from\nabove.  Jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low,\nthe sun-gun washing over the docks.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe sun-gun hits Jetson standing on the dock, frantically\nwaving his badge at the 'copter, signaling it down.  The\nPilot starts to take it down.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes is on all fours, clawing his way up the fishing net\ntoward the back of the boat.  Harcourt gets one hand on\nhis leg.  Sykes jerks his leg away, and Harcourt's claws\ndig deep through Sykes' pants into his legs as he pulls\naway.  Sykes BELLOWS in pain.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the\ndock.  He has to catch himself from falling out the open\ndoor.  Below, uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto\nthe dock.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tOn that boat -- out there!\n\nJetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth\nof the channel.  The helicopter tilts forward and goes.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging\nover the stern of the fishing boat.  He pushes to the back\nof the dinghy as Harcourt's savage visage appears at the\nbow.  Harcourt grins -- the predator with his prey\ntrapped.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson's face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the\nchannel water racing past beneath.  They come up on the\nboat and the Pilot plays the sun-gun onto the deck,\nlooking for movement, finally pinning Sykes and Harcourt\nat the stern dinghy.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe Captain reacts to the helicopter overhead, looks back\nat what the sun-gun spotlights.  He sees Harcourt standing\nat the bow of the dinghy, starting to clamber in.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n</b>\tHey!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n</b>\nHarcourt turns, sees the Captain on the bridge above him.\nHe reaches for a wood-handled gaff nearby.  He rears back\nwith it and lets it fly like a spear.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe gaff impales the Captain, off-center in his chest.\nThe Captain, his face frozen in shock, is thrown back\nagainst the throttle.  The boat lunges forward as the\nengines REV loudly.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n</b>\nHarcourt is thrown into the dinghy with Sykes.  As\nHarcourt recovers, Sykes spots the release for the tie\nline on the dinghy.  He lunges forward, throwing the\nratchet.  The line plays out, and the dinghy slides\nbackward into water!\n\n\n<b>INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson watches this happen.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie\nline) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat.\n\nHarcourt claws his way toward Sykes.  Water is already\nsplashing in over the stern transom... the dinghy is\nsinking.  Harcourt grabs Sykes' leg and pulls him toward\nhim.  Sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his\nmight.  Harcourt yanks him free.  Sykes kicks wildly at\nthe ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the\nline.  Harcourt is coming in for the kill when--\n\n-- Sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever.  The rest\nof the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the\ndinghy from the fishing boat!\n\nThe dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast.  A wave from\nthe fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side.  Some\nof it hits Harcourt -- he HOWLS and falls away.  Sykes\nsees this, tries to clamber over the side, but Harcourt is\non him again.  Sykes' body weight at the side of the\ndinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to\nwash in over the transom.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson reacts to Sykes and Harcourt battling in the dinghy\nbelow.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT\n</b>\nHarcourt, who is getting more and more wet, HOWLS in\nagony, thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water\ntouches.  Sykes is taking one hell of a beating.  Harcourt\nsweeps Sykes up in a bear hug, is about to crush his rib\ncage, when Sykes shifts his body weight, knocking Harcourt\noff balance.  Harcourt wobbles, fear on his face for the\nfirst time -- then he finally loses it, and the two of\nthem tumble overboard into the water, capsizing the\ndinghy.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  WATER - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes breaks the surface, gasping for air, frantically\nclawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still\nabove the water.  Suddenly, behind him, Harcourt's\npartially melted form erupts from the water, lunges on top\nof Sykes, and drags him under.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson hangs in the open door, watching in horror, wanting\nto help, knowing he can't.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  WATER - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes breaks the surface, Harcourt's misshapen lump of a\nbody unmoving but still on top of him.  Sykes shoves it\naway, struggling to stay afloat.  His head keeps dunking\nunder.  He's drowning.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n</b>\nJetson screws up his courage and turns to the Pilot.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tTake it down!  Take it down!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  WATER AND HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water.\nJetson hangs in the doorway, watching Sykes' head dunking\nunder again.  The helicopter's skids are three feet above\nthe water.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\t\t   (to Pilot)\n<b>\tALL THE WAY!\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tPILOT\n</b><b>\tI CAN'T IT'LL DITCH!\n</b>\nSykes' outreached hand stretches up from the water, but\nthe skid is just too high.  Jetson has no alternative, and\nhe does the bravest thing he has ever done.  He moves out\nonto the narrow helicopter skid.  Hanging on, three feet\nabove the water, he reaches down for Sykes' up reaching\nhand.\n\nThe fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from\neach other... Jetson stretches farther, farther... and the\ntwo hands meet!  Jetson winces from the pain of the\nseawater on Sykes' hand.  He starts pulling Sykes up.\nWhen--\n\n<b>HARCOURT'S HEAD BREAKS THE SURFACE A FOOT FROM SYKES'\n</b>FACE.  His eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly\ngone.  The nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto Sykes,\nbreaking his grip from Jetson's, and dragging him under\nagain.\n\nJetson is frantic.  He keeps waiting -- but this time\nSykes doesn't come up.  Jetson doesn't know what to do.\nFinally -- he leans down as far as he can, his face a foot\nfrom the water, SCREAMS to block the pain, and plunges his\nown arm below the surface!  He feels around, gets hold of\nsomething, and pulls.  It is Sykes' wrist.  He pulls hard,\nbringing the sputtering Sykes up out of the water.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\t\t   (to Pilot)\n\tTake it up!\n\nThe Pilot does.  Sykes comes up out of the water.  His\nfeet are just clear of the surface when -- Harcourt's hand\nand arm rocket out of the water, grabbing Sykes' ankle.\nSykes looks down in horror.  The helicopter keeps moving\nup, and before Harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm\ntears away from the torso at the shoulder.  Sykes wildly\nshakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it\nfalls back into the water below.\n\nJetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it\nmoves off toward shore.\n\n\n<b>INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n</b>\nSykes plops on the floor, soaked, battered, holding his\nlimp arm.  Jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket,\nwrapping the dry part around his own arm, wincing in pain.\nThe Pilot stare down at the circle of water where they\njust pulled Sykes from.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPILOT\n</b>\tWhat the hell was that down there?\n\tIt was weird.\n\nJetson looks at Sykes, wondering if he will say.  Sykes\nlooks at Jetson a long moment, then--\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tLooked like every other damn slag to\n\tme.  Just plain ugly.\n\nDespite the pain, Jetson smiles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t LONG DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  CHURCH ANTEROOM - DAY\n</b>\nWe are CLOSE on Sykes, who is having a hell of a time,\ntrying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling.  A\nPAIR OF ALIEN ARMS reach into FRAME to help him.  One of\nthe alien arms is also in a sling.\n\nANGLE WIDENS to reveal the alien is Jetson.  Both men wear\ntuxedos.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tHow do I look?\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tYou look very good.\n\nThere's a knock at the door.  Sykes opens it.  There\nstands Sykes' daughter, KRISTIN, twenty years old, looking\nradiant in her wedding dress.  She is in a foyer, and\nbehind her is the interior of the church with all the\nassembled guests, including Mrs. Jetson &amp; son.\n\n<b>\t\t\tKRISTIN\n</b>\tReady, Daddy...?\n\nSykes' heart melts.  Before moving to the door:\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\tGeorge, uh... I want to apologize\n\tnow, in advance, for all the rotten\n\tthings I'll ever say or do to you\n\tover the years.\n\nSykes moves to join his daughter.  As he does:\n\n<b>\t\t\tJETSON\n</b>\tThat is all right, Matthew.  After\n\tall, you are only human.\n\nSykes, caught off guard, has to laugh.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSYKES\n</b>\t\t   (under his breath)\n\tWhat a wildman...\n\nSykes takes his daughter's arm and the two of them start\ndown the aisle.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t    FADE OUT.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tTHE END\n</b>\n\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Alien Nation</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Rockne O'Bannon\" title=\"Scripts by Rockne O'Bannon\">Rockne O'Bannon</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=James Cameron\" title=\"Scripts by James Cameron\">James Cameron</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Alien Nation Script.html#comments\" title=\"Alien Nation comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 21:58:11.038368"}
