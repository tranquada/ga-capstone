MOJAVE DESERT - DAY (TELEVISION IMAGE)\n\nA LONG LENS SHOT of a far distant metallic object hovering\njust above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away.\nThe heat waves and the light refraction off the desert-\nscape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its\ntrue shape and appearance indistinct.\n\nThe VIDEO CAMERA recording this scene zooms back, then\npans over -- revealing a semicircle of US Army vehicles\nand personnel.  Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted\nscopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the\narmed infantry.  Everyone stares off at the same point on\nthe horizon.  Waiting.\n\nThe VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it\nmoves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a\nsecond, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards\nbehind the Army.  LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck\nbeds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes\nglued to the distant object.\n\nThe VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parked\nlocal TV van, finds the object again in the distance,\nzooms in, and waits, like everyone else.\n\nAbruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box\nCHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS.\n\n\t\t\tCRAIS\n\tThat was the scene in California's\n\tMojave Desert three years ago today\n\t-- the historic first view of the\n\tNewcomer ship upon its dramatic\n\tarrival.  As with the assassination\n\tof John Kennedy, who among us does\n\tnot remember exactly where he was\n\tthat October nineteenth morning,\n\twhen news first broke: that people\n\thave landed... from another star.\n\nWe PULL BACK from a large television set to reveal...\n\n\nINT.  A CROWDED BAR - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT\n\nThe Hollowpoint Lounge -- a cop bar.\n\nThe off-duty uniformed and plainclothes cops are mostly\nignoring the TV, except for two detectives, FEDORCHUK and\nALTEREZ, who are waiting for the ball scores.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORCHUK\n\tI remember where I was -- pissing\n\toff my balcony at the neighbor's\n\tdog!\n\nOthers laugh.\n\n\t\t\tALTEREZ\n\t\t   (yells at Crais on TV)\n\tGet to the goddamn ball scores!\n\nON THE TV SCREEN, an on-location interview with a CAL-TECH\nPROFESSOR comes up.  Her name and title appear across the\nbottom of the screen.\n\n\t\t\tCAL-TECH PROFESSOR\n\tFrom the time mankind first gazed up\n\tat the stars there had been\n\tspeculation about a visit by people\n\tfrom \"out there.\"  How ironic that\n\twhen that first contact was made,\n\tthe two hundred and sixty thousand\n\toccupants aboard the craft were as\n\tsurprised as we were about their\n\tarrival.  That they awakened from\n\tfrozen hibernation to find their\n\tmalfunctioning autopilot had landed\n\tthem here by mistake.\n\nThe CNN reporter, Duncan Crais, appears again.\n\n\t\t\tCRAIS\n\tThese \"Newcomers,\" we soon learned,\n\twere a genetically-engineered race,\n\tadapted for hard labor in almost any\n\tenvironmental condition.  In effect,\n\ttheir ship was a slave ship...\n\twashed ashore on Earth with no way\n\tto get back to where they came\n\tfrom...\n\nA dishwasher tray filled with beer glasses CUTS ACROSS\nFRAME, and we PAN WITH IT as it is slammed down on the\ncountertop.\n\nNow an interview with a FRESNO HOUSEWIFE standing outside\na supermarket comes on the TV SCREEN.\n\n\t\t\tFRESNO HOUSEWIFE\n\tWhen the Newcomers were first let\n\tout of the ship, they were\n\tquarantined in a camp not ten miles\n\tfrom the town here.  You can imagine\n\thow the people around here felt\n\tabout that.  But once they were\n\treleases from the camp and we got a\n\tchance to know them, we saw what\n\tnice, quiet people they really are...\n\nWIDER\n\nrevealing a MASSIVE ALIEN FIGURE in a filthy white\nbusboy's uniform.  His back is to us as he picks up two\ntrays from the counter.  The bartender is dwarfed by this\nNewcomer, but works around him without apparent concern.\nFedorchuk addresses the alien busboy.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORCHUK\n\tHey, Henry, how you doin' tonight?\n\tWorkin' hard?\n\nThe Newcomer turns -- his face is humanoid, but\ndisturbingly alien.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORCHUK\n\tYou got your green card, buddy?  You\n\tdidn't leave home without it?\n\nThe cops at the bar crack up.  Henry looks at Fedorchuk --\nhis eyes carrying no malice... or pain.  He merely blinks.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT./ EXT.  SLUG-MOBILE - STREET - NIGHT\n\nAn explosion of color and movement as OPENING TITLES PLAY\nvery quickly.  We're TRAVELING the streets in a n.d.\nsedan, getting MOVING GLIMPSES of the aliens living among\nus now:\n\n-- A coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables.\n\n-- A Newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of\nbooks.\n\n-- A city park where a number of alien families have\ngathered to play some arcane alien game.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tJeez... they call that gang-bang a\n\tgame...?\n\n-- A billboard for Pepsi featuring an alien.\n\n-- The sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light.\nSuddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to Sykes'\nhead... and alien hand.  Sykes jumps.  It's a NEWCOMER\nDERELICT standing there, weaving, mumbling in his own\nlanguage.  In one filthy hand holds a quart carton of\nmilk.  We know immediately what he wants.  Sykes rolls\ndown the window.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tTake a hike.\n\nSykes gets a whiff of the derelict's breath as the light\nchanges and the sedan pulls away, leaving him in the\nstreet.  Sykes grimaces at the smell.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWhy's it have to be sour milk that\n\tthese guys get wasted on?  What the\n\thell's wrong with Jack Daniels, or\n\tThunderbird for chrissakes?\n\t\t   (beat; disgusted)\n\tSlagtown.  Shit...\n\n-- Aliens hanging around outside their homes.\n\n-- Alien hookers plying their trade.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tHope their plumbing's the same.\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE\n\tIt is.\n\t\t   (and Sykes gives him\n\t\t    a look)\n\n-- A Newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slug-mobile.\n\n-- An alien couple exit a theater playing \"Terminator\nIII\".\n\n-- An alien wig shop.\n\nANGLE\n\nTITLES END, and we start to PULL BACK into the slug-mobile\nand HEAR:\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE (O.S.)\n\tSo you gonna go, or you not gonna\n\tgo?\n\n\nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT\n\nThe dashboard is littered with fast-food detritus and two\ncoffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the\nwindshield.  A hand picks up one of the coffees and we\nFOLLOW IT to a face, a forty-year-old cop face that's seen\nsome wear and tear -- behind the wheel is MATT SYKES.\nBeside him is his partner of nine years, BILL TUGGLE.\nTuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tHow can I go?\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE\n\tPut on your wash-and-wear suit and\n\tyour clip-on tie, have your landlady\n\ttie your shoes for you, and show up\n\tat the church.  Simple.\n\t\t   (beat)\n\tMe and Carol are going.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE\n\tHey, look -- we've known Kristin\n\tsince... since she was conceived in\n\tthat cabin up in Big Bear.\n\tRemember?  You and Edie banged the\n\twall so hard, me and Carol were\n\tpicking plaster out of our hair for\n\ta week...\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGoddammit, Tug -- I want to see\n\tKristin get married, okay?  But--\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE\n\tBut you're bummed because your ex\n\tand her new husband are paying for\n\tthe whole thing.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tShit, if Kristin had to get married\n\twhere I could afford it, we'd be\n\tholding the reception at Buddy's\n\tBurgers.\n\nSykes stares out the window, wallowing in his pissed-off\nmood.  Then he spots something that twinges his street-cop\nradar.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tUh-oh... Check it out.\n\nTHROUGH THE WINDOW Tuggle sees what Sykes sees: two ALIENS\nin long coats moving down the sidewalk, entering a mom-\nand-pop mini-mart on the corner.  One of them wears dark\nglasses and a red bandana (KIPLING): the other has on a\nblack vinyl raincoat.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tDoes that look at all suspicious to\n\tyou?\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE\n\tWhatever gave you that idea?\n\n\nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT\n\nSykes continues up a quarter of a block, pulls to the curb\namong other parked cars.\n\n\nINT.  SEDAN - NIGHT\n\nSykes is already pulling his gun.  Tuggle quickly reaches\nfor the radio in the glovebox.\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE\n\tThis is one-Henry-seven, we've got a\n\tpossible two-eleven in progress at\n\tPorter's Mini-Mart, corner of Court\n\tand Alvarado.  Requesting backup.\n\nImpulsive Sykes is already opening his door and climbing\nout.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tLet's do it, partner.\n\nTuggle drops the radio mike and follows Sykes as the Radio\nDispatcher confirms the call.\n\n\nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT\n\nThe two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked\ncars across the street from the mini-mart.  Through the\nstore window they see the old alien PROPRIETOR behind the\ncounter.  His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat\nand yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it\nright at him.  The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun\nand covers the door.\n\nSykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYou got your vest?\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE\n\tOf course.  Right in the trunk of\n\tthe car.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.\n\nThrough the store window the robbery continues in\npantomime.  Kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun,\nyelling orders in the alien language.  The Proprietor is\nquickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register.\nThe PROPRIETOR'S WIFE, a middle-aged alien woman, stands\nin the doorway from the back, frozen in fear.  The\nRaincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired.\n\nSykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the\nstreet from the store entrance.\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE\n\tWatch the driver.  I'm going for a\n\tbetter angle on the door.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tI got him.  Don't get pinned.\n\nTuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater-\ncorner across the intersection.\n\nThrough the store window Sykes sees Kipling grab the bag\nof cash, shove it in his coat pocket.  Bills fall out, but\nhe doesn't care.  Then, without warning, Kipling whips up\nthe twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's\nchest!  The Proprietor slams back against the shelves,\nslides to the floor.  Kipling leans over the counter and\nFIRES another round into the Proprietor.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (under his breath)\n\tAw, shit.\n\nTuggle is almost across the street when he hears the\nshots.\n\nThe human DRIVER of the getaway car (parked at the curb a\nfew doors down from the mini-mart) glances up, spots\nTuggle.  He leans on the HORN, reaches for a machine\npistol on the seat next to him.\n\n\nINT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT\n\nKipling and Raincoat alien react to the horn honk.  They\nspot Tuggle through the store window and open fire --\nBLASTING THROUGH THE GLASS.\n\nA civilian car enters the intersection.  The engine is hit\nby shotgun fire, and the car skids to a stop in the\nintersection, steam rising from the radiator.\n\n\nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT\n\nTuggle dives behind a lamp post.\n\nThe Driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine\npistol to fire at Tuggle.  Sykes sees this and opens fire\nat the Driver.  The Driver turns and fires at Sykes.\nSykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is\nsprayed with bullets.\n\nA forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between\nSykes and the Driver.  Once the truck is past, Sykes is\nstanding behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready.  He\nrapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver.\n\nTuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the\nshotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGet outta there!\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE\n\tI can't!  Do you mind!\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tI'll cover you!  Get outta there!!\n\nSykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway\ncar, firing toward the store as he goes.\n\nKipling and Raincoat dodge behind cover.\n\nTuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp\npost and runs to the stalled civilian car.  He slides\nacross the hood and drops behind the car for cover.\nTuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car\nwindow.  His gaze is met by the face of the OLD MAN driver\nwho is still inside the car.\n\n\t\t\tOLD MAN\n\tCan I get out now?\n\n\t\t\tTUGGLE\n\tMove it!\n\nSykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in\nthe store.  As he considers his next move--\n\nTuggle fires at the two aliens.  They return fire and he\nslides down to safety behind the car.  Or so he thinks.\nGlass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by\nthe shotgun blasts.  He flinches as another blast hits the\ncar.  He looks over.  There's a big exit hole in the\nfender beside him.  THE SHOT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAR.\nAnother exit hole is BLASTED, inches from his shoulder.\n\nPanicked, he scrambles along the side of the car -- BLASTS\nand exit holes following him until he reaches the front of\nthe car.  He has nowhere left to go and--\n\n-- a BLAST comes through the car and catches him squarely\nin the chest throwing him back onto the street.\n\nSykes' head jerks around -- in time to see his partner of\nnine years blown away.\n\nKipling keeps firing in Tuggle's direction until his\nshotgun CLICKS empty.\n\n\nINT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT\n\nKipling grabs Raincoat and throws him toward the back exit\nof the store.  The shotgun falls from Raincoat's hands.\nThe two of them run out the back.\n\n\nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT\n\nSykes runs to Tuggle's spread-eagled body.  One glance is\nenough.  Nobody ever looked deader.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tAw shit, Tug, Jesus!  Goddamn it!\n\nHe stares, shocked and incredulous.  He can't find a way\nto think or feel about this.  Then we see him going crazy\nright before our eyes, the rage revving.  He takes off\ntoward the store as SIRENS are HEARD rapidly approaching\nin background.\n\n\nINT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT\n\nSykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken\nglass, bangs through the exit.\n\n\nEXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT\n\nSykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round\nthe corner at the far end of the alley.  He takes off,\nquickly cranking up to full speed.\n\n\nEXT.  BACK STREET - NIGHT\n\nSykes rounds the corner.  Doesn't see them anymore.  He\nslows... moves along this street with some caution.  Lots\nof shadows, lots of hiding places.  Sykes HEARS a NOISE,\nlooks up... just in time to see Raincoat on a high, huge\nbillboard.  He cuts loose with the shotgun.  Sykes dives.\nHuge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the\nnight.  Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the\ncrates.\n\nRaincoat's shotgun CLICKS empty now.  He drops it, swings\ndown off the fire escape, runs off.\n\nSykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.\n\n\nEXT.  TUNNEL STREET - NIGHT\n\nSykes rounds this second corner, races down the street.\nThe only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up\nahead.  Sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open.\n\n\nINT.  TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\nThe murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves\nthrough the mouth.  He tries to control his breathing so\nhe can hear.  The only SOUND is his own shoes scuffing\nalong the asphalt.\n\nThen he HEARS -- another set of FOOTSTEPS.  Rapid\nfootsteps, coming toward him, ECHOING.  He can't tell from\nwhich direction!  He spins, just as a LARGE SHAPE lunges\nfor him with an alien CRY.\n\nIt's the wired Raincoat alien.  Sykes gets his gun up just\nin time and FIRES -- once, twice, three times.  Raincoat\nalien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the\nblasts.  Sykes approaches the body slowly.  With an\ninhuman ROAR, the alien snaps forward, lunging at Sykes\nwith outstretched arms.  Sykes jumps back, startled, and\nFIRES twice more at the pale figure.  Raincoat goes down\nand stays down.\n\nSykes relaxes for the briefest moment.  Then he HEARS\nit... a distinctive CLICKING SOUND, metal on metal.  Sykes\nlooks up and -- Kipling drops down on him from directly\nabove!  Sykes goes down in a heap.  He's managed to hold\nonto the gun and as Kipling comes for him, he swings the\ngun hand around.  Kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming\nthe gun from Sykes' hand.  Sykes tries to get to his feet,\nbut the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel.\n\nA SIREN is HEARD approaching in background.\n\nKipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace.  As he\ndraws near, Sykes HEARS that distinctive CLICKING SOUND\nagain.\n\nSYKES' P.O.V.\n\nThough his vision is BLURRED, Sykes still gets a good look\nat an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist.  The\nstrands of this bracelet are what make the CLINKING NOISE.\n\nANGLE\n\nThe alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching\nSIREN suddenly WAILS louder as a backup patrol car swings\nonto the street heading this way.  Kipling sees this and\nleaves Sykes, running off down the dark tunnel.\n\nON SYKES\n\ndazed, struggling to rise.  WE HEAR running FOOTSTEPS\napproaching.  Sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused.\n\nSYKES' P.O.V.\n\nAn OUT-OF-FOCUS ALIEN FACE looming over him.\n\nANGLE\n\nSykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his\nweight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien\nface.  The alien, caught by surprise and off balance,\nsprawls backward OUT OF FRAME.  Sykes is grabbed by a\nhuman uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again.\n\n\t\t\tHUMAN COP\n\tWhoa, whoa... hold it.  Take it easy.\n\t\t   (to alien on the\n\t\t    ground)\n\tYou okay?\n\nSykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus.  He looks at\nthe alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet\naway.  The alien is a uniformed cop... his name is JETSON.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tI am all right.\n\nHe gets up.  A trickle of purple blood runs from his nose.\n\n\t\t\tHUMAN COP\n\tI better call in.\n\nHe moves off.  Jetson moves toward Sykes and the Raincoat\nalien's body.  Sykes tenses, thinking Jetson might\nretaliate in some way.  But Jetson simply steps past him\nto kneel beside the dead alien.  He checks for a pulse on\nthe underside of the dead alien's upper arm.  Nothing.\nSykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain.  He\nstruggles to rise.  Jetson gets an arm around him to help\nhim up.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYour hand will require attention.\n\nSykes roughly jerks himself free of Jetson's grip.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGet the hell away from me!  I don't\n\tneed your goddamn help.\n\nHe almost loses his balance and has to steady himself\nagainst the tunnel wall.  Sykes leans there, the picture\nof impotent rage and frustration.  Jetson looks at him,\nwith that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit\nwhen trying to understand human nature.\n\n\nEXT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT\n\nOPEN on Tuggle's body, as the body bag is zipped up over\nhis face, and the litter is lifted into the back of the\nCoroner's wagon.\n\nWIDEN to reveal Sykes, standing nearby, watching.  The\nWagon pulls out, and Sykes turns, moving past all the LAPD\nblack-and-whites and forensics wagons, and COPS (two of\nthem aliens) and DETECTIVES, and RUBBERNECKERS (some\nalien).  He moves into:\n\n\nINT.  MINI-MART - NIGHT\n\nThe CRIME SCENE TEAM is checking for prints, digging slugs\nout of the wall, photographing everything.  Several\nUNIFORMED COPS mill around.  Sykes moves aimlessly around\nthe room like a stranger at a party.\n\nThe Proprietor's Wife stands near the body in a strange\nrigid posture, a thin, mournful KEENING SOUND coming from\nher lips.  A harried female uniformed cop is trying to get\nher away from the body, but can't get her to budge.\n\nMINKLER, a ballistics guy, is tagging the pump-shotgun the\nRaincoat alien dropped here.  NATUZZI, a mean-looking\nveteran uniform cop is with him.\n\n\t\t\tNATUZZI\n\tLooks like a standard combat pump-\n\taction.\n\n\t\t\tMINKLER\n\tIt is.\n\n\t\t\tNATUZZI\n\tSo what punched holes clear through\n\tthat car out there?\n\nMinkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box.\nInside are four unfired twelve gauge shells.\n\n\t\t\tMINKLER\n\tBRI Sabot slugs.  These puppies are\n\tnasty.  Two plastic sabots fall away\n\tin flight leaving a fifty-caliber\n\tslug going two thousand feet per\n\tsecond.  Tug might as well've been\n\thiding behind a rosebush.\n\nMinkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him.\nHe looks.  It's Sykes.\n\n\t\t\tNATUZZI\n\tPretty heavy artillery for knocking\n\tover a liquor store.\n\nA new voice enters the conversation.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON (O.S.)\n\tAn identical round was used in the\n\tshooting of a Newcomer named\n\tHubley, two days ago.\n\nSykes turns -- surprised, and not especially pleased to\nsee the voice is Jetson's.\n\n\t\t\tMINKLER\n\tYeah?  So why the extra fire power?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tPerhaps because even the larger\n\tcaliber handguns aren't always\n\teffective against my people.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (mulls this, then)\n\tYou saying there's some connection\n\tto this other homicide?\n\nBefore Jetson can say, the female cop who was talking to\nthe Proprietor's Wife steps up.\n\n\t\t\tFEMALE COP\n\tHey, give me a hand with this woman,\n\twill ya Jetson?  We've got to get\n\ther to Division for her statement\n\tand she won't budge.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (to Sykes)\n\tExcuse me.\n\nAnd he moves off with his partner.  Sykes calls after him,\nbut Jetson is already approaching the woman and doesn't\nturn.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tSo, you think there's a connection,\n\tor what?  Hey!\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  SYKES' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nThe slug-mobile pulls up.  A drained Sykes moves up the\nwalk to his front door.\n\n\nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nSykes enters his apartment, an untidy bachelor place\ndecorated with negative taste.  It's obviously the maid's\ndecade off.\n\nBy rote, he hits the rewind switch on the answering\nmachine on his way into the kitchen.  The tape rewinds.\nHe opens the fridge.  Not much here.  Left-over take-out\npizza carton.  Left-over take-out Chinese food cartons.\nLeft-over take-out burger wrappers. \n\nThe answering machine message begins -- he glances over\nhis shoulder as he HEARS his daughter's VOICE.  During the\nfollowing, he reaches the fridge.  Brings out a milk\ncarton that's in his way, sets it on the counter.  Reaches\nin again and this time brings out a bottle of Stoly.  Then\nsearches for a semi-clean glass.\n\n\t\t\tKRISTIN'S VOICE\n\t\t   (bouncy, bride-to-be\n\t\t    happy)\n\tHi, Daddy, it's me.  I'm over at\n\tDanny's parents' house... talking\n\tabout Sunday.  I thought maybe you'd\n\tbe home by now.  Anyway, uh, nothing\n\treally.  I just wanted to call and\n\tsay I love you.  I love you, Daddy.\n\t\t   (she giggles)\n\tUh-oh, I shouldn't'a done that.\n\tKnowing you, you'll probably pull\n\tthis tape out of your machine and\n\tsave it -- in that drawer where you\n\tkeep every card I ever gave you, and\n\tall of my old baby teeth... gross!\n\tAnyway, Daddy, don't save this tape\n\t-- but I do love you, and I'll talk\n\tto you before Sunday.\n\t\t   (beat)\n\tOh, Tug and Carol came by and met\n\tDanny last week.\n\t\t   (Sykes stiffens)\n\tDanny thought Tug was the greatest\n\t-- but, then, who doesn't?  Anyway,\n\tlove you, talk to you soon.  'Bye.\n\nThe machine BEEPS and HISSES.  Sykes take the glass and\nthe bottle of vodka, crosses back toward the living room,\nswitching off the answering machine as he goes.\n\nThen he stops, turns back, takes the message tape out of\nthe machine and tosses it into a drawer.\n\n\t\t\t\t    FADE TO:\n\nINT.  DETECTIVE SQUAD ROOM - DAY\n\nSykes enters, stirring a jumbo coffee.  He's slept about\nfour hours, and his face looks like he went a few with\nHagler.  He crosses straight to Fedorchuk's desk.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tSo what've you got on Tuggle's\n\tkillers?\n\n\t\t\tFEDORCHUK\n\tJesus, Sykes -- it's been less than\n\tten hours.  Me and Alterez are on\n\tit, okay?\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYou don't have squat.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORCHUK\n\tYou ever try to make a case in\n\tSlagtown?  The list of Newcomer\n\tinformants is about as long as the\n\tlist of Mexican war heroes...\n\n\t\t\tALTEREZ\n\tUp yours.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORCHUK\n\t... Nobody talks to nobody down\n\tthere.  Half of them don't speak\n\tEnglish and the other half only when\n\tit suits them.  It's gonna take some\n\ttime.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYeah, I know it's gonna take time.\n\tLike until the Ice Capades opens in\n\tHell, with you two on it.\n\nAcross the room, the Captain's door BANGS open and CAPTAIN\nWARNER pounds out, his deep voice booming through the\nsquad room.\n\n\t\t\tWARNER\n\tNobody wanders off!  I got an\n\tannouncement.  Get your asses back\n\tin here.\n\nTwo detectives on their way out, stop, and head back into\nthe room.  Everybody gathers around, curious, as Warner\nstands holding a sheet of paper.\n\n\t\t\tWARNER\n\tI'll make this short.  This is a\n\tdirective from Chief Evaner, who is\n\tacting on orders from the Mayor, who\n\tis under mandate from the Federal\n\tBureau of Newcomer Relations.  As of\n\tnine o'clock this morning, one\n\tNewcomer uniform officer has been\n\tpromoted to the rank of Detective,\n\tthird grade.\n\nThe detectives GROAN... some angrier ones grumble, \"This\nis bullshit!\", etc.\n\n\t\t\tWARNER\n\tAnd we've got him, gentleman.\n\t\t   (more groans)\n\tVolunteers for duty with the new\n\tdetective should see me in my\n\toffice... otherwise I will choose a\n\tvolunteer myself.  That is all.\n\nHe turns and heads back to his office in the wake of\ncontinued grumbling from the detectives.  Sykes, standing\nto one side, absently watches Warner return to his glass-\nwalled office.  Waiting inside are a balding man and an\nalien in a grey suit.  Sykes reacts.  The alien in the\nsuit is Jetson.\n\nThe grumbling continues around him as Sykes considers\nsomething.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORCHUK\n\tUnbelievable bullshit.\n\n\t\t\tALTEREZ\n\tHow long has this Slag been on the\n\tforce?  A year, max -- right?\n\n\t\t\tDETECTIVE\n\tI don't know about the rest of you,\n\tbut I sure as hell ain't gonna sit\n\tstill for this.  I'm calling the\n\tunion, pronto.\n\nOthers grumble.  \"Yeah!\".  Meanwhile, Sykes has decided\nsomething.  He heads toward Warner's office.  Fedorchuk\nsees this.\n\n\t\t\tFEDORCHUK\n\tWhere the hell is he going?\n\n\nINT.  WARNER'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nSykes KNOCKS and enters.\n\n\t\t\tWARNER\n\tYeah, Sykes?\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tCaptain.  I'd like to volunteer for\n\tduty with the new detective.\n\nWarner is surprised.  He never expected Sykes.\n\n\t\t\tWARNER\n\t... All right.  Detective Sergeant\n\tSykes, this is Detective... Jetson.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWe have met.\n\nWarner looks up, clocking this.  He looks at Sykes,\nstarting to smell something fishy.\n\nThe balding man, GOLDRUP, rises to shake their hands.\n\n\t\t\tGOLDRUP\n\tVictor Goldrup, Mayor's office.\n\tCongratulations, gentlemen.\n\nWarner is starting to suspect what Sykes is up to.\n\n\t\t\tWARNER\n\t\t   (to Sykes)\n\tYou are to have nothing to do with\n\tthe investigation into Bill Tuggle's\n\tdeath.  You know that.  Leave that\n\tfor Fedorchuk.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (nodding)\n\tDepartmental policy.\n\n\t\t\tWARNER\n\t\t   (to Jetson)\n\tYou?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYes, sir.\n\n\t\t\tWARNER\n\tGood.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tThere's another case I'd like to\n\ttake.  A homicide -- a Newcomer\n\tnamed Hubley.\n\nJetson looks over at Sykes, knows he's up to something.\nSykes avoids his look.\n\n\t\t\tWARNER\n\tGranger and Pitts are already on it.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGranger and Pitts have one hell of a\n\tcaseload... and I would have thought\n\twith Jetson here being the first\n\tNewcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's\n\tbody being found over in the\n\tNewcomer community...\n\n\t\t\tWARNER\n\tDon't tell me what to think.\n\n\t\t\tGOLDRUP\n\tHe's got a point.  That's the sort\n\tof thing we should be doing with\n\tthis early advancement program...\n\nLong-suffering Warner looks up at Goldrup, then finally\nsighs with resignation.  Sykes grins.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.  STAIRWELL - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY\n\nThe steel door BANGS open and Sykes and Jetson exit.  Next\nto Sykes' slept-in look, Jetson in his grey suit looks\nlike a Jehovah's Witness canvasser.  They move past all\nthe black-and-whites pulling out on p.m. watch during:\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t... and we work my hours.  I'll do\n\tthe driving, you do the paperwork.\n\tYou gotta learn it so you might as\n\twell do it all.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (after a moment)\n\tSergeant... I'd like to thank you\n\tfor what you're doing.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWhat's that?\n\t\t   (then realizing)\n\tLook, Jetson.  Get this straight in\n\tyour head.  We're not pals, we're\n\tnot married, and we ain't gonna take\n\tlong moonlight walks together...\n\tWe're just partners.  And don't call\n\tme Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or\n\tMatt if you have to.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tI am George.\n\nSykes nods absently, and they walk on... four and a half\nsteps to be exact.  Then it hits Sykes.  He seizes up\ncold.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWait a minute.  George?  George\n\tJetson?\n\nJetson nods... he's used to this.\nSykes cracks up.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (between laughs)\n\tMan, somebody really hung one on\n\tyou!  I've heard some good ones for\n\tyou guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley\n\tDavidson.  I guess the people at\n\timmigration got a little punchy\n\tafter a while, coming up with names\n\tfor a quarter of a million of you.\n\tYou weren't at the back of the line,\n\twere you, George?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tMy true name is Ss'tangya\n\tT'ssorentsa'.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGesundheit.  You don't mind if I\n\tstick to George, do you?\n\n\nEXT.  POLICE STATION PARKING AREA - DAY\n\nThey approach Sykes' ugly sedan, the slug-mobile.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tAnyway, what's it matter to you if\n\twe think it's funny, right?  Whatta\n\tyou care?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tThat is exactly so.\n\t\t   (completely deadpan)\n\tIt is like your name... Sykes.  I'm\n\tsure it doesn't bother you at all\n\tthat it sounds like \"ss'ai k'ss\",\n\ttwo words in my language which mean\n\t\"excrement\" and \"cranium\".\n\nSykes looks at him, perplexed.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\"Shit... head\".\n\nJetson gets in and slams the door, leaving Sykes standing\nthere, the smirk dropping from his face.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAY\n\nThey're cruising along in downtown traffic.  Sykes drives.\nJetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tLet's talk Hubley.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (refers to a folder\n\t\t    he holds)\n\tHis body was discovered three days\n\tago, in an alley off of Central\n\tAvenue, near downtown.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWith two BRI Sabot slugs in the\n\tchest.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (gently correcting\n\t\t    him)\n\tThrough the chest.  Rupturing both\n\tthe primary and secondary hearts.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (out the window)\n\tNice signal, dickwad!\n\nJetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from Sykes.\nThen...\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tHe was employed at the Northwest\n\tPetroleum Refinery in Torrance.  He\n\twas manager of the Methane Facility.\n\tHe was also a principle partner in a\n\treal estate venture to develop low-\n\tcost housing for Newcomers.\n\nSykes grimaces at the mention of \"Newcomer housing\".\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tTerrific.  A real pillar of the\n\tcommunity.\n\t\t   (beat)\n\tWas Hubley missing anything when\n\tthey found him?  Was he ripped off?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (checks file)\n\tThere was no wallet... but he was\n\tstill wearing a watch and two rings.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tThe guys at the mini-mart last night\n\tmade a half-assed stab at the money\n\tin the till -- but I don't think\n\tthat's what they were there for.  I\n\tthink we got us a couple'a\n\texecutions on our hands, George...\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tThe murder at the mini-mart is not\n\tour case.  The Captain said--\n\nSykes looks over at Jetson, pissed.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tLook, you want to fit in here,\n\tright?  You want to learn how to get\n\talong?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYes.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWell, there's a thing about\n\tpartners, about being somebody's\n\tpartner.  You do for each other.\n\tAnd other people's rules don't mean\n\tshit.  It's the rules set up between\n\tthe two of you, that's all that\n\tcounts.  Understand?\n\t\t   (Jetson nods)\n\tOkay.  Well, my friend and partner\n\twas shot last night and I'm after\n\tthe shitbag that did it.  As my\n\tpartner, I'm asking you to respect\n\tme and help me find him.\n\nJetson considers this several moments, then--\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tAnd as my partner, I ask you to\n\trespect me and my desire not to\n\tbreak with procedure.\n\nSykes stares at him, exasperated.  Without warning, he\nslams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy\ntraffic, puts it in \"Park.\" Jetson, who is already a\nlittle too close to the dashboard, bangs up against it.\nHORNS instantly go crazy behind them.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWhat is wrong?\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (very calm)\n\tNothing's wrong.  I just want to get\n\tsomething straight.  You agree that\n\tthere's a good chance these two\n\tshootings are somehow related,\n\tright?\n\nYELLING joins the HORNS outside.  Jetson is visibly\nunsettled by the chaos.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWell... yes, quite possibly.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tPossibly.  Good.  Well, would you be\n\twilling to accept the theory,\n\tGeorge, that... possibly... by\n\texamining the evidence from one case\n\twe might shed some small ray of\n\tlight on the other?  Does that sound\n\tunreasonable to you?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYes... no, it is not unreasonable.\n\tAlthough I--\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGreat.\n\t\t   (a relieved sigh)\n\tWell, I'm sure glad that's settled,\n\taren't you?\n\nAnd with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly\nout.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tI think we're really starting to\n\tclick now, George -- hmmm?\n\nJetson doesn't know what to think -- he just holds on.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.  HALLWAY - L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY\n\nWINTER, a deputy Medical Examiner (human), is leading\nSykes and Jetson along the hall.

You got nothin' better to\n\tdo, cushy county job like yours.\n\n\nINT.  AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY\n\nThey enter briskly through a swinging door.  They move\namong the tables (some occupied, some not) during:\n\n\t\t\tWINTER\n\tYeah, right.  Don't push your luck.\n\tAnyway, according to the sheet, the\n\tguy you nailed outside by the car--\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tThe human?\n\n\t\t\tWINTER\n\tYeah... he was one Martin Helder.\n\tWhite male, twenty-seven.  Let's\n\tsee... wrap sheet shows one armed\n\trobbery conviction, a couple for\n\tsale of a controlled substance.\n\tOh yeah, and he was wired on coke\n\twhen you stopped his clock.\n\nThey have reached a table holding a covered body.  Winter\nunceremoniously throws back the cover.  There lies the\npale naked body of the Raincoat alien.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tHave you identified this one?\n\n\t\t\tWINTER\n\tSo far he's a John Doe.  Or a Sam\n\tSlag, if you like.\n\nJetson smiles slightly out of politeness.\n\n\t\t\tWINTER\n\tNo I.D. on him and -- well, you\n\tknow, no fingerprints -- so it could\n\tbe tough.  Your buddies this morning\n\twent through the mug book but\n\tcouldn't make a facial match.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tFedorchuk couldn't find his ass with\n\this hands in his back pockets.\n\nJetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while Winter\nand Sykes continue talking off to one side.\n\n\t\t\tWINTER\n\t\t   (referring to\n\t\t    Raincoat alien)\n\tYou took this gut out, too, didn't\n\tyou?\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\tWINTER\n\tLucky for you, you got him in both\n\tof his... well, what we loosely\n\trefer to as... hearts.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tLucky nothing.  I had to empty my\n\tdamn gun into him.\n\n\t\t\tWINTER\n\tThat's the way these people are.\n\tYou don't hit both pumps you just\n\tpiss them off.\n\nDuring this, Jetson has turned the dead alien's hand over\n-- sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his\nface.  He leans closer, examining the palm carefully.\nThen he peels back the alien's upper lip.\n\nJetson frowns anew, with concern this time.  He looks\naround, spots a Newcomer lab assistant nearby -- BENTNER.\nJetson motions him over.  Jetson begins questioning him\nusing the alien language.  Sykes and Winter nearby, remain\noblivious.\n\n\t\t\tWINTER\n\tOh, here's an extra headshot if you\n\tneed one.\n\t\t   (hands Sykes a\n\t\t    polariod of dead\n\t\t    alien's face)\n\tWe're just about to start cutting\n\tin.  You're welcome to stick around\n\tif you want.  It's really\n\tfascinating stuff.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYeah, I'll bet.\n\nSykes looks over, now noticing Jetson and Bentner in\nearnest conversation.  He only catches snatches of the\nalien language.  Bentner appears very unsettled by what\nJetson is telling him.  In response to Jetson's final\nstatement, Bentner nods -- as if agreeing to do something\nJetson has requested.  Sykes goes over to Jetson.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWhat's this?  What's going on?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tNothing.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (really suspicious\n\t\t    now)\n\tNothing?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (looking away)\n\tShouldn't we examine their personal\n\teffects?\n\nJetson moves off, leaving Sykes there wondering.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Yeah, it's rubber.  It\n\tstretches.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tAnd still it fits?\n\nSykes looks at Jetson's serious expression.  He tosses the\ncondom and packet back into the counter and continues\nsearching.  A beat, then he can't stop himself -- he\nsteals a glance at Jetson's crotch.\n\nStill searching, Sykes picks up one of the dead alien's\nwell-worn heavy work boots.  He grimaces... the sides and\nsoles are painted with a viscous black substance.  He very\ntentatively sniffs it... and is grateful that it's not\nwhat he thought it might be.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWhat is this stuff?\n\nSykes gets some on his hands, doesn't know where to wipe\nit.

Jetson's\nWIFE, an attractive alien woman, stands watering the lawn\nwith a garden hose.  Jetson's son, age six, rides his\nbicycle along the walkway.

Moves to his son, kisses him\non the top of his head.\n\nSykes watches all this... and as he does, slowly his\nderisive expression softens.  As corny as this tableau may\nbe, there's something very appealing about the innocence\nof it... even to an unrepentant cynic like Sykes.\n\nJetson starts to climb into the car, and we--\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.

We PAN with the\nhand to reveal Kipling's face... sans bandana and\nsunglasses now.  He wears a black tuxedo.  He lets a small\ndab of the blue gel curl from the dispenser onto his\ntongue.

MAIN BALLROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT\n\nThe men are in tuxedos, the women in evening gowns.  Only\ntwo of three Newcomers faces present.  Kipling threads his\nway among the tables as the MAYOR, at the speaker's\nplatform, addresses the assembly.\n\n\t\t\tMAYOR\n\t... Our guest speaker tonight has\n\tdone so much in his community and\n\tfor his community in such a short\n\tperiod of time.  And I must say, as\n\tthe founder of the first Newcomer\n\towned and operated corporation in\n\tSouthern California, he certainly\n\thas come quite far in the last few\n\tyears.  Granted, not as far as he\n\tcame in the years before reaching\n\tLos Angeles.\n\nThere is laughter from the VIPs.  Kipling slides into a\nseat at one of the front tables.  He leans over and\nwhispers something into the ear of the person seated to\nhis right.  We see this CLOSE UP, and don't see who he is\nwhispering to yet.  Whoever it is, nods.\n\n\t\t\tMAYOR\n\t\t   (continuing)\n\tAs Mayor of this city, it gives me\n\tgreat pleasure to introduce someone\n\twho has so readily made our city\n\this home... and all of us who live\n\there, his friends.  Ladies and\n\tgentlemen, William Harcourt.\n\nThe VIPs applaud as the spotlight sweeps over to a front\ntable.  At first it hits Kipling, then it adjusts to\ncapture WILLIAM HARCOURT, seated to Kipling's right.\nHarcourt is an exemplar of the successful Newcomer\nentrepreneur... handsome, charming, with cool blue eyes\nthat glint with his piercing intellect.  He rises, smiling\nwarmly, steps past his striking ALIEN DATE seated to his\nright, to make his way to the podium.  He shields his eyes\nsomewhat from the bright spotlight.\n\nOnce behind the podium, he slips his notes from a breast\npocket as the applause ebbs.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tThank you all for that very warm\n\treception.\n\t\t   (pauses, smiles)\n\tI'm particularly grateful because I\n\tactually had the gall to write that\n\tin my notes: \"Thank you all for that\n\tvery warm reception\".  Imagine how\n\tembarrassed I would've been if it\n\thadn't have been such a warm\n\treception.\n\nThe VIPs laugh.

You could tie me up and\n\tthen do whatever you want with me...\n\tI've got my own ropes.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (still miming to\n\t\t    Jetson)\n\tDoes that cost extra or you throw\n\tthem in?\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\tYou've got me all wrong.  I don't\n\tcharge money for something that I\n\tmyself find pleasurable...\n\nFinally Jetson gets what Sykes is trying to tell him.  He\nsays in the uncertain, stagy voice of a bad liar:\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tI am going out to the car.  I will\n\tmeet you there.\n\nSykes rolls his eyes as Jetson exits into the corridor.\nCassandra emerges from the stall, wearing a long, stylish,\nlow-cut dress.\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\tLook, I don't know where Mr.\n\tStrader might be.  He comes and he\n\tgoes.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (starting to feel a\n\t\t    little uncomfortable)\n\tThe girl out front mentioned\n\tStrader's assistant, somebody named\n\tWatson.  Maybe he knows.\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\t\t   (tensing slightly)\n\tTodd?  Todd doesn't know either.\n\nShe is very close to Sykes now.  She fingers the lapel of\nhis jacket.\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\t\t   (continuing)\n\tI know... Why don't you hang around\n\tfor a while, let me entertain you?\n\tIt's Matt, right?  Now tell me the\n\ttruth, have you ever... made it...\n\twith one of us?\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tNot unless I got real drunk and\n\tnobody told me about it later.\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\tA virgin.  I find that very\n\tarousing...\n\n\nINT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nMUSIC drifts up from downstairs.  Jetson moves along the\ncorridor, scoping things out.  He tries a door.  Locked.\nTries another one.  Open.  He eases it wider, then enters\nthe darkened office.\n\n\nINT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT\n\nJetson moves into the office.  Looks around.  Makes his\nway to the cluttered desk top.  Pushes things around...\nall the usual stuff.  He starts to turn away, then his eye\ncatches something sticking out from behind a row of ledger\nbooks.  He reaches for it.  A small dispenser -- of the\nkind we saw being filled at the refinery.  Jetson studies\nit, his suspicions growing.  Opening it, he finds only the\nbarest trace of a viscous substance.\n\nHe smells it... not enough to tell for certain what it is.\nBut enough that he is very concerned about what it could\nbe.\n\n\nINT.  CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nCassandra is practically melting herself into Sykes now.\nShe takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her\nfacial ridges.  She shudders with pleasure.  Sykes begins\nto perspire.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tThere's lots of things I haven't\n\tdone, but his ain't high on the\n\tlist.  Don't take it personally.\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\tI think you're just a little scared\n\tnow, about what you might find once\n\tthe lights go out.  A little\n\tscared... and a lot curious.  Maybe\n\tmore than you want to admit.  But\n\tdoesn't that turn you on, that\n\tcuriosity and fear, swirling\n\ttogether?\n\t\t   (coos)\n\tThink of it as broadening your\n\thorizons.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tI like my horizons narrow.\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\t\t   (pressing herself\n\t\t    into him)\n\tYour voice is saying no, but your\n\tbody is saying yes.\n\nHe quickly disengages from her.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tMy voice, body, and everything else\n\tis saying I'll be back in two hours\n\tfor Strader, and he better damn well\n\tbe here.\n\nHe shoves a business card at her, then retreats through\nthe door.\n\n\nINT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nSykes closes the door and lets out his breath.\n\n\nINT.  CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nCassandra's expression instantly turns to worry and she\nquickly crosses to a phone and punches the intercom\nbutton.\n\n\nINT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT\n\nJetson, looking through a desk drawer, hears the intercom\nBUZZ in the next room.  Through the wall--\n\n\t\t\tWATSON (O.S.)\n\t\t   (tentatively)\n\tYes...?\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA (O.S.)\n\t\t   (over the intercom,\n\t\t    breathless)\n\tTodd, it's me.  The police were just\n\there... looking for Strader.  And\n\tasking about you.\n\nJetson moves toward the door to the adjoining office,\ndrawing his gun.  The floor squeaks beneath his feet.  He\nlooks down, then continues toward the door.\n\n\nINT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT\n\nJetson eases open the door.  It's the manager's private\noffice.  Jetson sees the phone receiver resting on the\ndesk, the desk lamp on, a lit cigarette in an ashtray --\nbut no one behind the desk.  Jetson eases through the door\nand--\n\n-- a chair crashes down on him from behind the door!\nJetson goes down, his gun skittering out of his hand.\n\n\nINT.  PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nJetson and his assailant battle in the well-appointed\noffice.\n\n\nINT.  OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nSykes hears the fight through the private office door.\nHe throws the door open.\n\n\nINT.  PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT\n\nSykes stands in the doorway, the Casull straight-armed at\nJetson's assailant.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tFreeze!  Now!\n\nThe assailant does.  He looks at Sykes, scared, breathing\nhard.  He's a Newcomer in a snappy Armani suit.  This is\nTODD WATSON.  Jetson, on the floor, starts to rise.\n\nSuddenly somebody flies at Sykes from the side, knocking\nhim sideways down the corridor.  It's Cassandra.  Watson\nseizes the moment and shoves the off-balance Jetson into\nsome furniture and dives for the door.\n\n\nINT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nWatson runs down the corridor, ducking onto a fire escape.\nMeanwhile Sykes wrestles with Cassandra.  She's as strong\nas he is, but he has the edge in experience.\n\nJetson, disheveled, appears in the private office doorway,\nready to chase Watson, but not knowing which way he went.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (struggling with\n\t\t    Cassandra)\n\tFire escape!  End of the hall!\n\nJetson nods, takes off down the corridor.  Sykes manges to\nget one handcuff on Cassandra's wrist, the other cuff\naround a pipe sticking out of the wall.  She SCREECHES at\nhim in the alien language as he collects the Casull and\ncharges down the corridor.\n\n\nEXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT\n\nJetson pounds down the fire escape.  Below him, he sees\nWatson reach the ground and take off running for the\nparking area.\n\nJetson reaches the ground and gives chase.\n\n\nEXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\nWatson zig-zags through the parked cars, Jetson cutting\ndown other rows trying to make up the distance between\nthem.\n\n\nEXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT\n\nSykes bangs down the fire escape, leaping the last fifteen\nfeet to the ground.\n\n\nEXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\nWatson reaches his Alfa Romeo, yanks open the door, fires\nit up.  Jetson slides up, ten feet behind the car, pulls\nhis gun, aims.\n\nThe white reverse-lights flash on.  Jetson stands there,\ngun aimed -- but he hesitates to shoot.  In that split\nsecond hesitation, Watson floors it... Jetson jumping to\navoid being hit.\n\n\nINT.  ALFA ROMEO - NIGHT\n\nWatson throws the car into Drive, looks up, and sees Sykes\nstanding right in front of the car.  He hits the gas.\nSykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car.\nWatson, with Sykes' face on the other side of the glass,\npanics and--\n\n\nEXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n-- plows the Alfa into some parked cars.\n\nSykes is up in a flash -- yanks Watson out of the car.\n\nWatson rears back to swing at Sykes, when Sykes swings his\narms around in two wide arcs, his fists landing two direct\nhits in the nerve centers under Watson's arms.  Watson\nfolds over with a \"ooowwph\" sound and drops to his knees.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (breathing hard)\n\tI'll be damned.  It worked.\n\t\t   (sees Jetson run up)\n\tHow'd you like that, huh?  Whammo!\n\tBoth barrels.  Dropped him like a\n\tbag of cement.\n\nJetson picks up Watson's fallen wallet.  He looks at the\nI.D.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWho is he?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tTodd Watson.  The assistant manager.\n\nWatson is still doubled over, just trying to draw one\nagonized breath.\n\n\t\t\tWATSON\n\tI don't believe this.  Look at my\n\tsuit.  Look at what you made me do\n\tto my car.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (laughing)\n\tYour girlfriend put up a better\n\tfight than you did, pal.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWe are looking for your employer,\n\tJoshua Strader.\n\n\t\t\tWATSON\n\tHe's out of town.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWhy did you run?\n\n\t\t\tWATSON\n\tBecause you two were chasing me.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWe were chasing you because you ran,\n\tyou dumb son-of-a-bitch.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWhen will Strader return?\n\n\t\t\tWATSON\n\tWho knows.  He's the boss -- he\n\tdoesn't have to check in with me.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (wearily)\n\tWatson... this is my partner here's\n\tfirst coupla days, and he wants to\n\tmake a good impression.  Me, though,\n\tthe way I feel -- this could be my\n\tlast day, know what I mean?  And I'm\n\tready to rain on you like a cow\n\tpissin' on a flat rock.\n\n\t\t\tWATSON\n\tLook -- Mr. Strader hasn't been\n\taround for a coupla days.  He didn't\n\ttell me where he was going or when\n\the'd be back.  I swear it.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (to Jetson)\n\tWhat do you think?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tI believe he is probably lying.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tThrough his ass.\n\t\t   (to Watson)\n\tNext time you see him, tell him to\n\tcall me... unless you want us to\n\tkeep coming back on you like a bad\n\tcase of herpes.\n\nSykes shoves a business card in Watson's breast pocket.\nThey walk away and Watson slumps against his car.\n\nANGLE - MOVING WITH SYKES AND JETSON\n\nas they walk wearily to the slug-mobile.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGeorge, you can handle the women\n\tfrom now on, you mind?\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\nWatson is alone, surveying the damage to his Alfa, when he\nhears footsteps.  He turns with a \"What now?\" expression\nand -- a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead.  He\ngoes down.  Kipling stands over him, flanked by FOUR HUMAN\nTHUGS.  One of these is QUINT, senior human in Harcourt's\nemploy.\n\n\t\t\tQUINT\n\t\t   (to other Thugs)\n\tOkay, scrape him up.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  ZUMA BEACH APPROACH _ NIGHT\n\nHarcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access\nroad, passing a lookout car attended by two alien Thugs.\nThe limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n.d.\nvan.\n\nHarcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back\nof the van.  Here he finds Kipling and Quint and the three\nhuman Thugs.\n\nThey have Watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing\nthe sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron.\nHe's bruised and bloody, but still conscious.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tAny progress?\n\n\t\t\tQUINT\n\tMy arm's gettin' tired and so far,\n\tzip.\n\n\t\t\tKIPLING\n\tHe is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to\n\tStrader.\n\n\t\t\tQUINT\n\tWhat's that mean?\n\n\t\t\tKIPLING\n\tDuty-bonded.  His allegiance to\n\tStrader is above pain or life.\n\n\t\t\tQUINT\n\tYou tellin' me this guy would die\n\tbefore he'd screw his boss and work\n\tfor us?  Nobody's that dumb.\n\n\t\t\tKIPLING\n\tIt is something you couldn't\n\tcomprehend, Quint.\n\nHarcourt approaches Watson, kneels beside him, careful to\nkeep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tI understand you have been resisting\n\tmy offer Mr. Watson.  Your sense of\n\tduty to Mr. Strader is noble, but --\n\tno longer an issue, I'm afraid...\n\nHarcourt signals and the two Thugs drag an alien body from\nthe back if the van: a middle-aged alien, Strader, shot\ntwice through the front of his silk suit.  Watson's eyes\nwiden in fear.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\t\t   (continuing)\n\tI will not make this offer again.  I\n\twant you to work for me, to manage\n\tthe nightclub as Strader's successor.\n\tIf you do, you will know a wealth\n\tand comfort our people never dared\n\timagine...\n\nWatson stares at Harcourt, scared but defiant.\n\n\t\t\tWATSON\n\tSss'k'a ta'!\n\nHarcourt studies Watson a moment, perhaps even admiring\nhis resolve.  Then--\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tIt is such a pity to die for an\n\toutmoded value.\n\t\t   (rising)\n\tMr. Quint, I believe it's time for\n\tour friend's swimming lesson.\n\nWatson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\t\t   (to Watson)\n\tIt's important to learn new skills.\n\tEssential to your growth as a\n\tperson.\n\nQuint and the Thugs free Watson from the bumper.  He bucks\nand lunges as they drag him toward the surf.  Quint\naddresses one of the Thugs, a new guy.\n\n\t\t\tQUINT\n\tYou never seen this before, have\n\tyou, Billy?  oh, man, you ain't\n\tgonna believe it... seawater is like\n\tbattery acid to these guys... I\n\tdon't know what it is, some kinds\n\tchemical reaction.  Whatta you think\n\tit is, Watson?  Whoa, hold him.\n\t\t   (a wave breaks\n\t\t    outside, the foam\n\t\t    rolls in)\n\tWhat I love about the surf is you\n\tcan never tell how far up it's going\n\tto come until it... whoops, got a\n\tlittle wet there.\n\nThe wave just sloshes over Watson's lower legs.  He\nscreams.  Flailing, one of his hands dips below the\nsurface of the water.  He howls and yanks out his hand.\nWe see the alien hand dripping seawater... then a thousand\ndroplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the\nhand.  The Thugs get Watson swinging.\n\n\t\t\tQUINT\n\tLast call, sucker.  One... two...\n\tTHREE!\n\nWatson is flung into the surf.\n\nANGLE\n\nHarcourt and Kipling have walked down almost to the\nwaterline.  We HEAR Watson's GURGLES and SCREAMS... then\nnothing.  Kipling is very nervous this close to the water.\nHarcourt seems unperturbed.\n\n\t\t\tKIPLING\n\tWhen we picked him up, he was\n\ttalking to those two cops -- the two\n\twho came to question you about\n\tHubley.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tThis is getting out of hand.  I want\n\tyou to deal with it.  Immediately.\n\nA wave rushes up the sand.  Kipling quickly steps back.\nHarcourt stands firm, staring it down, and the foam stops\nsix inches from his dress shoes.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\t\t   (continuing)\n\tWe must learn to embrace the things\n\twe fear... and from that grow\n\tstrong.\n\nA moment, then he turns and starts back toward the limo.\nHe motions to Strader's body and the surf.  The Thugs grab\nthe body and heave it into the waves.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nJetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the\nkitchen wall phone.  Sykes, foreground, takes the bottle\nof vodka from the refrigerator, throws some ice in a\nglass, pours himself a shot.  As Jetson is talking, he\nspots the carton of milk that Sykes inadvertently left out\nof the refrigerator two nights ago.\n\nHe sniffs it... his eyebrows do an involuntary movement.\nHe finishes with his wife and hangs up.  He watches Sykes\ntake a long pull on the vodka.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (holds up milk\n\t\t    carton)\n\tWould you mind?\n\nSykes shrugs, tosses him a glass.  Jetson pours the semi-\nlumpy milk and takes a big swallow.  Sykes grimaces.\nThen--\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (indicates phone)\n\tSo, she keeps you on a pretty short\n\tleash, does she?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tMy wife?  She worries about me.\n\nSykes leans against the counter, getting comfortable, his\nvoice more weary then bitter.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYeah... I know the routine.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYou are married?\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWas.  Divorced.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWe mate for life.  Divorce... is a\n\tstrange concept to us.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tIt's like having an eleventh finger\n\tremoved.  It hurts like hell, but\n\tyou never really needed the damn\n\tthing in the first place.\n\nJetson nods -- even though he doesn't really understand\nthis.  They drink... Jetson gazes around.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYour home is quite disordered.  I\n\tthought perhaps you had been\n\tburglarized when I walked in.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (growling)\n\tI appreciate your honesty, George.\n\nHe smacks his glass against Jetson's.  They drink.\n\n\nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER\n\nSykes has his wallet out... showing Jetson a dog-eared\nphoto.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tIgnore the bitch on the left, that's\n\tEdie.  I call her Edi Amin... This\n\tis Kristin, my daughter.  It's kinda\n\tan old picture... she's twenty now.\n\tGetting married, in fact... on\n\tSunday.\n\nJetson sitting across the table from Sykes, looks at the\nproffered photo.  They're both a little drunk now.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tHuman children can be very\n\tbeautiful.\n\t\t   (then)\n\tGetting married?  Congratulations.\n\tYou will be taking Sunday off,\n\tthen...\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (uneasy)\n\tMaybe not... I don't know.  I'm not\n\tsure I'm gonna go.\n\t\t   (mumbles)\n\tShe doesn't need her burn-out of a\n\tfather there...\n\nJetson looks at him.  Sees something he never thought\npossible in Sykes.  Vulnerability.  Trying to break the\nmelancholy mood, Jetson reaches for his wallet.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (upbeat)\n\tI must show you...\n\t\t   (flips open wallet,\n\t\t    shows four crisp\n\t\t    photos of his wife)\n\tAnd this is Richard.  My son.  He's\n\tfour years old.  We named him after\n\tthe former President, Richard Nixon.\n\nSykes looks at all the photos sprawled out on the table...\nand has to laugh.  He looks up at Jetson's sincere face.\nHe may be starting to like this guy.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYou open to a piece of advice?  Tell\n\tpeople you named him after Richard\n\tBurton, the actor.  Just take my\n\tword for it.\n\nAnd he clacks his glass against Jetson's sitting on the\ntable, and--\n\n\nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER\n\nThey are quite a bit drunker.  Jetson has doffed his\njacket and tie, leans in, listening intently to Sykes.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t... and so, and so the doctor says,\n\t\"If this is the thermometer, then\n\twhere'd I leave the pen?\"\n\t\t   (laughs raucously,\n\t\t    Jetson doesn't\n\t\t    react)\n\tYou're not... you don't think that's\n\tfunny?  George, work with me, I\n\talways get a laugh with that one.\n\tLook, if the doctor's got the\n\tthermometer in his hand, then\n\twhere's his pen gotta be?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (straight-faced)\n\tIn the other man's rectum.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (laughing)\n\tSticking out of his ass... yeah!\n\tSee, that's what makes it a joke.\n\tThere's like a surprise, and your\n\tmind fills in the funny picture.\n\tHere's this guy with a pen stuck in\n\this ass and he thinks it's a\n\tthermometer.\n\t\t   (Jetson just blinks)\n\tNada, huh?\n\nJetson shrugs apologetically.  Sykes pours them each\nanother round.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (continuing)\n\tYour health...\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tTa ss'trakyona'...\n\nThey CLACK glasses, and--\n\n\nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER STILL\n\nThe party has moves into the living room floor, around the\ncoffee table.  It's a quieter moment.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tThere is so much our two peoples\n\tdon't understand about each other.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tNo shit, Holmes.  You're only from\n\tanother goddamn planet, for\n\tchrissakes.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYou humans are very curious to us.\n\tYou invite us to live among you, in\n\tan atmosphere of equality we've\n\tnever known before.  You lay before\n\tus a beautiful green world, full of\n\tfreedoms and opportunities... You\n\tgive us ownership of our lives for\n\tthe first time... and you ask no\n\tmore of us than you do of\n\tyourselves: to live by the rules...\n\trules that aren't made to keep one\n\tpeople subordinate to another, but\n\trules that exist to preserve\n\tequality.  You aspire to very high\n\tideals here.\n\nSykes is watching Jetson, mesmerized.  The guy's never\nsaid this much at one time before.\n\nIf he wasn't drunk, Jetson would never let himself open up\nto a human like this.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (continuing)\n\tI hope you can understand how\n\tspecial your world is... how unique\n\ta people you humans are.  So it us\n\tall the more painful and confusing\n\tto us that so few of you seem\n\tcapable of living up the the ideals\n\tyou set for yourselves.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tDon't count on me, George.  I never\n\thad any ideals.\n\nJetson smiles a little.  He knows that's bullshit.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWe don't understand the hatred, the\n\tcontempt.  But we must bear it... we\n\tmust not react in anger... because\n\tour situation here is still fragile.\n\tThe separationists would see us\n\treturned to the quarantine camps.\n\tThe fundamentalists say we have no\n\tmore human rights than dogs or cats.\n\tBut the prejudice we face here is so\n\tinsignificant compared to the pain\n\tthat we've known before.  And that\n\tis why we are so grateful.\n\nSykes studies him a long time through heavy-lidded eyes.\nFinally--\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYeah, well... except I did hear you\n\teat your dead.\n\nJetson looks at him a long beat, then--\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (deadpan)\n\tOnly on Fridays.\n\nSykes stares at him for about five seconds and then\nexplodes with laughter.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYou son-of-a-bitch.  You're okay.\n\nJetson stands unsteadily, and announces:\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tI'm going home.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You\n\tdo sleep, don't you?\n\nJetson, going out the front door, just waves over his\nshoulder without turning around.  He's gone.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWhat a wildman...\n\nSykes, stands there wobbling, then he collapses backward\nonto the sofa, unconscious.  And we MATCH DISSOLVE TO--\n\n\nINT.  SYKES' APARTMENT - DAWN\n\nThe first hues of dawn stream through the window.  Sykes\nremains passed out on the sofa where we left him.\n\n\nEXT.  STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN\n\nThe slug-mobile parked at the curb.  Silence, then the\nRUMBLE of a heavy truck... and a tow truck turns onto this\nstreet at the corner.\n\nThe tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug-\nmobile.  The driver stays inside as his passenger alights\ncarrying a tool kit and a paper bag.  The human is Quint.\n\nQuint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then\nslides behind the wheel.\n\n\nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - DAWN\n\nQuint slides the contents from the paper bag.  It is a\npacket of C-4 plastic explosives, with a primer cap, and\ntwo lead wires with their ends bared.  Quint bends down,\nstarts to work under the dash.  As his head disappears\nfrom FRAME, suddenly another head appears above the\nseats... George Jetson sitting up groggily in the back\nseat.  A blanket slips off his head and shoulders.  He\nsits there blinking, rubbing his eyes, feeling lousy.\n\nUnder the dash, Quint starts to whistle as he works.\nMistake.\n\nJetson, with a puzzled expression, leans forward and sees\nthis guy in the front seat.  Before he can jump-start his\nbrain, Quint sits up, sees him, and hammers him in the\nface with his fist.  Jetson is knocked back, holding his\nface.  That was the last thing he needed.\n\n\nEXT.

This is an oil refinery,\n\tyou...\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (pushing harder)\n\tWHERE?!\n\n\t\t\tO'NEAL\n\t\t   (unable to breathe)\n\tYou... can't do... this!\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGeorge, uh... you're gonna break his\n\tlittle chest bones...\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tStay out of this, Matthew.\n\t\t   (to O'Neal)\n\tTell me where the drug has been\n\ttaken or I will crush your lungs\n\tagainst this wall.\n\nO'Neal is experiencing real fear now.  Sykes has decided\nto back Jetson up, for better or worse.  He takes the\n\"good cop\" role.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tDon't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he\n\tgets like this, I can't control him.\n\tI've seen this before.  He got like\n\tthis once -- I saw him jerk a guy's\n\tspine out and show it to him.\n\tNothing I could do.  I hadda go\n\tthrow up.\n\n\t\t\tO'NEAL\n\t\t   (at length, with\n\t\t    great effort)\n\t... They took the stuff out, all of\n\tit -- this afternoon.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tHow much?\n\n\t\t\tO'NEAL\n\tAbout fifty kilos... of\n\tconcentrate... and some street\n\tgrade... in tubes.\n\nJetson reacts to this... then increases the pressure.\nO'Neal is really in bad trouble now.  Even Sykes takes a\nhalf-step forward -- thinking Jetson might actually crush\nthis man.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWhere have they taken it?\n\n\t\t\tO'NEAL\n\tEncount... Encounters Club.\n\nFinally, Jetson eases off.  O'Neal slumps to the floor,\ngasping for air.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  REFINERY - NIGHT\n\nThis time Jetson is the Juggernaut... his expression set\nand hard... as he strides to the car.  Sykes practically\nhas to run to keep up.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGeorge, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's\n\ta beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it\n\t-- we got him by the short hairs.\n\tHe ain't gonna make any more of the\n\tshit.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tThe fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to\n\tfind it.  I can't let it get out on\n\tthe street.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWhy?  What's the big goddamn deal?\n\nJetson has reached the driver's door of the slug-mobile,\nyanks it open.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (continuing; as\n\t\t    Jetson starts the\n\t\t    car\n\tYou destroy that drug, you destroy\n\tthe case.  Don't blow the whole\n\tthing now by not following\n\tprocedure.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (through the open\n\t\t    driver's window)\n\tFuck procedure.\n\nAnd to Sykes' shock, he throws the car in gear and peels\nout.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tHey!!\n\nJetson accelerates toward the security gate.  The guard in\nthe shack starts yelling and runs out as the slug-mobile\nbashes through the barricade bar.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGEORGE!  GODDAMMIT!!\n\nSykes stands there like a moron -- with no partner, no\ncar.  A pickup truck carrying a Worker just getting off\nhis shift starts ambling past.  Sykes runs in front of it,\nwaving his badge.  The pickup skids to a stop.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tPolice.  Get out.  I need this\n\tthing.  Out, now!\n\nThe poor guy bails out and Sykes jumps in, jamming it into\ngear.  The truck has seen better days... it doesn't have\nmuch power to give as Sykes floors it toward the exit.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT\n\nAs Jetson races along the freeway, whipping past other\ntraffic.  He takes a hand off the wheel, reaches over and\npops open the glovebox.  He shoves some maps and garbage\naside, reaches deeper inside for something -- we don't see\nwhat.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.  ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT\n\nCassandra walks a trio of well-dressed DRUG DEALERS (two\nalien, one human) through the deserted club.\n\n\nINT.  SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nShe leads them to the office door, opens it, then lets\nthem enter ahead of her.  A couple of them smile at her\nlasciviously as they brush past.  She is about to enter\nherself when an alien hand flashes in behind her, covering\nher mouth, pulling her backward away from the door.\n\nIt is Jetson.  He had been hiding behind some crates\nstacked here in the corridor.  He pins Cassandra\npowerfully to the wall, keeping one hand over her mouth.\nShe struggles until she sees who it is.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tI am here to take Harcourt.  Where\n\tis he?\n\nShe hesitates, then decides to cooperate, indicates with a\nnod toward the office door.\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\tIn there.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (pulling his gun)\n\tShow me.\n\n\nINT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe large suitcase rests on the expansive conference\ntable.  A manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens\nit.  Inside are fifty one-kilo glass tubes full of the\nviscous blue drug.  Also several of the small, individual\ndispensers.  It is Harcourt, standing behind the table in\na pool of light, who has opened the suitcase.  He is\nflanked by Kipling... with Quint elsewhere in the room.\nThe room is lit by track light, creating pools of light\nand dark.\n\nThe two alien Dealers' eyes widen at the sight of the\ndrug.  The human dealer doesn't know what it is.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\t\t   (to alien dealers)\n\tIt's been a long time, hasn't it,\n\tgentlemen?\n\n\t\t\tHUMAN DEALER\n\tWhat is it?\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tA sweet indulgence from out past...\n\tresurrected for our future.\n\nHarcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien\nDealers' faces... smiles knowingly.  He slides one of the\ndispensers from the suitcase.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\t\t   (continuing; to\n\t\t    alien  dealers)\n\tPlease feel free to sample the\n\tquality.  The experience will be\n\teverything you remember it to be...\n\nOne of the alien Dealers takes the dispenser, brings it to\nhis tongue.  The other alien dealer turns to Harcourt--\n\n\t\t\tALIEN DEALER\n\tWhere'd you get it?\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tI arranged to spend some time with\n\tthree very resourceful men.  With a\n\tcertain amount of coaxing, one of\n\tthem was able to reconstitute the\n\tformula for me.\n\t\t   (beat)\n\tThey worked very well together.\n\tUnfortunately, they are no longer\n\twith us... but I was fortunate\n\tenough to reap the benefit of their\n\tendeavor.\n\nHe indicates the drug.  The first alien Dealer sways\ngently, enjoying the sensation.  The second alien Dealer\ntakes his hit... shudders as the first rush washes over\nhim.  The human Dealer is no fool... he grabs the\ndispenser.\n\n\t\t\tHUMAN DEALER\n\tLet me try some.\n\t\t   (he does,\n\t\t    immediately spits\n\t\t    it out)\n\tJesus!  Tastes like detergent!\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tAnd that's all the effect it will\n\thave on you.  But when my fellow\n\tNewcomers learn they can obtain it\n\there, they will work very hard... to\n\tmake as much money as they can... to\n\tgive it to me.\n\nSuddenly, a voice from the shadows near the open door to\nthe other office:\n\n\t\t\tVOICE\n\tYou haven't told him all of it.\n\nHarcourt and the others react.  Quint leaps to his feet,\ncaught off guard.  Kipling reaches for his shoulder\nholster.  A silhouette beside the open door to the outer\noffice nudges Cassandra into the light of the room, then\nsteps out himself.  It is Jetson.\n\nQuint gets his gun out, is about to aim... when his eyes\ngo wide at the sight of something Jetson holds.\n\nIt is the plastic explosive charge that Quint was wiring\nto the slug-mobile.  The wires are connected and Jetson's\nfinger squeezes down hard on the detonation push-switch.\n\n\t\t\tQUINT\n\tHe's got the C-4 charge!\n\nJetson moves forward slowly, holding the bomb in front of\nhim.  He is sweating rivers.  The others quickly join him.\nHe nudges Cassandra ahead of himself, keeping her where he\ncan see her.\n\n\t\t\tQUINT\n\t\t   (continuing)\n\tJust take it real casual, buddy.\n\tKeep your finger on that button and\n\tdon't do nothing squirrely.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tIf you release that button, you not\n\tonly kill us, but yourself.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tTo get you and that--\n\t\t   (indicates drug in\n\t\t    suitcase)\n\t-- I would do it.\n\nHe says it with such straightforward eye contact, that\nHarcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tEveryone up against that wall.\n\tVery slowly.\n\t\t   (to Harcourt)\n\tExcept you.\n\nHarcourt remains behind the desk.  Cassandra stays where\nshe is, near Jetson.  The others move to the wall.\nKipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen.\n\nJetson takes the \"sample\" dispenser from the table, tosses\nit into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it.\nAll the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tOne small matter seems to have\n\tescaped your attention.  That--\n\t\t   (indicates suitcase)\n\t-- is not on any books as a\n\tcontrolled substance.  Legally it\n\tmight as well be fifty kilos of...\n\tgrape jelly.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tThe charge is murder... and\n\tconspiracy to commit murder.\n\tHubley, Porter, Strader... probably\n\tothers.\n\nThere's a flicker of concern behind Harcourt's icy blue\neyes.\n\nCassandra stares at Harcourt.\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\tYou... you killed Strader?\n\nCassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket.\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\tWhere's Todd?!  Did you do something\n\tto Todd?!\n\nHarcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tTodd?  Who is Todd.\n\t\t   (then remembers;\n\t\t    smiles)\n\tAh, poor Mr. Watson.\n\nCassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said\nsinks in.  Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase.  They\nstart out.  Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's .357\nand with a KEENING WAIL, brings it up toward Harcourt's\nface.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tNOOO!\n\nJetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun.  He\nmanages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet\ngoing into the wall behind Harcourt.  Striking like a\nmongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead\nwires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart.\nJetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch...\nand nothing happens.\n\n\t\t\tKIPLING\n\tI got it!\n\nKipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the\nfloor.  Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her\nwith it, hard.  She drops to her knees and Quint viciously\nhits her again.\n\nMeanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet.  Kipling\nrears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm\n-- to the nerve plexus.  Jetson instantly folds over\nforward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into\nJetson's face, flipping him back.  Kipling slams him into\nthe wall face-first, pinning him there.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tKill them both.\n\n\t\t\tKIPLING\n\tHere?\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\t\t   (raging)\n\tDo it!\n\nQuint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the\nbase of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger.\nThere's a loud BLAM!  and Cassandra flinches... then looks\nup.\n\nQuint is blown backward away from her.\n\nSykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the\nCasull smoking in his hand.\n\nQuint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid\nwall, but the huge window overlooking the club.  He\ncrashes through it.\n\nANGLE FROM DANCE FLOOR\n\nas the wall of mirror explodes IN SLOW MOTION and Quint\ncartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds.\n\nANGLE - IN THE OFFICE\n\nKipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at\nSykes.\n\nSykes dodges into the private office for cover.\n\nThe three Dealers dive behind any available furniture.\n\nHarcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door\nleading into the adjoining outer office.\n\nSykes swings around the edge of the private office door,\nstraight-arms the Casull into the office and fires.\nKipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door,\ncovering Harcourt's back.  Sykes ducks back down.\n\nAn unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and\nKipling escaping, and takes off after them.\n\nSykes straight-arms the gun into the room again... sees\nJetson disappearing through the adjoining office door.  He\nmoves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in\nsurrender, rise from behind the furniture.\n\n\t\t\tALIEN DEALER\n\tDon't shoot, man -- we're unarmed --\n\tlook!\n\nSykes looks at these harmless wimps... then at Cassandra.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tYou okay?\n\n\t\t\tCASSANDRA\n\t\t   (dazed, but all\n\t\t    right)\n\tYeah...\n\nAnd he charges out the adjoining office door.\n\n\nEXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT\n\nHarcourt and Kipling bang down the metal stairs.  Jetson\nis ten feet above them.  Sykes flies out onto the fire\nescape, a few steps behind Jetson.  A POLICE CAR SIREN is\nHEARD arriving O.S.\n\n\nEXT.  ALLEY - BEHIND ENCOUNTER - NIGHT\n\nTwo UNIFORMED OFFICERS bound from their unit and run into\nthe back entrance of the club, leaving the unit running.\n\nTwo seconds later, Harcourt and Kipling leap down from the\nfire escape, find themselves near the unit.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tHere!\n\nHe throws the suitcase into the passenger side door, jumps\nin.  Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear\nand floors it.\n\nJetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels\nout.  Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing\ncar.  One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the\nrear of the trunk, but the car keeps going.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tThis way!\n\nHe indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby.  They race to\nit, jump in... Sykes driving.  He burns rubber as he pulls\nout.\n\nA second arriving police unit pulls into the alley,\nheading straight for the slug-mobile.  Sykes has to grate\nbetween the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get\npast.\n\n\nEXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT\n\nHarcourt and Kipling in the first police unit come\nthundering down the street zig-zagging through traffic.\nThe slug-mobile is three-quarters of a block behind them.\n\nINSIDE THE BLACK-AND-WHITE\n\nHarcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches...\neventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and\nSIREN blast on.\n\n\nEXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT\n\nIt looks like a backwards chase, the slug-mobile chasing\nthe howling police car through traffic.\n\nJetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic -- calls it\nout to Sykes the way he was trained at the academy.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tSlow traffic on your right... you're\n\tclear at the left rear...\n\t\t   (Sykes changes lanes)\n\tCareful, red light ahead...\n\nWith Jetson's help, Sykes is able to dice through the\ncross-traffic without incident.\n\n\nEXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT\n\nThe traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response\nto the approaching lights and SIREN.  Kipling dodges\naround the stopped traffic easily.\n\nThe same traffic that has pulled over for the police car\nnow starts easing back onto the street, cutting off the\nslug-mobile.\n\n\nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT\n\nSykes' expression tells us he's slipped into the same\njuggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYellow light ahead turning red...\n\nBut Sykes doesn't slow -- instead he floors it.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (continuing; wide-\n\t\t    eyed)\n\tRed light!  Red light!\n\n\nEXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT\n\nSykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the\nintersection, and continues the chase.  On the wrong side\nof the road, head-on into traffic.\n\nHeadlights peel off in front of them as they charge along\nthe wrong side.  They eventually catch up to the police\nunit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between\nthem.\n\nSykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the Casull\nwith the other.  He brings it up and around right in front\nof Jetson's nose, pointing it through the passenger window\nat Kipling.\n\nAt that moment, Kipling glances over and reacts to the\nbore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser.\n\nJetson reacts to the gun in his face... then reacts to\nsomething else he sees beyond it.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tGreen light, Matthew.\n\t\t   (Sykes doesn't\n\t\t    respond)\n\tGreen light!\n\nNow Sykes looks.  The light at the intersection has just\nturned green -- and the rows of the cars that were waiting\nstart coming.  It's a wall of headlights coming right for\nthe slug-mobile.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tShit!\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tSs-ai!\n\n\nEXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT\n\nSykes locks up the brakes.  Kipling veers around a couple\nof cars and speeds away.\n\nBecause of the other traffic, Sykes has only one course of\naction.  He skids a left onto a side street.\n\n\nEXT.  SIDE STREET - NIGHT\n\nSykes burns rubber down this quieter street, squeals a\nright onto another street that parallels the street the\npolice unit is on.  At the first street available, he cuts\nback in behind the police unit.\n\n\nEXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT\n\nSykes' car tears along below the overpass -- with the\npolice unit directly above them!  An on-ramp approaches\nfor the slug-mobile and Sykes floors it.\n\n\nINT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT\n\nHarcourt turns in his seat just in time to see the slug-\nmobile airborne as it flies from the on-ramp, landing a\nfew feet behind the black-and-white's bumper.\n\n\nEXT.  FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT\n\nWith the slug-mobile now, the police unit hangs a right,\ncuts through a parking lot, and bounces onto--\n\n\nEXT.  SECOND STREET AND TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\nThe police unit hangs a u-turn into the Second Street\ntunnel.  It clips one of the civilian cars, causing a\npile-up of traffic behind the police unit.\n\nThe slug-mobile skids to a stop, blocked by the clog of\ntraffic in the tunnel.  Sykes is out of the drivers door\nin a flash, stand on the door frame, and yells--\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tMove your goddamned cars!\n\nPeople climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered --\nignoring Sykes.  Sykes slides behind the wheel, bangs his\nbumper into the car in front of him, and pushes the car\nfar enough forward to get around.  He speeds off.\n\n\nINT./ EXT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - FREEWAY - NIGHT\n\nKipling rockets up a freeway on-ramp.  Harcourt smiles\nwith satisfaction -- there's no sign of the slug-mobile\nbehind them.  Kipling eases off, blends into the flow of\ntraffic.\n\n\nEXT.  FREEWAY - NIGHT\n\nSykes slaloms the slug-mobile through the civilian\ntraffic like Mario Andretti lapping the pack at\nIndianapolis.\n\n\nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT\n\nJetson spots the police unit in the right hand lane ahead.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tThere!\n\nSykes sees it.  Thinking fast, he eases off, using another\ncar as a blind.  He waits until the police unit is\nparallel to an off-ramp, then guns ahead and swings right,\ndirectly for the police unit.\n\nKipling looks over, reacts, just as the slug-mobile\nbroadsides the police unit.  Sykes forces the police unit\nup the off-ramp.\n\n\nEXT.  INTERSECTION - NIGHT\n\nDoor handle to door handle, the two cars slue to the\nright.  The police unit breaks out in front, but Sykes\nstays right on its ass.  They charge up onto--\n\n\nEXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\nThe police unit and slug-mobile -- bumper to bumper at 80\nMPH.\n\n\nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT\n\nAs the cars scream along, Jetson cranes out the side\nwindow, looking in distress at the inky seawater flashing\npast below.\n\n\nEXT.  VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\nThey reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto--\n\n\nEXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n\nA clear two lane straightaway near the ocean.  Sykes\npushes the slug-mobile to its limits, pulls alongside the\npolice unit.  The two cars trade blows at 90+ MPH.\nKipling manages to send Sykes onto the dirt shoulder,\nslowing him down.\n\n\nINT.  BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT\n\nKipling watches the slug-mobile in the rearview mirror,\nthen looks back out the front to see the end of the road\ncoming up fast!  Harcourt bellows to Kipling, who slams on\nthe brakes.\n\n\nEXT.  END OF BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n\nThe police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain\nlink fence where the road ends.  An abandoned drawbridge\nand the ocean are on the other side of the fence.\n\nWith nowhere else to go, Harcourt yells something at\nKipling and Kipling floors it back the way they came.\n\n\nEXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n\nThe two cars are racing for a full head-on.  At the last\ninstant, Sykes wrenches the wheel, throws the slug-mobile\nsideways, passenger side first.  The police unit smashes\ninto the rear door and fender of the slug-mobile, both\ncars skidding madly to a stop.  A fire ignites under the\nhood of the police unit.\n\n\nINT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT\n\nSykes sits stunned behind the wheel.  Disoriented but\nconscious, he raises his head, looks over... sees Jetson\nout cold, his forehead gashed and bleeding.  Then he looks\nover and sees the fire growing under the police unit's\nhood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug-\nmobile -- near the gas tank.\n\n\nEXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n\nSykes slides out of the driver's door, stumbles to\nJetson's door, wrenches it open, and drags the huge\nunconscious alien away from the cars.\n\nHe's still dragging Jetson away when he spots Harcourt\npulling himself through the smashed police unit window.\nBruised and bleeding, Harcourt reaches in for the\nsuitcase, then starts to run with it.\n\nWith Jetson a safe distance away from the cars, Sykes\nclambers to his feet, draws the Casull, and starts off\nafter Harcourt.\n\nHarcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the\nclosed drawbridge.  He heaves the suitcase over, then\nstarts to climb.\n\nSykes lumbers past the burning police unit.  Kipling is\nstill behind the wheel, his head slumped forward.  Sykes\nis just past the cars when they explode -- sending hoods\nand door panels and glass flying in all directions.\nHarcourt, on the other side of the fence, grabs the\nsuitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the\nabandoned drawbridge.\n\nSykes reaches the fence.  Instead of climbing, he simply\nblows the lock to hell with the Casull, and kicks open the\ngate.\n\n\nEXT.  ABANDONED DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT\n\nThe end of the bridge is in the \"up\" position... a huge\nasphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky.  Harcourt\nruns along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the\nbridge, the black seawater drifting past beside him.  His\nfoot slips once and he almost goes over the side.\n\nSykes -- backlit by the burning cars, the big Casull a\nprominent part of the silhouette -- just keeps coming.\n\nHarcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge --\nand has nowhere to go.  He is backed into a corner, with\nseawater on two side of him.  Harcourt pivots frantically,\nsees Sykes coming this way.  Harcourt is a trapped animal.\nHis chest heaves in panic.  Then his gaze falls on the\nsuitcase behind him... and slowly... finally... a look of\nresolve comes into his eye.\n\nON SYKES\n\nHe eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows\nHarcourt is.  There's some movement among the shadows, and\nSykes straight-arms the Casull, his finger white against\nthe trigger.\n\nPerspiration drips into Sykes' eye, but he doesn't blink.\nA long moment then--\n\nANGLE - THE SHADOWS\n\nHarcourt emerges from the darkness.  His face is composed,\nthe superior glint is back in his eye.  His arms are held\naway from his sides at 30 degree angles, clearly in\nsurrender.\n\nSykes cat-steps forward slowly.  Harcourt stares at Sykes'\neyes, and the desire there that Harcourt will give him an\nexcuse.  Harcourt simply... smiles.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tMove a finger, Harcourt, and you're\n\thistory...\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\tNo, Sergeant -- not history...\n\t\t   (beat)\n\tEternity...\n\nAnd now Sykes sees it -- Harcourt has been holding one of\nthe one-kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind\nhis arm.  He brings it up over his head, grins at Sykes,\nthen tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open.\nThe blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin.  His\nmouth fills.\n\nHe looks back at Sykes, making eye contact... his eyes\nmad, defiant.  And -- he swallows.  Long hold -- then the\nwallop of the overdose hits him... his face contorts in\nagony as he begins to convulse.  Sykes, wide-eyed, lowers\nthe Casull and watches as Harcourt drops to the ground and\ngoes into a massive violent seizure.  His limbs hammer\nagainst the deck... his back arches fiercely.  It is a\nbrutal, agonizing ten seconds.  Then, finally, his body\nbecomes still.\n\nSykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to\nhim and takes his pulse the way he saw Jetson do it.\n\nHIGH ANGLE SHOT - THE ENTIRE AREA\n\nSykes stands.  He notices the suitcase nearby, latches it,\nand hefts it.  He carries it with him back toward the\ninferno of the wrecked cars, the Casull hanging heavy and\ncold in his hand.\n\nANGLE FOLLOWING SYKES\n\nHe approaches the burning cars, heading for Jetson.  As he\npasses the burning cars, we have a half-second to register\nthat the driver's door of the police unit is now open\nbefore--\n\n-- a dark figure hurtles at Sykes' back from O.S.!  Sykes\nis thrown forward.  The suitcase crashes to the ground,\nand the Casull goes skittering off.  Sykes looks up -- to\nbe met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of\nKipling!  Kipling reaches down for the suitcase then Sykes\nhears it -- the telltale CLINKING SOUND.  He looks -- and\nsees the exotic silver bracelet on Kipling's wrist.  It\nconnects for him; this is the bandana alien -- the one who\nkilled Bill Tuggle!\n\nKipling brings the suitcase above his head.  He is a half-\nsecond from hurling it down on Sykes' skull when -- a GUN\nROARS.  Kipling is thrown back by the chest wound.  Sykes\nlooks.\n\nANGLE\n\nJetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking Casull.\n\nKipling recovers enough to come at Sykes again with the\nsuitcase again.  Jetson, shaking but determined, fires\nagain, and again, and again.\n\nKipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase\nstill over his head... until he is blasted at last and\nforever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the\ninferno.\n\nSykes rises, makes his way to Jetson's side.  Jetson has\nlet the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground.\nSykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the\nalien's hand.  The two partners remain like this, bathed\nin the orange flickering glow of the fire.\n\nHIGH WIDE SHOT\n\nof the drawbridge, the debris, the carnage, and our two\ncops...\n\n\t\t\t\t    DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n\nThe police mop-up is winding down.  Cop cars, coroner's\nwagons, fire trucks.  We MOVE through it all to find Sykes\nand Jetson seated on the curb, away from the railing.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWith Harcourt and Kipling dead, I\n\tassume you will be requesting\n\treassignment now.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (cool)\n\tIt'd be for your own good.  I think\n\tyou'd be better off with a partner\n\twho's a little more... by the book.\n\t\t   (smiles)\n\t... Still, I gotta tell you, George,\n\tfor a quiet guy, you're sure hell on\n\twheels once you get going.  I'd\n\tkinda hate to miss your next two\n\tdays as a detective.\n\nJetson smiles.  He glances up as they are bathed in red\nand blue light.  A patrol car has pulled up next to them.\nInside is Wiltey, a uniformed cop.\n\n\t\t\tWILTEY\n\tI'll give you guys a lift to the\n\tstation.  They're waiting to take\n\tyour statements on the shootings.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (to Jetson)\n\tLet's go, partner.\n\t\t   (then casually\n\t\t    correcting Wiltey\n\t\t    as he rises)\n\tAnd it's shooting.  Singular.\n\n\t\t\tWILTEY\n\tThey said two.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tNope.  I didn't shoot Harcourt... he\n\to.d.'d.\n\nSHOCK CUT - JETSON\n\nWe rapidly PUSH IN ON HIM as his head snaps around toward\nSykes.  His expression tells us his blood has just turned\nto ice.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.  CORONER'S WAGON - NIGHT\n\nANGLE FORWARD, shooting from the rear of the wagon, toward\nthe DRIVER and ATTENDANT up front.\n\n\t\t\tDRIVER\n\tSo it's just me and her left in the\n\thot tub, right?\n\n\t\t\tATTENDANT\n\tYou and the blonde?\n\n\t\t\tDRIVER\n\tNo, man, the redhead.  The blonde's\n\tgone in the house with some other\n\tguy.  But a few minutes later she\n\tcomes back out, alone, when me and\n\tthe redhead are going at it fast and\n\tfurious in the tub, ya know... and\n\tshe sees us, and... she climbs right\n\tin with us...\n\n\t\t\tATTENDANT\n\tYou're full of shit!\n\n\t\t\tDRIVER\n\tI swear it!  If I'm lyin', I'm\n\tdyin'...\n\nAnd, without warning, A LARGE INHUMAN HAND FLIES UP IN\nF.G., having ripped through the sealed body bag just below\nFRAME.\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.  SQUAD CAR - NIGHT\n\nJetson is up front with Wiltey; Sykes sits in the back,\nthough he is on the edge of the seat, leaning forward\ntoward the front.  Jetson is intently, nervously scanning\nahead and to both sides.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYou are certain this is the route\n\tthey would have taken?\n\n\t\t\tWILTEY\n\tI'm not positive -- but probably.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (warily)\n\tWhat's this about, George?  I know\n\tthat look.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (spots something out\n\t\t    a side window)\n\tThere!  Go back.  Down that side\n\tstreet.\n\nWiltey brakes, backs up, then turns into the side street.\n\nANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD\n\nas they approach an eerie scene.  The coroner's wagon is\nstopped at an angle in the middle of the intersection,\nheadlights and roof lights cutting into the night, the\nback doors wide open.  A patrol car is also here, on the\nother side of the wagon.  There is no movement anywhere\nnear the two vehicles.\n\nWiltey pulls the car up, his eyes like saucers at the\neerie scene.  He reaches for the radio hand mike.  Jetson\nquickly covers it with a large hand.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tNo!\n\t\t   (both Sykes and\n\t\t    Wiltey look at him)\n\tWe must do this alone.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tDo what?!  George-- ?!\n\nJetson is already sliding out of the car.\n\n\nEXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT\n\nJetson, Sykes, and Wiltey move warily forward, their guns\ndrawn.  They reach the van and Sykes takes Wiltey's\nflashlight, shines it through the open back doors.  The\ndoors are bent outward, smashed half off their hinges.\nOne of the body bags is ripped open, literally split from\nend to end.  The blue and red lightbar on the other patrol\ncar can be seen through the wagon's front windshield.\n\nJetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car,\nSykes and Wiltey follow.  Lights all ablaze, it too is\nabandoned.  One door has been wrenched off its hinges and\nlays in the street, and the front windshield is smashed.\nOur three cops approach the car, then Wiltey spots\nsomething beyond the unit.\n\n\t\t\tWILTEY\n\tOh, God...\n\nSykes and Jetson look.\n\nThe bodies of the coroner wagon Driver and Attendant, as\nwell as the two OFFICERS from the patrol car, are crushed\nand beaten and stretched out on the asphalt.  Their arms\nare twisted as though by a mad force -- each pointing down\nthe street toward the dock warehouses ahead.  Wiltey\nstumbles away, backward.\n\n\t\t\tWILTEY\n\tI'm calling for back up, now.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWiltey, no.\n\nBut Wiltey is going.  Jetson starts after him... but Sykes\ngrabs his arm, hard, and spins him.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWhat is this?!\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (low)\n\t... It's Harcourt.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tHarcourt is dead.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tNo he's not.  Not if he overdosed on\n\tthe drug.\n\t\t   (searches for the\n\t\t    words)\n\tMassive amounts trigger a... a\n\tchange.  Your body functions seize\n\tup, you appear to be dead, but it's\n\treally a state of incubation.  When\n\tyou emerge you're...\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (looks at the four\n\t\t    bodies sprawled\n\t\t    before him)\n\tTell me about it...\n\n\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT\n\nOne minute later.  OPEN CLOSE on a light shining into\nCAMERA, then WIDEN to reveal it is one of the door-mounted\nspotlights on Wiltey's patrol car.  Wiltey eases the car\ndown the center of the street.  Sykes and Jetson, guns\nready, walk slowly along on either side of the car... eyes\neverywhere.\n\nMOVING POV\n\nas they move past the shadowy dock warehouses... watching\nfor any signs of movement.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nSykes and Jetson converse across the hood of the car as\nthey walk.  Their eyes everywhere.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tI never thought I'd say this, but --\n\tfor once in my life I think I'm\n\twilling to wait for back-up.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWe can't let him get away.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tWhy the hell are you so dead set\n\tagainst back-up?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (a difficult\n\t\t    admission)\n\tBecause... because of what will\n\thappen if humans see what we are\n\tcapable of becoming.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tBut there's no more drug.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYou understand that.  But how many\n\tothers will?\n\nSykes looks across at Jetson's troubled expression.\n\nJust then, Wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across\nhis headlight beams fifty yards ahead.  Whatever it was,\nwas large and fast.  It darted into an open warehouse\ndoor.\n\n\t\t\tWILTEY\n\tThere he is!\n\nAnd Wiltey floors it.  Sykes and Jetson watch, unable to\nstop him.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tWiltey!\n\nHe and Sykes take off running.  Wiltey skids to the left,\nrockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight.\nSykes and Jetson pour it on.  They hear a SCREECH OF\nBRAKES.  They reach the warehouse door and race through.\n\n\nINT.  WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\nLOW ANGLE, SHOOTING ACROSS the underside of Wiltey's\nstopped patrol car as Sykes' and Jetson's feet appear\naround the corner of the warehouse door.  The car is still\nrunning -- the exhaust pipe still RUMBLING and expelling\nfumes.  The feet slow... then cautiously start around the\ncar.  We PAN with them as they move around the side of the\ncar.  A dark liquid begins dripping in EXTREME F.G.  We\nMOVE UP, to a CLOSE UP of the car bumper.  The dark liquid\nis blood, dripping deep red on the shiny chrome.  We MOVE\nUP farther, and--\n\n-- there is Wiltey's severed head.  IN CLOSE UP, resting\non the hood of the patrol car.\n\nSykes and Jetson stop dead at the sight.  Wiltey's body\nlies in a heap on the floor near the car.  They both\nstare, then Sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the\nwarehouse, his expression saying: what the hell could have\ndone this so fast?\n\nTHEIR POV\n\nThere are two paths to go.  Both dark and scary as hell.\nThe sound of a distant FOG HORN blends with the CREAKS and\nDRIPS of this waterfront building.\n\nANGLE - SYKES AND JETSON\n\nJetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun\nfrom the dash mount.  He checks the chamber as Sykes\nchecks the Casull.\n\nThey exchange a knowing look... then wordlessly, they\nsplit up.  Sykes takes the path to the left, Jetson to the\nright.\n\nWITH JETSON\n\nAs he moves into a dark area.  He slowly picks his way\nalong a long wall, having to step over all sorts of piled\ndebris, heading toward us.  We PAN slightly to the left to\nHOLD a door in CLOSE UP.  The door, already ajar, eases\nopen slightly wider.  Jetson hears this.  He reaches the\ndoor, sets himself, then spins and kicks the door open all\nthe way.  There's nothing inside... now.\n\nJetson looks up, sees movement in the distance.  It is\nSykes, quite far away, in another section of the\nwarehouse.  Sykes leaves Jetson's field of view.\n\n\nINT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT\n\nSykes walks around a corner -- freezes, and cocks his head\nas he hears VOICES -- followed, curiously, by LAUGHTER.\nHe eases forward, peers around a bend, and sees -- a table\nand a chair.  On the table is a mini-television, tuned to\nsome local late night talk show.  There's a thermos, a\nsteaming cup of coffee, and a Twinkie with a single bite\nout of it beside the TV.  The chair is empty, except for a\njacket slung across the back, the word SECURITY stitched\non the breast.  The guard is nowhere in sight.\n\nSykes moves toward the table, taking in this eerie sight.\nHe looks around, then continues on.\n\n\nINT.  WAREHOUSE - APPROACHING STAIRS - NIGHT\n\nJetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies, comes to a\nset of stairs leading to an upper floor.  The top of the\nstairs is pitch black.  Jetson adjusts his grip on the\nshotgun, slowly starts up the stairs.\n\n\nINT.  WAREHOUSE - AT FISH NETS - NIGHT\n\nSykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets, hanging\nfrom the ceiling.  He has no alternate route -- he begins\npushing through them.\n\nSYKES' POV - MOVING THROUGH FISH NETS\n\nBecause of the dimness, he can't see much beyond each rack\nof nets immediately before him.  He keeps wading through\n-- it's like a house of mirrors, he can't tell now much\nfarther he has to go to get out of the nets, and the\ndeeper in he gets, the harder it would be to go back the\nway he came.  He pushes past one particular rack of nets\nand looming out of the darkness ahead of him is--\n\n-- a terrifying face!\n\nON SYKES\n\nHe stumbles back, gets tangled in the nets, brings up the\nCasull, is about to fire when... he sees what the face is.\nIt's the maiden's figurehead from the bow of an old ship.\nThe wood is worm-eaten and decayed, creating a hideous\nvisage.  Sykes stands there a moment, trying to jump-start\nhis heart again.\n\n\nINT.  SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT\n\nJetson moves along the rickety planks.  He comes to a\ndoor.  He eases it open, enters.\n\n\nINT.  SECOND FLOOR ROOM - NIGHT\n\nJetson moves into the shadowy confines.  He hears an\nincessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner.  He moves\nto it.  Turns the spigot, stopping the drip.  Other drips\nare HEARD from a dozen other hidden recesses all around\nhim.  He glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the\nwall above the sink.  Suddenly he sees the movement of\nsomething behind him.  He spins with the shotgun.  A huge\nshadow moves along the wall.  He pivots the shotgun again\n-- toward the source of the shadow.\n\nIt's a length of black tarp, torn and flapping from the\nceiling.  Jetson lets out a deep breath.\n\n\nINT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT\n\nANGLE down a short passageway to an intersecting hallway.\nA strand of something hangs in FRAME in OUT OF FOCUS F.G.\nIt makes an indistinct, rhythmic CLINKING SOUND.  Sykes\nmoves along the intersecting hallway.  The CLINKING SOUND\ncatches his attention.  He stops, listens, then starts\ndown the passageway, toward us.\n\nHe comes forward into the storage room, having to get very\nclose to the strand of something before he sees what it\nis.  It's a double strand of chain, CLINKING gently\nagainst itself.  Sykes reaches out, steadies the chain,\nsilencing it.  He considers.  It could've been a natural\noccurrence... or something could have brushed against it,\nsetting it in motion.  He tightens his grip on the Casull,\nbacking away from the chain.  He senses something behind\nhim and spins.  Nothing there.  He relaxes.  However--\n\nBehind him now, in SOFT FOCUS, we glimpse movement at the\nother end of the short passageway.  It is a figure, moving\nslowly forward down the passageway, back-lit by the\nhallway light behind it, its shadow filling the passageway\nas it approaches Sykes.  It stops, inside the room now,\ndirectly behind Sykes.  Close enough to reach out and\ntouch him.  It is an alien silhouette, but larger, more\npowerful.\n\nSuddenly, Sykes senses something is there.  He turns,\nslowly, and--\n\nSHOCK CUT - HARCOURT\n\nas he steps from the shadows -- just like he did the last\ntime Sykes saw him on the abandoned drawbridge.  Only this\ntime it is a horribly transformed Harcourt.  His eyes are\nred-rimmed and piggish.  His head is lumpen, his skin\nthick and hard.  His neck muscles are corded -- giving him\na kind of hellish cobra's cowl.  There is still\nintelligence behind the eyes -- but it is a feral\nintelligence now.\n\n\t\t\tHARCOURT\n\t\t   (his voice a guttural\n\t\t    rumble)\n\tLooking for me, Sergeant?\n\nSykes stumbles back several steps, wildly brings up the\nCasull, and fires.  The powerful Casull round catches\nHarcourt in the shoulder, jerking him back.\n\n\nEXT.  WORK SHED AREA - NIGHT\n\nJetson, in another area of the docks, hears the echoing\nblast of the Casull.  He gauges as best he can the\ndirection it came from and takes off running.\n\n\nINT.  STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT\n\nHarcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact.  The\ncloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder-\nburned, but the bullet couldn't pierce his plated skin.\nHarcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth, starts\ntoward Sykes.\n\nScared shitless, Sykes rapid-fires.  One of his shots\nmisses, shattering a crate beside Harcourt's head.  The\nremaining shots strike Harcourt full on.  Harcourt is\njerked by the impact of the bullets each time, SNARLING in\nanger -- but none of the hits stop him.  The Casull is\nempty and Harcourt keeps coming.\n\nSykes stumbles back, but Harcourt is on him in a flash.\nHarcourt grabs Sykes' arm holding the gun, yanks hard.  We\nHEAR the POP as the shoulder dislocates.  Sykes HOLLERS,\nand the gun jumps out of his hand.\n\n\nINT.  WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT\n\nJetson races in, shotgun ready.  The last of Sykes' shots\nare still ECHOING.  Jetson looks around, frustrated,\nunable to tell exactly where they are coming from.  He\nsees the likely path and charges that way.\n\n\nEXT.  DOCK - AT STAIRS - NIGHT\n\nOn the CUT, Sykes' body is already tumbling down these\nrickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse,\nhaving been thrown ruthlessly from above.  As Sykes' body\nsprawls on the dock, the massive figure of Harcourt\nappears at the top of the stairs.\n\nSykes, scraped and bruised, struggles to his feet.\nHarcourt moves down the stairs, then vaults over the\nrailing the last fifteen feet.  Harcourt lurches forward\nand, with a taloned grip on Sykes' shoulders, propels him\ndown the docks.\n\n\nEXT.  STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT\n\nThe first two arriving black-and-whites skid to stops at\nthe coroner's wagon.  The Officers leap out, flagging\nother arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses.\n\n\nEXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT\n\nSykes is on his feet, but his knees buckle, and he almost\ncollapses again.  Harcourt comes at him.  Then Sykes sees\nit--\n\n-- a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of\nthe jetties.  Sykes makes a break for it.\n\n\nEXT.  WAREHOUSE - AT STAIRS - NIGHT\n\nJetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs,\nfrantically scanning for any sign of Sykes.  Then, in the\ndistance, he spots the two figures running along the jetty\n-- Sykes being chased by the re-formed Harcourt.  Jetson\ngives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive\nlook, then gathers up his courage, and races down the\nstairs to help Sykes.\n\n\nEXT.  JETTY - NIGHT\n\nSykes lumbers along the narrow jetty.  The fishing boat is\nalready passing the end of the jetty.  Harcourt is fast\nbehind Sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults\noff toward the stern of the boat -- landing on the fishing\nnet piled on the rear deck.  He yells in pain as his ankle\ntwists under his weight.\n\n\nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n\nSykes lies there, holding his arm, breathing hard,\nrelieved that he has escaped.\n\n\nEXT.  JETTY - NIGHT\n\nHarcourt can't reach the boat from the same jetty Sykes\ndid, so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty, then\nonto a second jetty.  And from here, he vaults across the\nseawater onto the boat.\n\n\nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n\nSykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the\ncabin.  The fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the\nopen sea.\n\n\nEXT.  DOCKS - NIGHT\n\nJetson sees this and is shitting bricks.  Suddenly the\nstark BEAM of a police helicopter sun-gun stabs down from\nabove.  Jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low,\nthe sun-gun washing over the docks.\n\n\nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\nThe sun-gun hits Jetson standing on the dock, frantically\nwaving his badge at the 'copter, signaling it down.  The\nPilot starts to take it down.\n\n\nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n\nSykes is on all fours, clawing his way up the fishing net\ntoward the back of the boat.  Harcourt gets one hand on\nhis leg.  Sykes jerks his leg away, and Harcourt's claws\ndig deep through Sykes' pants into his legs as he pulls\naway.  Sykes BELLOWS in pain.\n\n\nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\nJetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the\ndock.  He has to catch himself from falling out the open\ndoor.  Below, uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto\nthe dock.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tOn that boat -- out there!\n\nJetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth\nof the channel.  The helicopter tilts forward and goes.\n\n\nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n\nSykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging\nover the stern of the fishing boat.  He pushes to the back\nof the dinghy as Harcourt's savage visage appears at the\nbow.  Harcourt grins -- the predator with his prey\ntrapped.\n\n\nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\nJetson's face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the\nchannel water racing past beneath.  They come up on the\nboat and the Pilot plays the sun-gun onto the deck,\nlooking for movement, finally pinning Sykes and Harcourt\nat the stern dinghy.\n\n\nEXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n\nThe Captain reacts to the helicopter overhead, looks back\nat what the sun-gun spotlights.  He sees Harcourt standing\nat the bow of the dinghy, starting to clamber in.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\tHey!\n\n\nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n\nHarcourt turns, sees the Captain on the bridge above him.\nHe reaches for a wood-handled gaff nearby.  He rears back\nwith it and lets it fly like a spear.\n\n\nEXT.  BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n\nThe gaff impales the Captain, off-center in his chest.\nThe Captain, his face frozen in shock, is thrown back\nagainst the throttle.  The boat lunges forward as the\nengines REV loudly.\n\n\nEXT.  FISHING BOAT - NIGHT\n\nHarcourt is thrown into the dinghy with Sykes.  As\nHarcourt recovers, Sykes spots the release for the tie\nline on the dinghy.  He lunges forward, throwing the\nratchet.  The line plays out, and the dinghy slides\nbackward into water!\n\n\nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\nJetson watches this happen.\n\n\nEXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT\n\nThe dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie\nline) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat.\n\nHarcourt claws his way toward Sykes.  Water is already\nsplashing in over the stern transom... the dinghy is\nsinking.  Harcourt grabs Sykes' leg and pulls him toward\nhim.  Sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his\nmight.  Harcourt yanks him free.  Sykes kicks wildly at\nthe ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the\nline.  Harcourt is coming in for the kill when--\n\n-- Sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever.  The rest\nof the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the\ndinghy from the fishing boat!\n\nThe dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast.  A wave from\nthe fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side.  Some\nof it hits Harcourt -- he HOWLS and falls away.  Sykes\nsees this, tries to clamber over the side, but Harcourt is\non him again.  Sykes' body weight at the side of the\ndinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to\nwash in over the transom.\n\n\nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\nJetson reacts to Sykes and Harcourt battling in the dinghy\nbelow.\n\n\nEXT.  DINGHY - NIGHT\n\nHarcourt, who is getting more and more wet, HOWLS in\nagony, thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water\ntouches.  Sykes is taking one hell of a beating.  Harcourt\nsweeps Sykes up in a bear hug, is about to crush his rib\ncage, when Sykes shifts his body weight, knocking Harcourt\noff balance.  Harcourt wobbles, fear on his face for the\nfirst time -- then he finally loses it, and the two of\nthem tumble overboard into the water, capsizing the\ndinghy.\n\n\nEXT.  WATER - NIGHT\n\nSykes breaks the surface, gasping for air, frantically\nclawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still\nabove the water.  Suddenly, behind him, Harcourt's\npartially melted form erupts from the water, lunges on top\nof Sykes, and drags him under.\n\n\nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\nJetson hangs in the open door, watching in horror, wanting\nto help, knowing he can't.\n\n\nEXT.  WATER - NIGHT\n\nSykes breaks the surface, Harcourt's misshapen lump of a\nbody unmoving but still on top of him.  Sykes shoves it\naway, struggling to stay afloat.  His head keeps dunking\nunder.  He's drowning.\n\n\nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\nJetson screws up his courage and turns to the Pilot.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tTake it down!  Take it down!\n\n\nEXT.  WATER AND HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\nThe helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water.\nJetson hangs in the doorway, watching Sykes' head dunking\nunder again.  The helicopter's skids are three feet above\nthe water.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (to Pilot)\n\tALL THE WAY!\n\n\t\t\tPILOT\n\tI CAN'T IT'LL DITCH!\n\nSykes' outreached hand stretches up from the water, but\nthe skid is just too high.  Jetson has no alternative, and\nhe does the bravest thing he has ever done.  He moves out\nonto the narrow helicopter skid.  Hanging on, three feet\nabove the water, he reaches down for Sykes' up reaching\nhand.\n\nThe fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from\neach other... Jetson stretches farther, farther... and the\ntwo hands meet!  Jetson winces from the pain of the\nseawater on Sykes' hand.  He starts pulling Sykes up.\nWhen--\n\nHARCOURT'S HEAD BREAKS THE SURFACE A FOOT FROM SYKES'\nFACE.  His eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly\ngone.  The nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto Sykes,\nbreaking his grip from Jetson's, and dragging him under\nagain.\n\nJetson is frantic.  He keeps waiting -- but this time\nSykes doesn't come up.  Jetson doesn't know what to do.\nFinally -- he leans down as far as he can, his face a foot\nfrom the water, SCREAMS to block the pain, and plunges his\nown arm below the surface!  He feels around, gets hold of\nsomething, and pulls.  It is Sykes' wrist.  He pulls hard,\nbringing the sputtering Sykes up out of the water.\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\t\t   (to Pilot)\n\tTake it up!\n\nThe Pilot does.  Sykes comes up out of the water.  His\nfeet are just clear of the surface when -- Harcourt's hand\nand arm rocket out of the water, grabbing Sykes' ankle.\nSykes looks down in horror.  The helicopter keeps moving\nup, and before Harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm\ntears away from the torso at the shoulder.  Sykes wildly\nshakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it\nfalls back into the water below.\n\nJetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it\nmoves off toward shore.\n\n\nINT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT\n\nSykes plops on the floor, soaked, battered, holding his\nlimp arm.  Jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket,\nwrapping the dry part around his own arm, wincing in pain.\nThe Pilot stare down at the circle of water where they\njust pulled Sykes from.\n\n\t\t\tPILOT\n\tWhat the hell was that down there?\n\tIt was weird.\n\nJetson looks at Sykes, wondering if he will say.  Sykes\nlooks at Jetson a long moment, then--\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tLooked like every other damn slag to\n\tme.  Just plain ugly.\n\nDespite the pain, Jetson smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\t LONG DISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT.  CHURCH ANTEROOM - DAY\n\nWe are CLOSE on Sykes, who is having a hell of a time,\ntrying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling.  A\nPAIR OF ALIEN ARMS reach into FRAME to help him.  One of\nthe alien arms is also in a sling.\n\nANGLE WIDENS to reveal the alien is Jetson.  Both men wear\ntuxedos.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tHow do I look?\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tYou look very good.\n\nThere's a knock at the door.  Sykes opens it.  There\nstands Sykes' daughter, KRISTIN, twenty years old, looking\nradiant in her wedding dress.  She is in a foyer, and\nbehind her is the interior of the church with all the\nassembled guests, including Mrs. Jetson & son.\n\n\t\t\tKRISTIN\n\tReady, Daddy...?\n\nSykes' heart melts.  Before moving to the door:\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\tGeorge, uh... I want to apologize\n\tnow, in advance, for all the rotten\n\tthings I'll ever say or do to you\n\tover the years.\n\nSykes moves to join his daughter.  As he does:\n\n\t\t\tJETSON\n\tThat is all right, Matthew.  After\n\tall, you are only human.\n\nSykes, caught off guard, has to laugh.\n\n\t\t\tSYKES\n\t\t   (under his breath)\n\tWhat a wildman...\n\nSykes takes his daughter's arm and the two of them start\ndown the aisle.\n\n\t\t\t\t    FADE OUT.\n\n\t\t\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlien Nation\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Rockne O'Bannon\u00a0\u00a0James Cameron\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:18:57.926477"}
