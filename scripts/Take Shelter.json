A\r\n          strong wind bends them back, showing their light green\r\n          bellies.\r\n\r\n          This is a modest house in a row of modest houses. Propane\r\n          tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to\r\n          be more rural than suburb.\r\n\r\n          CURTIS LAFORCHE(35) stands in his driveway. His eyes, locked\r\n          on the sky, narrow as he stares at...\r\n\r\n          A STORM CELL stretching out on the horizon in front of him.\r\n          It's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and\r\n          gray clouds. They swirl in and out of one another sending\r\n          wispy tentacles toward the ground.\r\n\r\n          Curtis stands, awestruck.\r\n\r\n          The clouds move fast overhead. He looks up as they overtake\r\n          his position. A light rain begins.\r\n\r\n          The rain pats the ground. It makes soft indentions on his\r\n          cotton shirt. He watches it hit the concrete, falling harder\r\n          now. He notices something strange.\r\n\r\n          The rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. He pulls his\r\n          shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. He holds his\r\n          palm out flat in front of him. The rain pools.\r\n\r\n          He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. It's an\r\n          amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil.\r\n\r\n          Curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now.\r\n          Jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. The wind bends\r\n          back the trunk of the maple tree.\r\n\r\n          Curtis stands alone at the base of the surging STORM CELL.\r\n\r\n<b>          TITLE: TAKE SHELTER\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          INT.

He holds up his hand and studies\r\n          the falling rain. It's the thick, amber colored liquid.\r\n          With Hannah in his arms, Curtis watches, awestruck, as wispy\r\n          tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of THREE\r\n          TORNADOS out in the field.\r\n          Behind them, Red's teeth fray the rope at his collar.

It takes a moment for him to\r\n          find his bearings.\r\n          His breathing slows. He gently rubs his hand over the skin\r\n          on his arm.

He\r\n          stares at her, on the verge of breaking down.\r\n          She takes her hand and gently pulls his head down to her\r\n          shoulder. Without another look toward the crowd, Samantha\r\n          leads her family out of the dining hall.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          EXT.

She watches her father\r\n          fiddle with re-installing the alternator. His fingers\r\n          covered in grease.\r\n          Hannah steps down from the toolbox and walks into the front\r\n          yard. Curtis pauses, hearing a high-pitched, warbling SOUND\r\n          in the distance.

He turns away from the birds to see a STORM\r\n          CELL building on the opposite horizon. He scoops Hannah into\r\n          his arms, stepping back from it.\r\n          The SOUND of the birds grows louder. Curtis pivots to find\r\n          the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him. He\r\n          turns away as the wall of birds crash past him. The force so\r\n          powerful it knocks him backward.\r\n          He covers Hannah's head, dodging the onslaught of wind and\r\n          wings. The Flock passes.

The Tornado Sirens continue.\r\n          Curtis, Hannah in his arms and Samantha close behind, exits\r\n          the back of the house and heads to the storm shelter. He\r\n          passes Hannah to Samantha and fumbles with the padlock keys.\r\n          At the doors to the shelter, Samantha holds her robe up to\r\n          shield Hannah from the hail.

Tears shake from\r\n          his trembling face.\r\n\r\n<b>                          SAMANTHA\r\n</b>           I love you, but if I open the door,\r\n           then nothin's gonna change. You'll\r\n           see that everything's fine, but\r\n           nothing will change. Please. This\r\n           is what it means to stay with us.\r\n           This is something you have to do.\r\n          He looks at Hannah, then Samantha. Curtis steadies himself,\r\n          trying to control his flinching. He wipes his face with the\r\n          back of his hands and takes a deep breath.\r\n          Curtis walks toward the doors. On the steps, he reaches up\r\n          to the padlock. The keys shake in his fingers. He turns to\r\n          Samantha.\r\n\r\n<b>                          CURTIS\r\n</b>           Could you move Hannah back?\r\n\r\n<b>           88.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n          Samantha picks Hannah up in her arms and Curtis watches them\r\n          retreat to the rear wall.\r\n          He goes back to the lock. He inserts the key. The padlock\r\n          pops open. Curtis removes it. He looks back at Samantha,\r\n          then flings open the doors.\r\n\r\n<b>          SUNLIGHT.\r\n</b>          It's blinding. Curtis holds his hand up to cover his eyes.\r\n          He stares up at a crystal blue sky. Samantha watches as\r\n          Curtis steps out of the shelter.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS\r\n</b>\r\n          Curtis rises through the storm shelter's entryway. Out of\r\n          the corner of his eye he catches,\r\n\r\n<b>          A MAN PASSING BY.\r\n</b>          Curtis is startled. He turns to see a CREW of MEN from the\r\n          power company hoisting a ladder onto the pole at the corner\r\n          of the house. A power line dangles overhead.\r\n          He turns to see NEIGHBORS in their yards clearing debris.\r\n          Leaves and branches clutter the ground. The aftermath of a\r\n          storm.\r\n          Samantha steps out of the shelter holding Hannah. She\r\n          surveys the damage.\r\n\r\n<b>                          CURTIS\r\n</b>           It's fine.\r\n          She walks over to Curtis and hugs him. He kisses Samantha on\r\n          the head. Curtis looks up at the sky.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          INT. PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          Curtis sits with Samantha in the plush office of a\r\n          PSYCHIATRIST(56). Curtis rubs his hand over the soft leather\r\n          upholstery on the couch.\r\n\r\n<b>                          PSYCHIATRIST\r\n</b>           Do you have any vacation time that\r\n           you could use?\r\n\r\n<b>                          CURTIS\r\n</b>           I don't have a job right now.\r\n\r\n<b>                          PSYCHIATRIST\r\n</b>           Well, I know that times are hard,\r\n           but I think it's really important\r\n           for you to separate yourself from\r\n           that storm shelter.\r\n\r\n<b>                          (MORE)\r\n</b>\r\n<b>           89.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                          PSYCHIATRIST (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           I think you need to break away from\r\n           it for awhile. We can start you on\r\n           some medication that I think will\r\n           help, but that action alone would\r\n           mean a lot.\r\n\r\n<b>                          SAMANTHA\r\n</b>           We usually go on a trip to Myrtle\r\n           Beach every summer.

It would\r\n           give you all some time to prepare\r\n           as a family, but I want to be\r\n           clear, when Curtis gets back he'll\r\n           need to take more time than that.\r\n\r\n<b>                          SAMANTHA\r\n</b>           What does that mean?\r\n\r\n<b>                          PSYCHIATRIST\r\n</b>           I mean that he'll need hands on\r\n           therapy at a real facility.\r\n          Curtis looks up for the first time.\r\n\r\n<b>                          CURTIS\r\n</b>           You mean I have to leave my family.\r\n\r\n<b>                          PSYCHIATRIST\r\n</b>           I think you need to seriously\r\n           commit to some treatment.\r\n          Curtis processes this. Samantha takes his hand.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. BEACH/CONDO - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          Curtis scoops handfuls of sand out of a foot deep hole on the\r\n          beach. He slops the wet mixture into a castle shaped bucket,\r\n          his back to the shoreline of gentle, breaking waves.\r\n\r\n<b>                          CURTIS\r\n</b>           (signing and speaking)\r\n           Hey. Good, huh?\r\n          Hannah sits on her knees in front of Curtis sprinkling dry\r\n          sand over castle shaped mounds already formed.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          INT.

CONDO/BEACH - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          The wooden deck hangs off the back of the beach condo. A\r\n          picnic table is set with plastic place mats and forks. WIND\r\n          lifts the corner of a stack of napkins. The wind blows\r\n          harder, fanning the napkins off the table.\r\n\r\n<b>          ON THE BEACH,\r\n</b>          Curtis, still working in the sand, puts a top on the sand\r\n          castle.\r\n\r\n<b>                          CURTIS\r\n</b>           Good. We put a top on it.\r\n          Curtis smooths out the sand in the castle shaped bucket and\r\n          turns it over to top off their sand mound. He hands the\r\n          bucket over for Hannah to refill.\r\n          The SOUND of the waves behind them has STOPPED. They don't\r\n          notice.\r\n          Curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the\r\n          sand castle.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis looks up ready to sign the letters but sees Hannah\r\n          staring at the water. She looks at him and signs something\r\n          with her hands.\r\n\r\n<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           What is it honey?\r\n          Curtis misses it. He shakes his head, \"no\", and Hannah signs\r\n          again, slowly: \"S-T-O-R-M\".\r\n\r\n<b>                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           What?\r\n          Curtis turns to the shoreline, getting to his feet.\r\n          He looks down at Hannah, who watches, mesmerized. Scared,\r\n          she looks to her father. He grabs her under the arms and\r\n          rests her on his hip. She buries her head into his chest.\r\n\r\n<b>          AT THE CONDO,\r\n</b>          A gust of wind greets Samantha as she walks out onto the deck\r\n          holding a plate of hotdogs and a bowl of chili. She stops,\r\n          seeing the horizon. Her mouth falls open.\r\n          She slowly sets the plate and bowl down on the table, her\r\n          mind racing. She looks down at Curtis in disbelief.\r\n\r\n<b>           91.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis looks up to the Condo and makes eye contact. He\r\n          studies her face.\r\n          Samantha looks at her husband, trying to process it all. She\r\n          looks out at the horizon then back down to Curtis. Concern\r\n          on her face, she nods to him.\r\n          Curtis sees her nod.\r\n          Samantha's eyes, still locked on Curtis, soften, as if to\r\n          apologize. After a moment, she mouths to him, \"I love you.\"\r\n          Curtis nods back to her.\r\n          She looks back up to the shoreline.\r\n\r\n<b>          ON THE BEACH,\r\n</b>          Curtis' feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the condo.\r\n\r\n<b>          AT THE CONDO,\r\n</b>          Samantha hasn't moved from the porch. A light rain begins to\r\n          fall. Her hands grip the railing. She turns her left palm\r\n          up. Dark rain collects there.\r\n\r\n<b>          ON THE HORIZON IN FRONT OF HER,\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          THE WATER HAS RECEDED INTO THE GULF SOME 100 YARDS.
