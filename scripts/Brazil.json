CITYSCAPE                         SUNSET           1\n\n    A beautiful golden sun is setting. The sky is on fire. The\n    CAMERA starts to move downwards. A large neon sign rises\n    into shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the\n    frame. The building is neither past nor future in design\n    but a bit of both.\n    \n    Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads\n    below ... A glittering conglomeration of elevated\n    transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely\n    huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule\n    relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level\n    awnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... Transparent\n    tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an\n    elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of\n    large transport lorries passes thru frame. As we descend,\n    the sunlight is blocked out and street lights & neon signs\n    take over as illumination. Eventually we reach the upper\n    levels of a plush shopping precinct.\n\n2   INT.   SHOPPING PRECINT                  NIGHT            2\n    \n    Xmas decorations are everywhere. PEOPLE are busy buying,\n    ogling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on\n    display. SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly\n    packaged goods ... the shop windows are full of\n    elaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what. In one\n    window is a bank of TV sets - on the great majority of the\n    screens is the face of MR. HELPMANN - the Deputy Minister\n    of Information. He is being interviewed. No-one bothers to\n    listen to HELPMANN.\n\n                          INTERVIEWER\n               Deputy minister, what do you believe\n               is behind this recent increase in\n               terrorist bombings?\n\n                           HELPMANN\n               Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless\n               minority of people seems to have\n               forgotten certain good old fashioned\n               virtues. They just can't stand seeing\n               the other fellow win. If these people\n               would just play the game, instead of\n               standing on the touch line heckling -\n\n                          INTERVIEWER\n               In fact, killing people -\n\n                           HELPMANN\n               - In fact, killing people - they'd\n               get a lot more out of life.\n\n    We PULL AWAY from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers.\n    HELPMANN's voice carries over the rest of the scene.\n\n                          INTERVIEWER\n               Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to\n               those critics who maintain that the\n               Ministry Of Information has become\n               too large and unwieldy ...?\n\n                           HELPMANN\n               David ... in a free society\n               information is the name of the game.\n               You can't win the game if you're a\n               man short.\n\n    Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be\n    banks of snow but as we pan along with them the \"snow\"\n    turns out to be fire-fighting foam. It oozes out of a shop\n    front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames.\n    WORKMEN are busily sealing the opening with plywood\n    sheets, SHOPPERS pay no attention to this. Xmas carols are\n    being played by a Salvation Army style band calling\n    themselves Consumers For Christ. Santa Claus's grotto is\n    busy, all is well with the world.\n\n                          INTERVIEWER\n               And the cost of it all, Deputy\n               Minister? Seven percent of the gross\n               national produce ...\n\n                           HELPMANN\n               I understand this concern on behalf\n               of the tax-payers. People want value\n               for money and a cost-effective\n               service.\n\n3   INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT            3\n\n    CUT TO TV screen with HELPMANN still talking.\n\n                           HELPMANN\n               That is why we always insist on the\n               principle of Information Retrieval\n               Charges. These terrorists are not\n               pulling their weight, and it's\n               absolutely right and fair that those\n               found guilty should pay for their\n               periods of detention and the\n               Information Retrieval Procedures used\n               in their interrogation.\n\n    PULL BACK to reveal a rather clinical office. The TV rests\n    on a desk. A WHITE COATED TECHNICIAN is sorting out his in-\n    tray. Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork. He\n    comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open, to\n    discover a shiny, metal \"executive toy\".\n\n    CUT TO the BEETLE droning up near the ceiling.\n\n    The TECHNICIAN is disturbed by the buzz of the BEETLE as\n    it whirrs around the fluorescent light. He rolls up some\n    paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect.\n\nScenes 4-12 Deleted.                              4-12 Deleted.\n\n13  INT.   OFFICE                            NIGHT           13\n    \n    The TECHNICIAN gets up and balances a chair on top of his\n    desk. He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the BEETLE\n    still buzzing about the room just out of reach. Beneath\n    him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away\n    compiling a typed list of names under the heading\n    \"Information Retrieval, Subjects For Detention &\n    Interview\". The machine is being fed from a spool of paper\n    which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic\n    guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate\n    sheet, with the title above each name, each sheet\n    following its predecessor into a holding basket. In CLOSE-\n    UP we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in\n    the holding basket: TONSTED, Simon ... TOPPER, Martin F.\n    ... TROLLOPE, Benjamin G. ... TURB, William K. ... TURNER,\n    John D. ... Every name begins with T.\n\n                          INTERVIEWER\n               Do you think that the government is\n               winning the battle against\n               terrorists?\n\n                           HELPMANN\n               On yes. Our morale is much higher\n               than theirs, we're fielding all their\n               strokes, running a lot of them out,\n               and pretty consistently knocking them\n               for six. I'd say they're nearly out\n               of the game.\n               \n    The TECHNICIAN is tottering on one leg on the chair on the\n    desk as he strains to swat the BEETLE. Swish, swash, oops,\n    WHAP! Gottcha!!\n\n                          INTERVIEWER\n               But the bombing campaign is now in\n               its thirteenth year ...\n\n                           HELPMANN\n               Beginner's luck.\n\n    The BEETLE's career comes to a halt ... squashed flat on\n    the brilliantly clean ceiling ... or has it? As the\n    TECHNICIAN clambers down from the rickety heights, the\n    BEETLE's carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops\n    silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs,\n    hesitates and then types the letter \"B\" and hesitates and\n    then continues so that the next name is BUTTLE, Archibald.\n\n    The TECHNICIAN fails to notice this and the machine\n    continues smoothly TUTWOOD, Thomas T. ... TUZCZLOW,\n    Peter...\n\n                          INTERVIEWER\n               Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.\n\n                           HELPMANN\n               Thank you, David ... and a very merry\n               Christmas to you all.\n\n14  EXT.   HOUSING TOWERS                    NIGHT           14\n    \n    ZOOMING past foreground outdoor Xmas decorations we\n    TIGHTEN in on one of several massive residential tower\n    blocks that loom over what appears to be a poorer part of\n    the city\n\n15  INT.   BUTTLE FLAT                       NIGHT           15\n    \n    HELPMANN and INTERVIEWER are on the TV, the end credits\n    rolling over them to the beat of a Mozart theme tune.\n    PULLING BACK we reveal that the TV is in a conventional\n    sitting room, conventionally decorated for Christmas; out\n    the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that\n    snake unpleasantly across and through the walls. Smaller\n    conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various\n    services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the\n    metal) supply to this household. A conventionally poor but\n    proud family occupies the room. MRS BUTTLE is reading\n    Dickens' Christmas Carol to GIRL BUTTLE who is about six.\n    BOY BUTTLE plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some\n    action men dressed in security gear. MR. BUTTLE is putting\n    the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present\n    which looks identical to the \"executive toy\" we have just\n    seen in he TECHNICIAN'S office.\n\n    Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter. A tilt of\n    the CAMERA indicates that the laughter is coming from the\n    floor above.\n\n16  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       NIGHT           16\n\n    The flat is very bare and basic. The laughter is coming\n    from a cheap portable television showing \"Sgt. Bilko. From\n    BILKO'S POV we look through an open door of a bathroom\n    straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the\n    person in the bath to watch the TV. The person in the bath\n    is JILL LAYTON, washing the grime off herself while she\n    watches Bilko in the mirror. From her POV in the mirror,\n    the T.V. screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body\n    of a MAN in uniform.\n\n                             JILL\n                    (scared)\n               Who's there?\n\n17  INT.   BUTTLE'S FLAT                     NIGHT           17\n    \n    The BUTTLE FAMILY as before. MRS BUTTLE is closing the\n    book.\n\n                          MRS BUTTLE\n               There, that's enough for tonight. He\n               won't come Xmas Eve if you don't get\n               plenty of sleep.\n\n                          GIRL BUTTLE\n               Father Christmas can't come if we\n               haven't got a chimney.\n\n                          MRS BUTTLE\n               You'll see.\n\n    The GIRL exchanges goodnight kisses with her parents and\n    leaves the room.\n\n                          GIRL BUTTLE\n               How will he get down from upstairs?\n\n                          BOY BUTTLE\n               It's a secret.\n\n    We follow GIRL BUTTLE out of the sitting room into ...\n\n18  INT.   HALLWAY AND CHILDREN'S BEDROOM    NIGHT           18\n\n    GIRL BUTTLE enters her bedroom. There is little or no\n    light there, and she sees a bulky figure apparently\n    lowering himself into the room from the direction of the\n    ceiling.\n\n                          GIRL BUTTLE\n                    (unalarmed)\n               You've come ...\n\n    As she moves, the light from the hallway shows us the\n    figure of what looks like a commando on a night raid,\n    slowly sliding down a pole in he middle of the room. The\n    pole at the top end disappears through a hole in the\n    ceiling. Things become immediately clearer\n\n19  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING-ROOM               NIGHT           19\n\n    Crash! It's a raid! Battle-dressed SECURITY TROOPS smash\n    trough the door. Another ONE, swings from a rope, kicks in\n    the window from the outside and enters that way. Most\n    alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the\n    ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and\n    through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide\n    TWO MORE SECURITY TROOPS. The whole thing is short, brutal\n    and violent.\n    \n    BUTTLE is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike\n    canvas device that covers him from head to waist. A metal\n    clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back\n    of the bag. His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar. In\n    seconds he has become a canvas parcel. Meanwhile, GIRL\n    BUTTLE has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into\n    the lap of her screaming mother. BOY BUTTLE has his toy\n    machine gun knocked out of his hands by a TROOPER who we\n    see is identical in dress to the action men BOY BUTTLE has\n    been playing with. He rushes to his mother as guns are\n    viciously trained on them. TROOPS are kicking open the\n    doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job. An\n    OFFICIAL, wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front\n    door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an\n    official document. It goes something like this:\n\n                           OFFICIAL\n               I hereby inform you under powers\n               entrusted to me under Section 47,\n               Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number\n               438476, that Mr Buttle, Archibald,\n               residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri\n               La Towers, has been invited to assist\n               the Ministry of Information with\n               certain enquiries, the nature of\n               which may be ascertained on\n               completion of application form\n               BZ/ST/486/C fourteen days within this\n               date, and that he is liable to\n               certain obligations as specified in\n               Council Order 173497, including\n               financial restitutions which may or\n               may not be incurred if Information\n               Retrieval procedures beyond those\n               incorporated in Article 7 subsections\n               8, 10 & 32 are required to elicit\n               information leading to permanent\n               arrest - notification of which will\n               he served with the time period of 5\n               working days as stipulated by law.

To\n    his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the\n    flat below.\n                            CHARLIE\n               Bloody typical, they've gone back to\n               metric without telling us\n               \n\n20a INT.   BUTTLES' FLAT                     NIGHT          20a\n    \n    MRS BUTTLE stands stunned in the middle of her decimated\n    flat. The KIDS wail. Slowly MRS BUTTLE collapses -\n    slumping to the floor with the receipt in her hand: we\n    tighten into CLOSE UP of \"Receipt\".\n\n                       JILL (off CAMERA)\n               Mrs Buttle? Mrs Buttle?\n\n21  INT.   RECORD CLERK'S POOL                               21\n    \n    We come in on a CLOSE UP of a pink version of the RECEIPT\n    being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we PULL OUT to\n    reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal\n    desks, each desk with a built-in T.V. console, and each\n    (except one) occupied by a CLERK. Every desk is snowed\n    under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in\n    the previous scene. More pacers are delivered to each desk\n    intermittently by way of pneumatic tube. OFFICE BOYS\n    bustle about with even more paperwork. From the back of\n    the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs,\n    tabulations, figures ... All of this activity is\n    supervised from an elevated walkway by MR KURTZMAN.\n    Satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and\n    walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top\n    of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door.\n\n    MR KURTZMAN goes through this door and as he closes it\n    behind him, all activity in the CLERKS pool ceases. each\n    CLERK adjusts his T.V. screen with the flick of a switch,\n    and all the screens change to something which looks very\n    like \"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\".\n\n22  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             22\n    \n    MR KURTZMAN also has a T.V. console. He sits behind his\n    desk, reaches for his In-tray, and without looking at the\n    console he turns his screen on. He looks through a number\n    of files in his In-tray. He is surprised to hear a VOICE\n    say, \"Turn around real slow, amigo\". MR KURTZMAN turns\n    around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his\n    T.V. console with a large fist, and the screen obediently\n    flicks to a display of figures. He picks up a file which\n    we see as marked \"Buttle, Archibald\". He opens the file\n    and starts punching the keyboard of the console. The T.V.\n    starts bleeping in an alarmed way. MR KURTZMAN is puzzled.\n    He punches more figures. The screen starts to flash\n    \"Error, error, error\". MR KURTZMAN sighs with frustration.\n    He presses an intercom.\n                          MR KURTZMAN\n                    (into intercom)\n               Mr Lowry, will you step in here\n               please?\n               \n    He returns his attention, puzzled to the file. Nobody\n    comes into the office. MR KURTZMAN gets up and walks over\n    to his door and opens it. Beyond the door the room full of\n    CLERKS is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and\n    whirring consoles. From MR KURTZMAN'S POV we see that in\n    the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk.\n\n                          MR KURTZMAN\n               Does anyone know where Lowry is?\n\n    Nobody knows. MR KURTZMAN closes his door again. A moment\n    later it seems to him, and to us, that he has heard the\n    crash of six guns blazing away at each other. He re-opens\n    the door. The only sound again. He goes back to his desk.\n    He punches a few keys. The machine starts emitting even\n    more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then \"Admit\n    you're whupped, you drygulching scum\". KURTZMAN explodes\n    with anger, and presses the intercom again.\n\n                          MR KURTZMAN\n                    (Shouting into intercom)\n               Where the hell is Sam Lowry?!\n\n23  EXT.   SKY                               DAY             23\n    \n    CUT TO brilliantly clear sky. From on high an odd bird-\n    like figure swoops down on the CAMERA. As it comes closer\n    we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange wood\n    and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their\n    flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect.\n    Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an\n    outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI\n    fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then,\n    banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice\n    can be heard calling \"Sam ... Sam ... Sam\". He hovers,\n    looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO\n    face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised\n    twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her\n    face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly\n    mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft\n    billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rises\n    and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA\n    GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that\n    the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast\n    landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the\n    sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial\n    ballet.\n    \n    Romantic music fills the soundtrack.\n    \n    SAM swoops up and away. The GIRL floats in the distance as\n    SAM. rises in the foreground. She beckons to him. SAM\n    begins to flap back towards her. But then the dreamy\n    quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening\n    rumble. SAM looks down.\n    \n    The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive,\n    monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and\n    soars upwards with a mighty rush.\n    \n    CUT to the GIRL in LONG SHOT. The monolith rises up into\n    FRAME partially cutting her off from view.\n    \n    Before SAM can do anything, another stone skyscraper\n    breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. Then another\n    and another. There is nothing SAM can do. The GIRL is\n    being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless\n    structures. And then she is finally lost from view\n    somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis.\n    SAM lies closer. The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid.\n    No windows. No doors. Nothing whatsoever to interfere with\n    their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. As he flies among\n    these towering blocks he sees no sign of the GIRL, only\n    sheer walls rising high above him. Below him the walls\n    plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. No sound\n    but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in\n    this dead place. Coming round a corner he sees something\n    in the distance. far below him a dark procession is\n    wending its way through the narrow passages... away from\n    him.\n    \n    CUT TO LOW ANGLE SHOT of the procession making its way\n    past the CAMERA. Black-robed and cowled, the sinister\n    figures look like heavily armed monks. These are the\n    FORCES OF DARKNESS. Together they are straining at several\n    heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal\n    cage floating above and behind the procession. Binding the\n    cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached. Inside\n    is the GIRL - still enveloped in gossamer which billows as\n    if there were a breeze in constant attendance.\n    \n    CUT TO SAM as He dives out of shot.\n    \n    CUT to the FORCES OF DARKNESS suddenly stopping in their\n    tracks. They've seen something.\n    \n    CUT to their POV. There at the end of the passage between\n    two stone skyscrapers stands SAM ... barring the way.\n    \n    CUT to swords being unsheathed. Cowls being thrown back.\n    Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces. All the faces\n    are the same except for the manner in which they have\n    decayed. They smile - slobbering, sickeningly. Suddenly\n    the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become\n    long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others\n    shrinking. From the folds of cloth come evil weapons. The\n    FORCES are massed ready to charge.\n    CUT to long shot of SAM. He removes his arms from his\n    wings and folds the wings behind him. He is ready.\n    \n    Cut to the FORCES. Nothing moves ... except for the\n    constant dribble from their cracked mouths.\n\n    CUT back to SAM. Stillness. The tension is unbearable.\n    Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the\n    fearsome horde. Unarmed!\n\n    CUT to the FORCES thundering down to SAM. Weapons flailing\n    madly.\n\n    SAM skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading\n    field, and karate chops him senseless - at the same time\n    catching his sword as he falls. Spinning around he parries\n    a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker. Slash! Hack!\n    Stab! He lays waste to the FORCES. Nothing can stop this\n    boy. The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing\n    of SAM's sword. Wham! Bam! Smash! SAM carves his way\n    through the mob with nary a scratch. And then, suddenly,\n    they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate\n    SAM's prowess. The GIRL is beaming as SAM makes his way\n    toward the hawsers holding the cage. But then a noise\n    behind him makes him turn. There, behind him the pile of\n    black shapes begin to rise. The ropes become a mass of\n    flapping black cloth. This evil churning cloud coalesces\n    and lifts off the ground. The horrible flapping apparition\n    emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away. SAM\n    is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is\n    stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing. He looks\n    around - confused.\n\n24  INT.   SAM'S BEDROOM                     MORNING         24\n\n    TIGHT SHOT of telephone. The ringing continues. A hand\n    grapples with the receiver. SAM is in bed in a darkened\n    room. Sleepily he drags receiver to his ear.\n\n                              SAM\n               Hello ... What ... what? Oh ... Mr\n               Kurtzman! ... You're up late. Oh, is\n               it?\n\n    There is an electronic box of tricks by his bed,\n    incorporating an alarm. SAM thumps it. The alarm goes off.\n    This sets of a series of other things ... The window\n    shutters roll up letting in the morning light. Both taps\n    turn on in the bathroom ...\n\n                              SAM\n                    (into phone)\n               The electronics here are up the\n               spout. Yours too, sir? Don't worry\n               sir - I'll be there.\n\n    SAM puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is\n    moving towards him. Noticing one of his film posters is\n    loose he pushes the pin in firmly.\n    \n    In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up. In the sitting\n    room the television switches on. Back in the bedroom a\n    cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with\n    SAM's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on. SAM\n    comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath\n    taps, and starts to get dressed. In the kitchen the coffee-\n    maker has finished making s small pot of coffee. SAM pours\n    a quick cup and is gone at the door. Throughout all this\n    we have had a chance to get a glimpse of SAM's flat. It is\n    functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been\n    assembled with a loving hand. Most of the furnishings are\n    built in. The walls are divided into two-foot square metal\n    panels painted a non-committal colour. Certain of the wall\n    panels have Central Services logos on them with the\n    admonition \"Do not obstruct or remove\" below. SAM has\n    livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film\n    posters. The sitting room sports several framed pictures\n    of wide beautiful vistas.\n\n25  INT.   MINISTRY OF INFORMATION LOBBY     DAY             25\n\n    This is a gigantic, vaguely 30's monumental-style\n    building. The lobby is a vast impressive space containing\n    reception desks, fountains, statues etc. Prominent are the\n    security measures, which include automatic mobile cameras,\n    video screens and groups of SECURITY MEN who search all\n    who enter. SAM is finishing going through Security when he\n    meets JACK who is on his way out of the building.\n\n                             JACK\n               Sam!\n\n                              SAM\n               Jack!\n\n                             JACK\n               Long time no see!\n\n                              SAM\n               Well, since you disappeared up the\n               ladder of Information Retrieval ... I\n               don't expect to see you slumming in\n               Records - what's the problem?\n\n                             JACK\n               Problem? - No problem - yes,\n               everything's going fantastically\n               well, wonderful, marvelous, great\n               career prospects, Alison in great\n               shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm\n               on Security Level Five now, and Mr\n               Helpmann relies on me more and more,\n               yes, couldn't be better, I feel\n               terrifically motivated and job-\n               rewarded -\n               \n                              SAM\n               You sound worried.\n\n                             JACK\n               Me? - if I'm worried about anyone,\n               it's you. What happened to you, Sam?\n               You were the brightest of us -\n\n    As they have been talking, a nearby bank of closed circuit\n    TV screens has been displaying shots of people entering\n    the lobby. As each one enters the CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT on\n    their faces for a frozen CLOSE-UP. JILL has just entered\n    and the CAMERA ZOOMS IN and freezes on her face. SAM\n    happens to glance up at this moment. He is startled - the\n    over-exposed TV image is the face of the GIRL FROM THE\n    DREAM. The face is only there a few seconds before being\n    replaced by another picture. SAM looks about to see where\n    the GIRL is, but JILL, in overalls, has her back to him as\n    she stands in the queue for the Information desk and so\n    there is no-one even vaguely reminiscent of the DREAM\n    GIRL. SAM decides he must have imagined it. Over this JACK\n    has been talking.\n\n                             JACK\n               What's the matter?\n                               \n                              SAM\n               Sorry. Nothing.\n                    (snapping out of it)\n               See you - I'm going to be late.\n\n                             JACK\n                    (looking at his watch)\n               You are late.\n\n                              SAM\n               Even later.\n\n                             JACK\n               Sam, your life is going wrong - let\n               your friends tell you - Records is a\n               dead end department, no Security\n               Level worth a damn, it's impossible\n               to get noticed -\n\n                              SAM\n               Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous,\n               wonderful - remember me to Alison -\n               and the - er - twins.\n\n                             JACK\n               Triplets.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Really? - God, how time flies!\n    \n    As SAM heads off to the lift, he passes a group of MEN\n    standing around a temporary TV monitor. Several of them\n    are dressed in white lab coats. They are being explained\n    the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman\n    type. His assistant is operating the controls. On the\n    monitor we can see JILL standing in the queue for the\n    Information desk. The CAMERA appears to he tracking in on\n    her.\n    \n    CUT TO JILL at top of queue with several forms in her\n    hand. A strange prototype radio controlled camera on a\n    wheeled base is whirring and clicking as it approaches\n    her. Throughout the next sequence it pokes around JILL in\n    an annoying manner - thrusting itself at her face, trying\n    to see what is written on the forms, peering over her\n    shoulder. JILL hands a form to the Information Porter.\n    \n                             JILL\n               I want to report a wrongful arrest.\n    \n                            PORTER\n                    (looking at form)\n               You want Information Adjustments.\n               Different department.\n    \n                             JILL\n                    (exasperated but\n                    controlled)\n               I've been to Information Adjustments.\n               They sent me here. They told me you\n               had a form I had to fill in.\n    \n                            PORTER\n               Have you got an Arrest Receipt?\n    \n                             JILL\n               Yes.\n    \n                            PORTER\n               Is it stamped?\n    \n                             JILL\n                    (producing Buttle receipt)\n               Stamped?\n    \n                            PORTER\n                    (examining receipt)\n               No, there's no stamp on it.

She swats the annoying thing with her stack\n    of forms as she storms off. The camera overbalances and\n    crashes into the desk - sparking and spluttering.\n    \n    CUTTING BACK to the GROUP around the monitor we see a\n    deeply hurt SALESMAN and several sceptical white-coated\n    TECHNICIANS.\n    \n    \n26  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             26\n    \n    SAM is busily working at the console, unraveling a problem\n    while KURTZMAN looks on anxiously and ineffectually.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               Perhaps the machine's on the blink!\n               It keeps picking up old films.

DOCTOR'S OFFICE                   DAY             27\n    \n    CUT TO an old WOMAN's face reflected in triplicate in a\n    three-panelled mirror. A pair of MAN's hands have a grip\n    on her flabby cheeks, pulling them out several inches on\n    either side of her face. When I say several inches that's\n    just what I mean. Not only are her jowls being stretched\n    like silly putty but they are also being wrapped around to\n    the back of her neck to demonstrate how tight and smooth\n    her face can be made by DOCTOR who is prattling on over\n    this freak show.\n    \n                            DOCTOR\n               Now, when you come in tomorrow, Mrs\n               Lowry, we'll make a little tuck here\n               ... and there ...\n    \n    CUT TO WIDE SHOT of DOCTOR's surgery. It looks a bit like\n    a cross between an operating theatre and a boudoir. The\n    cold steel, glass and plastic surfaces are badly disguised\n    with pastel coloured chintz and satin. At the dressing\n    table sits the old WOMAN, SAM'S MOTHER. Behind her stands\n    the DOCTOR. He is much like his surgery. He has tailored\n    his surgical garments like a gigolo's dressing gown. It\n    seems that he has done a bit of tuck-taking on himself.\n    There is a certain plastic smoothness to his skin, but all\n    in all he has been fairly successful. SAM is pacing\n    around, raving.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (angrily)\n               I just wish you would stop\n               interfering, mother!

SAM stares at her.\n    \n                              SAM\n               My God, it works.\n    \n    \n28  INT.   POSH RESTAURANT (ENTRANCE)        DAY             28\n    \n    The conversation between SAM and his MOTHER takes place\n    while they are going through the sort of security checks\n    familiar at airports. They are, however, just outside the\n    velvet rope of the posh restaurant.\n    \n                            MOTHER\n                    (in full flow)\n               Mr Helpmann was very close to your\n               poor father.

It turns out to have been activated by a\n    gaily wrapped package. A SECURITY GUARD relieves her of it\n    and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of\n    executive toy which we have seen twice before.\n    \n                            MOTHER\n               It's a present for my son.\n    \n    She takes the toy back and hands it to SAM.\n    \n                            MOTHER\n               I hope you like it.

Merry Christmas.\n    \n    He pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish. He\n    looks disdainfully at SAM's unfashionable clerk's suite\n    \n                            MOTHER\n               Hello, Spiro.

SAM and his MOTHER follow, across the\n    restaurant which is much like the Palm Court at the Plaza\n    New York. Trellises, marble columns, antique mirroring,\n    potted palms combine to impress us with their\n    sophistication and taste. A string quartet can just be\n    made out against the far wall. Except for the unfortunate\n    intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting\n    across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating\n    right through the middle of a particularly valuable-\n    looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident\n    wealth and breeding. SAM, MOTHER and MAITRE D make their\n    way across the room. The waltzing strains of the string\n    quartet accompanying them.\n    \n    CUT to group of tables with diners. At one of them sits a\n    wealthy-looking OLDER WOMAN with a rather plain-looking\n    DAUGHTER in her 20s. The OLDER WOMAN is easily\n    distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage\n    that covers a goodish part of her head. The two of them\n    (the MOTHER and DAUGHTER, not the MOTHER and bandage) are\n    perusing the menus. SAM notes the DAUGHTER, unpleased.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Mother, I thought we were going to be\n               able to talk ....

NOT EVEN DREAMS!\n    \n29  EXT.   BRILLIANT SKY                     DAY             29\n    \n    SAM as his dream-self rises INTO SHOT, his wings straining\n    as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the GIRL. They\n    are rising up and away from the monolithic stone\n    skyscrapers that stretch away below them.\n    \n                              SAM\n               I'm taking you to a safe place. A\n               place where they will never be able\n               to get at us ... ever.\n    \n    An eyeball is scanning the sky. PULLING BACK we see it is\n    but one of thousands, tightly packed side by side forming\n    a landscape that extends as far as we can see. As SAM and\n    the GIRL in her cage come into view it becomes apparent\n    just how big these eyeballs are - they are gigantic -\n    about 10 feet in diameter. All of them follow SAM as he\n    comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises\n    from the centre of this bizarre place.\n    \n                              SAM\n               There's no way they can approach us\n               without being seen. You're safe here.\n    \n    He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his\n    wings. Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a\n    terrific cracking noise is heard. SAM freezes.\n    \n    A dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere\n    beyond the horizon - running right up the sky and over the\n    camera. SAM follows it as it continues over the GIRL and\n    down to the opposite horizon. Another crackling noise is\n    heard. Another crack appears. Then another. And another.\n    All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over\n    the horizon. Soon the sky is covered with these cracks\n    from horizon to foreground. Then cracks begin appearing at\n    right angles to them. Very quickly the sky is covered with\n    a mammoth grid. Once it is complete, another noise is\n    heard. Something like massive blocks of stone sliding\n    against one another. One of the squares formed by the grid\n    pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out\n    from the back side of the sky. A square hole is left in\n    its place. We can see the sides of the hole as it extends\n    upwards into blackness. As soon as this first block of sky\n    is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away. SAM is\n    frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on\n    above him. The eyeballs are madly looking this way and\n    that. The grinding noises are deafening as block after\n    block of sky is removed. With each successive loss the\n    light decreases. The GIRL is crying out for SAM to save\n    her. Frantically SAM tries to haul the cage down to the\n    platform but it's too late.\n    \n    Where the sky was is now pitch black. Only one block of\n    sky remains. Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and\n    out of shot. Total blackness. A maniacal laughter can be\n    heard. A beam of light is switched on. SAM has a\n    searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness. The\n    laughter continues. Suddenly the beam catches something\n    black and moving. it's the same black, flapping cloth that\n    appeared at the end of the previous dream. The horrible\n    flapping thing comes thundering down on SAM.\n    \n    He is engulfed in the black awfulness.\n    \n30  INT. SAM'S BEDROOM                       NIGHT           30\n    \n    SAM is in bed, grappling with the bedclothes. He is\n    dripping with sweat and screaming. The room is\n    oppressively hot. He gets up and looks at the thermostat.\n    It reads 99. He fumbles with it, but to no avail. It's\n    stuck.\n    \n    CUT to SAM coming into the sitting room. He rushes over to\n    the window and tries to open it. But it wasn't designed to\n    be opened. Screws hold it firmly shut. SAM heads to the\n    kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the\n    window. He swings the window open and takes a deep breath.\n    GAG! COUGH! HACK! A terrible greeny-brown smog pours in\n    through the window. Desperately SAM shuts the window and\n    madly tightens up the screws. Swinging a newspaper, he\n    tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere. He\n    makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall\n    gasping for air.\n    CUT to telephone being lifted from its cradle. Pull back\n    as SAM with opened telephone directory in front of him\n    dials. He is seated in his kitchen. In front of his open\n    refrigerator. The phone rings at the other end.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (into phone)\n               Hello - Central Services - I'm at\n               579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D\n               - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures\n               Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover\n               - and I've got trouble with the air-\n               conditioning\n    \n                          PHONE VOICE\n               Thank you or calling Central\n               Services. am sorry, due to temporary\n               staff shortage, Central Services\n               cannot take service calls centrally\n               between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a\n               nice day - this has not been a\n               recording, incident-\n    \n                              SAM\n               This is an emergency!\n                               \n                          PHONE VOICE\n               Thank you for calling Central\n               Services.

The door\n    is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a\n    desperate bid to keep cool. He is nodding off. As his head\n    slumps against one of the shelves, a jar of pickled onions\n    falls to the floor. The onions scattering everywhere.\n    \n31  EXT.   DARKNESS                          NIGHT           31\n    \n    The milky white spheres tumble everywhere. But they are\n    not onions, they are the giant eyeballs burtling through\n    space. SAM is clinging desperately to one. He grabs the\n    pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch\n    cover. SAM manages to pull himself inside. Once out of the\n    intergalactic maelstrom, SAM turns to survey the cramped\n    and dark space inside the eyeball. It seems to be bisected\n    by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is\n    escaping. Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, SAM\n    is able to move a section. More light shaftes into the\n    tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a\n    small hatch. SAM scrunches down and really puts his\n    shoulder to the hatch. with a metallic rasp it gives way\n    and SAM crashes through.\n    \n    CUT to other side of opening as SAM topples through. He\n    catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms\n    back revealing his close call with disaster. He is high on\n    a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. The hatch\n    he came through was the front of one of the millions of\n    files-drawers composing this wall. As he scrambles back\n    into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for\n    hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. Other\n    walls of files enclose this vast space. From where SAM is\n    it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time\n    Life building in NYC. These millions of files are being\n    tended by MEN arising themselves up and down, as well as\n    sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms.\n    The attendants are seen putting PEOPLE in different period\n    costumes into drawers. SAM's attention is distracted by a\n    sound overhead. Looking up he sees a window washer\n    platform being lowered in his direction. Leaning over the\n    side is a JOLLY GENT, who happens to look like MR HELPMANN\n    (as seen on TV).\n    \n                             GENT\n               Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.\n    \n                              SAM\n               What?

He\n    reaches inside.\n    \n    The GENT pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet.\n    \n                             GENT\n               This is the Sword Of Truth ... and\n               this the Helmet Of Justice.\n    \n    As SAM begins to strap on the weapon the GENT brings out a\n    cape.\n    \n                             GENT\n               And this. completes the outfit.\n    \n    He puts the cape around SAM's shoulders and helps him step\n    into the drawer. A moment's hesitation and then SAM outs\n    the helmet on and lies down in the drawer. It fits just\n    like a coffin.. As he lies back the GENT pushes the drawer\n    in.\n    \n                             GENT\n               It won't be pleasant but, trust me.\n    \n    As the drawer is pushed in SAM suffers a sudden bout of\n    claustrophobia. Looking up at the diministing opening he\n    is surprised to see - not the face of the JOLLY GENT - but\n    a terrifying SAMURAI WARRIOR's masked helmet. SAM\n    struggles to prevent the drawer being closed.\n    \n32  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT           32\n    \n    SAM is grabbing the walls of the fridge. Water from the\n    defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head. He wakes\n    up. Before he can really take in where he is the phone\n    rings. He staggers over to it.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Hello ... hello ...\n    \n                          PHONE VOICE\n               Hello.

Who is this?\n    \n    SAM realises that the voice is also in the room behind\n    him. He turns round and sees TUTTLE. TUTTLE is middle-\n    aged, a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes\n    suggesting a cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid\n    commando. In one hand he holds a gun pointed at SAM. The\n    other hand is holding a telephone receiver which TUTTLE is\n    in the act of placing in the large capacious bag at his\n    feet. SAM puts down his phone, and his hands up.\n    \n                            TUTTLE\n               Nice and easy now. Keep your hands\n               where I can see them.\n    \n                              SAM\n               What is this?\n                    (indignantly)\n               Who the hell are you?\n    \n    TUTTLE, keeping the gun on SAM, goes to different doors,\n    leaning backwards into bedroom, bathroom and closet.\n    \n    TUTTLE suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun.\n    \n                            TUTTLE\n               Harry Tuttle.

I've had\n               traps set for me before now. There\n               are people in Central Services who'd\n               love to get their hands on Harry\n               Tuttle.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Are you saying this is illegal?\n    \n    By now TUTTLE has managed to pull out some sections of\n    flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal\n    behind the removed panel. It is all very complicated and\n    greasy and it looks as though there is a lot more where\n    that came from. TUTTLE is amazingly neat and deft as he\n    works. A real pro. As he works he hums a wee tune ... yes\n    ... BRAZIL!!\n    \n                            TUTTLE\n               Well, yes ... and no.

At the next desk\n    is another CLERK much like SAM, his NEIGHBOUR.\n    \n                           NEIGHBOUR\n               I think Kurtzman getting is\n               suspicious.\n    \n                              SAM\n               What have we got on today?\n    \n                           NEIGHBOUR\n               Casablanca.\n    \n    KURTZMAN appears in his doorway.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n                    (calls out)\n               Mr Lowry! Would you step in here a\n               moment please.\n    \n    We go with KURTZMAN as he closes the office door behind\n    him, we are now in ...\n    \n    \n34  INT.   KURTZMAN'S OFFICE                 DAY             34\n    \n    KURTZMAN is pacing anxiously. SAM walks into the office.\n    During the brief opening and closing of the door we just\n    manage to hear the piano player in \"Casablanca\" singing,\n    \"... a kiss is just a kiss ...\". KURTZMAN is too worried\n    to notice. He is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if\n    it were contagious. He waves it frantically as SAM enters.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n                    (hysterically)\n               Thank God you're here! We're in\n               terrible trouble! Look at this! Look\n               at this!\n    \n    He thrusts the piece of paper at Sam.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (taking the paper)\n               A cheque.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               The refund for Tuttle!\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (startled)\n               Tuttle?\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion\n               from the word go! He's been wrongly\n               charged for Electromemorytherapy and\n               someone somewhere is trying to make\n               us carry the can!\n    \n                              SAM\n               I've never seen a Ministry cheque\n               before.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               We've got to get rid of it! There's\n               been a balls-up somewhere, and when\n               the music stops they'll jump on\n               whoever's holding the cheque!\n    \n                              SAM\n               Send it to somebody else. Send it to\n               Buttle. It's his cheque.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               I've tried that! Population Census\n               have got him down as dormanted, the\n               Central Collective Storehouse\n               computer has got him down as deleted,\n               and the Information Retrieval have\n               got him down as inoperative ...\n               Security has him down as excised.,\n               Admin have him down as completed\n    \n                              SAM\n               Hang on.\n    \n    SAM sits down at the console and punches keys. He does\n    this very efficiently, muttering to himself and generally\n    demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves KURTZMAN\n    way out of his depth, until -\n    \n                              SAM\n               He is dead.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll\n               never get rid of the damned thing!\n               What are we going to do?\n    \n                              SAM\n               Try next of kin.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n                    (a revelation)\n               Next of kin!\n    \n    SAM punches more keys.\n    \n                              SAM\n               There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle.\n               What's the number on the cheque?\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n                    (reading it)\n               27156789/074328/K.\n    \n    SAM has been efficiently punching this in.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Into memory. Now ... Central Banking\n               ... Buttle, Veronica ... Deposit\n    \n    SAM rips off a print out, rapidly stuffs it and the cheque\n    into a cannister and then into a vacuum tube. A job well\n    done.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n                    (fervently)\n               Please don't come back! Please don't\n               come back!\n    \n    Unfortunately KURTZMAN's prayers are not answered and the.\n    vacuum tube returns almost immediately. SAM opens it up.\n    From the computer screen comes a voice \"Play it again,\n    Sam\" - SAM and KURTZMAN look at the screen. We get a quick\n    glimpse of Humphrey Bogart before the screen reverts to\n    numbers.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Problem. She doesn't have a bank\n               account.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n                    (hysterically)\n               Well, that's it! I may as well go and\n               hang myself! This sort of thing\n               couldn't have happened before the\n               stupid seventh tier reorganization!\n               That was Simmons doing! And he and\n               Jeffries always sit together at\n               lunch!

It's Christmas.\n               There is one more option.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n                    (depressed. Not really\n                    believing it)\n               What?\n    \n                              SAM\n               Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the\n               cheque, tell her to sign her name on\n               the back, cash it at the corner sweet\n               shop.\n    \n    KURTZMAN is dumbfounded by the audacity of this.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               That's brilliant!\n    \n    SAM takes over. In no time at all he has battered away at\n    the keyboard, slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and\n    received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf\n    of different coloured papers.\n    \n                              SAM\n               I'll do it for you.

MOTORWAY TUNNEL                   DAY             35\n    CUT to SAM at the wheel of the little car, beetling along\n    in a seemingly endless, tube-like tunnel, menaced fore and\n    aft by huge buses, lorries and other carriers which\n    literally lift the little three-wheeler from the road\n    surface and shake it by the scruff of its tiny neck.\n    \n    CUT to SAM in interior of the Messerschmidt.

MOTORWAY TUNNEL                   DAY             36\n    \n    CUT to exterior view of Messerschmidt still merrily\n    progressing in arterial tunnel. CUT to very tiny exit\n    sign: Exit 49.\n    \n    CUT to SAM peering at sign.\n    \n    CUT to Messerschmidt taking the exit just as a huge lorry\n    roars by.\n    \n    \n37  EXT.   BUTTLE FLATS                      DAY             37\n    \n    Beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the\n    sunlight. Pulling back we reveal it to be an architect's\n    model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre\n    of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work -\n    graffiti and junk are now the only decorations. In the\n    background is the grim reality of the massive housing\n    tower. SAM's Messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow\n    of the building which is grey, decrepid, vandalised. Huge\n    conduits, pipes, and tubing frame the scene. SAM gets out\n    of the car under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a\n    few LOCALS. Self-consciously, SAM looks around him, then\n    at the paper in his hand. A little group of KIDS sit\n    pitching pennies against a wall. SAM goes over to them.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (super polite)\n               Excuse me. Can you tell me ...\n    \n    But before he can finish, the smallest, tiny KID looks up.\n    \n                              KID\n               Eff off.\n    \n    SAM, uncomfortably, effs off.\n    \n    He is watched, at some distance, imapassively by the\n    little GIRL BUTTTLE. As SAM enters the buildings one of\n    the kids gets out a can of something and approaches the\n    car. Another is fiddling, with a box of matches.\n    \n    \n38  INT.   BUTTLE FLATS                      DAY             38\n    \n    CUT to SAM hesitantly walking into the semi-derelict lobby\n    of the big block of flats. Graffiti, vandalism are in\n    evidence everywhere. He walks up to the lift. Pushes the\n    button. Nothing happens. He pushes again. This time the\n    lift door shudders and sparks. SAM tries to pull the doors\n    apart. They jam open with a three-inch gap between them -\n    still shuddering and grinding. In the sparking light, SAM\n    can make out an interior crammed with garbage, junk, old\n    furniture, dead cats. Yechhhh. Resignedly, he turns\n    towards the stairs.\n    \n    \n39  INT.   CORRIDOR                          DAY             39\n    CUT to SAM coming breathlessly out of the stairwell. On\n    the wall next to it is the number 37. Walking down the\n    corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock, but\n    then notices that the door is cracked open. SAM tries to\n    knock on the door, but it keeps edging open and he settles\n    for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly.\n    \n               SAM\n               Mrs Buttle\n                    (silence)\n               Uh, Mrs Buttle?\n                    (silence)\n    \n    SAM stands not knowing what to do.\n    SAM pushes the door a bit more open gingerly and puts\n    about 65 per cent of his body into the hall of the flat.\n    CUT to SAM's POV of darkish hall.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Mrs Buttle ...\n    \n40  INT.   BUTTLE SITTING ROOM               DAY             40\n    \n    CUT to SAM entering extremely tacky sitting-room shrouded\n    in half-darkness. This is the same flat from which the\n    FATHER was taken at the beginning of the film: the hole is\n    still in the ceiling. SAM becomes aware of a woman sitting\n    absolutely still at a small table by the only (still\n    broken) window in the room.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Are you Mrs Buttle?\n    \n    The WOMAN nods very slightly without looking at him.\n    \n                              SAM\n               My name is Lowry - Sam Lowry.

SAM\n    pushes the cheque a little way towards MRS BUTTLE but she\n    does not respond.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (indicting cheque)\n               It's a refund ...

Not my department ... I'm only\n               records. It seems that Mr Buttle was\n               overcharged by Information Retrieval.\n               I don't think they usually make\n               mistakes ... but, er ... I suppose\n               we're all human.\n    \n    SAM looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling.\n    \n               Oh ... what happened to the ...?\n    \n    He gets nothing back.\n    \n               Actually, my bringing this here is\n               rather unorthodox ... Usually any\n               payments are made through the central\n               computer ... but, er ... there were\n               certain difficulties, and rather than\n               cause delay, we thought you might\n               appreciate this now ... it being\n               Christmas.\n    \n                          MRS BUTTLE\n               My husband's dead, isn't he?\n    \n                              SAM\n               Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the\n               Ministry is always very scrupulous\n               about following up and eradicating\n               error. If you have any complaints\n               which you'd like to make, I'd be more\n               than happy to send you the\n               appropriate forms.\n    \n                          MRS BUTTLE\n               What have you done with his body?\n    \n                              SAM\n               Um ...\n    \n    MRS BUTTLE starts to cry.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Look, I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid\n               I don't know anything about it ...\n               I'm really just delivering the\n               cheque. Er ... If you wouldn't mind\n               signing these receipts\n                    (producing blue and pink\n                    receipts)\n               I'll go and leave you in peace.\n    \n    SAM picks up the cheque and gives it to MRS BUTTLE\n    together with the receipts. MRS BUTTLE tears them up and\n    throws them in his face.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Uh ...\n    \n                          MRS BUTTLE\n               He hadn't done anything ... He was\n               good ... What have you done with his\n               body?\n    \n    SAM looks around for an escape and sees a YOUNG BUTTLE\n    standing in the doorway. The BOY is looking at him with a\n    blank tearful face. Suddenly the BOY launches himself at\n    SAM with terrible ferocity. SAM is knocked against the\n    wall. A mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the\n    floor. The BOY is all over SAM kicking and pulling his\n    hair. MRS BUTTLE's reaction, however, is to try and pull\n    the BOY away from SAM. By the time she succeeds, SAM is on\n    his hands and knees, in pain. The BOY is crying and\n    shouting, and MRS BUTTLE is loudly trying to quieten the\n    BOY.\n    \n    From SAM'S POV, a piece of broken mirror lying on the\n    floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with JILL's\n    head and shoulders framed in the hole. The moment is\n    unreal for SAM in his dazed condition. The vision seems\n    unreal too. JILL is staring at SAM out of the piece of\n    mirror and. she's very much the GIRL from his dream now.\n    \n                             JILL\n               Are you alright?\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (mumbles)\n               It's you ... it's you ...\n    \n                             JILL\n               Mrs Buttle, are you alright?\n    \n    SAM grabs at the image, i.e. at the mirror, shifting the\n    angle so that the vision disappears. He looks for the\n    vision on the floor but can't find it. Then he begins to\n    realise the reality of what he has seen. He stands up,\n    dazed and battered. MRS BUTTLE has been looking up at the\n    ceiling. SAM looks up at the ceiling but there is now only\n    the empty space of the hole.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Wait! Stop! Come back!!\n    \n    MRS BUTTLE is shouting. SAM rushes out of the flat.\n    \n    \n41  INT.   BUTTLE'S CORRIDOR                 DAY             41\n    \n    SAM looks both ways and heads for the stairs.\n    \n    \n42  INT.   BUTTLE'S STAIRCASE                DAY             42\n    \n    SAM runs up the stairs to the floor above and finds\n    himself in -\n    \n    \n43  EXT.   SIMILAR CORRIDOR                  DAY             43\n    \n    He runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the\n    doors downstairs and now doesn't know which door to knock\n    at. He hesitates. He rings the bell on what he hopes is\n    the right door. The bell doesn't work. He bangs on the\n    door. The door opens a crack. A malevolent eye looks at\n    him.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Girl ... fair hair ...\n    \n    The door shuts firmly. SAM rushes to the next door.\n    \n    \n44  INT.   JILL'S FLAT                       DAY             44\n    \n    SAM bursts into JILL's flat. He sees the hole in the\n    floor. The place looks derelict. He hears an explosion and\n    looks out of a window to see his car in flames. JILL is\n    apparently retreating from it across the forecourt. She is\n    carrying a suitcase and bundles.\n    \n    \n45  INT.   STAIRCASE                         DAY             45\n    \n    SAM rushes down the stairs.\n    \n    \n46  EXT.   BLOCK OF FLATS                    DAY             46\n    \n    SAM charges out into the open air. JILL has disappeared.\n    The Messerchmidt, however, is in flames. SAM doesn't know\n    which way to turn. Spotting an old mattress lying by the\n    building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an\n    attempt to smother the flames. The group of CHILDREN watch\n    him silently. Suddenly with a great roar, JILL's lorry\n    comes round the corner at speed. SAM sees that JILL is at\n    the wheel. SAM runs after the lorry.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (shouting)\n               Wait! It was nothing to do with me!\n    \n    The lorry roars away. SAM dashes back to his smoldering\n    three-wheeler. He flings himself into it and starts it up.\n    He also roars away, except that he doesn't move... all\n    three wheels have been removed. He turns round in despair\n    and sees the group of CHILDREN regarding him\n    expressionlessly.\n    \n    They include the little GIRL BUTTLE.\n    \n    Defeated, he slumps down against his charred vehicle. A\n    shadow passes across his face. Looking up he sees GIRL\n    BUTTLE standing over him.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Go away.\n    \n                          GIRL BUTTLE\n               Her name is Jill.\n    \n                              SAM\n               What? ...Jill?

RECORD CLERKS POOL                DAY             47\n    \n    It is the end of the work day. The CLERKS are busily\n    getting their coats and leaving the office. As the last\n    one goes MR. KURTZMAN comes out of his private office with\n    his hat and coat on. He turns out the office light. He\n    sees SAM isolated in the empty room, still working at his\n    computer console. Totally absorbed in what he is doing.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               Oh ... Sam. I've had the transport\n               pool onto me ... You don't know\n               anything about a personnel\n               transporter gone missing do you?\n    \n    SAM doesn't seem to hear him. On the computer screen is a\n    front and side view picture of JILL. Her name and code\n    number is at the top of the screen. SAM is punching up\n    personal dossier information like \"age\", \"height\",\n    \"weight\", \"colour of hair\", \"colour of eyes\",\n    \"distinguishing marks\" etc.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (preoccupied)\n               A \"personnel\" transporter? They've\n               got it wrong. I had a personal\n               transporter. I'll do the paperwork\n               tomorrow -\n    \n    SAM punches up a few more categories for JILL's dossier.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's\n               cheque?\n    \n                              SAM\n               I delivered it.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               Can I forget it?\n    \n                              SAM\n               Yes.\n    \n    SAM punches a few more buttons on the computer.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               What a relief!\n                    (on reflection)\n               I shall probably have nightmares.\n    \n    At this point the word \"Classified\" superimposes itself\n    over most of the screen and \"IRQ/3\" starts agitating at\n    the bottom\n    \n                              SAM\n               Damn!

Which is hopeless, of\n               course. They never tell you anything.\n               But come the time they want something\n               from us ...\n    \n    Throughout this verbal wallpaper SAM has been punching\n    keys cancelling the CLASSIFIED overprint. He then punches\n    in the code for a hard-copy print-out. JILL's two-view\n    computer portrait rolls out as SAM ponders his options.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (cutting off Kurtzman)\n               I've go to accept that promotion to\n               get behind this, haven't I?\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               Yes.\n                    (realising what he's\n                    suggesting)\n               NO! You can't! You've only just\n               turned it down!\n                    (thinking Sam is joking)\n    \n                              SAM\n               I never signed the form.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               I did it for you.\n    \n                              SAM\n               What!

I don't, know.\n    \n    KURTZMAN picks up JILL's print-out and glances at it. He\n    grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder.\n    \n                           KURTZMAN\n               Come on, before they turn the lights\n               out.\n    \n    SAM nods. He turns off the machine. He stands up and\n    follows KURTZMAN towards the door. The door is some\n    distance away, and before they get there all the lights go\n    out. KURTZMAN bumps into a desk and curses.\n    \n    \n48  INT.   TRANSPORT CAGE                    EVENING         48\n    \n    Packed tightly between other passengers SAM is busy\n    drawing long flowing hair with a pencil on the computer\n    print-out of JILL turning her into the DREAM GIRL. The\n    transport cage rattles through its elevated tube towards a\n    tower block.\n    \n    \n49  INT.   SAM'S CORRIDOR                    EVENING         49\n    \n    The transport cage arrives at the platform forming the end\n    of SAM's corridor. Passengers disembark and head for\n    various doors along the corridor. SAM almost fails to get\n    off in time - so concentrated on JILL's picture is he.\n    Looking as if he's trying to make up his mind about\n    something he heads for his own front door.\n    \n    \n50  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        EVENING         50\n    \n    SAM enters. The place is in a state of turmoil. Servicing\n    panels are off the walls. Conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown\n    mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was\n    disemboweled. SPOOR stands in the middle of it all trying\n    to direct two other WORKMEN who are poring over wiring\n    plans which seem to make little sense to them. DOWSER is\n    not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and\n    banging going on somewhere behind the wall.\n    \n                              SAM\n               What the - ? How did you - ?\n    \n                             SPOOR\n               Emergency procedures.\n    \n                         DOWSER (O.S.)\n                    (muffled)\n               ...ergency procedures.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (angrily)\n               I haven't got an emergency. Get out\n               of here.\n    \n    For reply SPOOR whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag\n    and plays back SAM's original phone call to Central\n    Services, claiming \"an emergency\". SPOOR shuts off his\n    machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what\n    looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper\n    between each page. SPOOR indicates the bottom of page 1.\n    \n                             SPOOR\n               Sign here please.\n    \n                              SAM\n               What is it?\n    \n                             SPOOR\n                    (surprised)\n               It's a 27B/6, what did you think it\n               was?\n    \n    SAM takes out KURTZMAN's old-fashioned fountain pen from\n    his pocket, signs where indicated. SPOOR registers that\n    SAM's signature has hardly penetrated through he first\n    carbon let alone the other 43\n    \n                             SPOOR\n                    (sourly)\n               Haven't you got a ballpoint?\n    \n    SAM resignedly starts signing all the other pages one by\n    one. SPOOR realises that DOWSER's echo has gone missing.\n    \n                             SPOOR\n               Now where's he got to?\n                    (shouts)\n               Dowser!\n    \n    DOWSER bursts through a panel in the wall. This is the\n    panel which TUTTLE had removed and replaced. A few of the\n    flat's intestines have come out with DOWSER. DOWSER has\n    made a find - TUTTLE's spare part.\n    \n                             SPOOR\n               What have you got there?\n    \n                            DOWSER\n                    (highly excited)\n               Got there!\n    \n    DOWSER points to TUTTLE's spare part which is hanging out\n    of the wall attached to rubber tube. SPOOR examines this\n    closely. SAM watches alarmed. The TWO MEN go into a\n    mumbling huddle.\n    \n                             SPOOR\n               Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ...\n               Tuttle\n    \n                            DOWSER\n               Mumble ...

SPOOR grabs the form-book\n    out of SAM's hands, rips out the last page, thrusts that\n    page at SAM, shoves the book into his bag.

Wall panels are\n    off. Tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room\n    like greasy intestines. SAM more or less collapses onto a\n    couch. He stares at the ceiling. The room is gently\n    hiccoughing and belching around him. He stares at the\n    print-out of JILL's face. Slowly it dissolves into the\n    DREAM GIRL.\n    \n    \n51  EXT.   CONDUIT FOREST                    NIGHT           51\n    \n    DREAM GIRL's face fills screen. The camera pulls back to\n    reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest\n    of conduit/ducting-like vines. SAM is struggling through\n    the vines, which grab at him, entwine and entangle him.\n    Finally bursting free he reaches out for the GIRL hovering\n    before him, But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke\n    and he plummet into a void beneath his feet.\n    \n    \n52  EXT.   CLOUDS                            NIGHT           52\n    \n    CUT to SAM plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape\n    twisting around him. Somehow he manages to wrestle it\n    clear of his body. Gripping the corners he whips the cape\n    up and over his head. The wind catches it and fills it out\n    until it acts as a parachute slowing SAM's descent.\n    Suddenly the clouds thin out and SAM can see below him.\n    \n    \n53  EXT.   STRANGE LANDSCAPE                 ANTI-DAY        53\n    \n    SAM is heading down towards a barren landscape. Strange\n    mounds dot the barrenness - they ooze smoke and the\n    occasional flame. Near one of the mounds are two long\n    lines of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant\n    cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. The\n    black-robed FORCES OF DARKNESS (FOD) surround the\n    PRISONERS, relentlessly herding them towards the cages.\n    The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light.\n    The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a\n    black disc. SAM descends on his cape-parachute.\n    \n    CUT to PRISONERS in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards\n    the jaws of the brutal cages. They are defeated,\n    destroyed, without hope. The FOD prod and whip them\n    forward. One of the FOD raises his spear to force a\n    stumbling PRISONER to his feet but stops with the spear\n    raised above his head. He has seen something. Other FODS\n    turn to see what it is. CUT to SAM landing on the beach -\n    a short distance away. The PRISONERS stop and look up. We\n    see their faces clearly for the first time. One of them is\n    MRS BUTTLE. Others are PEOPLE SAM saw in the flats, and\n    the KIDS. SAM recognises them. He is slightly taken aback.\n    A look of determination crosses his face. He draws the\n    sword. EVERYONE is frozen in place. SAM starts forward.\n    But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins\n    to tremble and shake. EVERYONE looks terrified. With a\n    mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between SAM and\n    the OTHERS. Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the\n    opening. And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large black\n    flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high\n    into the sky. SAM hesitates and turns to look down into\n    the light. There, under several meters of the earth's\n    crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful\n    blue sky. SAM is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen\n    in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE that straddles the\n    crevasse. This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet\n    high. He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient\n    Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he\n    made of computer parts. His face is hidden behind a\n    horrific steel mask. It is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR that\n    was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of\n    Knowledge. In his hand is an evil-looking spear. SAM is\n    unsure which way to turn. The GREY PRISONERS are being\n    loaded into the cages with more speed. He turns to face\n    the GIANT WARRIOR. As SAM steps forward the GIANT stands\n    ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in\n    an almost religious gesture. POOF! He vanishes. As he does\n    the light from the day is cut off. Looking down, SAM sees\n    that he crevasse has vanished as well. Maniacal laughter\n    from the flapping black thing makes SAM look up to see the\n    ballooned cage packed with GREY PRISONERS rise up from the\n    ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black\n    flapping Thing. SAM rushes after it grabbing one of the\n    trailing ropes. But as he is hoisted into the air it is\n    severed by the FODS. He tumbles to the ground. Looking\n    around he sees that, for some reason, the second ballooned\n    cage is still tethered nearby. SAM rushes over to it and\n    begins chopping the tethers away.\n    The cage bobbles ungainlily as SAM cuts the last\n    restraining rope. Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but\n    before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg\n    halting his progress. As he struggles his other leg is\n    caught. He is being pulled back by two giant hands.\n    Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the\n    smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude. The\n    face looks like MR KURTZMAN. SAM desperately clings on to\n    the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands.\n    \n                   MR KURTZMAN OF THE MOUND\n               Don't go! It's a trap! She's not what\n               she seems.\n    \n    SAM kicks and strains but the hands hold firm.\n    \n    \n54  INT.   SAM'S FLAT                        NIGHT           54\n    \n    SAM wakes up. His feet are entangled in some wiring and\n    ducting. He is still in his devastated sitting room. As he\n    untangles himself the door bell rings. It takes a moment\n    for SAM to recognise it as the door bell. Annoyed and\n    still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the\n    door. He opens it. In bursts a GIRL dressed in a silly\n    bell-boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and\n    big-bowed tap dancing shoes. She launches into a terrible\n    song and dance routine.\n    \n                        GIRL (singing)\n               Mrs Ida Lowry requests the pleasure\n                 of your companyyyy\n                 at her apartment tonight,\n               from eight thirtyyyy\n                 midnight\n               to celebrate the completion\n                 of her recent cosmetic surgeryyyy\n               The guest of honour will be\n                 Mr Conrad Helpmann,\n               Dep.

MOTHER' S CORRIDOR                NIGHT           55\n    \n    SAM rings the doorbell to his mother's flat. He is\n    wearing. an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie - obviously his\n    only dress outfit. The door is opened by a LIVERIED FLUNKY\n    who's about to speak when an attractive 40-year old\n    woman's face appears over his shoulder and addresses SAM\n    over the threshold.\n    \n                             WOMAN\n               Sam, I'm so glad you came.

MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT           56\n    \n    SAM steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him.\n    The place is full of sleek people - smartly but less\n    formally dresses than SAM. It is an elegant baroque room -\n    lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous\n    Central Service ducts that thrust through antique\n    tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for\n    aesthetics or the interior decorator's feelings.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (bewildered)\n               Mother?

It is a curious\n    whirring murmuring tummeling sound, and it seems to be\n    growing closer. Suddenly a scrum of PEOPLE swings into\n    view around a corner at the far end of the rather long\n    corridor. At the centre of the scrum is a TALL MAN with a\n    magisterial expression and an air of eternal bustle. This\n    is MR WARREN. He is surrounded by the EXPEDITERS who are\n    competing for his attention with bits of paper and bits of\n    sentences. MR WARREN is snapping out decisions. Satisfied\n    EXPEDITERS drop out of the scrum at intervals,\n    disappearing one at a time through one of the many doors\n    which line both sides of the corridor.The scrum doesn't\n    get any smaller because new EXPEDITERS dart out of other\n    doors and join the milling MOB. The whole circus is coming\n    by SAM at the rate of knots. The sound it makes breaks\n    down into something like this.\n    \n                          EXPEDITER 1\n                    (waving pager)\n               Mr Warren, this order ...\n    \n                          EXPEDITER 2\n                    (waving same)\n               Mr Warren ...\n    \n                          EXPEDITER 3\n                    (ditto)\n               About this invoice ...

The\n    same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace.\n    As the scrum reaches SAM he gathers his nerve and jumps\n    right in beside WARREN, and keeps going.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (in a hurry)\n               I'm Lowry, Mr Warren ...

It is about four feet\n    wide. A small blacked-out window high on the far wall is\n    bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side\n    wall. The room is bare except for a chair and a desk which\n    is also bisected by the new wall. Pneumatic tubes hang\n    from the ceiling. SAM slowly enters the room.\n    \n    \n62  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY             62\n    \n    SAM looks lost ... disoriented. He doesn't know where to\n    begin because there's nothing to begin with. He squeezes\n    in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do\n    starts arranging his \"in\" and \"out\" baskets. There in his\n    \"in\" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys -\n    gaily wrapped with a card from HELPMANN - Merry Xmas &\n    Welcome. SAM can't quite believe. He returns to lining up\n    his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books)\n    against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. SAM\n    turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they\n    both fall over with a \"plop\". Puzzled, he stands the books\n    up again, turns his eyes away and \"plop\". Same result.\n    Intrigued, a bit exasperated, SAM carefully, and before\n    his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall,\n    and \"plop\", the books topple over. Puzzled, SAM grabs hold\n    of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the\n    wall. The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops,\n    somehow held stubbornly. SAM grits his teeth, reallllly\n    pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge.\n    Intrigued, SAM gets up, goes around his desk and heads for\n    the door.\n    \n    \n63  INT.

SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY             64\n    \n    SAM is sitting in his office listening to the protracted\n    one finger exercise which is going on next door. He stares\n    dumbly at the shining, absolutely useless, executive toy.\n    \n    \n65  EXT.   ICY SEA                           ANTI-DAY        65\n    \n    The CAMERA skims along over an icy sea. This is SAM'S POV\n    as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming\n    wings. In the distance rises a strange massive ship.\n    \n    As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing\n    heavily to one side. In fact it is barely afloat. Closer\n    still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone.\n    Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull,\n    but the super-structures and smokestacks. It looks like a\n    massive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is\n    engulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the\n    ship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after\n    course of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we\n    continue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is\n    looking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an\n    opening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts\n    out forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and\n    managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing\n    thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark\n    passage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself\n    teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull\n    and the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs\n    curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow\n    shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks\n    and fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM\n    gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but\n    his attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled far\n    below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of\n    grey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creaks\n    and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back\n    and forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the\n    ship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another\n    boom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as\n    the ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutches\n    at the wall.\n    \n    \n66  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY            66\n    \n    SAM's head is leaning against the wall of his office. The\n    boom repeats. LIME is knocking on the other side. SAM\n    leaps up. As he leaves his office he looks back to see the\n    desk creep through to LIME's office a little bit more.\n    \n67  INT.

Did you want\n               the lift?\n    \n    The cavalcade is passing the lifts. SAM backs away into\n    the open lift. The cavalcade passes on out of sight. The\n    lift contains a CHARLADY with a bucket and mop. She\n    remains in the lift as SAM joins her.\n    \n    \n69  INT.

From somewhere far away\n    there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain. SAM glances\n    around the lift. There appears to be an air conditioning\n    vent in the ceiling.\n    \n    SAM glances enquiringly at the CHARLADY who merely smiles\n    at him. Another scream is heard.\n    \n                              SAM\n               What's that?\n    \n    The CHARLADY smiles again.\n    \n               Doesn't that disturb you?\n    \n    The CHARLADY fiddles with something in her ears and pulls\n    out a pair of wax earplugs.\n    \n                           CHARLADY\n               Beg your pardon?\n    \n    The lift arrives.\n    \n    \n70  INT.   50TH FLOOR CORRIDOR               DAY             70\n    \n    The lift arrives. SAM steps out. The CHARLADY remains in\n    the lift. The doors close. SAM heads down surgically clean\n    white-tiled corridor.\n    \n    Passing a white-coated TECHNICIAN monitoring what appears\n    to be electric meters, SAM comes to a door with 5001.\n    Above the door a red light is glowing. SAM knocks. The red\n    light goes out and a green light comes on. SAM enters.\n    \n    \n71  INT.   ROOM 500l                         DAY             71\n    \n    Inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but\n    the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant-\n    looking FEMALE typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and\n    typing with great facility. SAM approaches the TYPIST who,\n    busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently\n    mouths the words ...\n    \n                            TYPIST\n               It won't be long now.\n                    (she carries on typing)\n                    \n    SAM nods, and stands quietly by her. He can hear tiny\n    sounds coming through her headphones. He looks down at the\n    piece of paper in the typewriter. He reacts a bit\n    strangely, perhaps even winces. We see he close up of the\n    words being struck crisply on paper.\n    \n                         ON TYPEWRITER\n               AHHHH, Oh God ... No, don't ... UHH,\n               please ... I ...

From this earphone we can\n    just hear quietly ...\n    \n                           EARPHONE\n               Oooooooh ... aaaaaahhh ... please ...\n               arrrrrghhhh no ... please ...

She puts back the earphone and\n    carries on typing.\n    \n                            TYPIST\n               I'm sure he won't be long now.\n    \n    She types a little more but suddenly stops.\n    \n                         I thought so!\n    \n    She takes off the earphones and takes the paper and\n    carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all\n    the different copies.\n    \n    Through the frosted glass door leading into the next area,\n    SAM can see a FIGURE come through a double door and turn\n    left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the TYPIST as he exits\n    from sight. She is charmed. Almost immediately after them,\n    a white-coated TECHNICIAN exits, but to the left.\n    \n                            TYPIST\n               You can go in now.\n    \n    \n72  INT.   JACK'S OFFICE                     DAY            72\n    \n    SAM goes through the glass door and is about to push open\n    the double doors in front of him. He is halted by a noise\n    from the TYPIST - she indicates that he is to go to the\n    left. He does so and enters an office. An antique desk\n    with a large collection of executive toys and other\n    tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a\n    rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall\n    of the much larger room that SAM was stopped from\n    entering. Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently\n    successful. A buzzing noise draws SAM's attention to the\n    wash basin in the far corner. The Information Retrieval\n    TECHNICIAN is standing by a sink massing his temples with\n    old-fashioned scalp vibrators. His back to us.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Excuse me. Are you officer 412/L?\n    \n    The TECHNICIAN makes no sign of having heard this. He\n    continues vibrating his temples.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (a bit louder)\n               Er, excuse me!\n    \n    Getting no response SAM walks over to the TECHNICIAN. As\n    he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face\n    down on the desk top. It seems strangely familiar - but as\n    it is a negative concave image SAM isn't sure. He\n    continues over to the TECHNICIAN.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (louder)\n               Excuse me.\n    \n    He touches the TECHNICIAN on the shoulder, who jumps with\n    a start. He spins around and turns out to be none other\n    than JACK LINT. He is amazed to see SAM.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (surprised)\n               Jack!!\n    \n                             JACK\n                    (recovering slightly)\n               SAM!

LIFT                              DAY            74\n    \n    Slightly unnerved, SAM gets in the lift, pushes the button\n    for his floor - the 30th - and immediately begins perusing\n    JILL's dossier. The lift descends. But unnoticed by SAM\n    continued past his floor without stopping. It stops at the\n    Lobby Mezzanine. SAM looks up and realizes he is on the\n    wrong floor. Angrily he pushes the correct floor number\n    but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice\n    echoing through the massive lobby. He looks in the\n    direction of the porters desk. There stands JILL arguing\n    with the PORTER.\n    \n                             JILL\n               But you've stamped this form before!\n               Why won't you stamp it now?\n    \n                            PORTER\n               You've just said yourself, Miss,\n               we've already stamped it. Why should\n               we stamp it twice?\n    \n    SAM is frozen. He can't believe what he sees. The lift\n    doors close. SAM is too slow to stop them. Madly he pushes\n    the buttons - to no effect. The lift descends. (At this\n    point we had better describe the lift. It is a cross\n    between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille\n    doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall\n    in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of\n    dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the\n    Ministry.)\n    \n    SAM can see JILL and if JILL were to look up she could see\n    SAM descending. He is shouting and rattling the bars of\n    the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention.\n    SAM sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying\n    to stop the demon lift. From his POV we see JILL\n    disappearing from view still arguing with the PORTER.\n    \n    \n75  INT.   BASEMENT                          DAY            75\n    \n    The lift comes to rest. SAM is still trying to get it to\n    respond and return him to the lobby. TWO TECHNICIANS are\n    waiting as the doors open. From SAM's POV he sees them\n    hang a sign on the door and walk away. He bangs the\n    buttons for another moment with no result. He looks out of\n    the lift and is able to read the sign - \"LIFT OUT OF\n    ORDER\". Frantically he looks around for another lift. All\n    the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off\n    to one side, its doors standing open. Rushing over to it\n    he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but\n    there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters. Before\n    he can sort this out a voice shouts at him.\n    \n                             VOICE\n               Hey, you - get out of there.\n    \n    A GUARD approaches looking tough and mean.\n    \n                             GUARD\n               What do you think you're doing ...\n               that's the Deputy Minister's lift.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Sorry, I'm in a hurry.\n    \n                             GUARD\n               Hold on, sonny ... let's see your\n               I.D.\n    \n    SAM fumbles through his pockets desperate to get back to\n    the lobby before JILL leaves. He has forgotten he is\n    wearing his new I.D. badge. The GUARD can't see it because\n    JILL's dossier is covering it.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Shit ... it's here somewhere.

Confused he looks around and\n    then realizes his I.D. badge, is on his lapel and the\n    GUARDS are responding as trained. The GUARDS chasing him\n    screech to a halt when they see the others snapping to\n    attention. Everyone looks confused, embarrassed, hesitant\n    to make the next move.

He lets go of JILL for a moment to grab at the\n    papers. The LADY continues screaming at him, her little\n    Pekinese dog (who incidentally wears a plaster over his\n    bum hole) yaps at his ankles, ripping SAM's new trousers.\n    SAM is torn between trying to regain the pages of the\n    dossier and following JILL who has disappeared round the\n    corner. He gives up retrieving the paper and rushes after\n    JILL.\n    \n    CUTTING back to the TWO GUARDS, who have been observing\n    all this bizarre activity, we see one of them reading one\n    of the pieces of paper.\n    \n                          OTHER GUARD\n               Hey, you shouldn't be reading that\n               it's classified.\n    \n    \n82  EXT.

It\n    is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and\n    forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke. In the\n    murk can be seen sinister-looking FIGURES in protective\n    clothing and hard hats.\n    \n    This is the world which is now entered by JILL's lorry ...\n    The lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and\n    JILL jumps down from the cab.

Window boxes with flowers and\n    shrubbery surrounded by a white picket fence provide\n    domestic charm, however, in the doorway stands a MAN with\n    protective clothing and something like a gas-mask over his\n    face. He is waving to someone. Slowly the house rises out\n    of frame.\n    \n    In a WIDER SHOT we can see the house is suspended from and\n    a giant crane that swings it through the air - air filled\n    with stead, smoke, evil-smelling fumes. It is lowered onto\n    the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one\n    of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of\n    the power plant.\n    \n    \n88  INT.

He looks around uneasily and then he\n    start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a\n    compartment which seems to be full of maps, rags, etc. He\n    gets grease on sleeve of his suit. In the space behind the\n    seats he finds the pieces of luggage which JILL had\n    carried away from the flat. He starts to examine this\n    cautiously and is startled by the sudden opening of the\n    cab door.\n    \n                             JILL\n               Don't act guilty. Act like me.

From SAM'S P.O.V., the\n    house suspended from the crane starts moving through the\n    sky towards the lorry. He glances back to see JILL slip a\n    package out from behind the seat. She glances\n    surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel\n    inside her jacket she walks away.\n    \n    \n89  EXT.

The picture on it - though faded by pollution -\n    is of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by\n    the murk and mess of the power plant. JILL has made her\n    way over to a rather SHADOWY FIGURE lurking around the\n    corner of one of the metal structures. They appear to be\n    exchanging parcels. SAM is worried by this suspicious\n    behaviour - reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on\n    the side of the building that illustrates, almost\n    identically, the action we have just seen along with the\n    warning: \"MIND THAT PARCEL.

JILL is desperately trying to get him to move.\n    \n                             JILL\n               Come on, let's go!

DOMESTIC STREET                   DUSK          107\n    \n    A Security vehicle in full banshee howl roars through the\n    streets. We roar along with it as it rounds a corner and\n    skids to a halt at a safe but striking distance from\n    JILL's lorry. Heavily armed SECURITY POLICE pour out and\n    take up firing positions behind parked cars or whatever\n    other cover is available. Searchlights are played on the\n    lorry. The OFFICER IN CHARGE appears with a loud-hailer.\n    \n                       OFFICER IN CHARGE\n               Come out, we know you're in there!\n               You cannot possibly escape. Throw\n               your weapons from your vehicle and\n               come out slowly with your hands on\n               your heads. Obey my instructions and\n               no harm will come to you. But if you\n               force us to shoot we'll shoot to\n               kill.\n    \n    During the above speech a SMALL BOY on a tricycle \"roars\"\n    around a corner behind the SECURITY POLICE. He rides into\n    a gap between them, rolls his tricycle over and \"takes\n    cover\" behind it. He points his toy rifle at JILL's lorry\n    and takes shot. In reaction to the noise made by the kid's\n    rifle the OFFICER IN CHARGE dives for cover and the\n    SECURITY TROOPS open fire and pepper JILL's lorry cab with\n    holes. A few of the SECURITY TROOPS then rush forward and\n    fling open the cab door. The cab is empty. The OFFICER IN\n    CHARGE gets to his feet and looks about. His uniform is\n    covered with dust, oil and shit from the street. He just\n    misses seeing the back of the BOY as he disappears round\n    the corner on his tricycle.\n    \n    \n108 INT.   LINGERIE DEPARTMENT/SHOPPING CENTRE              108\n    \n    To the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering\n    sensuous, supportive world of ladies undergarments. As we\n    slip past girdles, bras, panti-hose for a variety of\n    exotic occasions we come upon SAM and JILL pushing a\n    shopping trolley. In the trolley is the \"suspicious\"\n    parcel which JILL was given at the power plant.\n    \n                              SAM\n               This is a hell of a time to buy a\n               nightie.\n    \n                             JILL\n               Are you still following me?\n    \n                              SAM\n               Please, Jill ... I love you.\n    \n                             JILL\n               Go away.\n    \n                              SAM\n               There are plenty of other safe\n               places. Why don't we go back to my\n               flat?\n    \n                             JILL\n               Leave me alone!\n    \n                              SAM\n               You've got to trust me.

I decided\n               to trust you. Maybe I was wrong.\n               Whose side are you on really? Who are\n               your friends? Who was the man who\n               gave you the parcel? What's in it?\n               It's the only thing you saved from\n               the lorry .... It must he something\n               very special.\n    \n                             JILL\n               I saved you from the lorry and you're\n               not very special.\n    \n                              SAM\n               ........... It's a bomb isn't it?\n    \n                             JILL\n                    (exasperated)\n               Oh ... Jesus!\n    \n    SAM grabs the parcel from the trolley and tries to start\n    tearing it open.\n    \n                              SAM\n               I'm going to open it!\n    \n                             JILL\n                    (grabbing parcel and trying\n                    to take it from him)\n               No you're not!\n    \n    They start an ugly little struggle for the parcel. SAM's\n    suit gets slightly ripped. Their tug-of-war is interrupted\n    by a voice off camera.\n    \n                             VOICE\n               SAM!!\n    \n    SAM turns to see MRS TERRAIN and SHIRLEY a short distance\n    away. MRS TERRAIN is heavily bandaged and sitting in a\n    wheelchair which SHIRLEY is pushing.\n    \n                          MRS TERRAIN\n               It's me and Shirley!\n    \n    From the TERRAINS' POV SAM looks as if he is wrestling\n    with a dummy, or with himself if he is beside a full\n    length mirror. The mirror or something obscures JILL. MRS\n    TERRAIN and SHIRLEY exchange puzzled looks and proceed\n    toward SAM.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets\n               go of the parcel and pushes JILL\n               away. She moves off.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (after Jill for Mrs\n                    Terrain's benefit)\n               I think that'll hold it.\n                    (to Shirley)\n               Hello Shirley.

Are you buying a Christmas\n               present for your mother?\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (Trying to keep an eye on\n                    Jill who is disappearing\n                    from sight)\n               Er, yes ...\n    \n                          MRS TERRAIN\n               Shirley and I come here regularly. I\n               love romantic lingerie.\n    \n    She unwraps a set of red and black, fur trimmed things\n    with strategic holes in them.\n    \n                          MRS TERRAIN\n                    (coyly)\n               Picture me in these.\n    \n    At this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far\n    corner of the store. It is the corner that we last saw\n    JILL moving towards. SAM races towards the smoke, dust\n    covering his suit. He finds bras, knickers, broken shop\n    dummies, bleeding CUSTOMERS and SHOP ASSISTANTS all over\n    the place. On the edge of this devastated area he sees\n    JILL struggling out from under a pile of negligees and\n    plaster dust. He rushes over to her.\n    \n                              SAM\n                           (frantic)\n               Are you alright?\n                             JILL\n               Yes.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (anxiety giving way to\n                    anger)\n               You don't deserve to be!

I\n               should. have made you open it in the\n               lorry\n    \n    She has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it\n    open. Under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured.\n    Christmas packages - yes you guessed it - executive toys.\n    She throws the parcel and its contents hard into SAM's\n    chest. He topples back-wards - tangling himself up with\n    the severed limbs of a shop dummy.\n    \n                             JILL\n               There's your bomb! Our annual bribes\n               for official ass-holes like you!\n    \n    SAM sits in the debris - ashamed and relieved. Liquor\n    oozes from the broken bottle all over SAM's suit. He is at\n    a loss for words.\n    \n    JILL's attention is attracted by moans coming from the\n    badly hurt BOMB VICTIMS. She goes to help them.\n    \n                             JILL\n                    (to Sam)\n               Come on, make yourself useful, there\n               are people hurt!\n               \n    JILL goes around trying to make the INJURED comfortable.\n    SAM follows her. He takes off his jacket with his\n    Information Retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to\n    make a pillow for one of these VICTIMS. By now sirens are\n    wailing, water sprinklers are functioning, and there is\n    general pandemonium. SECURITY GUARDS run into the area and\n    begin arresting everyone, including the DEAD and INJURED.\n    ONE OF THE GUARDS tries to drag off the WOMAN whom JILL is\n    attending.\n    \n                             JILL\n               Hey stop ... she's hurt!\n    \n    The GUARD gives JILL a thump in the side of the face with\n    his gloved hand. SAM sees red.\n    \n                              SAM\n               DON'T TOUCH HER!!\n    \n    The GUARD looks up and as he does so he is transformed\n    into the GIANT WARRIOR from SAM's dream. He towers over\n    the WOUNDED, the DYING and the debris of the blasted\n    lingerie department. SAM grabs for a weapon and comes up\n    with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy. It\n    makes a passable club.\n    \n                             JILL\n               SAM .... don't!!\n    \n    The TWO COMBATANTS square off ... looking for an opening\n    ... a chink in the other's defences - at which point SAM\n    is flattened from behind by a TROOPER's gun butt.\n    \n    \n108a       INT.                              STONE SHIPANTI-DAY108a\n    \n    SAM is falling down the inner wall of the stone ship. He\n    tumbles end over end - unable to stop his crashing\n    descent. With a thud he hits the bottom. Stunned, bruised\n    and battered he tries to get up. Standing over him are the\n    GREY PRISONERS. They press forward.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (feebly)\n               Where is she? Is she here?\n    \n    The GREY PRISONERS dissolve into what looks like several\n    BAGGEES.\n    \n    \n109 INT.

SAM is lying on the floor, covered by his jacket,\n    with his badge prominently displayed. He is dazed and\n    mumbling ... the only BAGGEE in the wagon apart from TWO\n    GUARDS who have removed their helmets and are relaxing\n    while travelling back to base.\n    \n                            GUARD A\n                    (scratching his head)\n               These helmets don't half make your\n               scalp itch.\n    \n                            GUARD B\n               Ooh, don't mention it.\n                    (beginning to scratch his\n                    head)\n               And they make you sweat.

He takes in the situation,\n    sees all the BAGGEES and staggers to his knees.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Jill! Jill! Are you there?!\n    \n    He begins rummaging through the BAGGEES. ONE of which is\n    dressed as FATHER CHRISTMAS. SAM opens the \"face vent\" of\n    the BAGGEE'S' hoods. A pair of strange eyes look out.\n    \n                            GUARD A\n               Excuse me, sir - that's government\n               property.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Is here a girl here?

His suit is torn and bloody. MR WARREN is\n    gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture.\n    Behind WARREN, crowding the doorway, are the PEOPLE who\n    circulate around him and are the cast of the WARREN high\n    energy circus.

Within\n    seconds it returns. SAM sends it off a second time. It\n    doesn't return a second time, periodically something\n    passes through the tubes causing them to move. SAM's\n    pneumatic tubes continue to pulsate, pressure building up.\n    At this point SAM's desk begins, as before, to creep\n    through the wall. He grabs it violently. He pulls it.\n    There is a scream from the other side of the wall. SAM\n    smiles. Th pneumatic tubes give a final convulsion and\n    then there appears to be a muffled explosion outside SAM's\n    office door. It shakes the whole building.

MINISTRY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL       NIGHT    117\n                       BUILDING\n    \n    SAM is leaving the Ministry of Information Retrieval. The\n    lights in the foyer are blazing behind him, the street\n    lamps are lit. He is exhausted and depressed and anxious\n    about the safety and whereabouts of Jill. He begins to\n    retrace their first journey together, down the Ministry\n    front steps and around the corner to where Jill's truck\n    was parked.\n    \n    \n117a       EXT.                              JUST AROUND THE\nCORNER     NIGHT                             117a\n    \n    SAM stands in the passageway where JILL's lorry was first\n    parked. The only hint of its once-upon-a-time presence is\n    a small splodge of oil by the kerb. SAM stands lost and\n    beaten under a street light. He slumps down to the\n    pavement unsure his next move. The street light is\n    reflected in the pool of oil. As he stares at the\n    reflected light it expands and becomes a patch of blue\n    cloud-filled sky. SAM turns to look at the actual street\n    light. It has become a crack of blazing light coming thru\n    the inner wall of the great stone ship.\n    \n    \n117b       INT.                              STONE SHIPANTI-DAY117b\n    \n                    DREAM GIRL'S VOICE\n               I'm here Sam. Don't give up.\n    \n    SAM is pushing thru the GREY PRISONERS. The light from the\n    crack shafts across the space in which they find\n    themselves imprisoned, striking the opposite wall. There\n    in the bright pool of light are SAM's wings - beautiful,\n    shimmering silver... But, nailed to a large stone\n    cruciform - like a crucified eagle. SAM rushes towards\n    them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a\n    great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a\n    black shadow falls across SAM and the wings. Looking round\n    he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the\n    floor - but, blocking the opening is the GIANT SAMURAI\n    WARRIOR. SAM draws his sword and rushes toward the GIANT.\n    The GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he\n    raises his spear in front of himself in an almost\n    religious gesture. Poof! He vanishes! SAM is confused.\n    Suddenly a PRISONER shouts a warning and SAM spins round\n    just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic\n    WARRIOR who is now standing directly behind him. SAM\n    parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then\n    strikes with his sword. At thin air! The GIANT has\n    vanished again. SAM can't figure it out. But he hears\n    something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the GIANT who\n    is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down.\n    Again SAM manages a few parries as he is forced backwards.\n    He trips and falls to the ground. The spear goes into the\n    ground.\n    \n    Before the GIANT can wrench the spear loose, SAM slashes\n    at him with his sword. But again the GIANT disappears. SAM\n    spins around. The GIANT is a short distance from him. SAM\n    rushes him. Again he vanishes. This time he reappears next\n    to the spear and tries to free it. But SAM attacks again\n    and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he\n    can recover the spear. SAM is becoming exasperated with\n    his behaviour, and as the GIANT reappears he shouts at him\n    to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the\n    big fellow. The sword pins the GIANT's foot to the ground\n    before he can disappear. Instead of blood pouring from the\n    wound, fire issues forth. SAM takes advantage of the\n    situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground.\n    The GIANT is unable to escape as SAM charges, but manages\n    to dodge a bit. However the spear catches his arm and\n    opens a gash. Again fire pours out. As the big GUY tries\n    to stop the fire, SAM charges again. This time he succeeds\n    in striking dead centre. The GIANT gasps as fire gushes\n    from his chest. He staggers and crashes to the ground. The\n    wounds continue to bleed fire.\n    \n    SAM gets his breath back and approaches the fallen\n    WARRIOR. Reaching down he removed the GIANT's mask. Fire\n    rushes forth from all the facial orifices. But the thing\n    that makes him catch his breath is the face itself. It's\n    his ... SAM's! While he stares in amazement the fire\n    begins to melt the face. In a moment it is unrecognizable.\n    SAM stands there stunned. Somewhere in the distance a bell\n    tolls.\n    \n    \n118 EXT.   JUST AROUND THE CORNER            NIGHT         118\n    \n    SAM's face is reflected in the puddle of oil. He is\n    staring wide-eyed. A church bell tolls in the distance.\n    SAM is definitely spooked. He scrambles to his feet. He's\n    got to get out of here. He heads off down the passageway\n    but is brought quickly to a halt. There, in the shadows,\n    is SOMEONE smoking a cigarette. He hesitates and reverses\n    direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice\n    comes from behind him.\n    \n                             JILL\n               You're late.\n    \n    SAM spins around. Stepping out from the shadows is JILL -\n    cigarette in her mouth.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (stunned)\n               Jill! What are you do ...

I was worried sick\n               about you ... I thought ...\n    \n    A patrol car approaches. Quickly SAM grabs JILL and goes\n    into a kiss to explain their presence. The car hesitates\n    for a moment and drives on.\n    \n                             JILL\n                    (through kiss)\n               They're gone.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (through kiss)\n               Are you sure?\n    \n                             JILL\n                    (through kiss)\n               Yes.\n    \n    They resume passionate kiss.

SAM looks up and down the platform\n    cautiously but there is no-one in sight as the train\n    clatters off again into the darkness. SAM and JILL\n    approach SAM's front door. He puts a key in the door and\n    tries to open the door but has some difficulty. Something\n    creaks. He gives the door a heavy shove and the door opens\n    and a shower of white powdery ice falls on his head..\n    \n    \n120 INT.

The\n    flat looks as though it has been disembowelled and then\n    deep frozen. Icicles are hanging down from everywhere. The\n    flat looks like a scrap dump. Every wall has spilled out\n    its disgusting steel and rubber entrails, filling most of\n    the available space and making progress through the flat\n    difficult. Half a dozen MEN are at work.

MOTHER'S CORRIDOR                 NIGHT         122\n    \n    A venerable PORTER carrying a single key on a large ring\n    is preceding SAM and JILL along the corridor which we have\n    seen before. The PORTER's name is MATTHEWS.\n    \n                              SAM\n               My mother said it would be all right.\n    \n                           MATTHEWS\n               She didn't say anything about it to\n               me.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Well, she's my mother, not yours.\n    \n                           MATTHEWS\n               I won't be held responsible.\n    \n                              SAM\n               How long will she he away?\n    \n                           MATTHEWS\n                    (darkly)\n               There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's\n               clinic who never come back at all.\n    \n    MATTHEWS unlocks MOTHER's door.\n    \n                           MATTHEWS\n                    (to Jill)\n               You're not a professional, are you?\n    \n                             JILL\n               No, amateur.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (firmly)\n               Thank you, Matthews.\n    \n    With which he ushers JILL through the door and closes the\n    door in MATTHEWS' face.\n    \n    \n123 INT.

INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FOYER       NIGHT          124\n    \n    SAM arrives at the Ministry of Information Retrieval\n    reception It's late. GROUPS OF CLEANERS are operating\n    cleaning machinery. SAM approaches the DESK PORTER who is\n    playing with the executive toy SAM gave him.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me\n               through to Mr Helpmann's office?\n    \n                            PORTER\n               I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to\n               go through the proper channels.\n    \n                              SAM\n               And you can't tell me what the proper\n               channels are, because that's\n               classified information?\n    \n                            PORTER\n               I'm glad to see the Ministry's\n               continuing its tradition of\n               recruiting the brightest and best,\n               sir.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Thank you, Dawson.\n    \n    SAM crosses the foyer, checks to see that Dawson is no\n    longer watching him engrossed as he is with the executive\n    toy, and slips past the lift which, at that moment,\n    disgorges a leg-bandaged, be-crutched LIME who hobbles\n    across the lobby without seeing SAM, who slips down the\n    stairs which he knows lead to Helpmann's private lift.\n    \n    \n125 INT.   BASEMENT                          NIGHT         125\n    \n    SAM creeps along the corridor to the lift door - avoiding\n    a GROUP OF SECURITY MEN who are singing carols in close\n    harmony. ONE GUARD is conducting and giving instruction.\n    They are all incredibly big and brutal looking.\n    \n                         CHOIR MASTER\n                    (stopping them)\n               No, no, no, Arthur, you're going flat\n               on that G. It's your breathing. Take\n               a breath on the end. of the previous\n               line, after Noel. Right, one, two,\n               three.\n    \n    The CHOIR begins singing again. SAM reaches the lift and\n    looks at the small panel of letters set into the wall.\n    CLOSE UP of SAM's face concentrating. He hears, we hear, a\n    reprise of MR HELPMANN talking to SAM in MOTHER's\n    bathroom.\n    \n                        HELPMANN (V/O)\n               Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,\n               but we were close friends, and I keep\n               his name alive at the office every\n               day. It's as though he's there\n               speaking to me. \"'ere I am, J.H.\"\n    \n    SAM is already typing the letters EREIAMJH into the\n    keyboard. The lift judders and star s to ascend.\n    \n    \n126 INT.   MR HELPMANN'S OFFICE              NIGHT         126\n    \n    SAM steps out of lift into an ante-room. No-one is there.\n    Tentatively he knocks on the connecting door into the\n    office. No reply. He slowly opens door.\n    \n    \n                              SAM\n               Mr Helpmann? Are you there? Hello?\n    \n    The office is empty. SAM looks around - not sure what he\n    wants to do. He notices his MOTHER's picture on HELPMANN's\n    desk. He is just about to leave when his eye is caught by\n    an elaborate computer console in a side room. It\n    occasionally chatters away. Paper print-outs fill a large\n    bin. Hesitantly SAM approaches it. Looking around to make\n    sure the room is still empty he punches the On key and the\n    machine lights up.\n    \n    He cautiously pushes a couple more keys. The teleprinter\n    machines have paused but one starts chattering now. He\n    looks at the one which is busy. A CLOSE UP shows us the\n    message coming through: TOTAL - TOTAL -TOTAL - CAR 15\n    REQUEST FEEDBACK STATUS ON SUBJECT BENJAMIN GEORGE\n    TROLLOPE - VAGRANT - DETAINED TERRORIST/SUSPECT/ASSOCIATE.\n    This is followed by a code number. The teleprinter falls\n    silent.\n    \n    SAM returns to the keyboard and switches it off. He turns\n    to leave.\n    The teleprinter starts chattering again. SAM stops and\n    goes back to it and looks at the page again. A CLOSE UP\n    shows us: UPDATE - SUBJECT TROLLOPE DECEASED - CAUSE OF\n    DEATH GUNSHOT RESISTING ARREST. PLEASE DELETE FROM SPECIAL\n    CATEGORY. The computer spool revolves back and forth for\n    two or three seconds and then stops. SAM ponders this for\n    a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and swtiches\n    on the machine. He has he answer.\n    \n    \n127 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT          127\n    \n    SAM enters the flat. JILL is nowhere to be seen. The\n    lights are out but, from the partially opened bedroom door\n    beams a shaft of bright light. Music pours forth ... it is\n    \"BRAZIL\".\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (cautiously)\n               Jill?\n    \n    Getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through.\n    There is JILL but, transformed. She is wearing one of\n    SAM's MOTHER's wigs which billows in the air blown by a\n    fan. She is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed\n    from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly. She\n    looks like the DREAM GIRL. SAM stands open-mouthed. JILL\n    notices him and smiles.\n    \n                             JILL\n               What do you think? ... is it me?\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (still stunned)\n               You don't exist any more. I've killed\n               you. Jill Layton is dead.\n    \n    He holds out a print-out. She reads it and slowly looks\n    up.\n    \n                             JILL\n               Care for a bit of necrophilia?\n    \n    They rush together.\n    \n    \n128 INT.   STONE SHIP                        ANTI-DAY      128\n    \n    The screen is filled with brilliant white clouds rushing\n    about a beautiful blue sky. They course this way and that.\n    Pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a\n    mammoth glass-like cube held aloft by four stone columns.\n    The absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as\n    SAM sweeps up into shot - his wings gleaming in the light.\n    He is a tiny speck but, overjoyed -he has found the day.\n    far below him the GREY PRISONERS gather beaming with\n    happiness. Diving back to the ground - SAM unsheaths his\n    sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of\n    the great columns. The FORCES OF DARKNESS who have been\n    lurking in the shadows slink back. SAM, with one mighty\n    swing, strikes the column - the noise reverberates as\n    cracks begin to race up and through the column. It is\n    disintegrating. As it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to\n    topple. Everyone steps back. Down it plummets. And smashes\n    into a million pieces. The bright blue sky escapes in all\n    directions. The GREY PRISONERS' iron collars and chains\n    fall from their necks as they stand, surrounded by a\n    beautiful blue sky. They look up to the sun. SAM is\n    exultant.\n    \n    \n129 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  DAWN          129\n    \n    Pull back from the sun through a window. The light falls\n    on SAM's smiling sleeping face. Showly he wakes. He little\n    by little remembers where he is and reaches over for JILL.\n    She isn't there. Sam panics.\n    \n                             JILL\n               Merry Xmas.\n    \n    She is sitting at the foot of the bed grinning at him. She\n    crawls over to him - they start to embrace.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Everything is going to be all right.\n    \n    But crash !!! it's a raid! Like a giant drill a whirling\n    cylinder has plunged through the ornate moulded ceiling of\n    Mother's bedroom, and we now see what made the neat hole\n    in the BUTTLE ceiling ... CUTS show doors being burst open\n    by SECURITY TROOPS. JILL and SAM are frozen in panic.\n    SECURITY TROOPS are sliding down a fireman's pole\" from\n    the hole in the ceiling.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (shouts)\n               She's dead. Check the list!\n    \n    But it is SAM they have come for. He is being dragged out\n    of the bed.\n    \n                            GUARDS\n                    (as they struggle with him)\n               You Turncoat Bastard! JUDAS!!\n               TRAITOR!!\n    \n    A canvas bag is plunged over his head. All goes black.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (muffled)\n               JILL!!!\n    \n    A shot rings out. JILL screams. It echoes through the\n    blackness.\n    \n    \n130 INT.   PROCESSING AREA                                 130\n    \n    In absolute inky darkness, SAM and the CAMERA move through\n    space and time marked only by voices and sounds\n    encountered on the way. This sound-sequence fades in and\n    out a few times, indicating that the journey is longer\n    than the real-time period of the blacked-out sequence. We\n    hear:\n    \n    Footsteps of SAM and GUARDS.\n    \n    Distant howl of pain.\n    \n    Muzak.\n    \n    Iron gate.\n    \n    Footsteps again.\n    \n    Lift doors opening and closing.\n    \n    Muzak.\n    \n    Typing pool.\n    \n                         FEMALE VOICE\n               a wonderful gift, I changed it at the\n               chemist for some antibiotics and\n               bathroom scales and there's enough\n               left on the voucher for a\n               tonsilectomy if I want to treat\n               myself ...\n    \n    Office door opens and closes.\n    \n                         GUARD'S VOICE\n               Christmas Parcel for you, sir ...\n               sign here please ...\n    \n    What looks like a rectangular hatch in the blackness\n    opens. It is the eyeslit on the front of SAM's bag being\n    opened by a SECURITY GUARD.\n    \n    The SECURITY GUARD peers in for a moment and then steps\n    back to reveal two SMART OFFICIALS sitting at a desk. They\n    are looking up at SAM/us.\n    \n                          OFFICIAL A\n               93/HKS/608, you are charged with the\n               following:\n               Passing confidential documents to\n               unauthorized personnel - viz IR\n               dossier/Gillian Layton.

This process repeats again and\n    again - getting faster and faster. The OFFICIALS' faces\n    seem to become a changing blur. Their voices overlap in a\n    growing cacophony. The desk and the other items in the\n    room remain static. To add to this disturbing effect the\n    FORCES OF DARKNESS begin to gather in the room behind the\n    OFFICIALS. As they increase in number they begin to press\n    forward unseen by the OFFICIALS.

SAM\n    disappears under their onslaught. A pause. Then SAM is\n    raised, spread-eagled, above the black sea of the FORCES.\n    Strong hands hold him. The maniacal laughter starts up.\n    SAM is turned in its direction.\n    \n    CUT to a shot over the top of the mass of robed FIGURES.\n    Rising from the ruins of the stone columns, the black\n    cloth thing flaps menacingly towards camera. We can see\n    the towering filing cabinet skyscrapers of the Storeroom\n    of Knowledge in the background.\n    \n    SAM looks terrified. As the thing hovers above SAM in all\n    its huge twisting awfulness, it slowly begine to unfold\n    like some deadly flower blooming in stop motion.\n    \n    SAM freezes as the interior becomes invisible. There in\n    the billowing blackness is the GIRL.

He twists and\n    turns, but to no avail. From the darkness above him\n    descends the JOLLY GENT looking just like MR HELPMANN) on\n    his window washer's platform.

The\n    laughter echoes round the cell. SAM sees that MR HELPMANN,\n    in his wheelchair is watching him. He is dressed as Father\n    Christmas. They are alone in the cell. SAM scrunches up\n    into the corner.\n    \n                           HELPMANN\n               Sam, what are we going to do with\n               you?

Keep your eye\n               on the ball. Got to go .... Can't\n               keep the orphans waiting.\n    \n    HELPMANN goes. A GUARD helps him out and then returns with\n    ANOTHER to help put the restraining bag over SAM.\n    \n                             GUARD\n               Don't fight it, son .... confess\n               quickly ... Before they get into the\n               expensive procedures. If you hold out\n               too long you could jeopardise your\n               credit rating.\n    \n    The bag blacks everything out.\n    \n    \n133 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM                      133\n    \n    The bag comes off. SAM finds himself strapped into an\n    Information Retrieval chair. The CAMERA tracks back\n    frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an\n    unbelievably vast room. The walls curve up and out of\n    sight.\n    \n    The floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all - strange\n    light undulates beneath. The whole effect is one of total\n    disorientation and overwhelming size. SAM is desperately\n    trying to take it in. Next to the chair is a porcelain\n    tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments.\n    Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at\n    hand. As the GUARDS leave SAM to take up their positions\n    near the distant door they hand over documents to the\n    white-coated INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OFFICER.\n    \n                             GUARD\n               11/AFT/607, sir.\n    \n    They all sign the document which the I.R. OFFICER retains\n    after giving carbon copies to the GUARDS. The GUARDS then\n    proceed to the door and take up positions on either side\n    of it. The I.R. OFFICER heads toward SAM. We can now see\n    he wears a mask. It is the face of the FORCES OF DARKNESS.\n    A smiling baby doll face. SAM sits, mesmerized, watching\n    him approach. Within fifteen or twenty yards of SAM the\n    I.R. OFFICER comes to an abrupt halt. He seems to sway.\n    After a moment he turns slightly, hesitantly, giving the\n    impression that he may return to the door. He looks at the\n    GUARDS, pauses, straightens himself up, takes a deep\n    breath and continues again towards SAM, rather more\n    briskly than before. SAM watches, terrified and\n    fascinated. The I.R. OFFICER goes to the table which is\n    covered with evil-looking surgical-type instruments - he\n    blunders clumsily into it, knocking a couple of them onto\n    the floor. He picks then up quickly and replaces them.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Jack?\n    \n    The I.R. OFFICER reacts to this as if he's been hit in the\n    solar plexus, and he tries to disguise it by simulating a\n    coughing fit. He then picks up a nasty looking implement\n    and advances on SAM.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Jack?... Jack?\n    \n                             JACK\n                    (hysterically from behind\n                    mask)\n               Shut up!\n    \n                              SAM\n               Jack, I'm innocent!

Jack, please\n               take that mask off.\n    \n    JACK is very close to SAM, he is shaking. He lifts up his\n    mask to reveal sweaty face, contorted with fear and anger.\n    \n                             JACK\n               You stupid bastard!\n    \n                              SAM\n               What?\n    \n                             JACK\n               How could you do this to me?\n    \n                              SAM\n               Help me, Jack!

This is a professional\n               relationship!\n    \n    JACK comes at SAM with the horrifying implement.\n    \n                              SAM\n               JACK!! ... You can't ... No, don't!\n    \n    SAM's eyes widen in terror. From his POV we look up at\n    JACK approaching. The ceiling above and behind JACK is\n    suddenly and. loudly penetrated by the Ceiling Hole\n    Machine, and in an instant without benefit of \"fireman's\n    pole\", the commando-like figure of MR TUTTLE gun in hand,\n    leaps through the hole.\n    TUTTLE is immediately followed by similar looking MEN with\n    balaclavas, guerilla-type clothing, and very efficient\n    guns. JACK is cut down. So are the TWO GUARDS who have\n    opened the door from the corridor and are shooting into\n    the room.\n    \n    TUTTLE raps out into a walkie-talkie\n    \n                            TUTTLE\n               Detonate!\n    \n    From somewhere near at hand there is a large explosion\n    which rocks the room. TUTTLE is already unstrapping SAM.\n    \n                            TUTTLE\n               Let's go!\n    \n    \n134 INT.

We've only got thirty seconds\n               to get clear!\n    \n    TUTTLE tosses SAM a dark overcoat to cover his light grey\n    detainee outfit. Together, the TWO GROUPS burst out\n    through the door into the large empty forecourt.\n    \n    \n137 EXT.   FORECOURT                         NIGHT          137\n    \n    The forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights.\n    Machine gun installations open fire. The RESCUERS are\n    totally exposed.\n    \n    They are cut down left and right.\n    Desperately they battle their way across the open space.\n    Time running out. SAM, knowing the way, leads TUTTLE\n    towards a shielded spot. Will they make it? As the last\n    RESCUER is cut down SAM and TUTTLE dive for cover.\n    KOWBLAMMPOW! A massive explosion. Then another. And\n    another. SECURITY TROOPS caught unprotected are decimated.\n    SAM looks up. Christ! The building is being blown to bits.\n    Certain windows are lit. They spell out MERRY XMAS. With a\n    final massive haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser\n    of masonry, steel, paper and dozens of T.V. consoles and\n    visual aid apparatus including, in large chunks, MR\n    HELPMANN's masterpiece. But also tons and tons of paper.\n    \n    Every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected\n    its load skywards. The night sky is full of white\n    rectangular wisps. Ashlike they flutter down over the\n    city. SAM looks around and can't see TUTTLE anywhere. He\n    shouts for him. But the remaining TROOPS have spotted SAM\n    and SAM runs.\n    \n    \n138 EXT.   CITY PASSAGES                     NIGHT         138\n    \n    SAM runs madly through paper-littered passages\n    \n    \n139 EXT.   SHOPPING                          PRECINCT     NIGHT139\n    \n    Eluding his pursuers, SAM dives into a crowded, garishly\n    lit, shopping centre. Once among the protective company of\n    he mindlessly shopping MOB, SAM slows down and proceeds\n    casually. The SHOPPERS go about their programmed business\n    paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them.\n    Searching the CROWD, SAM spots TUTTLE making his way\n    towards him. TUTTLE is having a bit of trouble walking\n    against the steadily increasing wind. As he proceeds\n    across an open area a blown piece of paper. catches on his\n    foot. He tries shaking it off.\n    \n    It remains firmly stuck. While he is struggling with the\n    piece of paper another, larger piece catches his other\n    leg. He begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the\n    flying debris. Another hits him and twists around his arm.\n    Still more paper blows against him. He is having\n    difficulty staying upright. Twisting this way and that he\n    tries to free himself, but more and more paper covers him.\n    He is practically obscured from view. SAM can't believe\n    what he is seeing. SHOPPERS continue about their business,\n    apparently unaware of TUTTLE'S terrible plight. Apart from\n    ONE SHOPPER who loses control of her shopping trolley -\n    and watches it career down the steps of the shopping\n    precinct. By now TUTTLE is totally encased in this cocoon\n    of litter. He is now just a ball of paper writhing about\n    on the ground. SAM has to do something. He rushes out from\n    his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off TUTTLE.\n    The pieces come loose with surprising ease. The wind\n    carries them away as SAM frantically tears at the pile.\n    But there is no sign of TUTTLE. Nothing. The last few\n    pieces of paper flutter away leaving SAM standing there\n    with a couple of posters in his hands. He realises that he\n    is suddenly very visible. All the shopping bustle has\n    stopped. They are all staring at him. SAM spots TROOPS\n    shouldering their way towards him. He turns tail and\n    dashes off.\n    \n    \n140 INT.   MOTHER'S FLAT                     NIGHT         140\n    \n    The drawing room door burst open as SAM dashes in. SAM\n    goes straight through and into the bedroom. The room is\n    empty of all terrestrial human life forms. A hollow wind\n    blows the curtains.\n    \n    \n141 INT.   MOTHER'S BEDROOM                  NIGHT         141\n    \n    The room is in chaos (and there is a hole in the ceiling).\n    SAM turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway. He rushes\n    forwards.\n    \n    \n142 INT. MOTHER'S FRONT DOOR NIGHT 142\n    \n    But it's MATTHEWS the porter who is at the door watching\n    SAM running towards him.\n    \n                           MATTHEWS\n                    (piously)\n               A sad loss. Your mother was with her\n               at the end. The doctor said there was\n               no pain.\n    \n    SAM grabs MATTHEWS round the neck and shakes him.\n    \n                              SAM\n               Where is she?\n    \n    \n143 EXT    A CORNER                          NIGHT         143\n    \n    SAM comes running around corner. He is suddenly bathed in\n    a strange blue light. He halts and looks up. There\n    opposite him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance\n    to a chapel of dully modernistic design. Holy music from\n    an electric organ can be heard. SAM rushes up the stops\n    and through the door.\n    \n    \n144 INT. CHAPEL OF OUR LADY OF THE CHECK-OUT COUNTER NIGHT 144\n    \n    CUT to SAM slipping into the chapel (in tight spot) and\n    suddenly being confronted by SPIRO the Maitre D.\n    \n                             SPIRO\n               Ah, yes, Mr Lowry. It's so good you\n               could make it. Right this way.\n    \n    SAM, dumbfounded, follows.\n    \n    CUT to SAM being lead into the middle of the cold, modern\n    chapel which, possibly for the occasion, has been tarted\n    up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit\n    theatrical. A large flower-smothered coffin rests on some\n    sort of raised stand in front of the altar, a VICAR stands\n    in the pulpit, and a fair sprinkling of PEOPLE sit in\n    stepped seats on three sides of the room.\n    \n    The coffin is closed, but a length of bandage has escaped\n    the lid. Standing amidst the floral tributes is a large,\n    rather idealized, colour portrait of MRS TERRAIN looking\n    not so much young as beautiful. Among the MOURNERS are DRS\n    JAFFE and CHAPMAN and others in their operating gowns.\n    \n    \n    To enlarge on the scene, we see SHIRLEY T snuffling in her\n    hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves, the\n    VICAR standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it,\n    etc. CUT to SAM trying to take all this in, stopping in\n    the middle of the room. Don't forget DR CHAPMAN sobbing.\n    \n                             SPIRO\n                    (stopping and looking back\n                    at Sam)\n               Mrs Lowry? Mrs Lowry is ...\n    \n    In the background the VICAR begins speaking, and we hear\n    his voice throughout the following action. CUT TO SAM'S\n    POV ....\n    \n                     VICAR (in background)\n               At these times of giving and\n               receiving let's remember the greatest\n               gift of all: not a gift to be\n               spurned, not a gift to be opened and\n               carelessly set on one side, not a\n               gift to be taken back and changed,\n               but the gift of eternal life. Mrs\n               Terrain has just received that most\n               wonderful of all gifts. She came to\n               us physically new, she goes hence\n               from us not so physically new. But\n               the spirit never grows old. And in\n               the domain of the Eternal Giver, Mrs\n               Terrain shall dwell in bountiful joy\n               forever.\n    \n    ..... (CUT to SAM's POV) ... past SPIRO to a section in\n    the bleachers directly across from the coffin and the\n    VICAR where a WOMAN (her back to SAM) is surrounded by a\n    buzzing flock of very handsome and well-dressed YOUNG MEN.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (trying to take in scene)\n               what? ... Oh ...\n                    (starts to follow Spiro)\n    \n                             SPIRO\n                    (coming up to back of\n                    woman)\n               Madam ...\n    CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It\n    is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years\n    younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.\n    \n                            MOTHER\n               Sam!!!\n                    (uncertainty in her\n                    expression)\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (staring dumbly, not\n                    knowing what to say)\n               Mother? ... What ... what's ...\n               you've got to help me ...\n    \n                            MOTHER\n                    (embarrassed, unsure)\n               Not now ... please\n    \n                         YOUNG GALLANT\n                    (belligerently)\n               Ida, is this fellow bothering you?\n                    (getting up)\n               I'll -\n    \n    But before we can find out what he'll:\n    \n                             SFX:\n               TERRIFIC CRASH.\n    \n    CUT to entrance to Chapel as a squad of TROOPS come\n    crashing in. PEOPLE begin to scatter, screaming. The\n    TROOPS spot SAM who dashes away from his MOTHER and heads\n    for a door behind the altar. In his panic he crashes\n    against the coffin which topples over spilling its\n    contents ... a hundredweight of offal. SAM covers his\n    mouth and dashes through the door.\n    \n    \n145 EXT.   MAZE-LIKE DARK PASSAGES           NIGHT          145\n    \n    CUT to SAM, really dashing madly, tripping over things,\n    hurting himself, getting up running.\n    He is in a maze of machinery. Every way he turns his path\n    seems blocked by either TROOPS or FIGURES from his dreams.\n    The walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes\n    deeper into it. More rectangular, higher. We see a top\n    shot of the maze with SAM separate from the pursuing\n    FORCES but they are closing in on him from all sides. The\n    maze extends as far as we can see. SAM turns left and\n    right through it, always there is a chance of turnings.\n    Until ... he rounds a corner and for the first time there\n    is nowhere to go. The maze leads straight ahead to a dead\n    end.\n    At the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from\n    the consumer society. Televisions, washing machines, hair\n    dryers, junk. SAM can do nothing but try to dig through\n    this pile.\n    \n    \n    Maybe he can defend himself with something here. He\n    scrabbles away. Looking back he sees the massed AGENTS,\n    TROOPS, FORCES OF DARKNESS heading toward him. No escape.\n    He digs, harder, faster. Junk flies everywhere. He\n    actually reaches the end wall. Back to it, he turns to\n    face the foe. But as he moves against the wall his hand\n    touches something. A door knob. He turns. It's a door. The\n    knob turns easily. The door swings open. SAM dives through\n    it.\n    \n    \n146 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT         146\n    \n    SAM finds himself in a strange little house empty of\n    furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed\n    frame. He tries to lock the door behind him but there is\n    no key. He puts his weight against the door to keep it\n    shut. From outside there is the general noise of pursuit\n    but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet\n    uniform engine-sound. SAM lets go of the door carefully.\n    He looks around but there is only one window and it is\n    shuttered. He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-\n    \n    SAM'S POV: A rapidly receding street.\n    \n    \n147 EXT.   CITY                              NIGHT         147\n    \n    JILL's truck, with the house on its back, is driving\n    dangerously through he streets. It lurches round the\n    corner.\n    \n    \n148 INT.   HABITATION UNIT                   NIGHT          148\n    \n    - The lurch throws SAM to one side. He picks himself up,\n    and, fighting the centrifugal force, works his way to the\n    shuttered window which is at the front end of the house,\n    in the wall opposite the door. SAM undoes the shutters and\n    finds himself looking at the rear window of JILL's cab. He\n    sees the back of the DRIVER's head. The DRIVER is wearing\n    JILL's cap. He sees the back of the DRIVER's cab. He bangs\n    on the glass of the cab. The DRIVER raises her head so\n    that the face is visible to SAM in the driving mirror. He\n    sees that it is JILL, in a flat cap. She smiles at him.\n    SAM sobs with relief and love.\n    \n    \n149 EXT.   THE ROAD                          NIGHT         149\n    \n    The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches then breasts\n    the rise beyond which lies ... looking more than ever ...\n    JILL'S VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a MIX ...\n    \n    \n150 INT.   TRAVELLING LORRY                  NIGHT         150\n    \n    Through the windscreen we see the dawn coming up ahead.\n    The reverse shot shows us JILL driving and SAM next to\n    her. They glance at each other.\n    \n    \n151 EXT.   SMALL ROAD                        EARLY MORNING 151\n    \n    The lorry, travelling slowly now, approaches and then\n    breasts the rise beyond which lies ... A STUNNINGLY\n    BEAUTIFUL UNTOUCHED VALLEY. We ZOOM towards it through a\n    MIX ...\n    \n    \n152 EXT.   BEAUTIFUL VALLEY                  DAY           152\n    \n    Half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with\n    the house on its back. Creepers and wild roses have grown\n    up over the truck and some of the house. A curl of smoke\n    rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to\n    one of the walls. A small piece of ground around the truck\n    has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a\n    vegetable plat. There is also a pretty cow, and some\n    chickens. JILL appears locking like CRUSOE carrying a\n    basket of eggs.\n    \n    \n153 INT.   HOUSE                             MORNING       153\n    \n    SAM is in the bed, just waking up. He opens his eyes,\n    locking calm. Off screen we hear the door opening.\n    \n                       JILL (off screen)\n               Morning. Sleep well?\n    \n    SAM nods his head slightly, on the pillow.\n    \n                              SAM\n                    (quietly)\n               I don't dream anymore.\n                    (he embraces her)\n    \n    \n154 EXT.   HOUSE AND GARDEN                  MORNING       154\n    \n    A high shot. Everything in the garden is definitely\n    lovely. The music tells us. The music swells and the\n    camera slowly pulls back, and back. It's a happy ending.\n    And then, in the foreground, TWO HUGE HEADS appear looking\n    straight at the camera. It is MR HELPMANN and JACK. They\n    both shake their heads.\n    \n                          MR HELPMANN\n               He's got away from us, Jack.\n    \n    CUT to their POV.\n    \n155 INT.   INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM        DAY            155\n    \n    Sam is sitting in the IR chair. He is strapped in. His\n    eyes are open but miles away. His face is wreathed in a\n    benign and very happy smile.\n    \n                             JACK\n               I'm afraid you're right, Mr.\n               Helpmann. He's gone.\n    \n    A wide shot of the room shows us HELPMANN and LINT turn\n    away and leave. SAM is left alone. He is humming.. The\n    camera pulls back and back. The Information Retrieval room\n    with SAM in it floats away into the most beautiful\n    glorious sky ever.\n    \n    SAM's humming into a full orchestra, and we hear ......\n    \n    \n               \"Brazil, where hearts were entertained in June,\n               We stood beneath an amber moon,\n               And softly murmured 'Some day soon'\n               We kissed and clung together,\n               Then, tomorrow was another day.\n               The morning found me miles away,\n               With still a million things to say,\n               Now, when twilight beams the sky above,\n               Recalling thrills of our love,\n               There's one thing I'm certain of,\n               Return, I will,\n               To old Brazil.\"\n\n    THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Terry Gilliam\u00a0\u00a0Charles McKeown\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:21:38.379684"}
