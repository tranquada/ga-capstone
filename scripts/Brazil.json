CITYSCAPE                         SUNSET           1\n</b>\n    A beautiful golden sun is setting. The sky is on fire. The\n    CAMERA starts to move downwards. A large neon sign rises\n    into shot. It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the\n    frame. The building is neither past nor future in design\n    but a bit of both.\n<b>    \n</b>    Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads\n    below ... A glittering conglomeration of elevated\n    transport tubes, smaller square buildings which are merely\n    huge, with, here and there, the comparatively minuscule\n    relics of previous ages of architecture, pavement level\n    awnings suggesting restaurants and shops ... Transparent\n    tubes carry whizzing transport cages past us ... an\n    elevated highway carrying traffic composed primarily of\n    large transport lorries passes thru frame. As we descend,\n    the sunlight is blocked out and street lights &amp; neon signs\n    take over as illumination. Eventually we reach the upper\n    levels of a plush shopping precinct.\n\n<b>2   INT.   SHOPPING PRECINT                  NIGHT            2\n</b><b>    \n</b>    Xmas decorations are everywhere. PEOPLE are busy buying,\n    ogling, discussing, choosing wisely from the goodies on\n    display. SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly\n    packaged goods ... the shop windows are full of\n    elaborately boxed and be-ribboned who-knows-what. In one\n    window is a bank of TV sets - on the great majority of the\n    screens is the face of MR. HELPMANN - the Deputy Minister\n    of Information. He is being interviewed. No-one bothers to\n    listen to HELPMANN.\n\n<b>                          INTERVIEWER\n</b>               Deputy minister, what do you believe\n               is behind this recent increase in\n               terrorist bombings?\n\n<b>                           HELPMANN\n</b>               Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless\n               minority of people seems to have\n               forgotten certain good old fashioned\n               virtues. They just can't stand seeing\n               the other fellow win. If these people\n               would just play the game, instead of\n               standing on the touch line heckling -\n\n<b>                          INTERVIEWER\n</b>               In fact, killing people -\n\n<b>                           HELPMANN\n</b>               - In fact, killing people - they'd\n               get a lot more out of life.\n\n    We PULL AWAY from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers.\n    HELPMANN's voice carries over the rest of the scene.\n\n<b>                          INTERVIEWER\n</b>               Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to\n               those critics who maintain that the\n               Ministry Of Information has become\n               too large and unwieldy ...?\n\n<b>                           HELPMANN\n</b>               David ... in a free society\n               information is the name of the game.\n               You can't win the game if you're a\n               man short.\n\n    Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be\n    banks of snow but as we pan along with them the \"snow\"\n    turns out to be fire-fighting foam. It oozes out of a shop\n    front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames.\n    WORKMEN are busily sealing the opening with plywood\n    sheets, SHOPPERS pay no attention to this. Xmas carols are\n    being played by a Salvation Army style band calling\n    themselves Consumers For Christ. Santa Claus's grotto is\n    busy, all is well with the world.\n\n<b>                          INTERVIEWER\n</b>               And the cost of it all, Deputy\n               Minister?

These terrorists are not\n               pulling their weight, and it's\n               absolutely right and fair that those\n               found guilty should pay for their\n               periods of detention and the\n               Information Retrieval Procedures used\n               in their interrogation.\n\n    PULL BACK to reveal a rather clinical office. The TV rests\n    on a desk. A WHITE COATED TECHNICIAN is sorting out his in-\n    tray. Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork. He\n    comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open, to\n    discover a shiny, metal \"executive toy\".\n\n    CUT TO the BEETLE droning up near the ceiling.\n\n    The TECHNICIAN is disturbed by the buzz of the BEETLE as\n    it whirrs around the fluorescent light. He rolls up some\n    paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect.\n\nScenes 4-12 Deleted.                              4-12 Deleted.\n\n<b>13  INT.

He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the BEETLE\n    still buzzing about the room just out of reach. Beneath\n    him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away\n    compiling a typed list of names under the heading\n    \"Information Retrieval, Subjects For Detention &amp;\n    Interview\". The machine is being fed from a spool of paper\n    which is being rhythmically chopped by an automatic\n    guillotine which neatly leaves each name on a separate\n    sheet, with the title above each name, each sheet\n    following its predecessor into a holding basket. In CLOSE-\n    UP we see the names on the sheets of paper building up in\n    the holding basket: TONSTED, Simon ... TOPPER, Martin F.\n    ... TROLLOPE, Benjamin G. ... TURB, William K. ...

Our morale is much higher\n               than theirs, we're fielding all their\n               strokes, running a lot of them out,\n               and pretty consistently knocking them\n               for six. I'd say they're nearly out\n               of the game.\n<b>               \n</b>    The TECHNICIAN is tottering on one leg on the chair on the\n    desk as he strains to swat the BEETLE.

As the\n    TECHNICIAN clambers down from the rickety heights, the\n    BEETLE's carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops\n    silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs,\n    hesitates and then types the letter \"B\" and hesitates and\n    then continues so that the next name is BUTTLE, Archibald.\n\n    The TECHNICIAN fails to notice this and the machine\n    continues smoothly TUTWOOD, Thomas T. ...

Smaller\n    conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various\n    services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the\n    metal) supply to this household. A conventionally poor but\n    proud family occupies the room. MRS BUTTLE is reading\n    Dickens' Christmas Carol to GIRL BUTTLE who is about six.\n    BOY BUTTLE plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some\n    action men dressed in security gear. MR. BUTTLE is putting\n    the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present\n    which looks identical to the \"executive toy\" we have just\n    seen in he TECHNICIAN'S office.\n\n    Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter. A tilt of\n    the CAMERA indicates that the laughter is coming from the\n    floor above.\n\n<b>16  INT.

From\n    BILKO'S POV we look through an open door of a bathroom\n    straight at a mirror propped up by the bath, to enable the\n    person in the bath to watch the TV. The person in the bath\n    is JILL LAYTON, washing the grime off herself while she\n    watches Bilko in the mirror.

It's a raid! Battle-dressed SECURITY TROOPS smash\n    trough the door. Another ONE, swings from a rope, kicks in\n    the window from the outside and enters that way. Most\n    alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the\n    ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and\n    through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide\n    TWO MORE SECURITY TROOPS. The whole thing is short, brutal\n    and violent.\n<b>    \n</b>    BUTTLE is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike\n    canvas device that covers him from head to waist. A metal\n    clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back\n    of the bag. His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar. In\n    seconds he has become a canvas parcel. Meanwhile, GIRL\n    BUTTLE has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into\n    the lap of her screaming mother. BOY BUTTLE has his toy\n    machine gun knocked out of his hands by a TROOPER who we\n    see is identical in dress to the action men BOY BUTTLE has\n    been playing with. He rushes to his mother as guns are\n    viciously trained on them. TROOPS are kicking open the\n    doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job. An\n    OFFICIAL, wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front\n    door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an\n    official document. It goes something like this:\n\n<b>                           OFFICIAL\n</b>               I hereby inform you under powers\n               entrusted to me under Section 47,\n               Paragraph 7 of Council Order Number\n               438476, that Mr Buttle, Archibald,\n               residing at 412 North Tower, Shangri\n               La Towers, has been invited to assist\n               the Ministry of Information with\n               certain enquiries, the nature of\n               which may be ascertained on\n               completion of application form\n               BZ/ST/486/C fourteen days within this\n               date, and that he is liable to\n               certain obligations as specified in\n               Council Order 173497, including\n               financial restitutions which may or\n               may not be incurred if Information\n               Retrieval procedures beyond those\n               incorporated in Article 7 subsections\n               8, 10 &amp; 32 are required to elicit\n               information leading to permanent\n               arrest - notification of which will\n               he served with the time period of 5\n               working days as stipulated by law.

RECORD CLERK'S POOL                               21\n</b><b>    \n</b>    We come in on a CLOSE UP of a pink version of the RECEIPT\n    being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we PULL OUT to\n    reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal\n    desks, each desk with a built-in T.V. console, and each\n    (except one) occupied by a CLERK. Every desk is snowed\n    under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in\n    the previous scene. More pacers are delivered to each desk\n    intermittently by way of pneumatic tube. OFFICE BOYS\n    bustle about with even more paperwork. From the back of\n    the room we get a view of the screens which show graphs,\n    tabulations, figures ... All of this activity is\n    supervised from an elevated walkway by MR KURTZMAN.\n    Satisfied that all is well with his clerks he turns and\n    walks towards his glass enclosed private office at the top\n    of the room, his name lettered on the opaque glass door.\n\n    MR KURTZMAN goes through this door and as he closes it\n    behind him, all activity in the CLERKS pool ceases. each\n    CLERK adjusts his T.V. screen with the flick of a switch,\n    and all the screens change to something which looks very\n    like \"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\".\n\n<b>22  INT.   MR KURTZMAN'S OFFICE              DAY             22\n</b><b>    \n</b>    MR KURTZMAN also has a T.V. console. He sits behind his\n    desk, reaches for his In-tray, and without looking at the\n    console he turns his screen on. He looks through a number\n    of files in his In-tray. He is surprised to hear a VOICE\n    say, \"Turn around real slow, amigo\". MR KURTZMAN turns\n    around real slow, his expression relaxes, he thumps his\n    T.V. console with a large fist, and the screen obediently\n    flicks to a display of figures. He picks up a file which\n    we see as marked \"Buttle, Archibald\". He opens the file\n    and starts punching the keyboard of the console. The T.V.\n    starts bleeping in an alarmed way. MR KURTZMAN is puzzled.\n    He punches more figures. The screen starts to flash\n    \"Error, error, error\". MR KURTZMAN sighs with frustration.\n    He presses an intercom.\n<b>                          MR KURTZMAN\n</b>                    (into intercom)\n               Mr Lowry, will you step in here\n               please?\n<b>               \n</b>    He returns his attention, puzzled to the file. Nobody\n    comes into the office. MR KURTZMAN gets up and walks over\n    to his door and opens it. Beyond the door the room full of\n    CLERKS is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and\n    whirring consoles. From MR KURTZMAN'S POV we see that in\n    the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk.\n\n<b>                          MR KURTZMAN\n</b>               Does anyone know where Lowry is?\n\n    Nobody knows. MR KURTZMAN closes his door again. A moment\n    later it seems to him, and to us, that he has heard the\n    crash of six guns blazing away at each other. He re-opens\n    the door. The only sound again. He goes back to his desk.\n    He punches a few keys. The machine starts emitting even\n    more alarming beeps, then horse whinnies, then \"Admit\n    you're whupped, you drygulching scum\". KURTZMAN explodes\n    with anger, and presses the intercom again.\n\n<b>                          MR KURTZMAN\n</b>                    (Shouting into intercom)\n               Where the hell is Sam Lowry?!\n\n<b>23  EXT.   SKY                               DAY             23\n</b><b>    \n</b>    CUT TO brilliantly clear sky. From on high an odd bird-\n    like figure swoops down on the CAMERA. As it comes closer\n    we can see that it is, in fact, a MAN wearing strange wood\n    and metal bird wings. In the bright sunshine their\n    flapping movements create a brilliant, flashing effect.\n    Along with the wings, SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an\n    outfit that combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI\n    fighter pilot. He sweeps past the CAMERA and then,\n    banking, rises BACK INTO SHOT IN MCU. An ethereal voice\n    can be heard calling \"Sam ... Sam ... Sam\". He hovers,\n    looking beyond the CAMERA to something wonderful. CUT TO\n    face of stunningly beautiful GIRL, she is the idealised\n    twin of JILL LAYTON ... Her long hair swirls across her\n    face partially obscuring it and making her appear slightly\n    mysterious. The CAMERA PULLS AWAY from her as soft\n    billowing material sinuously undulates about her. It rises\n    and falls like waves carried on the wind. As the CAMERA\n    GLIDES BACK through this sea of gossamer we can see that\n    the GIRL is being held aloft by and in it. A vast\n    landscape stretches below her. The sun frames her in the\n    sky. She and SAM are engaged in a beautiful sensual aerial\n    ballet.\n<b>    \n</b>    Romantic music fills the soundtrack.\n<b>    \n</b>    SAM swoops up and away. The GIRL floats in the distance as\n    SAM. rises in the foreground. She beckons to him. SAM\n    begins to flap back towards her. But then the dreamy\n    quality of this scene is interrupted by threatening\n    rumble. SAM looks down.\n<b>    \n</b>    The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive,\n    monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and\n    soars upwards with a mighty rush.\n<b>    \n</b>    CUT to the GIRL in LONG SHOT. The monolith rises up into\n    FRAME partially cutting her off from view.\n<b>    \n</b>    Before SAM can do anything, another stone skyscraper\n    breaks through the ground and rushes upwards. Then another\n    and another. There is nothing SAM can do. The GIRL is\n    being cut of from him by these gigantic faceless\n    structures. And then she is finally lost from view\n    somewhere in the depths of this strange stone metropolis.\n    SAM lies closer. The stone skyscrapers appear to be solid.\n    No windows. No doors. Nothing whatsoever to interfere with\n    their clean, harsh, rectilinear design. As he flies among\n    these towering blocks he sees no sign of the GIRL, only\n    sheer walls rising high above him. Below him the walls\n    plummet vertiginously into the darkish streets. No sound\n    but the creaking flapping of his wings can he heard in\n    this dead place. Coming round a corner he sees something\n    in the distance. far below him a dark procession is\n    wending its way through the narrow passages... away from\n    him.\n<b>    \n</b>    CUT TO LOW ANGLE SHOT of the procession making its way\n    past the CAMERA. Black-robed and cowled, the sinister\n    figures look like heavily armed monks. These are the\n    FORCES OF DARKNESS. Together they are straining at several\n    heavy hawsers that rise in long arcs up to a huge metal\n    cage floating above and behind the procession. Binding the\n    cage are metal straps to which ropes are attached. Inside\n    is the GIRL - still enveloped in gossamer which billows as\n    if there were a breeze in constant attendance.\n<b>    \n</b>    CUT TO SAM as He dives out of shot.\n<b>    \n</b>    CUT to the FORCES OF DARKNESS suddenly stopping in their\n    tracks. They've seen something.\n<b>    \n</b>    CUT to their POV. There at the end of the passage between\n    two stone skyscrapers stands SAM ... barring the way.\n<b>    \n</b>    CUT to swords being unsheathed. Cowls being thrown back.\n    Underneath are rotting, broken dolls' faces. All the faces\n    are the same except for the manner in which they have\n    decayed. They smile - slobbering, sickeningly. Suddenly\n    the robed bodies change shape - some rising up to become\n    long, others expanding sideways to become bulbous, others\n    shrinking. From the folds of cloth come evil weapons. The\n    FORCES are massed ready to charge.\n    CUT to long shot of SAM. He removes his arms from his\n    wings and folds the wings behind him. He is ready.\n<b>    \n</b>    Cut to the FORCES. Nothing moves ... except for the\n    constant dribble from their cracked mouths.\n\n    CUT back to SAM. Stillness. The tension is unbearable.\n    Suddenly SAM unleashes a terrifying scream and charges the\n    fearsome horde. Unarmed!\n\n    CUT to the FORCES thundering down to SAM. Weapons flailing\n    madly.\n\n    SAM skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading\n    field, and karate chops him senseless - at the same time\n    catching his sword as he falls. Spinning around he parries\n    a spearthrust and skewers a third attacker. Slash! Hack!\n    Stab! He lays waste to the FORCES. Nothing can stop this\n    boy. The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing\n    of SAM's sword. Wham! Bam! Smash! SAM carves his way\n    through the mob with nary a scratch. And then, suddenly,\n    they are all dead, but a heap of blackness to commemorate\n    SAM's prowess. The GIRL is beaming as SAM makes his way\n    toward the hawsers holding the cage. But then a noise\n    behind him makes him turn. There, behind him the pile of\n    black shapes begin to rise. The ropes become a mass of\n    flapping black cloth. This evil churning cloud coalesces\n    and lifts off the ground. The horrible flapping apparition\n    emits a terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away. SAM\n    is about to rush after it to halt its escape but is\n    stopped by the sound of a telephone ringing. He looks\n    around - confused.\n\n<b>24  INT.   SAM'S BEDROOM                     MORNING         24\n</b>\n    TIGHT SHOT of telephone. The ringing continues. A hand\n    grapples with the receiver. SAM is in bed in a darkened\n    room. Sleepily he drags receiver to his ear.\n\n<b>                              SAM\n</b>               Hello ... What ... what? Oh ... Mr\n               Kurtzman! ... You're up late. Oh, is\n               it?\n\n    There is an electronic box of tricks by his bed,\n    incorporating an alarm. SAM thumps it. The alarm goes off.\n    This sets of a series of other things ... The window\n    shutters roll up letting in the morning light. Both taps\n    turn on in the bathroom ...\n\n<b>                              SAM\n</b>                    (into phone)\n               The electronics here are up the\n               spout. Yours too, sir? Don't worry\n               sir - I'll be there.\n\n    SAM puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is\n    moving towards him. Noticing one of his film posters is\n    loose he pushes the pin in firmly.\n<b>    \n</b>    In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up. In the sitting\n    room the television switches on. Back in the bedroom a\n    cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with\n    SAM's clothes neatly hanging - ready to be put on. SAM\n    comes out of the bathroom, having turned off the bath\n    taps, and starts to get dressed. In the kitchen the coffee-\n    maker has finished making s small pot of coffee. SAM pours\n    a quick cup and is gone at the door. Throughout all this\n    we have had a chance to get a glimpse of SAM's flat. It is\n    functional, soulless and, though neat, has not been\n    assembled with a loving hand. Most of the furnishings are\n    built in. The walls are divided into two-foot square metal\n    panels painted a non-committal colour. Certain of the wall\n    panels have Central Services logos on them with the\n    admonition \"Do not obstruct or remove\" below. SAM has\n    livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film\n    posters. The sitting room sports several framed pictures\n    of wide beautiful vistas.\n\n<b>25  INT.

SAM\n    happens to glance up at this moment. He is startled - the\n    over-exposed TV image is the face of the GIRL FROM THE\n    DREAM. The face is only there a few seconds before being\n    replaced by another picture. SAM looks about to see where\n    the GIRL is, but JILL, in overalls, has her back to him as\n    she stands in the queue for the Information desk and so\n    there is no-one even vaguely reminiscent of the DREAM\n    GIRL.

Except for the unfortunate\n    intrusion of metal tubing and ducting brutally thrusting\n    across areas of the ceiling, occasionally penetrating\n    right through the middle of a particularly valuable-\n    looking mirror, the general effect is one of confident\n    wealth and breeding.

A\n               place where they will never be able\n               to get at us ... ever.\n<b>    \n</b>    An eyeball is scanning the sky. PULLING BACK we see it is\n    but one of thousands, tightly packed side by side forming\n    a landscape that extends as far as we can see. As SAM and\n    the GIRL in her cage come into view it becomes apparent\n    just how big these eyeballs are - they are gigantic -\n    about 10 feet in diameter. All of them follow SAM as he\n    comes to rest on a platform high atop a column that rises\n    from the centre of this bizarre place.\n<b>    \n</b><b>                              SAM\n</b>               There's no way they can approach us\n               without being seen. You're safe here.\n<b>    \n</b>    He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his\n    wings. Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a\n    terrific cracking noise is heard. SAM freezes.\n<b>    \n</b>    A dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere\n    beyond the horizon - running right up the sky and over the\n    camera. SAM follows it as it continues over the GIRL and\n    down to the opposite horizon. Another crackling noise is\n    heard. Another crack appears. Then another. And another.\n    All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over\n    the horizon. Soon the sky is covered with these cracks\n    from horizon to foreground. Then cracks begin appearing at\n    right angles to them. Very quickly the sky is covered with\n    a mammoth grid. Once it is complete, another noise is\n    heard. Something like massive blocks of stone sliding\n    against one another. One of the squares formed by the grid\n    pattern begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out\n    from the back side of the sky. A square hole is left in\n    its place. We can see the sides of the hole as it extends\n    upwards into blackness. As soon as this first block of sky\n    is withdrawn, another begins to slide up and away. SAM is\n    frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on\n    above him. The eyeballs are madly looking this way and\n    that. The grinding noises are deafening as block after\n    block of sky is removed. With each successive loss the\n    light decreases. The GIRL is crying out for SAM to save\n    her. Frantically SAM tries to haul the cage down to the\n    platform but it's too late.\n<b>    \n</b>    Where the sky was is now pitch black. Only one block of\n    sky remains. Slowly that final bit of sky is pulled up and\n    out of shot. Total blackness. A maniacal laughter can be\n    heard. A beam of light is switched on. SAM has a\n    searchlight in his hand and is searching the darkness. The\n    laughter continues. Suddenly the beam catches something\n    black and moving. it's the same black, flapping cloth that\n    appeared at the end of the previous dream. The horrible\n    flapping thing comes thundering down on SAM.\n<b>    \n</b>    He is engulfed in the black awfulness.\n<b>    \n</b><b>30  INT.

The room is\n    oppressively hot. He gets up and looks at the thermostat.\n    It reads 99. He fumbles with it, but to no avail. It's\n    stuck.\n<b>    \n</b>    CUT to SAM coming into the sitting room. He rushes over to\n    the window and tries to open it. But it wasn't designed to\n    be opened. Screws hold it firmly shut. SAM heads to the\n    kitchen He finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the\n    window. He swings the window open and takes a deep breath.\n    GAG! COUGH! HACK! A terrible greeny-brown smog pours in\n    through the window. Desperately SAM shuts the window and\n    madly tightens up the screws. Swinging a newspaper, he\n    tries clearing a path through the clouded atmosphere. He\n    makes it to the front door and staggers out into the hall\n    gasping for air.\n    CUT to telephone being lifted from its cradle. Pull back\n    as SAM with opened telephone directory in front of him\n    dials. He is seated in his kitchen. In front of his open\n    refrigerator.

The door\n    is open and he has wedged a chair into the gap in a\n    desperate bid to keep cool. He is nodding off. As his head\n    slumps against one of the shelves, a jar of pickled onions\n    falls to the floor. The onions scattering everywhere.\n<b>    \n</b><b>31  EXT.   DARKNESS                          NIGHT           31\n</b><b>    \n</b>    The milky white spheres tumble everywhere. But they are\n    not onions, they are the giant eyeballs burtling through\n    space. SAM is clinging desperately to one. He grabs the\n    pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch\n    cover. SAM manages to pull himself inside. Once out of the\n    intergalactic maelstrom, SAM turns to survey the cramped\n    and dark space inside the eyeball. It seems to be bisected\n    by a dividing wall, from which a thin sliver of light is\n    escaping. Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit, SAM\n    is able to move a section. More light shaftes into the\n    tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a\n    small hatch. SAM scrunches down and really puts his\n    shoulder to the hatch. with a metallic rasp it gives way\n    and SAM crashes through.\n<b>    \n</b>    CUT to other side of opening as SAM topples through. He\n    catches himself in the nick of time as the camera zooms\n    back revealing his close call with disaster. He is high on\n    a vast wall of what looks like filing cabinets. The hatch\n    he came through was the front of one of the millions of\n    files-drawers composing this wall. As he scrambles back\n    into the opening we can see that the wall drops away for\n    hundreds of feet, disappear into a steaming mist. Other\n    walls of files enclose this vast space. From where SAM is\n    it looks like the view from the 50th storey of the Time\n    Life building in NYC. These millions of files are being\n    tended by MEN arising themselves up and down, as well as\n    sideways, on modern skyscraper window-cleaners' platforms.\n    The attendants are seen putting PEOPLE in different period\n    costumes into drawers. SAM's attention is distracted by a\n    sound overhead. Looking up he sees a window washer\n    platform being lowered in his direction. Leaning over the\n    side is a JOLLY GENT, who happens to look like MR HELPMANN\n    (as seen on TV).\n<b>    \n</b><b>                             GENT\n</b>               Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.\n<b>    \n</b><b>                              SAM\n</b>               What?

A mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the\n    floor. The BOY is all over SAM kicking and pulling his\n    hair. MRS BUTTLE's reaction, however, is to try and pull\n    the BOY away from SAM. By the time she succeeds, SAM is on\n    his hands and knees, in pain. The BOY is crying and\n    shouting, and MRS BUTTLE is loudly trying to quieten the\n<b>    BOY.\n</b><b>    \n</b>    From SAM'S POV, a piece of broken mirror lying on the\n    floor reflects the hole in the ceiling ... with JILL's\n    head and shoulders framed in the hole.

He looks for the\n    vision on the floor but can't find it. Then he begins to\n    realise the reality of what he has seen. He stands up,\n    dazed and battered. MRS BUTTLE has been looking up at the\n    ceiling. SAM looks up at the ceiling but there is now only\n    the empty space of the hole.\n<b>    \n</b><b>                              SAM\n</b>               Wait! Stop!

Wall panels are\n    off. Tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room\n    like greasy intestines. SAM more or less collapses onto a\n    couch. He stares at the ceiling. The room is gently\n    hiccoughing and belching around him. He stares at the\n    print-out of JILL's face. Slowly it dissolves into the\n<b>    DREAM GIRL.\n</b><b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>51  EXT.   CONDUIT FOREST                    NIGHT           51\n</b><b>    \n</b>    DREAM GIRL's face fills screen. The camera pulls back to\n    reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest\n    of conduit/ducting-like vines. SAM is struggling through\n    the vines, which grab at him, entwine and entangle him.\n    Finally bursting free he reaches out for the GIRL hovering\n    before him, But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke\n    and he plummet into a void beneath his feet.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>52  EXT.

Somehow he manages to wrestle it\n    clear of his body. Gripping the corners he whips the cape\n    up and over his head. The wind catches it and fills it out\n    until it acts as a parachute slowing SAM's descent.\n    Suddenly the clouds thin out and SAM can see below him.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>53  EXT.   STRANGE LANDSCAPE                 ANTI-DAY        53\n</b><b>    \n</b>    SAM is heading down towards a barren landscape. Strange\n    mounds dot the barrenness - they ooze smoke and the\n    occasional flame. Near one of the mounds are two long\n    lines of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant\n    cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. The\n    black-robed FORCES OF DARKNESS (FOD) surround the\n    PRISONERS, relentlessly herding them towards the cages.\n    The entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light.\n    The sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a\n    black disc. SAM descends on his cape-parachute.\n<b>    \n</b>    CUT to PRISONERS in their grey shrouds, shuffling towards\n    the jaws of the brutal cages. They are defeated,\n    destroyed, without hope. The FOD prod and whip them\n    forward. One of the FOD raises his spear to force a\n    stumbling PRISONER to his feet but stops with the spear\n    raised above his head. He has seen something. Other FODS\n    turn to see what it is. CUT to SAM landing on the beach -\n    a short distance away. The PRISONERS stop and look up. We\n    see their faces clearly for the first time. One of them is\n    MRS BUTTLE. Others are PEOPLE SAM saw in the flats, and\n    the KIDS. SAM recognises them. He is slightly taken aback.\n    A look of determination crosses his face. He draws the\n    sword. EVERYONE is frozen in place. SAM starts forward.\n    But he is stopped by a violent tremor as the earth begins\n    to tremble and shake. EVERYONE looks terrified. With a\n    mighty roar a crack opens up in the ground between SAM and\n    the OTHERS. Brilliant rays of light shaft upwards from the\n    opening. And then, with a maniacal shriek, the large black\n    flapping thing shoots out of the crevasse and streaks high\n    into the sky. SAM hesitates and turns to look down into\n    the light. There, under several meters of the earth's\n    crust are fluffy white clouds darting about in a beautiful\n    blue sky. SAM is delighted but as he looks up he is frozen\n    in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE that straddles the\n    crevasse. This terrifying CREATURE stands over 12 feet\n    high. He is encased in a frightening concoction of ancient\n    Japanese armour which seems on closer examination to he\n    made of computer parts. His face is hidden behind a\n    horrific steel mask. It is the GIANT SAMURAI WARRIOR that\n    was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom Of\n    Knowledge. In his hand is an evil-looking spear. SAM is\n    unsure which way to turn. The GREY PRISONERS are being\n    loaded into the cages with more speed. He turns to face\n    the GIANT WARRIOR. As SAM steps forward the GIANT stands\n    ominously still. Then very slowly he raises his spear in\n    an almost religious gesture. POOF! He vanishes. As he does\n    the light from the day is cut off. Looking down, SAM sees\n    that he crevasse has vanished as well. Maniacal laughter\n    from the flapping black thing makes SAM look up to see the\n    ballooned cage packed with GREY PRISONERS rise up from the\n    ground and begin to float away escorted by the Black\n    flapping Thing. SAM rushes after it grabbing one of the\n    trailing ropes. But as he is hoisted into the air it is\n    severed by the FODS. He tumbles to the ground. Looking\n    around he sees that, for some reason, the second ballooned\n    cage is still tethered nearby. SAM rushes over to it and\n    begins chopping the tethers away.\n    The cage bobbles ungainlily as SAM cuts the last\n    restraining rope. Grabbing hold he is pulled upwards, but\n    before he can reach the cage something clutches his leg\n    halting his progress. As he struggles his other leg is\n    caught. He is being pulled back by two giant hands.\n    Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the\n    smoking mounds a head and two giant arms protrude. The\n    face looks like MR KURTZMAN. SAM desperately clings on to\n    the rope as he struggles with the restraining hands.\n<b>    \n</b><b>                   MR KURTZMAN OF THE MOUND\n</b>               Don't go! It's a trap! She's not what\n               she seems.\n<b>    \n</b>    SAM kicks and strains but the hands hold firm.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>54  INT.

As he\n    untangles himself the door bell rings. It takes a moment\n    for SAM to recognise it as the door bell. Annoyed and\n    still disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the\n    door. He opens it. In bursts a GIRL dressed in a silly\n    bell-boy costume with lots of glitter, net stockings and\n    big-bowed tap dancing shoes.

It is about four feet\n    wide. A small blacked-out window high on the far wall is\n    bisected by what looks like a recently constructed side\n    wall. The room is bare except for a chair and a desk which\n    is also bisected by the new wall. Pneumatic tubes hang\n    from the ceiling.

He doesn't know where to\n    begin because there's nothing to begin with. He squeezes\n    in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do\n    starts arranging his \"in\" and \"out\" baskets. There in his\n    \"in\" basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys -\n    gaily wrapped with a card from HELPMANN - Merry Xmas &amp;\n    Welcome. SAM can't quite believe. He returns to lining up\n    his pencils, placing a couple of bocks (phone books)\n    against the wall on the left extreme of his desk. SAM\n    turns his attention away from the books when suddenly they\n    both fall over with a \"plop\". Puzzled, he stands the books\n    up again, turns his eyes away and \"plop\". Same result.\n    Intrigued, a bit exasperated, SAM carefully, and before\n    his very eyes, the desk begins to disappear into the wall,\n    and \"plop\", the books topple over. Puzzled, SAM grabs hold\n    of the desk and begins to try to pull it back through the\n    wall. The desk moves back an inch or so, but then stops,\n    somehow held stubbornly. SAM grits his teeth, reallllly\n    pulls, grimacing a bit, but the desk won't budge.\n    Intrigued, SAM gets up, goes around his desk and heads for\n    the door.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>63  INT.

ICY SEA                           ANTI-DAY        65\n</b><b>    \n</b>    The CAMERA skims along over an icy sea. This is SAM'S POV\n    as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming\n    wings. In the distance rises a strange massive ship.\n<b>    \n</b>    As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing\n    heavily to one side. In fact it is barely afloat. Closer\n    still, it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone.\n    Dark, evil, grey blocks of granite form not only the hull,\n    but the super-structures and smokestacks. It looks like a\n    massive medieval fortress gone to sea. The screen is\n    engulfed in stone. The CAMERA heads up the side of the\n    ship. Higher and higher we climb - past course after\n    course of mammoth stones. Reaching the first deck, we\n    continue upwards. There appears to be no entrance. SAM is\n    looking frustrated and angry. But then he spots an\n    opening. A few stones have come loose - one of them juts\n    out forming a ledge. As the cage passes, SAM jumps and\n    managed to gain a foothold on the outcropping. Squeezing\n    thru the gap in the rocks, he makes his way thru a dark\n    passage. Emerging from the opening he finds himself\n    teetering over an enormous abyss formed by the outer hull\n    and the inner stone core of the ship. Great stone ribs\n    curve downwards thru the darkness broken only by narrow\n    shafts of brilliant light streaming from occasional cracks\n    and fissures in the stone core. For a brief moment SAM\n    gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of the openings but\n    his attention is distracted by a distant moan. Huddled far\n    below him at the bottom of the dark abyss are hundreds of\n    grey shrouded PRISONERS. Their moan blends with the creaks\n    and groans of the stones as the ship slowly wallows back\n    and forth. Suddenly a great boom resounds throughout the\n    ship. SAM is unsure where it comes from. And then another\n    boom reverberates about him. He has to steady himself as\n    the ship quivers from the noise. Another book. He clutches\n    at the wall.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>66  INT.   SAM'S OFFICE                      DAY            66\n</b><b>    \n</b>    SAM's head is leaning against the wall of his office.

An antique desk\n    with a large collection of executive toys and other\n    tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a\n    rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall\n    of the much larger room that SAM was stopped from\n    entering. Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently\n    successful. A buzzing noise draws SAM's attention to the\n    wash basin in the far corner.

Angrily he pushes the correct floor number\n    but before the doors close he hears an angry woman's voice\n    echoing through the massive lobby. He looks in the\n    direction of the porters desk. There stands JILL arguing\n    with the PORTER.\n<b>    \n</b><b>                             JILL\n</b>               But you've stamped this form before!\n               Why won't you stamp it now?\n<b>    \n</b><b>                            PORTER\n</b>               You've just said yourself, Miss,\n               we've already stamped it.

Madly he pushes\n    the buttons - to no effect. The lift descends. (At this\n    point we had better describe the lift. It is a cross\n    between the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille\n    doors and the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall\n    in glass tubes so that one can have panoramic views of\n    dramatic architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the\n    Ministry.)\n<b>    \n</b>    SAM can see JILL and if JILL were to look up she could see\n    SAM descending.

TWO TECHNICIANS are\n    waiting as the doors open. From SAM's POV he sees them\n    hang a sign on the door and walk away. He bangs the\n    buttons for another moment with no result. He looks out of\n    the lift and is able to read the sign - \"LIFT OUT OF\n    ORDER\". Frantically he looks around for another lift. All\n    the others are on distant floors - then he spots one off\n    to one side, its doors standing open. Rushing over to it\n    he leaps inside and reaches to push the floor number - but\n    there are no numbers on the buttons, only letters.

On the edge of this devastated area he sees\n    JILL struggling out from under a pile of negligees and\n    plaster dust.

SAM rushes towards\n    them and begins to pull them loose, But before he can, a\n    great cracking noise reverberates thru the ship and a\n    black shadow falls across SAM and the wings. Looking round\n    he saees the inner wall has split open to the level of the\n    floor - but, blocking the opening is the GIANT SAMURAI\n    WARRIOR. SAM draws his sword and rushes toward the GIANT.\n    The GIANT stands ominously still. Then very slowly he\n    raises his spear in front of himself in an almost\n    religious gesture. Poof! He vanishes! SAM is confused.\n    Suddenly a PRISONER shouts a warning and SAM spins round\n    just in time to avoid a slash of the spear by the gigantic\n    WARRIOR who is now standing directly behind him. SAM\n    parries a couple more thrusts of the spear and then\n    strikes with his sword. At thin air! The GIANT has\n    vanished again. SAM can't figure it out. But he hears\n    something whoosh and instinctively dodges as the GIANT who\n    is once again behind him brings the spear crashing down.\n    Again SAM manages a few parries as he is forced backwards.\n    He trips and falls to the ground. The spear goes into the\n    ground.\n<b>    \n</b>    Before the GIANT can wrench the spear loose, SAM slashes\n    at him with his sword. But again the GIANT disappears. SAM\n    spins around. The GIANT is a short distance from him. SAM\n    rushes him. Again he vanishes. This time he reappears next\n    to the spear and tries to free it. But SAM attacks again\n    and the GIANT is forced to do his vanishing act before he\n    can recover the spear. SAM is becoming exasperated with\n    his behaviour, and as the GIANT reappears he shouts at him\n    to hold still, at the same time throwing his sword at the\n    big fellow. The sword pins the GIANT's foot to the ground\n    before he can disappear. Instead of blood pouring from the\n    wound, fire issues forth. SAM takes advantage of the\n    situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground.\n    The GIANT is unable to escape as SAM charges, but manages\n    to dodge a bit. However the spear catches his arm and\n    opens a gash. Again fire pours out. As the big GUY tries\n    to stop the fire, SAM charges again. This time he succeeds\n    in striking dead centre. The GIANT gasps as fire gushes\n    from his chest. He staggers and crashes to the ground. The\n    wounds continue to bleed fire.\n<b>    \n</b>    SAM gets his breath back and approaches the fallen\n    WARRIOR. Reaching down he removed the GIANT's mask. Fire\n    rushes forth from all the facial orifices. But the thing\n    that makes him catch his breath is the face itself. It's\n    his ... SAM's! While he stares in amazement the fire\n    begins to melt the face. In a moment it is unrecognizable.\n    SAM stands there stunned. Somewhere in the distance a bell\n    tolls.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>118 EXT.

A church bell tolls in the distance.\n    SAM is definitely spooked. He scrambles to his feet. He's\n    got to get out of here. He heads off down the passageway\n    but is brought quickly to a halt. There, in the shadows,\n    is SOMEONE smoking a cigarette. He hesitates and reverses\n    direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice\n    comes from behind him.\n<b>    \n</b><b>                             JILL\n</b>               You're late.\n<b>    \n</b>    SAM spins around.

The CAMERA tracks back\n    frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an\n    unbelievably vast room. The walls curve up and out of\n    sight.\n<b>    \n</b>    The floor doesn't seem to be a floor at all - strange\n    light undulates beneath. The whole effect is one of total\n    disorientation and overwhelming size. SAM is desperately\n    trying to take it in. Next to the chair is a porcelain\n    tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments.\n    Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at\n    hand. As the GUARDS leave SAM to take up their positions\n    near the distant door they hand over documents to the\n    white-coated INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OFFICER.\n<b>    \n</b><b>                             GUARD\n</b>               11/AFT/607, sir.\n<b>    \n</b>    They all sign the document which the I.R. OFFICER retains\n    after giving carbon copies to the GUARDS. The GUARDS then\n    proceed to the door and take up positions on either side\n    of it. The I.R. OFFICER heads toward SAM. We can now see\n    he wears a mask. It is the face of the FORCES OF DARKNESS.\n    A smiling baby doll face. SAM sits, mesmerized, watching\n    him approach. Within fifteen or twenty yards of SAM the\n    I.R. OFFICER comes to an abrupt halt. He seems to sway.\n    After a moment he turns slightly, hesitantly, giving the\n    impression that he may return to the door. He looks at the\n    GUARDS, pauses, straightens himself up, takes a deep\n    breath and continues again towards SAM, rather more\n    briskly than before. SAM watches, terrified and\n    fascinated. The I.R. OFFICER goes to the table which is\n    covered with evil-looking surgical-type instruments - he\n    blunders clumsily into it, knocking a couple of them onto\n    the floor. He picks then up quickly and replaces them.\n<b>    \n</b><b>                              SAM\n</b>               Jack?\n<b>    \n</b>    The I.R.

The SHOPPERS go about their programmed business\n    paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them.\n    Searching the CROWD, SAM spots TUTTLE making his way\n    towards him. TUTTLE is having a bit of trouble walking\n    against the steadily increasing wind. As he proceeds\n    across an open area a blown piece of paper. catches on his\n    foot. He tries shaking it off.\n<b>    \n</b>    It remains firmly stuck. While he is struggling with the\n    piece of paper another, larger piece catches his other\n    leg.

He is having\n    difficulty staying upright. Twisting this way and that he\n    tries to free himself, but more and more paper covers him.\n    He is practically obscured from view. SAM can't believe\n    what he is seeing. SHOPPERS continue about their business,\n    apparently unaware of TUTTLE'S terrible plight. Apart from\n    ONE SHOPPER who loses control of her shopping trolley -\n    and watches it career down the steps of the shopping\n    precinct. By now TUTTLE is totally encased in this cocoon\n    of litter. He is now just a ball of paper writhing about\n    on the ground. SAM has to do something. He rushes out from\n    his hiding place and tries to pull the litter off TUTTLE.\n    The pieces come loose with surprising ease. The wind\n    carries them away as SAM frantically tears at the pile.\n    But there is no sign of TUTTLE. Nothing. The last few\n    pieces of paper flutter away leaving SAM standing there\n    with a couple of posters in his hands. He realises that he\n    is suddenly very visible.

PEOPLE begin to scatter, screaming. The\n    TROOPS spot SAM who dashes away from his MOTHER and heads\n    for a door behind the altar. In his panic he crashes\n    against the coffin which topples over spilling its\n    contents ... a hundredweight of offal. SAM covers his\n    mouth and dashes through the door.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>145 EXT.   MAZE-LIKE DARK PASSAGES           NIGHT          145\n</b><b>    \n</b>    CUT to SAM, really dashing madly, tripping over things,\n    hurting himself, getting up running.\n    He is in a maze of machinery. Every way he turns his path\n    seems blocked by either TROOPS or FIGURES from his dreams.\n    The walls of the maze become more simplified as he goes\n    deeper into it. More rectangular, higher. We see a top\n    shot of the maze with SAM separate from the pursuing\n    FORCES but they are closing in on him from all sides. The\n    maze extends as far as we can see. SAM turns left and\n    right through it, always there is a chance of turnings.\n    Until ... he rounds a corner and for the first time there\n    is nowhere to go. The maze leads straight ahead to a dead\n    end.\n    At the end of the maze is a great pile of detritus from\n    the consumer society. Televisions, washing machines, hair\n    dryers, junk. SAM can do nothing but try to dig through\n    this pile.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b>    Maybe he can defend himself with something here. He\n    scrabbles away. Looking back he sees the massed AGENTS,\n    TROOPS, FORCES OF DARKNESS heading toward him. No escape.\n    He digs, harder, faster. Junk flies everywhere. He\n    actually reaches the end wall. Back to it, he turns to\n    face the foe. But as he moves against the wall his hand\n    touches something. A door knob. He turns. It's a door. The\n    knob turns easily. The door swings open. SAM dives through\n    it.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>146 INT.

He tries to lock the door behind him but there is\n    no key. He puts his weight against the door to keep it\n    shut. From outside there is the general noise of pursuit\n    but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet\n    uniform engine-sound. SAM lets go of the door carefully.\n    He looks around but there is only one window and it is\n    shuttered. He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-\n<b>    \n</b>    SAM'S POV: A rapidly receding street.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>147 EXT.

He picks himself up,\n    and, fighting the centrifugal force, works his way to the\n    shuttered window which is at the front end of the house,\n    in the wall opposite the door. SAM undoes the shutters and\n    finds himself looking at the rear window of JILL's cab. He\n    sees the back of the DRIVER's head. The DRIVER is wearing\n    JILL's cap. He sees the back of the DRIVER's cab. He bangs\n    on the glass of the cab. The DRIVER raises her head so\n    that the face is visible to SAM in the driving mirror. He\n    sees that it is JILL, in a flat cap. She smiles at him.\n    SAM sobs with relief and love.\n<b>    \n</b><b>    \n</b><b>149 EXT.

Creepers and wild roses have grown\n    up over the truck and some of the house. A curl of smoke\n    rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to\n    one of the walls. A small piece of ground around the truck\n    has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a\n    vegetable plat. There is also a pretty cow, and some\n    chickens.
