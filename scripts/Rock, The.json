In the military, they are called\n\t\tCourts Martial. This country has places where lessons a-re leaned.  They\n\t\tare called schools.

An insurrection against a government to which we have\n\t\tsworn allegiance.  Everyone in this room must understand that.\n\nHummel looks from face to face, studying each.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHUMMEL \n\t\tThe question is what kind of traitor are we.  Coward or lion? \n\t\tBenedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson?  I have posed that question to\n\t\tmyself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear.

I happen to share General Hummells view.\n\n\n\nThe door opens.  A NAVAL ATTACHE pokes his head in.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNAVAL ATTACHE \n\t\tGeneral, it's him.

General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat,\n\t\tignorant mouth.

Remember the Gulf War.  Those pretty \"smart bomb\" pictures\n\t\ton C.N.N.? My men lased those targets.  Ten were left to rot outside\n\t\tBaghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu,\n\t\tgentlemen.  No benefits were paid to their families; no medals\n\t\tconferred.  These men died for their country and they weren't even given\n\t\ta coddamn military burial. \n\t\t\t\t\t(beat) \n\t\tThis situation will not stand: you\n\t\twill transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman \"Red Sea Trading\n\t\tCompany\" account to an account I designate.  From these funds,\n\t\treparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83\n\t\tmarines, families.  The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's\n\t\texpenses.

DIRECTOR WOMACK \n\t\tWhat did Hummel mean by \",standard countermeasure,\" General?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGENERAL PETERSON \n\t\tNapalm.  Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm.  \n\t\tIt burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation.  The problem is\n\t\tthat V.X. gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm. \n\t\tHummel must know about Willy Peter, General.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGENERAL KRAMER \n\t\t'Course he does. \n\t\t\t\t\t(explaining to others) \n\t\t\"Willy Peter,\" short for \"White Phosphorous Incendiary Device,\" still \n\t\tin its test phase.  It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up V.X. \n\t\t\t\t\t(dawning on him) \n\t\tThat explains Hummells time frame.  He knows we're not\n\t\toperational.  What would it take, General?\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGENERAL PETERSON \n\t\tTo equip a flight of F-16s with Willy Peter in 36\n\t\thours?  An act of God. \n\t\t\t\t\t(off Kramer's look) \n\t\tAll right, we can try.
