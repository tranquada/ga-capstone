But there is just one story. Because we\nblend into one developing narrative the lives that we\nshow.\n\nThere is no suggestion of time travel or re-incarnation\nor any other tricksy or mystic device. We can do in real\ntime and with real characters what other movies strive to\ndo with immortal time travellers and ghosts. Our story\nis thoroughly based in reality and the magic we are\ndealing with is real, human magic.\nIn moving from one character to the next everything will\nchange; supporting characters, setting, period. But the\nessential situation of our hero of the moment will relate\nto the one before and the one following.\nThe magic will be in the transitions, in leaving one\ncharacter and advancing the film through hundreds or\nthousands of years to find our next hero in tantalizingly\nsimilar human circumstances. The effect of these transi-\ntions across space and time, will let the audience grasp\nthe simple truth behind our story; that we are all in it\ntogether.\nThe key to allowing the audience to enjoy this human\nconnection at the heart of the film is that one actor\nwill play the six individuals. The feeling will be of\nthe endless, glorious playing and replaying of the simple\ndrama of being alive.\nWe end the film with a present-day hero, but by that time\nwe will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh\nlight, feeling his kinship with the caveman and the slave\nand the others who have gone before. The resolution of\nhis contemporary story is theirs also. By then perhaps,\nwe will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec-\ntive, too.\n\nAnd the structure of the film itself has the thrill of\nnovelty. It has never before been used in cinema.\nNever. Our six characters and their stories connect in\nmany different ways, some obvious, others vague, tanta-\nlizing threads. Even global connections are made, as the\nplanet itself and all its people, come and go in the\nstory. For the audience the game of making the connec-\ntions, feeling the bonds, even inventing or discovering\nassociations of their own, will be endless in this big-\ngest of stories, smallest of stories. It is truly a new\ncinematic experience.                                       *\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                       *\n</b>\n<b>                             BEING HUMAN\n</b>      Hector is a family man. He and his woman and two\n      children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a\n      hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance\n      by a covering of branches and brush. Just inside a small\n      fire smoulders permanently, a few times a day encouraged\n      into life for cooking or warmth. If it ever went out it\n      would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com-\n      fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family.\n      Hector doesn't know that his name is Hector. It is\n      simply a convenience to help us tell his story. The idea\n      of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not\n      yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. Hector\n      is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of\n      Christ, in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet. In\n      his entire life Hector will traverse no more than ten\n      square miles of it.\n\n\n<b>      FADE IN:\n</b><b>      FIRST IMAGE\n</b>      is the reflection of Hector's face in a rock pool. The\n      image suddenly fragments. Hector is enjoying himself,\n      deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his\n      image reforms itself and then is disrupted again. When\n      he is finished, a trace of vanity makes him bend down\n      closer to his reflection. He strokes his long hair and\n      fingers a blemish on his cheek.\n      Then he is aware of another presence. He sharply turns.\n      Some way off a solitary figure stands on the rise of some\n      rocks, not afraid to show itself. Hector calls out.\n<b>                               HECTOR\n</b>                 Go back home... leave me alone...\n\n      We see that the figure is a young BOY, Hector's son.     The\n      Boy thinks about it for a moment, before turning and\n      disappearing behind the rocks.\n\n<b>1-4   TITLE SCENES                                               1-4\n</b>\n      The small fire that never goes out has been enlarged to\n      cook the day's meal. Beyond the fire on a rock shelf\n      HECTOR plays with his children, a GIRL of six and Boy of\n      eight. It is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge\n      in, but in 4000 BC possibly rougher than normal. Hector\n      is acting the part of some trapped wild animal, lashing\n      out at the hunters surrounding him. But in his act of\n      wild rage he gets carried away. He picks up his son and\n      throws him hard, much too hard, on his back.\n\n<b>                                                 (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                            2.           *\n</b>\n<b>1-4   CONTINUED:                                                   1-4\n</b>      The Boy tumbles down   from the shelf to the cave floor at\n      his mother, DEIRDRE's   feet, howling in pain. Deidre\n      scowls at Hector. If    the gesture had been invented he\n      would probably shrug   his shoulders. The Boy howls on.\n      Hector kneels beside his daughter, absorbed in her antics\n      as she sleeps. She is a vivid dreamer. Her whole little\n      form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy\n      unspooling in her head. She emits unearthly nighttime\n      noises, squeals and giggles and moans. Hector is fasci-\n      nated. Where has his daughter gone? Who is this strange\n      wild creature that has taken her form, lying beside him?\n      Hector's daughter delights him. And while Hector watches\n      his daughter, Deirdre from their bed watches Hector.\n\n      It is almost dawn, the cave is quiet and the fire has\n      diminished. By its light we see Deirdre and Hector making\n      love, on their bed of dried grass and skins. It's diffi-\n      cult to say what their lovemaking might look like. What\n      has 6000 years done to that art? We will think about it.\n      On the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children.\n      As we MOVE CLOSER we see that they are far from sleep.\n      Two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover.\n      We CUT BETWEEN them, the loving parents and the watching,\n      learning children.\n      Hector is arguing with his son, just outside their cave.\n      The Boy wants to go foraging with him again.\n\n<b>                                 HECTOR\n</b>                   No... stay here... stay!\n      Hector takes a few steps.    The Boy follows.\n\n<b>                                 HECTOR\n</b>                   No... go back... go away...\n\n      Hector walks on again, taking big, angry father strides.\n      The Boy stubbornly tags along at a safe distance. Hector\n      walks on for some time before turning on him.\n\n<b>                                 HECTOR\n</b>                   Leave me alone! Stay here...\n                   Stay!\n\n      There is real anger in his voice. The Boy wisely\n      retreats to the cave. As Hector turns to continue his\n      walk alone he see Deirdre looking at him accusingly from\n      the entrance. She holds out her arms ready to comfort\n      the Boy rejected by his father. Hector is in the\n      classic, timeless, no-win situation and he knows it.\n      With a sigh of frustration he heads for the beach.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                          3.         *\n</b>\n<b>5   EXT. SHORE - DAY                                             5\n</b>    Hector is foraging on the shoreline, gathering cockles,\n    seaweeds, mussels, crabs, anything edible. He splashes\n    in the shallows, hoarding the food in a roughly-woven\n    bag. Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its\n    shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed.\n    Hector looks about 30 years old. This is advanced middle\n    age for his times and it shows. He has a heavy cold and\n    an irritating hack in his throat. In a similar condition\n    a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly\n    drugged days in bed, perhaps attempting a little light\n    paperwork propped up on some pillows.\n\n    The sun is warming the day. Hector sits on a rock, sur-\n    veying his world. He seems very much a part of it. He\n    watches some wading seabirds nearby. Like him they are\n    nosing around the margins of low tide for food. He\n    smiles. In another season they or their eggs will pro-\n    vide a meal or two. There is a strange atmosphere of\n    appropriateness in the scene, Hector seems such an inte-\n    gral part of it. The easy fit of the man in his land-\n    scape strikes us. Hector belongs to it in ways that a\n    present-day hunter or holiday maker, or even naturalist,\n    never could. Also, there is an odd sense of the world\n    being rather empty.\n    Whether the larger world is round or flat,   spinning or\n    orbiting, Hector neither knows nor cares.    He knows\n    simple things. Cold and hunger. He knows     warmth, rough\n    comfort and companionship. His family and    the safety of\n    their cave.\n    Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh-\n    tens himself, easing the ache in his back. Then some-\n    thing disturbs him. From behind a distant headland a\n    smudge of smoke trails into the sky. Hector picks up his\n    bag and runs. He knows where he is going. He reaches a\n    vantage point on some rocks. He steadies himself and\n    gazes hard out to sea. We can feel the strain in his\n    eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the\n    glinting water. Then his jaw drops in fear. Around the\n    edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular\n    motion. Their steady progress is full of menace. Oar-\n    driven boats, slowly, insistently making their way into\n    Hector's bay. He jumps from the rocks and runs up the\n    beach toward the cave. One thing else that Hector knows\n    is fear, blind, gut-turning fear.\n\n<b>6   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          6\n</b>\n    Hector is a small figure in the landscape now, racing up\n    the steep slope in the direction of his home.\n<b>                                                 (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                            4.       *\n</b>\n<b>6   CONTINUED:                                                   6\n</b>    He stops for breath and to look back on the bay. The\n    shapes are distinct now, two large open boats, roughly\n    made but menacingly adequate for their purpose, coastal\n    raiding. The boats are nearing the beach now and figures\n    can be seen preparing to land. Hector gathers enough of\n    his wits and strength to continue his race up the\n    hillside.\n\n<b>7   INT. HECTOR'S CAVE - DAY                                     7\n</b>\n    Inside, his family are in a state of panic. They seem to\n    have prepared for this moment. Through their agitation\n    there is purpose. They gather bits and pieces to carry\n    with them in their flight. Hector's children are attemp-\n    ting to take too much. Hector shouts instructions to\n    them as he puts more wood on the fire. It must stay\n    burning in their absence.\n    Hector gathers his family together and they leave the\n    cave.\n\n\n<b>8   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          8\n</b>    Hector shoves his children in one direction up the slope\n    further into the hills. His woman runs off the other\n    way. A hasty, confused argument takes place.\n\n<b>                                 HECTOR\n</b>                 Up the hill!\n<b>                               DEIRDRE\n</b>                 No, down onto the other beach.\n                 The little ones can't take the\n                 hill.

Hector has no choice but to\n    follow her, herding the children in front of him.\n\n    Deirdre runs on, heading for the lower slope and the cover\n    of some trees. Then from these same trees she sees the\n    figures of the RAIDERS coming toward her. She turns,\n    running back up the hill. Hector and the children also\n    turn and run back the way they have come, by now dropping\n    precious bits of food and other possessions. The Raiders\n    are running strongly, five or six of them.\n\n<b>                                                   (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                          5.         *\n</b>\n<b>8    CONTINUED:                                                  8\n</b>     The little Girl starts to go back for a precious toy she\n     has dropped. Hector picks her up and carries her off\n     over his shoulder. The Boy follows.\n     Deirdre is trailing behind them. She was right. She\n     doesn't have the stamina for the hill. Hector looks back\n     and sees the Raiders gaining on her. His face is a con-\n     fusion of fear and indecision. He almost stops, as if to\n     go back and help her, but then changes his mind and runs\n     off once again with the children. Deirdre is by now\n     throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers,\n     hoping that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her\n     to gain some ground. But they don't stop and the effort\n     tires her even more.\n\n     She attempts one final dash and then, all of her energy\n     gone, she stops in her tracks and waits for her pursuers.\n     the Raiders break their run also and trot and finally\n     walk, the distance between them and Deirdre.\n     Hector is watching all of this over his shoulder, still\n     running. He stops for a moment to watch Deirdre being\n     finally surrounded by the Raiders. Then he runs on.\n\n\n<b>9    EXT. VALLEY - DAY                                          9\n</b>     Hector is tiring, too. With the Girl still awkwardly\n     clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a steep\n     slope, half-dragging the Boy up behind him. He stops\n     for a breath and sees the raiders moving into the\n     valley below. In a moment of utter panic he lets go of\n     his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on\n     alone. We can sense the moment of release in his\n     unburdened flight. But it doesn't last long. Some way\n     up the slope he stops and turns. He sees his children,\n     only now beginning to work out what has happened, and\n     the raiders below. He can't do it. Even as the Girl\n     calls to him he is running back down the hill, feeling\n     the first stab of a guilt that will never leave him.\n\n<b>                                GIRL\n</b>                  Come back, Dada...\n\n<b>10   EXT.

The raiders have\n     been slowed down by their capture of Deirdre. Hector\n     is hoisting his two children into the lower branches of\n     a solitary tree on the hillside. He coaxes them up into\n     the higher branches.\n<b>                                                (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                           6.\n</b>\n<b>10   CONTINUED:                                                 10\n</b><b>                                BOY\n</b>                  I'm hungry.\n\n<b>                                HECTOR\n</b>                  Don't move from here.

They don't wave.\n     Maybe waving hasn't been invented yet. Hector heads off\n     alone, higher into the hills.\n\n\n<b>11   EXT. ROCKS - DUSK                                          11\n</b>     It is dusk now. We find Hector waking from a fitful\n     sleep behind some rocks. He sits up and takes in his\n     surroundings. His face hardens as awareness of his pre-\n     dicament returns. He stands up and then crouching low,\n     moves off down the hill.\n\n\n<b>12   EXT.

He sees a\n     figure standing beneath the tree. He moves forward to\n     the protection of some rocks, and watches. He is close\n     enough to hear the voice of the solitary Raider, although\n     he doesn't understand the words. The Raider looks up\n     into the branches and talks in a friendly, persuasive\n     way.\n<b>                                RAIDER\n</b>                  It's too cold to spend all night\n                  up there.

There is\n     movement in the branches. Hector can see the dark shapes\n     of his two children clambering down. The Raider\n     stretches out his arms and helps the Boy to the ground.\n\n<b>                                                  (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                         7.\n</b>\n<b>12   CONTINUED:                                                12\n</b>     Then he reaches up for the Girl, catches her as she drops\n     and keeps her in his arms. He laughs in a comforting\n     way.\n<b>                                RAIDER\n</b>                  That was easy, eh? You're half\n                  asleep already, little girl. I'll\n                  carry you.\n     Hector watches the Raider and his children move slowly\n     off, down the hillside, the Raider carrying the Girl in\n     one arm and holding the Boy's hand. They almost look\n     like a family.\n\n<b>13   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                        13\n</b>\n     It is fully dark now. On the beach the Raiders have set\n     up a comfortable camp with a large fire. We are still\n     with Hector. He has come down from his bleak hiding\n     place in the hills. The smell of fire and food and con-\n     cern for his family, have drawn him here. He is hiding\n     somewhere way off from the camp, but close enough to\n     observe it.\n     What he sees disturbs him, but for odd reasons. His\n     family appear to be happily integrated with the Raiders.\n     His two children have become fast friends with the man\n     who coaxed them from the tree. His woman is with a\n     larger group closer to the fire. They are playfully\n     attempting to communicate with her, and although still a\n     little timid, she is smiling. There is no hint of bar-         *\n     barity, rape or abuse. That was not the intention of the\n     Raiders. To them, a fertile woman and two healthy\n     children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages.\n     For their part, the family have to accept the situation.\n     Food and shelter are the best that life can offer.\n\n     Painfully, Hector takes in the reality of the scene. His\n     family have been stolen from him, plain and simple. In\n     the morning they will be gone, out to sea and round the\n     headland forever. He watches them for a while longer,\n     then it becomes too painful. He retreats into the dark-\n     ness and up into the empty hills again.\n\n\n<b>14   EXT. ROCK SHELTER - NIGHT                                 14\n</b>     Hector spends a long, cold night alone, squatting in a\n     narrow crevice in the rocks. He doesn't sleep, or even\n     attempt to close his eyes. He stares into the darkness.\n     There is nothing in the world to comfort him, no phi-\n     losophy or religion, no friend to run to. This night he\n     is utterly alone.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                         8.\n</b>\n<b>15   EXT.

It seems to revive him,\n     refresh him, even comfort him. A sign, however meager,\n     that life goes on. Then Hector trots off in the direc-\n     tion of the shore. There is not much else that he can\n     do.\n\n\n<b>16   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           16\n</b>     The Raiders are loading up their boats, wading back and\n     forth from the shoreline. Hector watches from cover.\n     His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            *\n     whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.         *\n\n     The last of the Raiders on shore wade out the short dis-\n     tance to the boats. Hector watches these moments of\n     departure, watches the faces of his family.\n     Hector makes his move. In a mad act he breaks cover and         *\n     runs down toward the departing boats. The last Raiders\n     are climbing aboard. Hector charges at full speed to the\n     water's edge. He screams agonizingly at the Raiders and\n     impotently starts throwing stones at them. The Raiders\n     all look at him. The LEADER is impudently brushing\n     Hector's missiles aside, like so many flies and smiling.\n     Suddenly Hector's rage and energy leave him. He stands\n     looking at the Raiders and they look at him, for a long\n     moment. The Raiders are all young men, hardly into their\n     twenties, and nowadays might resemble something like a          *\n     motorcycle gang. But in Hector's time they are men in\n     the full prime of life. They begin to laugh and exchange\n     remarks about Hector. He returns their looks fiercely.\n     His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.         *\n     The Leader eventually turns from Hector, still smiling\n     and gives an order. The men lift their oars and prepare\n     to leave. Then an older man stands up in the other boat.\n     He calls over to the Leader, nodding in the direction of\n     Hector. Hector doesn't know what they are saying, but\n     they have an intense exchange, obviously centered on him.\n     The older man seems to be an adviser, a priest or wise\n     man, although he's still only about thirty years old.\n     The Leader listens to him intently. The PRIEST talks and\n     points to the cliffs. The Leader looks there and nods\n     his head. He gives some instructions to his men. Hector\n     stands, bemused. Six or so of the Raiders leave the\n     boats, wade ashore and without any resistance from him,\n     take hold of Hector. Hector's children instictively rise        *\n     as if to defend their father, but Deirdre, despite her          *\n     own feelings, wisely holds them back.                           *\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                              9.\n</b>\n<b>17   EXT.

The Priest and the\n     Leader walk on ahead, still talking intensely.\n     At the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the\n     wide sea are stretched out beneath them. The Priest, as\n     they arrive, becomes excited. He points to a pile of\n     large stones at the very summit of the headland. The\n     mound of stones is obviously man-made.\n<b>                            PRIEST\n</b>               I told you! I knew they did it\n               around here!

Do we throw you\n               over, is that the idea?\n     Hector doesn't understand.    He looks at him blankly.\n<b>                             LEADER\n</b>               He wants me to throw you over.\n               What does it do? Does it help the\n               sun? Should I throw you over?\n     The Leader tries to help Hector understand by miming the\n     act of throwing him off the cliff. Hector doesn't know\n     how to respond.\n<b>                             PRIEST\n</b>               I tell you, it's one man, one\n               stone. It'll help the voyage.\n     The Leader is unsure. He walks around the pile of\n     stones, checking it out from all sides as if it was some\n     infernal machine that he didn't know the workings of. He\n     squats down and squints through it to the watery sun\n     emerging from the clouds far out to sea. He looks across\n     to Hector, now sitting on the grass. The Leader sits\n     down beside him. They sit together like friends. The\n     ageless intimacy of sacrificer and victim.\n\n<b>                             LEADER\n</b>               What's it got to do with the sun?\n<b>                             PRIEST\n</b>               I don't know, yet.\n\n     The Leader looks at Hector.

The Priest, with some       sense of\n     ceremony, looks around for a large stone, picks      one up\n     and places it on top of the pile. He waits for       a moment,\n     almost as if he expects some consequence of his      action.\n\n<b>                                PRIEST\n</b>                  It's meaningless, without him\n                  going over the cliff.\n\n     The Leader strides off back toward the beach. The others\n     follow him, giving a final look or smile to Hector, apart\n     from the Priest, who looks him up and down, regretting\n     that he is not by now a corpse in the ocean. Hector\n     watches them go, too shocked still to react in any mean-\n     ingful way. He stands alone, trying to unpick the rope\n     that binds his hands.\n     When they are some distance from him, Hector starts to\n     follow them, at first running to catch up and then simply\n     trotting after them. The Raiders are aware of him behind\n     them. The Leader eventually stops and calls to Hector.\n<b>                                 LEADER\n</b>                  Off you go.

His link\n     with them is all that   is left. Again and again the\n     Leader stops to shoo   Hector away, but Hector dumbly tags\n     along behind.\n\n<b>18   EXT.

Hector\n     follows to the very water's edge, then stands and bleakly\n     watches them. The Raiders prepare to move off. Hector\n     is an embarrassment to them now. At the last moment the\n     Leader gives a brusque order to one of his men. The man\n     clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again,\n     carrying a large flint-bladed knife. He comes out of the\n     water and walks up to Hector. Hector is beyond any form\n     of reaction. He will take whatever is offered to him.\n     The man comes close, the knife held ready. He stands in\n     front of Hector for a moment. On the boat, Hector's\n     family are tense with fear for his life.\n<b>                                                     (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                         11.\n</b>\n<b>18   CONTINUED:                                                 18\n</b>     Then the tense moment passes, as the man grunts and nods\n     at Hector's hands, still bound with rope. Hector under-\n     stands. He lifts his hands and the man with some effort\n     hacks through the rough hemp. Then he turns and wades\n     back to the boat.\n\n     As the man clambers aboard the Leader speaks to him. The\n     man stops, drops back into the water, and returns to\n     Hector on the shore. He offers Hector the cut piece of\n     rope, a weird gesture of conciliation. He even smiles.\n     Hector refuses the gift. The man stands sheepishly for a\n     moment, then drops the rope at Hector's feet and wades\n     back to the boat. A piece of rope in exchange for a\n     family.\n\n     Hector watches them for some time, his family and the\n     strange Raiders, as they, achingly slowly, retreat from\n     his view and his life.\n     At last he turns and moves up from the shoreline. He\n     goes some distance then stops, thinks for a moment, then\n     retraces his steps. He goes back to the water's edge,\n     picks up the piece of rope that bound him, and walks\n     off with it. It might be of some use to him.\n\n\n<b>19   INT.

He is working on his instincts now, still\n     emotionally in shock. He digs around in the embers of\n     the fire. Some of the larger bits of wood still hold\n     some life. Hector bends low and starts to waft expertly         *\n     and blow at the fire's remains.\n     We leave our first Hector squatting at his fire, in the\n     simplest act of physical survival. For him the problems\n     of emotional survival without his family lie ahead.\n\n<b>20   INT. BATHHOUSE FURNACE - DAY                               20\n</b>\n     This is another, bigger fire. In fact we might be in\n     hell. A crude furnace blazes. Filthy, sweat-covered\n     men feed it with wood and charcoal, an endless task given\n     the ferocity of the fire. To one side of the oppressive,\n     low-ceilinged furnace room, some small boys endlessly\n     toil at two large bellows, feeding the flames with jets\n     of air. OVER the NOISE of the FURNACE someone is\n     WHISTLING, an odd human sound in an inhuman setting.\n     Shadowy figures come and go with barrow loads of wood.\n     We TILT UP TO the space above the furnace to see a mass\n     of dangerously crude clay pipes, oozing water and steam\n     at every joint.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                         12.\n</b>\n<b>21   INT. BATHHOUSE - DAY                                      21\n</b>     Above the heat and filth there is a different world. A\n     clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing figures, droning\n     conversations and resonant laughter. It is the hot room\n     of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have\n     advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the\n     technology. It is men's day at the bathhouse. All of\n     the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and\n     comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance,\n     some around the edge of the pool, others in the water\n     rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. There are three\n     or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie-\n     torial way that they look after their masters gives the\n     place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over-\n     indulged grown-ups.\n\n     And then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall,\n     holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more\n     healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so         *\n     by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face\n     that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached\n     from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He\n     watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need\n     that he might have.\n\n     Hector's master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others\n     around him. He is in anxious conversation with an older        *\n     man wading beside him. We don't hear what they are saying\n     but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius'\n     pleading and the older man's cool distraction. The older\n     man gives a final dismissive shake of his head. Hector         *\n     immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as\n     Lucinnius climbs out of the water.\n<b>                             LUCINNIUS\n</b>               I'm going to the cool room.\n\n\n<b>22   INT.

Lucinnius' worries are\n     Hector's also.\n     Hector walks a pace behind Lucinnius through various\n     chambers of the bathhouse, passing the games area and\n     the massage room as they go. All around them slaves\n     attend to their pampered masters.\n\n<b>23   INT.

Hector then\n     moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master's\n     behavior. Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to\n     casually join his friends. The eldest of the three\n     gives off as much of the aura of a Godfather as a naked\n     man in a towel can. The other two are deferential to\n     the older man, and treat Lucinnius with apparent con-\n     tempt. Hector watches the older man put a paternal\n     hand on Luccinius's shoulder and speak with a calm\n     smile on his face. Hector almost winces to see his\n     master submit to this patronizing treatment. Slave\n     and master exist so closely together that many of\n     their feelings are shared. More precisely, Lucinnius's\n     feelings are shared by Hector. It is a one-way exchange.\n     From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too,\n     Hector is living two lives, his own and his master's.\n     Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic\n     schizophrenia?\n     As Luccinius stands to leave we can    tell by their expres-\n     sions that the THREE MEN are open in    their contempt for\n     him. Hector is quickly on his feet     and by Lucinnius's\n     side as he goes. A final sarcastic     remark comes from one\n     of the three.\n<b>                                MAN #1\n</b>                  Well washed, Lucinnius.\n\n     Lucinnius tries to muster his dignity as they leave.              *\n\n<b>24   EXT.

It is difficult to tell from the people\n     because they are such a cosmopolitan crowd, faces from\n     every corner of the Mediterranean world. It has some-\n     thing of the atmosphere of a frontier town in a western,\n     except that here the half-finished buildings are made of\n     brick and stone.\n     Lucinnius leaves the bathhouse. Hector follows three\n     paces behind him, loaded down with the large towel, the\n     scrubber, robe, and the wooden stool. The stool goes\n     with them everywhere, in case Lucinnius has to stop in\n     the street and converse with a friend. Other notables\n     are among the street throng, their own slaves tagging\n     along behind with their little wooden stools. Some have\n     whole trains of slaves shadowing them.

Cyprian's\n     home is a street palace. It is early in the morning, but\n     there is already activity around the house, visitors\n     coming and going, messengers, petitioners. A few impor-\n     tant callers arrive in litters, carried by slaves.\n     Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the door\n     and are checked in by the gateman. Lucinnius's hopes of\n     quietly bending Cyprian's ear are dashed. It seems as\n     if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial\n     Mr. Big.\n\n\n<b>34   EXT.

Cyprian's aides usher the\n     visitors into his presence in a regular flow, some have\n     an audience of a few minutes, others last merely seconds.\n\n     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius, like a mother watching\n     her child from a distance on its first day at school.\n<b>                                                  (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                              23.\n</b>\n<b>34   CONTINUED:                                                     34\n</b>     Lucinnius, sitting expectantly in line, does look a\n     little pathetic, even ridiculous. Straight-backed, hands\n     on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri-\n     ficial offering himself.\n     Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other slaves\n     as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by\n     place to the front of the line. We almost expect Hector\n     to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is\n     finally summoned into the inner office. Hector waits.\n     The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn't emerge\n     within the first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him\n     the time of day. More minutes pass. Hector watches a\n     game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door.\n     One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go\n     into the office. So does Lucinnius' friend Julian.\n\n     Eventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad\n     smile on his face.

Hector\n     walks behind, casting the light on Lucinnius's crumpled,\n     defeated form. Lucinnius begins to sob, at first\n     quietly, then more loudly and more pathetically. Hector\n     looks around and behind him, afraid, or perhaps hoping,\n     that Lucinnius's moans will wake the household.\n\n<b>43   INT.

We\n     see on his face the effort as he pulls at it, and do we\n     detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed Lucinnius\n     on his way? Lucinnius sighs and twitches a little.

Lucinnius lies still.\n     Hector has won this final battle of wills. He stands    up,\n     suddenly repulsed by what has happened. But quickly    he\n     gathers his wits. He makes his decision. He throws     the\n     knife down. It clatters along the hard shiny floor.\n     Hector has run out of the room before it has come to    rest\n     against the wall.\n\n<b>44   INT.

He puts most of them into a leather money\n     bag and ties it to his waist. Then he pulls on\n     Lucinnius's cloak and rushes out of the room. He returns\n     quickly to pick up his certificate of freedom from the\n     table.

There are\n     tantalizing   similarities between their situation and the           *\n     one we left   Thalia and Hector in on the boat a few\n     moments ago,   1400 years ago.\n\n<b>                                                     (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                               39.\n</b>\n<b>52   CONTINUED:                                                      52\n</b>     The woman and Hector exchange glances now and then,\n     delicate signals of mutual awareness. Talking without\n     words.\n     They are not alone in the wagon, perched on its half load\n     of timber. With them is a NUN accompanying a GIRL of\n     about eight. The Girl is tearful. A man, his face\n     unseen, is snoring underneath his hat. A younger man,\n     gaunt and hungry-looking, is dressed in the rough\n     travelling clothes of a monk or PRIEST. Even without his\n     habit we would know he was a holy man.

They are       *\n     travelling high in the mountains. Hector dawdles on\n     his way, eating a hard biscuit he takes from his pocket.\n     The last sound he hears from the wagon is the renewed\n     WAILING OF the GIRL. Hector lays himself down at the           *\n     side of the road. His eyes begin to close. Then a SOUND\n     in the distance makes him open them again. He listens.\n     MORE SOUNDS drift up to him from the floor of the valley.\n     He stands up and crosses the track. At first he can see\n     nothing. He walks back along the rim of the road. Then\n     he sees where the noise is coming from. A mounted\n     skirmish is in progress, just where a wooden bridge\n     crosses the small river, at the very bottom of the valley.\n     There are no more than 30 knights in full armor, with\n     twice as many foot soldiers and squires. Even from such\n     a distance Hector can see and hear that the fighting is\n     ferocious, almost insane in its intensity. From this\n     distance it is like a puppet show, except the violence\n     is real. The scene places Hector in his time and for us\n     there is a strange feeling to it, almost as if Hector\n     has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to\n     some distant age. But this is not the case. Hector is\n     where he belongs, in Medieval Europe.\n     Hector makes his decision. With a last look behind him         *\n     he runs off in the direction of the wagon. Like any wise\n     citizen of a violent age, Hector knows when to leg it.\n\n\n<b>54   EXT.

The figure\n     pauses and crouches over Beatrice. Hector can hear the\n     distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her, from head to\n     toe, and then a deep, long sigh. The figure stands up and\n     moves quietly to the door, disappearing downstairs.\n     Hector rouses himself and follows the other.\n\n\n<b>58   INT.

Behind them is a group of soldiers,\n     reserves who have not yet joined the battle. They are\n     much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci-\n     plined unit.\n     Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground\n     drill and battle training. To the BEAT of DRUMS they\n     perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same\n     pattern over and over again. A deadly dance, thrusting\n     their pikes in unison. They become like one evil,\n     inhuman machine. It is mesmerizing to watch, all the                *\n     more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hector\n     and Beatrice are acting out.

Some officers have moved in and the place is\n     more crowded than before. The Priest makes his way to\n     his corner, but on the way he pauses by Beatrice. She\n     snores lightly. The Priest bends over and takes a long\n     sniff at her, then he sighs out his admiration.\n\n     He steps over her and settles into his own space by the\n     window. He suddenly misses the presence of Hector. He\n     looks again at Beatrice, still and sleeping. What the\n     Priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging\n     her neck and head. She moans softly in her pretence of\n     sleep.\n     The Priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know\n     why. He sniffs again, in the general direction of\n     Beatrice. The mingled smells that his sensitive nose\n     detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his           *\n     cloak over his head.\n\n     Across the room, Hector's head emerges from the covering\n     beside Beatrice.

We have left our previous\n     Hector sitting under his tree 400 years ago. This\n     Hector is awakening into what might be a nightmare.\n     The huge raft is many smaller rafts lashed together.\n     There are over a hundred and fifty people perched on\n     them, lying or squatting in sleep. It is early morning.\n     The sea is calm around them, but the deep ocean swell is\n     still there to remind them of their predicament, menacing,\n     like a controlled anger.\n\n     Hector is fully awake now, sitting against some boxes.\n     He speaks to ANDRE sitting close by.\n<b>                                                     (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                            71.\n</b>\n<b>93   CONTINUED:                                                   93\n</b>     Andre is Hector's   slave, still bound to him in service\n     through shipwreck   and disaster.

All over the raft figures are coming awake,\n     sitting up, taking in the new day, and the dreadful\n     reality of their situation.\n     Andre speaks to Hector.\n\n<b>                                ANDRE\n</b>                  Do you think I'll still see\n                  Europe?\n<b>                                HECTOR\n</b>                  I think there's more chance of\n                  me eating you, Andre.\n<b>                                                   (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                             72.\n</b>\n<b>93   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             93\n</b>     The more we see     of the people, their costumes, weapons,\n     mannerisms, the     easier we will place them in their\n     time.

The place is the Indian Ocean.\n\n     Hector turns his eyes to another part of the raft,\n     closer to him. He watches a man and woman. The woman,\n     URSULA, still has her eyes closed, sleeping on a pile of\n     canvas. The man, FRANCISCO, stands beside her holding\n     a cloak over her to protect her from sea spray. His eye\n     catches Hector's, and they hold each other's gaze for a\n     long time. There is antipathy but also pain in their\n     look.                                                              *\n\n     A man, DOM PAULO, moves among the waking wretches.

The raft is\n     now standing off-shore riding out the heavy ocean surf\n     before finally beaching. The strong are helping to row\n     ashore, under the shouted instructions of the NAVIGATOR.\n     Those too weak to help are huddled beside their posses-\n     sions, hoping to survive this final trial of the sea.\n<b>                                                   (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                         73.\n</b>\n<b>94   CONTINUED:                                                 94\n</b>     Hector works his oar with the rest. He has time to cast\n     a glance at Ursula and Francisco. Francisco in his\n     manic-heroic way manages to row while at the same time\n     trying to offer a steadying arm to Ursula.\n     If Hector had time or energy to laugh, he would.\n\n     The raft is in the full rage of the surf. The sense\n     behind its loose construction is obvious now. Snake-like\n     it rides the waves, one half up, the other down. The\n     beaching isn't easy. A few people are washed overboard\n     with no way of saving them. Finally the raft makes it\n     through the barrier of the outer surf. They are in a\n     long curving bay. Up from the beach lies an area of             *\n     dunes, and beyond that a thick belt of jungle.\n\n     The raft scrapes onto the sand. Those near the beach\n     scramble ashore, immediately prostrating themselves in\n     prayers of thanks while those at the back jump into\n     the water and clumsily wade the last few feet to safety.\n     Hector's attention is never far from Ursula. She is             *\n     struggling in the water with some of her baggage. A\n     youth, NUNO, goes to help her. Hector overtakes him and\n     nudges him out of the way, offering to take Ursula's load\n     from her shoulders. She refuses his help. Waist-deep in         *\n     water they tussle over her bundle of possessions. Hector        *\n     overpowers her, wrestles her load from her grasp, angrily\n     wades to the shore and dumps it on the sand. In amongst\n     the drama of their situation their little battle of wills\n     seems petty and pathetic, but it reveals much about their\n     past.\n<b>                                                                     *\n</b>     Soon the survivors are dragging their possessions from\n     the raft. They have managed to hoard a surprising amount\n     from their doomed ship. Carpets, chests, chairs, all\n     are dragged ashore.\n\n<b>95   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                            95\n</b>\n     Civilization has taken hold quickly in this little corner\n     of Africa. Dom Paulo, the leader, already has a table\n     and chair set up in the sand, and behind him SAILORS are\n     erectig a tent-like house, made from timbers and rich\n     tapestries and carpets. The others are making their own\n     shelters all along the beach. A regular little community\n     is taking shape, a crazy, rich-textured village decked out\n     in all the colors of the East. The silks and ginghams\n     that were destined for the finest halls in Europe now give\n     shelter to sick slaves, starving sailors, ruined traders\n     and grieving mothers.\n<b>                                               (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                           74.        *\n</b>\n<b>95   CONTINUED:                                                  95\n</b>     Some of the survivors have   recovered sufficiently from\n     the trauma of near death to   mark out the boundaries of\n     their new beach homes with   lines of stones. The habits\n     of ownership die hardest of   all.\n     Although Dom Paulo is the man in authority he is also a\n     man in deep shock. Most of what he has earned or\n     plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom\n     of the ocean. Since he is socially superior to anyone\n     else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command.\n     There are probably fifty men among the survivors more\n     suited to lead them to safety.\n     By Dom Paulo's side always is his SON. A quiet boy of\n     about eleven. He is like a little miniature of his\n     father, dressed in the same style of clothes. He is a\n     constant, silent witness to everything that Dom Paulo does,\n     good or bad, wise or foolish. He and his father are a\n     continuing fascination for Hector, and we can enjoy\n     Hector watching the boy watching his father. Some of the\n     absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high-\n     lighted in this way. There can be sadness in it too\n     however, the pain of a son witnessing his father's\n     compromises or failures all too closely, and Dom Paulo's\n     sad awareness of his image slowly tarnishing in his\n     son's eyes.\n     Amidst the construction work, Dom Paulo is talking with\n     some of his OFFICERS.\n<b>                                DOM PAULO\n</b>                  How many made it?\n<b>                                OFFICER\n</b>                  Eighty men.

He pulls out the nails and pockets them,\n      then continues to rummage amongst the wood for more.\n      Hector is a survivor. And not the first Hector to\n      scavenge on a beach, in a world that feels big and empty.\n\n\n<b>112   EXT. DUNES - MORNING                                         112\n</b>      Hector is enjoying the   freshness of the day. We see              *\n      him climb over a dune   and then as he nears the summit\n      duck and retreat down   the slope again. Cautiously he\n      crawls up the dune and   looks over to the other side.\n\n      He is watching a young Girl and the boy Nuno. They are\n      twelve or thirteen years old. They are coyly in the\n      early stages of making love, the Boy lying close to the\n      Girl, kissing her, beginning to caress her. Their                  *\n      love-making is poised oddly between child's play and               *\n      eroticism. It's their day of discovery and it is like\n      a dream of love.\n      The Boy is just about to   discover some more and is\n      fumbling with the Girl's   clothing, when he looks up and\n      catches sight of Hector.    Hector ducks down but knows he\n      has been seen and decides   to brazen it out. He stands\n      up in full view of them.\n\n<b>                                 HECTOR\n</b>                   Stop that... leave her alone...\n                   get back to the camp... or I'll tell\n                   your mother... how can you play like\n                   this when there are people needing\n                   your help back there...?\n      The Boy is standing now and fixing his clothing. He walks\n      off back to the camp. The Girl remains sitting in the\n      sand, buttoning her dress, too embarrassed even to raise\n      her head to Hector.\n\n      Then Hector is touched by something, perhaps the sad stoop\n      in the Boy's shoulder or the Girl's lowered head. Hector\n      realizes he has broken something precious and in their\n      circumstances infinitely fragile and irretrievable. He\n      feels like an oaf. He calls after the Boy.\n\n<b>                                 HECTOR\n</b>                   Come back...

Then he sees the procession of the               *\n      Native King and his people, some cattle, and porters\n      carrying baskets.\n      Hector runs off towards the camp.\n\n\n<b>113   EXT.

The ragged Europeans, already scanning the                   *\n      baskets of the Natives for signs of solid food,\n      somehow still muster an absurd sense of their own                    *\n      importance for the occasion. The Natives, excited and                *\n      curious, trying to contain their exuberance so that they             *\n      don't miss a single detail of this most significant\n      day. Many of the Natives have climbed into the trees,                *\n      either out of timidity or to get a better view                       *\n\n      The trees around the meeting place are dripping with\n      bodies, like human fruit.\n      Hector slips into the crowd as the NATIVE KING is in\n      mid-speech.

The four\n      Officers do the same. The King and a few of his atten-\n      dants take a step or two forward and peer at the exposed\n      white European bellies. They look at one another and\n      mumble solemnly. Then they step back. Dom Paulo and the\n      Officers fix their clothing and re-muster their dignity.\n      The King is enjoying himself.    He speaks again to the\n      Slave, who then translates.\n\n<b>                                 SLAVE\n</b>                   He wants to see you breathe.\n      The King takes a deep breath, then nods to Dom Paulo.\n      Dom Paulo and the Officers do as they are told. The King\n      joins them, and for a few moments there is a kind of\n      communion between them. Then everyone joins in. It is a            *\n      strange, poignant moment, all the Natives and all the\n      Europeans united in the simple act of breathing.\n      Dom Paulo regains his composure.

Dom Paulo's Officers enjoy a\n      muted titter as he peels off his precious rings and\n      gives them to the King, replacing the worthless baubles\n      around his own neck.

Match after match    disappears into\n      his elaborate stone structure, only to   fizzle out.\n\n      The sun finally vanishes, and Betsy goes limp at her\n      easel. The sun has won the race again. She and Thomas\n      watch Hector trying to light the fire.
