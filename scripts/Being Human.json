But there is just one story. Because we\nblend into one developing narrative the lives that we\nshow.\n\nThere is no suggestion of time travel or re-incarnation\nor any other tricksy or mystic device. We can do in real\ntime and with real characters what other movies strive to\ndo with immortal time travellers and ghosts. Our story\nis thoroughly based in reality and the magic we are\ndealing with is real, human magic.\nIn moving from one character to the next everything will\nchange; supporting characters, setting, period. But the\nessential situation of our hero of the moment will relate\nto the one before and the one following.\nThe magic will be in the transitions, in leaving one\ncharacter and advancing the film through hundreds or\nthousands of years to find our next hero in tantalizingly\nsimilar human circumstances. The effect of these transi-\ntions across space and time, will let the audience grasp\nthe simple truth behind our story; that we are all in it\ntogether.\nThe key to allowing the audience to enjoy this human\nconnection at the heart of the film is that one actor\nwill play the six individuals. The feeling will be of\nthe endless, glorious playing and replaying of the simple\ndrama of being alive.\nWe end the film with a present-day hero, but by that time\nwe will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh\nlight, feeling his kinship with the caveman and the slave\nand the others who have gone before. The resolution of\nhis contemporary story is theirs also. By then perhaps,\nwe will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec-\ntive, too.\n\nAnd the structure of the film itself has the thrill of\nnovelty. It has never before been used in cinema.\nNever. Our six characters and their stories connect in\nmany different ways, some obvious, others vague, tanta-\nlizing threads. Even global connections are made, as the\nplanet itself and all its people, come and go in the\nstory. For the audience the game of making the connec-\ntions, feeling the bonds, even inventing or discovering\nassociations of their own, will be endless in this big-\ngest of stories, smallest of stories. It is truly a new\ncinematic experience.                                       *\n\n                                                                       *\n\n                             BEING HUMAN\n      Hector is a family man. He and his woman and two\n      children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a\n      hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance\n      by a covering of branches and brush. Just inside a small\n      fire smoulders permanently, a few times a day encouraged\n      into life for cooking or warmth. If it ever went out it\n      would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com-\n      fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family.\n      Hector doesn't know that his name is Hector. It is\n      simply a convenience to help us tell his story. The idea\n      of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not\n      yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. Hector\n      is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of\n      Christ, in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet. In\n      his entire life Hector will traverse no more than ten\n      square miles of it.\n\n\n      FADE IN:\n      FIRST IMAGE\n      is the reflection of Hector's face in a rock pool. The\n      image suddenly fragments. Hector is enjoying himself,\n      deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his\n      image reforms itself and then is disrupted again. When\n      he is finished, a trace of vanity makes him bend down\n      closer to his reflection. He strokes his long hair and\n      fingers a blemish on his cheek.\n      Then he is aware of another presence. He sharply turns.\n      Some way off a solitary figure stands on the rise of some\n      rocks, not afraid to show itself. Hector calls out.\n                               HECTOR\n                 Go back home... leave me alone...\n\n      We see that the figure is a young BOY, Hector's son.     The\n      Boy thinks about it for a moment, before turning and\n      disappearing behind the rocks.\n\n1-4   TITLE SCENES                                               1-4\n\n      The small fire that never goes out has been enlarged to\n      cook the day's meal. Beyond the fire on a rock shelf\n      HECTOR plays with his children, a GIRL of six and Boy of\n      eight. It is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge\n      in, but in 4000 BC possibly rougher than normal. Hector\n      is acting the part of some trapped wild animal, lashing\n      out at the hunters surrounding him. But in his act of\n      wild rage he gets carried away. He picks up his son and\n      throws him hard, much too hard, on his back.\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            2.           *\n\n1-4   CONTINUED:                                                   1-4\n      The Boy tumbles down   from the shelf to the cave floor at\n      his mother, DEIRDRE's   feet, howling in pain. Deidre\n      scowls at Hector. If    the gesture had been invented he\n      would probably shrug   his shoulders. The Boy howls on.\n      Hector kneels beside his daughter, absorbed in her antics\n      as she sleeps. She is a vivid dreamer. Her whole little\n      form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy\n      unspooling in her head. She emits unearthly nighttime\n      noises, squeals and giggles and moans. Hector is fasci-\n      nated. Where has his daughter gone? Who is this strange\n      wild creature that has taken her form, lying beside him?\n      Hector's daughter delights him. And while Hector watches\n      his daughter, Deirdre from their bed watches Hector.\n\n      It is almost dawn, the cave is quiet and the fire has\n      diminished. By its light we see Deirdre and Hector making\n      love, on their bed of dried grass and skins. It's diffi-\n      cult to say what their lovemaking might look like. What\n      has 6000 years done to that art? We will think about it.\n      On the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children.\n      As we MOVE CLOSER we see that they are far from sleep.\n      Two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover.\n      We CUT BETWEEN them, the loving parents and the watching,\n      learning children.\n      Hector is arguing with his son, just outside their cave.\n      The Boy wants to go foraging with him again.\n\n                                 HECTOR\n                   No... stay here... stay!\n      Hector takes a few steps.    The Boy follows.\n\n                                 HECTOR\n                   No... go back... go away...\n\n      Hector walks on again, taking big, angry father strides.\n      The Boy stubbornly tags along at a safe distance. Hector\n      walks on for some time before turning on him.\n\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Leave me alone! Stay here...\n                   Stay!\n\n      There is real anger in his voice. The Boy wisely\n      retreats to the cave. As Hector turns to continue his\n      walk alone he see Deirdre looking at him accusingly from\n      the entrance. She holds out her arms ready to comfort\n      the Boy rejected by his father. Hector is in the\n      classic, timeless, no-win situation and he knows it.\n      With a sigh of frustration he heads for the beach.\n\n                                                          3.         *\n\n5   EXT. SHORE - DAY                                             5\n    Hector is foraging on the shoreline, gathering cockles,\n    seaweeds, mussels, crabs, anything edible. He splashes\n    in the shallows, hoarding the food in a roughly-woven\n    bag. Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its\n    shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed.\n    Hector looks about 30 years old. This is advanced middle\n    age for his times and it shows. He has a heavy cold and\n    an irritating hack in his throat. In a similar condition\n    a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly\n    drugged days in bed, perhaps attempting a little light\n    paperwork propped up on some pillows.\n\n    The sun is warming the day. Hector sits on a rock, sur-\n    veying his world. He seems very much a part of it. He\n    watches some wading seabirds nearby. Like him they are\n    nosing around the margins of low tide for food. He\n    smiles. In another season they or their eggs will pro-\n    vide a meal or two. There is a strange atmosphere of\n    appropriateness in the scene, Hector seems such an inte-\n    gral part of it. The easy fit of the man in his land-\n    scape strikes us. Hector belongs to it in ways that a\n    present-day hunter or holiday maker, or even naturalist,\n    never could. Also, there is an odd sense of the world\n    being rather empty.\n    Whether the larger world is round or flat,   spinning or\n    orbiting, Hector neither knows nor cares.    He knows\n    simple things. Cold and hunger. He knows     warmth, rough\n    comfort and companionship. His family and    the safety of\n    their cave.\n    Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh-\n    tens himself, easing the ache in his back. Then some-\n    thing disturbs him. From behind a distant headland a\n    smudge of smoke trails into the sky. Hector picks up his\n    bag and runs. He knows where he is going. He reaches a\n    vantage point on some rocks. He steadies himself and\n    gazes hard out to sea. We can feel the strain in his\n    eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the\n    glinting water. Then his jaw drops in fear. Around the\n    edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular\n    motion. Their steady progress is full of menace. Oar-\n    driven boats, slowly, insistently making their way into\n    Hector's bay. He jumps from the rocks and runs up the\n    beach toward the cave. One thing else that Hector knows\n    is fear, blind, gut-turning fear.\n\n6   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          6\n\n    Hector is a small figure in the landscape now, racing up\n    the steep slope in the direction of his home.\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            4.       *\n\n6   CONTINUED:                                                   6\n    He stops for breath and to look back on the bay. The\n    shapes are distinct now, two large open boats, roughly\n    made but menacingly adequate for their purpose, coastal\n    raiding. The boats are nearing the beach now and figures\n    can be seen preparing to land. Hector gathers enough of\n    his wits and strength to continue his race up the\n    hillside.\n\n7   INT. HECTOR'S CAVE - DAY                                     7\n\n    Inside, his family are in a state of panic. They seem to\n    have prepared for this moment. Through their agitation\n    there is purpose. They gather bits and pieces to carry\n    with them in their flight. Hector's children are attemp-\n    ting to take too much. Hector shouts instructions to\n    them as he puts more wood on the fire. It must stay\n    burning in their absence.\n    Hector gathers his family together and they leave the\n    cave.\n\n\n8   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          8\n    Hector shoves his children in one direction up the slope\n    further into the hills. His woman runs off the other\n    way. A hasty, confused argument takes place.\n\n                                 HECTOR\n                 Up the hill!\n                               DEIRDRE\n                 No, down onto the other beach.\n                 The little ones can't take the\n                 hill. Neither can I.\n\n                              HECTOR\n                 Up the hill! They're down there\n                 already. I saw them!\n\n                                 DEIRDRE\n                 You're wrong!\n    She runs off down the slope. Hector has no choice but to\n    follow her, herding the children in front of him.\n\n    Deirdre runs on, heading for the lower slope and the cover\n    of some trees. Then from these same trees she sees the\n    figures of the RAIDERS coming toward her. She turns,\n    running back up the hill. Hector and the children also\n    turn and run back the way they have come, by now dropping\n    precious bits of food and other possessions. The Raiders\n    are running strongly, five or six of them.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          5.         *\n\n8    CONTINUED:                                                  8\n     The little Girl starts to go back for a precious toy she\n     has dropped. Hector picks her up and carries her off\n     over his shoulder. The Boy follows.\n     Deirdre is trailing behind them. She was right. She\n     doesn't have the stamina for the hill. Hector looks back\n     and sees the Raiders gaining on her. His face is a con-\n     fusion of fear and indecision. He almost stops, as if to\n     go back and help her, but then changes his mind and runs\n     off once again with the children. Deirdre is by now\n     throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers,\n     hoping that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her\n     to gain some ground. But they don't stop and the effort\n     tires her even more.\n\n     She attempts one final dash and then, all of her energy\n     gone, she stops in her tracks and waits for her pursuers.\n     the Raiders break their run also and trot and finally\n     walk, the distance between them and Deirdre.\n     Hector is watching all of this over his shoulder, still\n     running. He stops for a moment to watch Deirdre being\n     finally surrounded by the Raiders. Then he runs on.\n\n\n9    EXT. VALLEY - DAY                                          9\n     Hector is tiring, too. With the Girl still awkwardly\n     clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a steep\n     slope, half-dragging the Boy up behind him. He stops\n     for a breath and sees the raiders moving into the\n     valley below. In a moment of utter panic he lets go of\n     his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on\n     alone. We can sense the moment of release in his\n     unburdened flight. But it doesn't last long. Some way\n     up the slope he stops and turns. He sees his children,\n     only now beginning to work out what has happened, and\n     the raiders below. He can't do it. Even as the Girl\n     calls to him he is running back down the hill, feeling\n     the first stab of a guilt that will never leave him.\n\n                                GIRL\n                  Come back, Dada...\n\n10   EXT. VALLEY - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                          10\n\n     Hector and the children have reached the safety of a\n     small valley higher up in the hills. The raiders have\n     been slowed down by their capture of Deirdre. Hector\n     is hoisting his two children into the lower branches of\n     a solitary tree on the hillside. He coaxes them up into\n     the higher branches.\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           6.\n\n10   CONTINUED:                                                 10\n                                BOY\n                  I'm hungry.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  Don't move from here. I'll come\n                  for you in the morning. There's\n                  no food. Try and sleep in the\n                  branches. Don't cry. Don't make\n                  a noise.\n     Hector moves off, looking back to his children in the\n     tree.  They too gaze anxiously at him. They don't wave.\n     Maybe waving hasn't been invented yet. Hector heads off\n     alone, higher into the hills.\n\n\n11   EXT. ROCKS - DUSK                                          11\n     It is dusk now. We find Hector waking from a fitful\n     sleep behind some rocks. He sits up and takes in his\n     surroundings. His face hardens as awareness of his pre-\n     dicament returns. He stands up and then crouching low,\n     moves off down the hill.\n\n\n12   EXT. VALLEY - DUSK                                         12\n     Hector has returned to the area of the tree. He slows\n     down some distance away and just in time. He sees a\n     figure standing beneath the tree. He moves forward to\n     the protection of some rocks, and watches. He is close\n     enough to hear the voice of the solitary Raider, although\n     he doesn't understand the words. The Raider looks up\n     into the branches and talks in a friendly, persuasive\n     way.\n                                RAIDER\n                  It's too cold to spend all night\n                  up there. We've got a fire at the\n                  beach. Food, too.\n\n     There is no response from the tree.    The Raider coaxes\n     again.\n                                RAIDER\n                  Come on! Your mother's down\n                  there. She's happy... she's warm,\n                  too... and full... she wants to\n                  see you... she sent me...\n\n     His friendly tone of voice has an effect. There is\n     movement in the branches. Hector can see the dark shapes\n     of his two children clambering down. The Raider\n     stretches out his arms and helps the Boy to the ground.\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         7.\n\n12   CONTINUED:                                                12\n     Then he reaches up for the Girl, catches her as she drops\n     and keeps her in his arms. He laughs in a comforting\n     way.\n                                RAIDER\n                  That was easy, eh? You're half\n                  asleep already, little girl. I'll\n                  carry you.\n     Hector watches the Raider and his children move slowly\n     off, down the hillside, the Raider carrying the Girl in\n     one arm and holding the Boy's hand. They almost look\n     like a family.\n\n13   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                        13\n\n     It is fully dark now. On the beach the Raiders have set\n     up a comfortable camp with a large fire. We are still\n     with Hector. He has come down from his bleak hiding\n     place in the hills. The smell of fire and food and con-\n     cern for his family, have drawn him here. He is hiding\n     somewhere way off from the camp, but close enough to\n     observe it.\n     What he sees disturbs him, but for odd reasons. His\n     family appear to be happily integrated with the Raiders.\n     His two children have become fast friends with the man\n     who coaxed them from the tree. His woman is with a\n     larger group closer to the fire. They are playfully\n     attempting to communicate with her, and although still a\n     little timid, she is smiling. There is no hint of bar-         *\n     barity, rape or abuse. That was not the intention of the\n     Raiders. To them, a fertile woman and two healthy\n     children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages.\n     For their part, the family have to accept the situation.\n     Food and shelter are the best that life can offer.\n\n     Painfully, Hector takes in the reality of the scene. His\n     family have been stolen from him, plain and simple. In\n     the morning they will be gone, out to sea and round the\n     headland forever. He watches them for a while longer,\n     then it becomes too painful. He retreats into the dark-\n     ness and up into the empty hills again.\n\n\n14   EXT. ROCK SHELTER - NIGHT                                 14\n     Hector spends a long, cold night alone, squatting in a\n     narrow crevice in the rocks. He doesn't sleep, or even\n     attempt to close his eyes. He stares into the darkness.\n     There is nothing in the world to comfort him, no phi-\n     losophy or religion, no friend to run to. This night he\n     is utterly alone.\n\n                                                         8.\n\n15   EXT. ROCKS - MORNING                                       15\n     In the morning it is lightly raining. Hector stands in\n     the drizzle outside the shelter. It seems to revive him,\n     refresh him, even comfort him. A sign, however meager,\n     that life goes on. Then Hector trots off in the direc-\n     tion of the shore. There is not much else that he can\n     do.\n\n\n16   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           16\n     The Raiders are loading up their boats, wading back and\n     forth from the shoreline. Hector watches from cover.\n     His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            *\n     whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.         *\n\n     The last of the Raiders on shore wade out the short dis-\n     tance to the boats. Hector watches these moments of\n     departure, watches the faces of his family.\n     Hector makes his move. In a mad act he breaks cover and         *\n     runs down toward the departing boats. The last Raiders\n     are climbing aboard. Hector charges at full speed to the\n     water's edge. He screams agonizingly at the Raiders and\n     impotently starts throwing stones at them. The Raiders\n     all look at him. The LEADER is impudently brushing\n     Hector's missiles aside, like so many flies and smiling.\n     Suddenly Hector's rage and energy leave him. He stands\n     looking at the Raiders and they look at him, for a long\n     moment. The Raiders are all young men, hardly into their\n     twenties, and nowadays might resemble something like a          *\n     motorcycle gang. But in Hector's time they are men in\n     the full prime of life. They begin to laugh and exchange\n     remarks about Hector. He returns their looks fiercely.\n     His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.         *\n     The Leader eventually turns from Hector, still smiling\n     and gives an order. The men lift their oars and prepare\n     to leave. Then an older man stands up in the other boat.\n     He calls over to the Leader, nodding in the direction of\n     Hector. Hector doesn't know what they are saying, but\n     they have an intense exchange, obviously centered on him.\n     The older man seems to be an adviser, a priest or wise\n     man, although he's still only about thirty years old.\n     The Leader listens to him intently. The PRIEST talks and\n     points to the cliffs. The Leader looks there and nods\n     his head. He gives some instructions to his men. Hector\n     stands, bemused. Six or so of the Raiders leave the\n     boats, wade ashore and without any resistance from him,\n     take hold of Hector. Hector's children instictively rise        *\n     as if to defend their father, but Deirdre, despite her          *\n     own feelings, wisely holds them back.                           *\n\n                                                              9.\n\n17   EXT. CLIFFS - DAY                                             17\n     Hector's hands have been bound with rope. He is being\n     led up to the top of the cliffs. The Priest and the\n     Leader walk on ahead, still talking intensely.\n     At the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the\n     wide sea are stretched out beneath them. The Priest, as\n     they arrive, becomes excited. He points to a pile of\n     large stones at the very summit of the headland. The\n     mound of stones is obviously man-made.\n                            PRIEST\n               I told you! I knew they did it\n               around here! Ask him...\n     The Leader moves closer to Hector and talks to him in a\n     friendly, reasoning tone.\n\n                             LEADER\n               What do we do? Do we throw you\n               over, is that the idea?\n     Hector doesn't understand.    He looks at him blankly.\n                             LEADER\n               He wants me to throw you over.\n               What does it do? Does it help the\n               sun? Should I throw you over?\n     The Leader tries to help Hector understand by miming the\n     act of throwing him off the cliff. Hector doesn't know\n     how to respond.\n                             PRIEST\n               I tell you, it's one man, one\n               stone. It'll help the voyage.\n     The Leader is unsure. He walks around the pile of\n     stones, checking it out from all sides as if it was some\n     infernal machine that he didn't know the workings of. He\n     squats down and squints through it to the watery sun\n     emerging from the clouds far out to sea. He looks across\n     to Hector, now sitting on the grass. The Leader sits\n     down beside him. They sit together like friends. The\n     ageless intimacy of sacrificer and victim.\n\n                             LEADER\n               What's it got to do with the sun?\n                             PRIEST\n               I don't know, yet.\n\n     The Leader looks at Hector.    Then he makes up his mind.\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              10.\n\n17   CONTINUED:                                                     17\n                                LEADER\n                  No.  It's too much of a risk.\n                  Just add a stone to the pile. Let\n                  him go. That's the best we can\n                  do.  Let's go.\n\n     With that, he stands up. The Priest, with some       sense of\n     ceremony, looks around for a large stone, picks      one up\n     and places it on top of the pile. He waits for       a moment,\n     almost as if he expects some consequence of his      action.\n\n                                PRIEST\n                  It's meaningless, without him\n                  going over the cliff.\n\n     The Leader strides off back toward the beach. The others\n     follow him, giving a final look or smile to Hector, apart\n     from the Priest, who looks him up and down, regretting\n     that he is not by now a corpse in the ocean. Hector\n     watches them go, too shocked still to react in any mean-\n     ingful way. He stands alone, trying to unpick the rope\n     that binds his hands.\n     When they are some distance from him, Hector starts to\n     follow them, at first running to catch up and then simply\n     trotting after them. The Raiders are aware of him behind\n     them. The Leader eventually stops and calls to Hector.\n                                 LEADER\n                  Off you go.   We don't want you.\n     He turns from Hector   and moves on. Hector persists in\n     following them. They    are his only connection now with\n     anything that thinks   or feels in the world. His link\n     with them is all that   is left. Again and again the\n     Leader stops to shoo   Hector away, but Hector dumbly tags\n     along behind.\n\n18   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                               18\n\n     The Raiders wade out to the waiting boats. Hector\n     follows to the very water's edge, then stands and bleakly\n     watches them. The Raiders prepare to move off. Hector\n     is an embarrassment to them now. At the last moment the\n     Leader gives a brusque order to one of his men. The man\n     clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again,\n     carrying a large flint-bladed knife. He comes out of the\n     water and walks up to Hector. Hector is beyond any form\n     of reaction. He will take whatever is offered to him.\n     The man comes close, the knife held ready. He stands in\n     front of Hector for a moment. On the boat, Hector's\n     family are tense with fear for his life.\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         11.\n\n18   CONTINUED:                                                 18\n     Then the tense moment passes, as the man grunts and nods\n     at Hector's hands, still bound with rope. Hector under-\n     stands. He lifts his hands and the man with some effort\n     hacks through the rough hemp. Then he turns and wades\n     back to the boat.\n\n     As the man clambers aboard the Leader speaks to him. The\n     man stops, drops back into the water, and returns to\n     Hector on the shore. He offers Hector the cut piece of\n     rope, a weird gesture of conciliation. He even smiles.\n     Hector refuses the gift. The man stands sheepishly for a\n     moment, then drops the rope at Hector's feet and wades\n     back to the boat. A piece of rope in exchange for a\n     family.\n\n     Hector watches them for some time, his family and the\n     strange Raiders, as they, achingly slowly, retreat from\n     his view and his life.\n     At last he turns and moves up from the shoreline. He\n     goes some distance then stops, thinks for a moment, then\n     retraces his steps. He goes back to the water's edge,\n     picks up the piece of rope that bound him, and walks\n     off with it. It might be of some use to him.\n\n\n19   INT. CAVE - DAY                                            19\n     Hector has returned to his cave home, now cold and empty\n     of life. He is working on his instincts now, still\n     emotionally in shock. He digs around in the embers of\n     the fire. Some of the larger bits of wood still hold\n     some life. Hector bends low and starts to waft expertly         *\n     and blow at the fire's remains.\n     We leave our first Hector squatting at his fire, in the\n     simplest act of physical survival. For him the problems\n     of emotional survival without his family lie ahead.\n\n20   INT. BATHHOUSE FURNACE - DAY                               20\n\n     This is another, bigger fire. In fact we might be in\n     hell. A crude furnace blazes. Filthy, sweat-covered\n     men feed it with wood and charcoal, an endless task given\n     the ferocity of the fire. To one side of the oppressive,\n     low-ceilinged furnace room, some small boys endlessly\n     toil at two large bellows, feeding the flames with jets\n     of air. OVER the NOISE of the FURNACE someone is\n     WHISTLING, an odd human sound in an inhuman setting.\n     Shadowy figures come and go with barrow loads of wood.\n     We TILT UP TO the space above the furnace to see a mass\n     of dangerously crude clay pipes, oozing water and steam\n     at every joint.\n\n                                                         12.\n\n21   INT. BATHHOUSE - DAY                                      21\n     Above the heat and filth there is a different world. A\n     clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing figures, droning\n     conversations and resonant laughter. It is the hot room\n     of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have\n     advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the\n     technology. It is men's day at the bathhouse. All of\n     the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and\n     comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance,\n     some around the edge of the pool, others in the water\n     rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. There are three\n     or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie-\n     torial way that they look after their masters gives the\n     place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over-\n     indulged grown-ups.\n\n     And then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall,\n     holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more\n     healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so         *\n     by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face\n     that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached\n     from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He\n     watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need\n     that he might have.\n\n     Hector's master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others\n     around him. He is in anxious conversation with an older        *\n     man wading beside him. We don't hear what they are saying\n     but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius'\n     pleading and the older man's cool distraction. The older\n     man gives a final dismissive shake of his head. Hector         *\n     immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as\n     Lucinnius climbs out of the water.\n                             LUCINNIUS\n               I'm going to the cool room.\n\n\n22   INT. BATHHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                      22   *\n     Hector wraps the towel around his master and follows him,\n     a look of concern on his face. Lucinnius' worries are\n     Hector's also.\n     Hector walks a pace behind Lucinnius through various\n     chambers of the bathhouse, passing the games area and\n     the massage room as they go. All around them slaves\n     attend to their pampered masters.\n\n23   INT. BATHHOUSE - COOL ROOM - DAY                          23   *\n\n     After an anxious scan of the cool room, Lucinnius goes\n     towards three men occupying a marble bench.\n                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            13.\n\n23   CONTINUED:                                                   23\n     Hector as if by magic produces a small wooden stool for\n     his master to sit on as he joins the others. Hector then\n     moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master's\n     behavior. Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to\n     casually join his friends. The eldest of the three\n     gives off as much of the aura of a Godfather as a naked\n     man in a towel can. The other two are deferential to\n     the older man, and treat Lucinnius with apparent con-\n     tempt. Hector watches the older man put a paternal\n     hand on Luccinius's shoulder and speak with a calm\n     smile on his face. Hector almost winces to see his\n     master submit to this patronizing treatment. Slave\n     and master exist so closely together that many of\n     their feelings are shared. More precisely, Lucinnius's\n     feelings are shared by Hector. It is a one-way exchange.\n     From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too,\n     Hector is living two lives, his own and his master's.\n     Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic\n     schizophrenia?\n     As Luccinius stands to leave we can    tell by their expres-\n     sions that the THREE MEN are open in    their contempt for\n     him. Hector is quickly on his feet     and by Lucinnius's\n     side as he goes. A final sarcastic     remark comes from one\n     of the three.\n                                MAN #1\n                  Well washed, Lucinnius.\n\n     Lucinnius tries to muster his dignity as they leave.              *\n\n24   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            24\n\n     This is not the grandeur of Rome, but the dusty main\n     street of a provincial capital in Greece or Spain or\n     North Africa. It is difficult to tell from the people\n     because they are such a cosmopolitan crowd, faces from\n     every corner of the Mediterranean world. It has some-\n     thing of the atmosphere of a frontier town in a western,\n     except that here the half-finished buildings are made of\n     brick and stone.\n     Lucinnius leaves the bathhouse. Hector follows three\n     paces behind him, loaded down with the large towel, the\n     scrubber, robe, and the wooden stool. The stool goes\n     with them everywhere, in case Lucinnius has to stop in\n     the street and converse with a friend. Other notables\n     are among the street throng, their own slaves tagging\n     along behind with their little wooden stools. Some have\n     whole trains of slaves shadowing them. Human status\n     symbols. Lucinnius stops near some street stalls.\n     Hector stops beside him.\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           14.        *\n\n24   CONTINUED:                                                  24\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  Bad omens, Hector. Bad omens.\n                  Get me something to eat. Just\n                  a mouse or two.\n                               HECTOR\n                  Yes.\n\n     Hector places the stool at Lucinnius's feet and moves off.\n     Lucinnius sits down, still absorbed in his problems.\n\n     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius as he orders the food.\n                                HECTOR\n                  Two mice... and some bread...\n\n                               STALLHOLDER\n                  No mice.\n                                HECTOR\n                  Two chicken legs, then, cold, and\n                  the bread.\n     As Hector is given the food and pays for it, he sees\n     another man, JULIAN, approach Lucinnius, trailed by TWO\n     SLAVES. One of them is carrying a folding chair much\n     more substantial than Lucinnius's. Julian and Lucinnius\n     greet one another and sit down to talk, Lucinnius at\n     something of a height disadvantage. The Two Slaves move\n     off to one side. Lucinnius's mood has brightened since\n     the arrival of his friend. Their conversation seems open\n     and friendly.\n     Hector gives his master his food, and then moves to join\n     the Two Slaves, hearing a snatch of the conversation as\n     he goes.\n\n                                JULIAN\n                  Of course you're free to call at my\n                  house at anytime, but I was\n                  receiving Nepos... how could I\n                  admit you?\n     Hector offers to share his bread with the other Two\n     Slaves.

Hector\n     and the Slaves hurry to gather up the seats and take their          *\n     positions behind their masters. The casualness of their\n     conversation has gone, and they resume the formality of\n     their roles.\n\n25   EXT.

They are gathered around a shrine in the large\n     public room. The entrails of a chicken lie on a slab of\n     marble. Hermas prods them with a knife. He makes much\n     of the mysteries of his craft, as if it were a skill\n     beyond ordinary men.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          17.\n\n26   CONTINUED:                                                 26\n     The other two peer over his shoulders.

I must.\n\n     This burst of resolve has relaxed Lucinnius.   His tense\n     muscles yield more to Hector's fingers.\n     THALIA enters the room. She is a household slave, a\n     Nubian from Africa. She carries a lighted torch and\n     moves around the room lighting the wall lamps.

HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   28\n\n     Late at night, Hector is still awake. He rises from his\n     bed and quietly moves out of the room. He is careful\n     not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him,\n     some of them sprawled on the floor. He shares his bed-\n     room with at least eight other slaves. Privacy is a\n     master's privilege.\n\n\n29   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           29\n     In the darkened house, Hector makes his way up some\n     stairs and along a passage. The only sound is a crack\n     or two of far-away THUNDER. At the end of the passage,\n     Hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall.\n     He climbs this, and lifts open the trap door above his\n     head.\n\n\n30   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT                                            30\n     Odd flashes of lightning far out to sea are the only\n     source of light as Hector moves across the flat roof.\n     In one corner he sees what he is looking for, the outline\n     of a figure resting against the low parapet wall. He\n     moves towards it. The figure speaks.\n\n                                FIGURE\n                  I missed you last night.\n     It is Thalia. We can tell that they are close.

At first it feels                 *\n     strange, their physical intimacy alongside their matter-\n     of-fact conversation, but gradually we understand it, the\n     giving and taking of comfort where it can be found, and\n     the realness of their friendship. Their stroking and\n     touching and holding becomes good to watch. We get a\n     feeling for what they have given one another, in stolen\n     hours and half hours, up here on the roof, the only place\n     where they can be themselves.\n                                HECTOR\n                  It's the Gods arguing.

HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       31\n\n     Hector is back in his bed. A figure enters the room,\n     steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes\n     him awake. Hector comes to. Lucinnius stands over him,\n     whispering.\n\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  I can't sleep. Get me a chicken.\n                  I want to make another sacrifice.\n                  We'll do it ourselves.\n\n     Hector wearily takes himself out of bed and follows\n     Lucinnius out of the room.\n\n                                                           22.        *\n\n32   INT. HENHOUSE - NIGHT                                       32\n     Hector is in the henhouse, in the dark, selecting a\n     chicken for sacrifice. He is about to leave when he\n     sees a MAN and WOMAN, arms around each other, sitting in\n     a corner. The Man looks at the white hen Hector is\n     holding.\n\n                             MAN\n               Can't you find a woman, Hector...\n     Hector smiles. He isn't surprised to see them. They are\n     only doing what he and Thalia do on the roof. The Slaves\n     have their meeting places scattered all over the house.\n                             HECTOR\n               Sorry to trouble you... just\n               fetching a chicken... good night\n               ... the roof's free...\n     The Man shakes his head with a smile. Hector leaves, the\n     sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms.\n                             HECTOR\n               Come on, miss, you can tell\n               Lucinnius his future.\n\n\n33   EXT. STREET - MORNING                                       33\n     Hector and Lucinnius are approaching the home of Cyprian.\n     Hector as usual is walking some paces behind his master,\n     and he carries a large satchel of documents. Cyprian's\n     home is a street palace. It is early in the morning, but\n     there is already activity around the house, visitors\n     coming and going, messengers, petitioners. A few impor-\n     tant callers arrive in litters, carried by slaves.\n     Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the door\n     and are checked in by the gateman. Lucinnius's hopes of\n     quietly bending Cyprian's ear are dashed. It seems as\n     if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial\n     Mr. Big.\n\n\n34   EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING                                    34\n     The slaves gather on one side of the courtyard, gossiping\n     and playing games of chance on the ground. Their masters\n     wait on the other side of the courtyard, seated on\n     benches along the wall. Cyprian's aides usher the\n     visitors into his presence in a regular flow, some have\n     an audience of a few minutes, others last merely seconds.\n\n     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius, like a mother watching\n     her child from a distance on its first day at school.\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              23.\n\n34   CONTINUED:                                                     34\n     Lucinnius, sitting expectantly in line, does look a\n     little pathetic, even ridiculous. Straight-backed, hands\n     on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri-\n     ficial offering himself.\n     Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other slaves\n     as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by\n     place to the front of the line. We almost expect Hector\n     to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is\n     finally summoned into the inner office. Hector waits.\n     The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn't emerge\n     within the first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him\n     the time of day. More minutes pass. Hector watches a\n     game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door.\n     One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go\n     into the office. So does Lucinnius' friend Julian.\n\n     Eventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad\n     smile on his face. Hector relaxes and leaves the ball\n     game to join him.\n                                HECTOR\n                  You look happier.\n\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  Relieved anyway... relieved that\n                  it's over at last.\n     Lucinnius strides out of the courtyard with Hector\n     following after him.\n\n35   EXT. STREETS - DAY                                             35\n\n     Lucinnius and Hector are walking home in their usual\n     formation. Hector is closer than normal, so that they\n     can talk.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  Will he help you?\n\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  I have to kill myself by tomorrow\n                  morning. He has all my letters to\n                  Titinius, none of them got\n                  through. He says it's like\n                  treason... and he says I should\n                  want to die for owing him half a\n                  million anyway...\n\n     Hector is shocked.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  What if you don't...\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              24.\n\n35   CONTINUED:                                                     35\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  Then he will... and that wouldn't\n                  be pleasant... he would drag me to\n                  Rome... those letters...\n     Lucinnius shivers to think of them.\n\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  I'm done for, Hector... but it's\n                  strange...

He    is talking to GALLUS, who is Lucinnius's\n     ten-year-old   son. Hector has a close friendship with\n     him. As we    listen to their conversation it becomes clear\n     that Hector   finds comfort in the boy, for the family that\n     he lost.\n     Today there is an air of distraction about Hector.\n     Understandable, considering his scheduled death.\n     The kitchen slaves come and go as they talk.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  But even if it's round you can\n                  still fall off the edge.\n     Hector has picked up a large metal plate to help him make\n     his point.\n                                GALLUS\n                  No... it's not round like that...\n                  it's round like this.\n     Gallus sees his playball.

A couple of\n     the godfather's foot soldiers.\n     They greet Lucinnius deferentially, but he knows that\n     they would break his back at the whim of their master.\n                                VISITOR\n                  Good evening, Lucinnius.

Hector stands beside Lucinnius,      who is\n     counting out coins and other valuables on     his table.\n                             LUCINNIUS\n               Eight hundred sesterces... cash\n               ... that's all that's left... what\n               a failure... my father left me\n               three farms and forty thousand...\n\n     Lucinnius places the money in a box on his table. He is\n     quite drunk, resigned now to his fate. Hector however is\n     cold sober, grim-faced. Lucinnius looks up at him.\n\n                             LUCINNIUS\n               Nothing else to be done.

Hector\n     walks behind, casting the light on Lucinnius's crumpled,\n     defeated form. Lucinnius begins to sob, at first\n     quietly, then more loudly and more pathetically. Hector\n     looks around and behind him, afraid, or perhaps hoping,\n     that Lucinnius's moans will wake the household.\n\n43   INT. WASH ROOM - NIGHT                                          43\n\n     Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of\n     distress, with drink and terror and self pity.\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              33.        *\n\n43   CONTINUED:                                                     43\n     He runs into the tiled washing room, wails loudly and\n     makes a stabbing motion at his stomach. Hector sees all\n     of this from behind as he enters the room. Lucinnius\n     crumples to the floor and squats on his knees. He calls\n     out in pain.\n\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  Oh, that hurts, that stings!\n     Lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool,\n     holding his stomach. Hector sits down beside him. They\n     both look down at the blade, still in Lucinnius' body.\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  This is hopeless.\n\n     They sit absurdly like this for a long moment, neither\n     of them knowing what do do next. It's awkward, like in a\n     waiting room. Then Lucinnius speaks.\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  Help me, Hector...\n                                HECTOR\n                  You've done it... you've done it\n                  ... lie down...\n     Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal.\n     He helps Lucinnius lie out on the marble floor.\n                                HECTOR\n                  Close your eyes... you did it...\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  Thank you, thank you.\n     The movement has increased the spread of blood over\n     Lucinnius' clothing. He raises his head.\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  You do it now, Hector... hurry...\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  Lie still... lie still...\n\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  Do it Hector... do it... you\n                  promised...\n     It looks as if Hector is playing for time.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  Shush... I'll need the knife...\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           34.\n\n43   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           43\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  Take it... do it...\n\n     Lucinnius' voice is fading now. Hector waits, then\n     reaches down for the knife in Lucinnius' stomach. We\n     see on his face the effort as he pulls at it, and do we\n     detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed Lucinnius\n     on his way? Lucinnius sighs and twitches a little. It's\n     as if the life flows out of him as the knife is released\n     from the wound. His voice is even more faint.\n\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  Do it, Hector... do it... do it...\n     Hector has the knife in his hand, but still he waits,\n     looking at Lucinnius, willing the last dregs of life from\n     him.\n                                LUCINNIUS\n                  Do it... do it... do it...\n     The whispers fade to a croak. Lucinnius lies still.\n     Hector has won this final battle of wills. He stands    up,\n     suddenly repulsed by what has happened. But quickly    he\n     gathers his wits. He makes his decision. He throws     the\n     knife down. It clatters along the hard shiny floor.\n     Hector has run out of the room before it has come to    rest\n     against the wall.\n\n44   INT. STUDY - NIGHT                                          44\n     Hector runs into the study and makes for the box contain-\n     ing the coins. He puts most of them into a leather money\n     bag and ties it to his waist. Then he pulls on\n     Lucinnius's cloak and rushes out of the room. He returns\n     quickly to pick up his certificate of freedom from the\n     table. Then just as he is leaving, he again stops, sits\n     down on the chair, pulls off his worn shoes and places on\n     his feet a pair of Lucinnius's stout street sandals.\n45   EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                      45\n\n     Hector is walking quickly from the kitchen across the\n     courtyard to the street gate. Near the gate he stops\n     and looks back at the house. He makes a decision and\n     retraces his steps across the courtyard and back into\n     the house.\n46   INT. THALIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                  46\n\n     Thalia is sleeping in a large pallet bed on the floor\n     with two other women. Hector gently shakes her shoulder,\n     trying not to wake the others. After a moment or two\n     Thalia opens her eyes.\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              35.\n\n46   CONTINUED:                                                     46\n     Hector whispers to her before she has time to open her\n     mouth.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  I'm leaving... come now if you\n                  want to... but we must hurry...\n                  I'm a free man...

HARBOR - NIGHT                                            47\n\n     The shadowy cloaked figures making their way down to the            *\n     harbor are Hector and Thalia.                                       *\n\n     Nearer the harbor we sense the nighttime work of loading\n     and preparing ships for the morning tide. By the light\n     of oil lamps cargos are manhandled aboard, voices shout,\n     WINCHES CREAK. Hector encounters a night WATCHMAN, but\n     diverts his suspicion by boldly addressing him.\n                                HECTOR\n                  I have some mail for Tyre... where\n                  are the east-bound ships?\n                                WATCHMAN\n                  Ask at the harbor.                                     *\n     With an authoritative nod, Hector strides off in the\n     direction of the noise and lights, Thalia at his heels.\n     Hector talks when the Watchman is out of earshot.\n                                HECTOR\n                  We want a timber ship... they go\n                  west... straight to Rome...\n\n                                 THALIA\n                  And then?   Then you go home?                          *\n     Hector hurries on, noncommittal in his reply.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  You can go to anywhere from Rome.\n\n\n48   EXT. QUAY - NIGHT                                              48\n     Hector and Thalia approach a ship heavily laden with\n     timber. Final supplies are being carried aboard, super-\n     vised by two men on the quay. Hector approaches them.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  Where is the Captain?\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         36.\n\n48   CONTINUED:                                                 48\n                                CREWMAN\n                  He's on the ship.\n\n     He indicates a man standing on the rear deck. Hector and\n     Thalia climb up the gangplank and approach him.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  Good morning, Captain...

SHIP - DAY                                            49\n     Hector and Thalia are asleep, huddled together in a cor-\n     ner of the ship that they have claimed as their quarters.\n\n     A CREWMAN comes and shakes Hector awake. He stirs himself\n     to the sounds of a SHIP UNDERWAY, the sounds of the SEA-\n     WASH, the WIND in the CANVAS, the MOANS of the TIMBERS.\n\n                                CREWMAN\n                  Captain says to come on deck.\n     Hector wakes Thalia and they clamber out of the darkness\n     of the hold onto the brightest, freshest of days at sea.\n\n                                                          37.\n\n50   EXT. SHIP - DAY                                             50\n     There is no sign of land behind them. The ship is moving\n     swiftly in a strong, clean breeze and a light sea. We\n     can tell from Thalia's reactions that she has never been\n     out at sea before, at least never above deck. Every-\n     thing is novel to her and it shows, even the movement of         *\n     the ship. Her excitement is childlike.\n\n                             THALIA\n               Where's the land gone?\n                                                                      *\n     Hector, too, is taken by the novelty of it all but is\n     less prepared to admit it. He waves his hands around the\n     empty horizon noncommittally.\n                             THALIA\n               Have you been on a ship before?\n\n                             HECTOR\n               Yes, of course.\n     We can tell he is lying.\n                             THALIA\n               Me, too, but they kept us down\n               there.\n     She points down into the lower depths of the hold.   Then\n     she gets even more excited.\n\n                             THALIA\n               Tonight... we'll be where the\n               thunder is!\n     They look at each other and then all around them. The\n     freshness of the day and on an overwhelming feeling of\n     freedom, exhilarate them. Their senses and their\n     feelings, are in new territory. They are like children\n     in a brand-new world.\n     The Captain on the other side of the ship, beckons them.         *\n\n                             CAPTAIN\n               Thought you would like to see\n               them.\n\n     He points to three shapes in the mid-distance, ships\n     heading for the port they have left. There is a thrill           *\n     in their glamor, their fine progress under full sail.\n                             CAPTAIN\n               Your master's ships... going\n               home...\n                                                                      *\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              38.\n\n50   CONTINUED:                                                      50\n                                HECTOR\n                  No... they can't be... they're\n                  lost...\n                                CAPTAIN\n                  No they're not...

The Captain smiles\n     at them and looks back to the ships, coursing healthily\n     on their way.\n                                CAPTAIN\n                  Somebody been putting the wind up\n                  Lucinnius? That's an old one...\n                  didn't think anybody'd fall for\n                  that...\n\n\n51   EXT. SHIP - DAY                                                 51\n     Later, the ship is still making brisk progress. Thalia\n     and Hector are sitting on deck, some distance from one\n     another. They are quieter now, more thoughtful. Hector               *\n     catches her eye. Hector is drawn by her smile and moves              *\n     to join her. They sit quietly, absorbed in thought,\n     thoughts of each other, their looks and smiles tell us\n     that. As if they are talking without words. Hector\n     looks around him. A sailor on the forward deck is\n     sorting out some rope, an echo of a previous time and                *\n     place. The wind catches the sailor's hat. He grabs it\n     from the air and spends time arranging it once more on\n     his head, just so. A tiny human moment.                              *\n\n\n52   EXT. WAGON - DAY                                                52\n     A man is driving a heavy two-horse wagon. The wind has\n     just lifted his hat from his head. He spends some time\n     replacing it carefully, just so. Watching him from the\n     back of the wagon is Hector.\n     The drama of the lives of Thalia and Hector      has played\n     itself out long ago. Between the breath of       sea breeze\n     that lifted the hat of the Roman sailor and      the gust of\n     mountain wind that snatches the hat of the      wagoner, lies\n     1400 years.                                                          *\n\n     Hector sits   in the wagon beside a woman. There are\n     tantalizing   similarities between their situation and the           *\n     one we left   Thalia and Hector in on the boat a few\n     moments ago,   1400 years ago.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               39.\n\n52   CONTINUED:                                                      52\n     The woman and Hector exchange glances now and then,\n     delicate signals of mutual awareness. Talking without\n     words.\n     They are not alone in the wagon, perched on its half load\n     of timber. With them is a NUN accompanying a GIRL of\n     about eight. The Girl is tearful. A man, his face\n     unseen, is snoring underneath his hat. A younger man,\n     gaunt and hungry-looking, is dressed in the rough\n     travelling clothes of a monk or PRIEST. Even without his\n     habit we would know he was a holy man. His incessant\n     talk tells us.\n                                PRIEST\n                  We want to praise God because we\n                  live in this ultimate age, when\n                  all things are done, all is known,\n                  all the wonders of his creation\n                  revealed to us... nothing more for\n                  man to see or do... all that is\n                  left is the hope of salvation...\n                  even for our humbler sisters...\n     The Girl is sobbing through all of this.\n                                PRIEST\n                  Yes weep, child, weep for joy...\n                  you are a glorious example to us\n                  all... already a child of God's...\n                  blessed to spend your earthly days\n                  within his church as Christ's\n                  servant... what generous parents\n                  you have... giving you to the\n                  sisters... What a sacrifice.                            *\n     There is an Irish lilt to his voice which colors what                *\n     he is saying with a tinge of mischief. He is a difficult\n     fellow to pin down. Hector looks at him amusedly, still              *\n     sharing his thoughts silently with the woman, BEATRICE.\n     The Nun interrupts the Priest cheerfully.\n\n                                NUN\n                  She's already received the last\n                  rites, before she left her family.\n                  She belongs to God now... Don't you?                    *\n\n     The child sobs more noisily.                                         *\n                                PRIEST\n                  Fortunate child, destined for\n                  paradise. Untouched by the\n                  abiding curse of carnal lust.

If all men forsook forever the\n                  fleshy temptations... and held\n                  womankind to barrenness... think\n                  how much the sooner would come the\n                  day of judgement... all God's\n                  chosen gathered in paradise... I've               *\n                  written a small treatise in favor                 *\n                  of virginity, sister. We could                    *\n                  discuss it later if you like...                   *\n\n     The DRIVER of the wagon turns his head briefly to the\n     Priest.\n                                DRIVER\n                  What are you talking about?\n     Hector gestures to Beatrice that he is leaving the wagon\n     to walk for a while and asks her to join him. She shakes\n     her head with a smile. Hector smiles, too, then jumps\n     down from the wagon and, walking slowly, allows it to\n     gain ground in front of him. The ramblings of the Priest\n     fade away.\n\n                                PRIEST\n                  It's simple, brother... if we\n                  cease carnal union entirely then\n                  in fifty or so years we'll all be\n                  rid of our earthly lives and God\n                  can proceed with His reign over\n                  His heavenly kingdom... that same\n                  paradise that God gave to man\n                  before, but which man was so unfit\n                  to inhabit that within seven hours\n                  Eve was already tempting her\n                  master and mate, and within nine\n                  hours the Lord had to expel the\n                  both of them! Just think, they                    *\n                  messed it up in nine hours!                       *\n\n                                                         41.\n\n53   EXT. MOUNTAIN TRACK - DAY                                 53\n     Hector smiles as the Priest's VOICE FADES into the dis-\n     tance. It is a  cold fresh day of early summer. They are       *\n     travelling high in the mountains. Hector dawdles on\n     his way, eating a hard biscuit he takes from his pocket.\n     The last sound he hears from the wagon is the renewed\n     WAILING OF the GIRL. Hector lays himself down at the           *\n     side of the road. His eyes begin to close. Then a SOUND\n     in the distance makes him open them again. He listens.\n     MORE SOUNDS drift up to him from the floor of the valley.\n     He stands up and crosses the track. At first he can see\n     nothing. He walks back along the rim of the road. Then\n     he sees where the noise is coming from. A mounted\n     skirmish is in progress, just where a wooden bridge\n     crosses the small river, at the very bottom of the valley.\n     There are no more than 30 knights in full armor, with\n     twice as many foot soldiers and squires. Even from such\n     a distance Hector can see and hear that the fighting is\n     ferocious, almost insane in its intensity. From this\n     distance it is like a puppet show, except the violence\n     is real. The scene places Hector in his time and for us\n     there is a strange feeling to it, almost as if Hector\n     has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to\n     some distant age. But this is not the case. Hector is\n     where he belongs, in Medieval Europe.\n     Hector makes his decision. With a last look behind him         *\n     he runs off in the direction of the wagon. Like any wise\n     citizen of a violent age, Hector knows when to leg it.\n\n\n54   EXT. WAGON - DAY                                          54\n     Hector catches up with the moving wagon and jumps onto\n     it, happily back in the security of his fellow                 *\n     travellers. He smiles at Beatrice.                             *\n\n                             HECTOR\n               A bit cold... walking...\n     She smiles at him. He sits opposite her in the wagon,\n     and allows his foot to touch hers. She doesn't move\n     away. Hector calls to the Driver.\n                             HECTOR\n               How long to get there?\n\n                             DRIVER\n               When it gets dark, we'll be there.                   *\n\n     Hector looks at Beatrice.\n\n                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              42.\n\n54   CONTINUED:                                                     54\n                                HECTOR\n                  I thought I heard fighting... back\n                  there...\n     Beatrice replies, but in a language that Hector doesn't\n     understand.\n\n                                BEATRICE\n                  I don't know what you're saying...\n                  I haven't understood anything\n                  you've said all day...\n\n     Hector talks back to her.\n                                HECTOR\n                  I don't know what you're saying...\n\n     They both smile. It doesn't seem to disturb them too\n     much that they don't share a language. They repeat                  *\n     their incomprehensible statements, just for the fun of\n     it.\n                                BEATRICE\n                  I don't know what you're saying.\n                                HECTOR\n                  I don't understand.\n     Beside Hector the Girl has stopped sobbing but she is\n     still troubled. She turns to him and speaks quietly but\n     with determination.\n                                GIRL\n                  I want to go home to my mother.\n     Hector doesn't know how to respond. He can do nothing               *\n     to help her, and anyway, is more interested in Beatrice.            *\n\n55   EXT. FARMYARD - NIGHT                                          55\n\n     It is almost dark when the wagon finally turns into the\n     yard of the farm where they will spend the night.\n\n56   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         56\n\n     The Farmer and his Wife have laid out a table with\n     simple food, a stew, bread and wine. The travellers settle\n     down to eat. The Priest, however makes a performance out\n     of his more modest needs. He calls loudly to the wife\n     working at the open fire.\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              43.\n\n56   CONTINUED:                                                     56\n                                PRIEST\n                  Just bread and water for me,\n                  Mistress. I have no need of wine\n                  or meat.\n     She brings him a jug of water and he makes much of giving\n     thanks to God for his simple meal, muttering his grace\n     quietly to himself, excluding all others from his conver-\n     sation with the Almighty.\n\n57   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         57\n     In the dark, sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an\n     upstairs room. Gentle snores and regular breathing lay a\n     blanket of soft sound over the human forms.\n\n     One of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow. Hector,\n     in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes\n     aware of this. He watches as the figure stands up and\n     picks its way between the bodies to the door. The figure\n     pauses and crouches over Beatrice. Hector can hear the\n     distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her, from head to\n     toe, and then a deep, long sigh. The figure stands up and\n     moves quietly to the door, disappearing downstairs.\n     Hector rouses himself and follows the other.\n\n\n58   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         58\n     Hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen. The                 *\n     figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard RUMMAGING\n     there. Hector creeps closer and sees that it is the\n     Priest. He already has a chicken leg between his teeth\n     as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under\n     his arm. He emerges from the pantry. He sees Hector\n     standing by the table. They recognize one another and\n     relax. The Priest doesn't re-enter his holy act. He\n     speaks normally, cheekily.\n\n                                PRIEST\n                  God, I'm starving. Do you think\n                  I dare heat that up on the fire?\n\n     He indicates the large pot containing the remains of the\n     stew.\n                                PRIEST\n                  No... I'll eat it cold... I\n                  deserve to suffer.\n\n     He pours some wine into the cup and slides it across the\n     table to Hector.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                44.\n\n58   CONTINUED:                                                       58\n     Then he digs his hands into the cold stew and eats chunks\n     of meat as they talk.\n\n                                PRIEST\n                  Have some wine.\n\n     Hector takes a drink.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  I saw some fighting today... back\n                  up the road...\n\n                                PRIEST\n                  So, the mad knights are at it\n                  again... what were they, Swiss\n                  or English?\n\n                                  HECTOR\n                  I don't know.    They all look the\n                  same to me.\n                                PRIEST\n                  It might help us get through...\n                  if there's a bit of confusion...\n                  we'll still travel separately\n                  though, for now.\n     The Priest changes his tone of voice, mocking his own\n     holy act.\n                                PRIEST\n                  But, Hector, you must keep out\n                  of the way of temptation... I saw\n                  the way you were eyeing up that\n                  widow... now stay away from\n                  that... although she is beautiful,\n                  is she not... but we're going\n                  home, remember.\n     Hector is smiling.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  How do you know she's a widow?\n                                PRIEST\n                  Look at her eyes... hungry eyes...\n                  she could lead you into trouble...\n                  she smells like paradise, though.\n     He changes his tone yet again.       He talks straight.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                  45.\n\n58   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                  58\n                                PRIEST\n                  Listen, Hector, let's get this\n                  clear... if anyone's going to dally\n                  with that widow it'll be me... you\n                  couldn't handle her... she'd\n                  bewitch you... at any rate, you're\n                  not a sinning kind of fellow, are\n                  you... why don't you get off up\n                  the road tomorrow, and I'll catch\n                  you up, in five or so days...\n\n     Hector doesn't answer, but smiles. The Priest has\n     stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely.\n                                PRIEST\n                  You're not a sinning fellow,\n                  remember... another month and\n                  we'll be at the channel, then\n                  home... the little ones you only\n                  talk about when you're drunk...\n                  don't forget them...\n     Hector still remains silent.

FARMYARD - DAY                                            59\n\n     Overnight, the remnants of a company of soldiers, fresh             *\n     from battle, have collected in the courtyard. Some are\n     tired, dispirited, others are wounded. Our Travellers               *\n     watch from the farm window.

They scatter the food from the table and lay out\n     the MOANING suit of armor on it. A young SQUIRE follows\n     them in and kneels by the knight in the suit. The MOANS\n     are MUFFLED because the knight's helmet has been battered\n     out of shape in the battle and can't be removed. The\n     ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the\n     head inside. The Soldiers gingerly try to remove the\n     helmet. Their efforts are useless. Blood oozes from the\n     joints of the helmet. The MOANING suit of armor seems\n     inhuman, robot-like.\n\n                                SOLDIER\n                  Must be sore in there.

Hector            *\n     takes time to watch the   Squire still kneeling beside his          *\n     father, quietly stroking   the helmet. Ronald the Priest\n     mutters every prayer he   can remember. The suit of armor\n     twitches and MOANS.\n\n     Hector looks at Beatrice and motions for her to follow\n     him outside. The Priest looks on helplessly as they\n     slide past the table and head for the door.\n\n\n61   EXT. FARM - DAY                                                61\n     More soldiers have continued to make their way to the\n     shelter of the farm. Everywhere is the chaos of war.\n     Wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the\n     medicos or the priest. Prisoners huddle in cowed groups.\n     Everyone looks for food. Individual soldiers, like lost\n     souls, run here and there trying to regroup with their\n     comrades. The youngest are squires of twelve or thir-\n     teen, the oldest are red-faced, overweight knights in\n     expensive armor.\n\n     Hector and Beatrice have found a quiet corner where they\n     can sit and talk. Behind them is a group of soldiers,\n     reserves who have not yet joined the battle. They are\n     much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci-\n     plined unit.\n     Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground\n     drill and battle training. To the BEAT of DRUMS they\n     perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same\n     pattern over and over again. A deadly dance, thrusting\n     their pikes in unison. They become like one evil,\n     inhuman machine. It is mesmerizing to watch, all the                *\n     more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hector\n     and Beatrice are acting out. They have the problem of not\n     sharing a language, but, resourceful as lovers are, they\n     soon employ this as another titillating element in their\n     love-play.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  I think you know what I'm saying\n                  ... a little...\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             49.\n\n61   CONTINUED:                                                    61\n                                BEATRICE\n                  No, I don't, I don't understand\n                  a word.\n                                HECTOR\n                  How come you don't speak like\n                  anyone else?

FARM - DAY                                             63\n     Hector and Beatrice have found some privacy, near the\n     trees and by a low wall. Some bushes hide them from\n     full view of the farm yard. Hector is sitting cross-\n     legged and Beatrice kneels behind him, giving his head\n     a thorough going over. Mutual grooming is the original,\n     and perhaps the best, form of foreplay. Hector certainly\n     likes it.\n\n                              BEATRICE\n               That's four.\n\n                             HECTOR\n               Yes, it does feel good.\n     She gives his scalp a final delicious rub, and then stops.\n\n                             BEATRICE\n               You can do me now.\n     Beatrice loosens her clothing to bare her neck and\n     shoulders. Hector begins to probe her hair and scalp.            *\n     She arches her back under the first touch of his fingers.\n     Hector laps it up, inspired to caress ever more tenderly         *\n     her scalp and neck, still with the outward purpose of\n     looking for fleas.\n                             HECTOR\n               Got one... a tiny little one...\n               yours are so small... and fair...                      *\n     To Hector even her fleas are a delight. He seems to want         *\n     to keep it as a pet. There is no hope for this man.              *\n     Beatrice moans softly, happily. Hector still kneading            *\n     her scalp.\n                             HECTOR\n               I don't know your name. I'm\n               Hector... who are you? I'm\n               Hector.\n     Beatrice replies with a hint of breathlessness.\n\n                             BEATRICE\n               Hector... yes... I'm Beatrice...\n\n                              HECTOR\n               Beatrice.\n                             BEATRICE\n               Yes. Hector...

At first it is small, snatched\n     kisses amongst the grooming, but soon the kisses become\n     longer and the grooming less.\n\n                                BEATRICE\n                  I'm still itchy lots of places,\n                  Hector.\n\n64   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            64\n     The Priest is with some seriously wounded soldiers, laid\n     out in a corner of the farmyard. Whether he is a bogus\n     priest or not, Ronald is taking his duties seriously.\n     There is a little of the rogue about him now. He sees\n     the Nun and the little Girl preparing to leave. They\n     have acquired a mule. They mount up, the Girl behind\n     the Nun, and plod off through the farmyard. They stop\n     briefly beside the Priest to say their farewells.\n                                PRIEST\n                  Goodbye, little girl... the Lord\n                  will bless you, I know, in his\n                  house.\n     He talks to the Nun as they move off.\n\n                                PRIEST\n                  How long for you on the road?\n\n                                NUN\n                  Three or four days.\n                                PRIEST\n                  Good luck to you.\n\n                                NUN\n                  They're not killing nuns, yet.\n\n                                PRIEST\n                  The Saxon, won't he go with you?\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           54.        *\n\n64   CONTINUED:                                                  64\n                                NUN\n                  He's nowhere to be seen.\n\n     The Priest watches them go, and then returns to his\n     duties with the wounded.\n\n\n65   EXT. TRACK - DAY                                            65\n     The Nun's mule turns out of the farmyard and heads off\n     along the track. A few Soldiers are burying some of\n     their dead nearby. The Nun watches this and doesn't see\n     what the Girl sees on the other side, the mingled bodies\n     of Hector and Beatrice, all pretence at grooming now\n     gone, engaged in fervent lovemaking. It's probably the\n     first and last that the Girl will see. A smile flickers\n     across her face before she turns away forever. Ahead of\n     her there might be many a bleak night in her convent\n     when she will remember the image, and that same smile\n     will return to her lips.\n\n66   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                         66\n\n     The Priest is kneeling beside a young wounded Soldier.\n     He is close to death, but in his youth is fighting it.\n     He is frightened, and clings to the presence of Ronald.\n                                SOLDIER\n                  My name is Peter... don't forget\n                  ... tell everybody that was my\n                  name...

Peter...\n                  say it again.\n\n     Ronald stays with the boy as he struggles against his\n     own annihilation.\n                               PRIEST\n                  Peter...\n\n     Ronald behaves well with the dying boy.\n\n                                                         55.\n\n67   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                     67\n     The Priest makes his way upstairs in the darkness. He\n     yawns, a long, contented yawn. He has completed the\n     hardest day's work that he has undertaken as a priest,\n     if he really is a priest. If he is not, then the pre-\n     tence has been just as exhausting. He wants to sleep.\n\n\n68   INT. FARMHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                     68\n     In the room sleeping forms lie here and there in the\n     darkness. Some officers have moved in and the place is\n     more crowded than before. The Priest makes his way to\n     his corner, but on the way he pauses by Beatrice. She\n     snores lightly. The Priest bends over and takes a long\n     sniff at her, then he sighs out his admiration.\n\n     He steps over her and settles into his own space by the\n     window. He suddenly misses the presence of Hector. He\n     looks again at Beatrice, still and sleeping. What the\n     Priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging\n     her neck and head. She moans softly in her pretence of\n     sleep.\n     The Priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know\n     why. He sniffs again, in the general direction of\n     Beatrice. The mingled smells that his sensitive nose\n     detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his           *\n     cloak over his head.\n\n     Across the room, Hector's head emerges from the covering\n     beside Beatrice. They make love quietly in the dark,\n     also enjoying the thrill of confounding the Priest.\n\n\n69   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                       69\n     The Priest wakes up. Outside he can hear the first\n     sounds of the day, the murmuring VOICES of Soldiers in\n     the yard, the CLATTER OF MILK PAILS. In the room it is\n     still semi-dark. The Priest sits up. The others have\n     already left, but Beatrice is there, stretching herself\n     and fixing her hair. Hector is not with her. She smiles\n     at the Priest. Then, in another part of the room, Hector\n     emerges from what looks like a pile of clothing, sits up\n     and smiles too.\n\n                               HECTOR\n               Good morning.\n     Hector and Beatrice look at each other. The Priest looks\n     at them in turn. Their cheeky act of innocence mocks\n     him.\n\n                                                              56.\n\n70   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            70\n     Hector is washing himself by the stream that flows close\n     by the yard. He drinks a handful of water for breakfast.\n     The Priest sees him from the farmyard and comes to join\n     him.                                                                *\n     Hector is in a cheerful mood, pleased with himself and\n     his success with Beatrice. The Priest is sullen,\n     reproachful.\n                             HECTOR\n               You're a busy man, what with all\n               these souls departing.\n                             PRIEST\n               There's nothing wrong with helping\n               someone to die in peace. They\n               want me to go with them.\n                             HECTOR\n               Nothing at all.\n                             PRIEST\n               Are you staying here?\n\n                             HECTOR\n               Moving on, as you told me to...\n               we'll meet up, like you said.\n               I'll wait for you at the channel.\n                                                                         *\n                             PRIEST\n               She'll do you harm. I told    you.\n               She might be a witch. Wait    for\n               me. I still have the money     from\n               Venice. We can be home in    a\n               month.\n                             HECTOR\n               Witch my arse. Stop giving me\n               orders.\n     Both of them are unhappy now, confusing one another,\n     spoiling their friendship.\n                             HECTOR\n               You're a strange fellow. Are you\n               a priest? Are you jealous?\n\n     The Priest is silent. They are saved from hurting each\n     other more. A Soldier shouts down to them from the farm.\n\n                             SOLDIER\n               We're moving soon, Father.\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              57.\n\n70   CONTINUED:                                                     70\n     The Priest turns to Hector for what might be the last\n     time.\n\n                                PRIEST\n                  So, you're leaving?\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  You have work to do here.\n     The Priest walks back up to the farm. Hector calls out              *\n     what might be an attempt at an apology or simply another            *\n     taunt.\n                                HECTOR\n                  I don't understand you.\n\n     The Priest looks back at him briefly, then walks on.\n\n\n71   EXT. TRACK - DAY                                               71\n     Hector and Beatrice have packed their few belongings into\n     a shoulder bag. They turn out of the farmyard and walk\n     down the main track.\n     Hector catches a last glimpse of the Priest being helped\n     onto the back of a horse, behind a Soldier. He is ridden\n     off in the opposite direction with the rest of the troop.\n     Other battles lie ahead to be blessed, and more battered\n     bodies requiring comfort.\n     Hector and   Beatrice are enjoying the first pulse-\n     quickening   flush of their intimacy, and the thrill of\n     knowing it   will go further. They chatter freely,                  *\n     despite not   sharing a language.\n                                HECTOR\n                  I'm glad we're going the same way.\n                                BEATRICE\n                  We'll have to sleep in the hills\n                  tonight. Will you keep me warm?\n     The damp greyness of the early morning has lifted and the\n     sun is shining as they step out onto the higher hills.\n\n\n72   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                            72\n     Hector and Beatrice have stopped to eat. They shelter in\n     the fold of a hillside, with a wide stream running some\n     way below. Hector feeds Beatrice a piece of cheese from\n     his knife.\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             58.\n\n72   CONTINUED:                                                    72\n                                BEATRICE\n                  Hurry up and finish your wine and\n                  then we can make love.\n     Hector seems to know what she is saying. He throws down\n     his knife and cheese, lying down with her on the grass.\n     He kisses her breasts and her body eagerly. He lifts her\n     skirts and caresses and kisses her naked legs and thighs.\n     She stretches herself out happily, arms spread wide on\n     the grass. Hector talks through his kisses.\n\n                                HECTOR\n                  Why do you smell so wonderful?\n     He lifts his head to let her see him sniffing.                     *\n\n                                BEATRICE\n                  Oh, you like my smell, do you?

Such a squire would follow\n     his knight into battle, guiding him through the chaos.                *\n     But this boy seems to have died a less public, more\n     furtive death.

Hector and Beatrice are open to this sad-               *\n     ness, but in their age sentiment was of a tougher strain.\n                                BEATRICE\n                  We'll cover his eyes at least...\n                  so the crows don't get him.

Beatrice hasn't\n     removed her new shoes, she likes them so much. She is\n     dabbing Hector with her perfume which, he has discovered,\n     she keeps in a small bottle kept in a pouch on a chain\n     around her neck.\n                                                                        *\n     Nearby the corpse of   the squire still lies, its head\n     shrouded in stones,   as if absurdly hiding its eyes from\n     the antics of Hector   and Beatrice. The old shoes\n     Beatrice has placed   on its feet look odd compared to\n     the fine uniform.                                                  *\n\n     Hector and Beatrice seem unaware of the strangeness of\n     their situation, but perhaps it only looks strange to\n     our modern eyes.\n\n     Hector continues to bask in her wonderful aroma.\n                                HECTOR\n                  You've put magic in this stuff,\n                  haven't you, you're bewitching\n                  me...\n     They appear to get the gist of one another's love talk.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             61.\n\n74   CONTINUED:                                                    74\n                                BEATRICE\n                  You're eager today, Hector, aren't\n                  you?

She takes a\n     handful of dried flowers or herbs from a pouch in her\n     bag. Mumbling strangely and quickly to herself, she\n     walks around the corpse three times, scattering the\n     leaves over the body.\n     Hector is fascinated, but a little uneasy. He watches\n     from a safe distance. During the few moments that it\n     takes, Beatrice seems like a different person.\n     Then, all of a sudden, the familiar, friendly Beatrice\n     returns. She completes her ceremony by throwing a few\n     drops of her perfume over the body.

The\n     air is clean. The landscape    looks untouched by man,\n     but a few smudges of smoke in   the distance suggest farms\n     or villages. There might be    the glimpse of a castle on\n     a hill.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           62.\n\n76   CONTINUED:                                                  76\n     If it all feels oddly familiar to us, then perhaps it\n     is the memory of a picture in a forgotten story book, or\n     an ancient landscape on a gallery wall. Once again in\n     the film there is the tantalizing feeling of awaking not\n     from a dream, but in a dream.\n\n     The moment passes in the more down to earth concerns of\n     Hector and Beatrice.\n                                HECTOR\n                  I have to keep the sun on my back,\n                  that's what Ronald said... the\n                  sun on my back all the way home...\n                  I'll stay on this side of the\n                  river...\n\n                                BEATRICE\n                  Yes, of course... we stay on this\n                  side of the river, all the way\n                  down... until tomorrow...\n                                HECTOR\n                  I stay on this side...\n\n                                BEATRICE\n                  Yes...

Or\n     simply an early version of a cluttered handbag?\n\n     We don't know what is passing through Hector's mind.\n     Perhaps he is trying to work out how he came to be lying\n     with the strange, wonderful, unknowable creature by his\n     side. And how many people have done that through the\n     ages, in caves or by campfires, or in suburban bedrooms?\n     There are many ways in which we will be able to connect\n     with this perplexed, flea-ridden man, far away from home,\n     huddling by a fire in the forest, trapped in his time, as\n     we all are.\n\n79   EXT.

He maneuvers his small boat to them and they\n     clamber aboard. Beatrice and the boatman greet each\n     other familiarly. They gossip amiably as the ferry makes\n     its way across the river.

I'll\n                  make them fit you...\n\n     She holds the jacket up against Hector to measure it.\n     Hector's reaction to a dead man's clothing is                       *\n     predictable.                                                        *\n\n                                HECTOR                                   *\n                  What did he die of?                                    *\n                                BEATRICE\n                  I'm getting shy.

You\n                  and me... sleep...\n     Hector is beginning to understand what she means, but he\n     keeps his feelings to himself. Beatrice talks on. Now\n     that she has started, she wants to say it all.\n\n                                BEATRICE\n                  I like you. You like me too,\n                  don't you? We were lucky to meet\n                  the way we did. All the men around\n                  here are old.                                          *\n     Beatrice falls silent, overtaken     by her shyness. Hector\n     understands fully what she means     now, but his mind is\n     a confusion. He can't respond.       She tries to direct his\n     thoughts to the one area she is     sure about.\n                                BEATRICE\n                  Come up and I'll show you the bed...\n     She climbs a   ladder nearby and lifts open a trapdoor\n     on the wooden   ceiling. Hector climbs up to join her and\n     together they   stand on the ladder with their heads poking\n     into the tiny   space above.\n\n84   INT.

Hector's expression lightens a little too.\n     It occurs to him to take up her offer immediately. She               *\n     catches his thought, and the moment tingles happily.                 *\n     Then from outside they hear voices.

A BOY\n     of about eight and   a GIRL of ten are coming in from the            *\n     garden. They have    been working outside. Beatrice goes\n     to embrace each of   them. Hector's face is a confusion\n     once again.\n                                GIRL\n                  You were gone a long time.

She stands\n     proudly by her children.\n\n                                BEATRICE\n                  These are my children...\n\n     The CREAK of a door makes Hector turn his head.\n                                BEATRICE\n                  ... and this is my mother....\n\n     An OLD WOMAN stands in the main doorway, smiling at\n     Hector and nodding her head. She speaks to her daughter.\n                                MOTHER (OLD WOMAN)\n                  So... you found one, eh?\n\n     Hector stands, surrounded by instant family, and doesn't\n     know what to do. Eventually he speaks.                               *\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              67.        *\n\n85   CONTINUED:                                                     85\n                                HECTOR\n                  Is there water... to drink... to\n                  wash?\n     He mimes with his hands. Beatrice understands that he\n     wants some breathing space. She talks to her son.\n\n                                BEATRICE\n                  Take Hector to the well... but\n                  come here first.\n\n     She takes off the dead Squire's shoes and puts them on\n     the Boy's bare feet. He is delighted. He does a little\n     dance in them before leaving with Hector.\n\n\n86   EXT. WELL - DAY                                                86\n     Hector stands at the well some way from the house.\n     Beatrice's garden is a madness of wild flowers, harvested\n     by her for scents and powders. She is a remarkable\n     woman, living as she does in the harsh male world of\n     her time. The scented air and the dizzy SOUNDS OF the\n     BEES almost make Hector swoon. He is experiencing the\n     full, heady impact of Beatrice, and it is summed up in\n     a full-blown pollen-filled sneeze.\n     He drinks at   her well. The Boy is beside him, still\n     engrossed in   his new shoes. Hector splashes some water\n     on his face   and looks back at the house. He has some\n     decisions to   make.\n\n\n87   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                             87\n     The Mother sits by the window in the nearest thing to\n     a comfortable chair that the house has to offer. She\n     is working on some lace. Hector enters the room to\n     watch her. He smiles and stands shyly at the door. The\n     Mother thinks he wants her chair for himself. In a\n     flurry of apology she rises, drops her work and motions\n     for Hector to have the good seat. He is full of\n     embarrassment.\n                                HECTOR\n                  No, no... sit down... I just came\n                  to watch... please... sit...\n     He guides the Mother back to the good chair. They\n     struggle comically for a while, but eventually she allows\n     Hector to settle her there. She mumbles unhappily.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             68.        *\n\n87   CONTINUED:                                                    87\n                                MOTHER\n                  We can't have this... this was\n                  Arnaud's seat... it's yours\n                  now...

I don't want it... it's\n                  yours... I can sit on the box.\n     The old woman   allows herself a shy smile. Whether in\n     innocence or   mischief, she has secured the best seat in\n     the house for   herself. If he stays, Hector will never\n     dare rest his   bones in it.\n\n88   EXT. YARD - DAY                                               88\n     Hector has retreated to the yard. The Girl is\n     boiling some dyes in a cauldron over an open fire. The\n     Boy is working at a basketful of flower heads, pulling\n     petals and separating the hearts, putting them in a\n     large jar of colored liquid.\n     Hector is aware of Beatrice watching him. She is\n     returning to the kitchen, firmly holding a struggling\n     chicken, wings flapping and feathers flying everywhere.\n     This chicken is making the supreme sacrifice in\n     Beatrice's final effort at total seduction, a wonderful\n     meal. Hector is guiltily aware of this as their eyes\n     meet briefly.\n     Hector takes in   what the Boy is doing and joins in\n     the work. The    Boy smiles at Hector's initial clumsiness.\n     He motions for   Hector to have a sniff of the jar of\n     liquid. Hector    does so.  The smell is heady and pleasant.\n\n                               HECTOR\n                  Ah...\n     The Boy says something and points towards his sister.\n     She stands by her cauldron, stirring the bubbling liquid.\n     Hector goes to watch her work. He looks in the cauldron.\n                                HECTOR\n                  Good color... for cloth?\n\n     Without thinking, Hector leans over the cauldron to\n     sniff. A hideous odor assaults him. He backs off.\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             69.        *\n\n88   CONTINUED:                                                    88\n                               HECTOR\n                  Ugh...\n\n     The Girl says something to him, and points to a bucket\n     of liquid at her feet. Hector makes out something like\n     the word \"peepee.\"\n\n                               HECTOR\n                  Peepee?\n     The Girl nods enthusiastically.      The Boy is sniggering.\n\n89   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                            89\n\n     Hector sits at the table with Beatrice and her family.\n     There is an air of awkward silence, although the Boy\n     and Girl look openly at Hector, perhaps assessing him as\n     a future father.\n     The meal has been served in a communal pot. In Beatrice's\n     house there is the luxury of small individual plates.\n     The others wait for Hector to begin, but he indicates\n     to the old Mother to help herself first. She does, and\n     she doesn't stop until her plate is heaped high with\n     food. There is definitely some power play going on in\n     the old woman's mind, although her face is all innocence.\n     Hector submits, taking only a modest portion of food.\n     The old Mother's appetite is prodigious. It is comical\n     to watch her little frame consume so much, quietly\n     and methodically. She is an eating machine.\n     During the meal Beatrice and Hector exchange glances. But\n     this time their talking without words is a serious affair.\n                                HECTOR\n                  Mmmm... good food....\n\n90   EXT.

He turns to look at Beatrice.\n     She stands outside her house for a long time, watching\n     him until he turns onto the main road and OUT OF SIGHT.\n     The pain and the awkwardness in   Beatrice and Hector\n     are specific, but the scene of   parting is timeless.\n     Is this the ten millionth such   parting, or the billionth?\n     It is one of them at any rate,   and a sad one.\n\n\n92   EXT.

Hector\n     sees the boat, dragged out of the water.\n\n     He sits down against the trunk of a large tree.       His              *\n     eyes begin to close.                                                   *\n\n\n93   EXT. RAFT - MORNING                                               93\n     Hector awakes. He looks around him. He is on a huge                    *\n     raft, made of ship's timbers. We have left our previous\n     Hector sitting under his tree 400 years ago. This\n     Hector is awakening into what might be a nightmare.\n     The huge raft is many smaller rafts lashed together.\n     There are over a hundred and fifty people perched on\n     them, lying or squatting in sleep. It is early morning.\n     The sea is calm around them, but the deep ocean swell is\n     still there to remind them of their predicament, menacing,\n     like a controlled anger.\n\n     Hector is fully awake now, sitting against some boxes.\n     He speaks to ANDRE sitting close by.\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            71.\n\n93   CONTINUED:                                                   93\n     Andre is Hector's   slave, still bound to him in service\n     through shipwreck   and disaster. Our Hector is now a\n     master. Andre is    a young Asian. A quiet, capable,\n     intelligent man,   but with that same lost look in his\n     eyes that Hector   had as a slave.

The place stinks enough\n                  as it is...\n\n     There is a flurry of movement amongst the figures, then\n     a splash, then a cry of a Woman. The noise has awakened\n     others. All over the raft figures are coming awake,\n     sitting up, taking in the new day, and the dreadful\n     reality of their situation.\n     Andre speaks to Hector.\n\n                                ANDRE\n                  Do you think I'll still see\n                  Europe?\n                                HECTOR\n                  I think there's more chance of\n                  me eating you, Andre.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             72.\n\n93   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             93\n     The more we see     of the people, their costumes, weapons,\n     mannerisms, the     easier we will place them in their\n     time.

The place is the Indian Ocean.\n\n     Hector turns his eyes to another part of the raft,\n     closer to him. He watches a man and woman. The woman,\n     URSULA, still has her eyes closed, sleeping on a pile of\n     canvas. The man, FRANCISCO, stands beside her holding\n     a cloak over her to protect her from sea spray. His eye\n     catches Hector's, and they hold each other's gaze for a\n     long time. There is antipathy but also pain in their\n     look.                                                              *\n\n     A man, DOM PAULO, moves among the waking wretches.

RAFT - DAY                                               94\n\n     The sun is up, and Dom Paulo was right. The raft is\n     now standing off-shore riding out the heavy ocean surf\n     before finally beaching. The strong are helping to row\n     ashore, under the shouted instructions of the NAVIGATOR.\n     Those too weak to help are huddled beside their posses-\n     sions, hoping to survive this final trial of the sea.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         73.\n\n94   CONTINUED:                                                 94\n     Hector works his oar with the rest. He has time to cast\n     a glance at Ursula and Francisco. Francisco in his\n     manic-heroic way manages to row while at the same time\n     trying to offer a steadying arm to Ursula.\n     If Hector had time or energy to laugh, he would.\n\n     The raft is in the full rage of the surf. The sense\n     behind its loose construction is obvious now. Snake-like\n     it rides the waves, one half up, the other down. The\n     beaching isn't easy. A few people are washed overboard\n     with no way of saving them. Finally the raft makes it\n     through the barrier of the outer surf. They are in a\n     long curving bay. Up from the beach lies an area of             *\n     dunes, and beyond that a thick belt of jungle.\n\n     The raft scrapes onto the sand. Those near the beach\n     scramble ashore, immediately prostrating themselves in\n     prayers of thanks while those at the back jump into\n     the water and clumsily wade the last few feet to safety.\n     Hector's attention is never far from Ursula. She is             *\n     struggling in the water with some of her baggage. A\n     youth, NUNO, goes to help her. Hector overtakes him and\n     nudges him out of the way, offering to take Ursula's load\n     from her shoulders. She refuses his help. Waist-deep in         *\n     water they tussle over her bundle of possessions. Hector        *\n     overpowers her, wrestles her load from her grasp, angrily\n     wades to the shore and dumps it on the sand. In amongst\n     the drama of their situation their little battle of wills\n     seems petty and pathetic, but it reveals much about their\n     past.\n                                                                     *\n     Soon the survivors are dragging their possessions from\n     the raft. They have managed to hoard a surprising amount\n     from their doomed ship. Carpets, chests, chairs, all\n     are dragged ashore.\n\n95   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                            95\n\n     Civilization has taken hold quickly in this little corner\n     of Africa. Dom Paulo, the leader, already has a table\n     and chair set up in the sand, and behind him SAILORS are\n     erectig a tent-like house, made from timbers and rich\n     tapestries and carpets. The others are making their own\n     shelters all along the beach. A regular little community\n     is taking shape, a crazy, rich-textured village decked out\n     in all the colors of the East. The silks and ginghams\n     that were destined for the finest halls in Europe now give\n     shelter to sick slaves, starving sailors, ruined traders\n     and grieving mothers.\n                                               (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           74.        *\n\n95   CONTINUED:                                                  95\n     Some of the survivors have   recovered sufficiently from\n     the trauma of near death to   mark out the boundaries of\n     their new beach homes with   lines of stones. The habits\n     of ownership die hardest of   all.\n     Although Dom Paulo is the man in authority he is also a\n     man in deep shock. Most of what he has earned or\n     plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom\n     of the ocean. Since he is socially superior to anyone\n     else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command.\n     There are probably fifty men among the survivors more\n     suited to lead them to safety.\n     By Dom Paulo's side always is his SON. A quiet boy of\n     about eleven. He is like a little miniature of his\n     father, dressed in the same style of clothes. He is a\n     constant, silent witness to everything that Dom Paulo does,\n     good or bad, wise or foolish. He and his father are a\n     continuing fascination for Hector, and we can enjoy\n     Hector watching the boy watching his father. Some of the\n     absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high-\n     lighted in this way. There can be sadness in it too\n     however, the pain of a son witnessing his father's\n     compromises or failures all too closely, and Dom Paulo's\n     sad awareness of his image slowly tarnishing in his\n     son's eyes.\n     Amidst the construction work, Dom Paulo is talking with\n     some of his OFFICERS.\n                                DOM PAULO\n                  How many made it?\n                                OFFICER\n                  Eighty men.

Any trouble, discharge\n                  three shots.\n\n     The Officer leaves to carry out his orders.

Andre is carrying Hector's possessions, a\n     rolled-up carpet and a bolt of colorful cloth. We feel\n     an echo of the days when Hector was a slave, walking\n     two paces behind with his master's possessions.\n     Hector finds what he is looking for. Francisco is\n     working on a shelter for himself and Ursula, with the\n     help of some slaves.

They see some figures, laden       with\n     supplies, running off into the forest. Others       are\n     following them, discharging MUSKETS, shouting      for the\n     DESERTERS to stop. Hector and Francisco walk       briskly\n     in the direction of the trouble. They see two       of the\n     Deserters being overtaken by their pursuers.

Dom Paulo leads the young boy through an\n      intricate, pretty tune. They sit formally and there is\n      an air of stoicism about them, determined as they are\n      to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of\n      circumstances. But there is also a feeling of madness\n      about it. The madness of a man who has lost a grip of\n      what is going on about him. Down on the beach men are\n      waiting to die in the morning on his orders. The blend\n      of formality and madness make the scene comic.\n\n101   EXT.

It\n      blinds the eyes of those in the little execution party\n      making their way along the beach.\n      The cross-cum-scaffold has been erected some way from the\n      camp. Most people are  attending to their morning\n      chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being\n      carried out along the shore.\n\n      Our view of the hangings will be from the distance of the\n      camp; marionette figures, men dancing on ropes, the form-\n      ality of legal death. The priest and the executioners.\n      It takes a while for the people in the camp to become\n      aware of the other observers up on the dunes. Three\n      figures stand in full view, boldly, silently, watching\n      the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold.\n      The word passes around the camp. Eyes pass between the\n      executions and the tall natives watching.   The first man\n      is already dangling on the rope by the time that Dom Paulo\n      and his officers are discussing the appearance of the\n      natives.\n                               DA CUNHA\n                 Some gunpowder would scatter them,\n                 sir.\n                               DOM PAULO\n                 No, they might want to be\n                 friendly... they'll have food\n                 too... get one of our African\n                 slaves... we must try and talk to\n                 them...

Everyone in the camp watches as he\n      approaches them. There is tension. Will the natives run\n      or fight or talk. They begin to talk. The natives seem\n      most interested in the hangings, and point in that\n      direction, asking questions. The Slave makes an attempt\n      at explaining what is happening, but the natives seem\n      baffled. They start laughing and shaking their heads.\n      By now the second figure is dangling on the rope, the\n      cross making an efficient double-gallows.\n\n\n103   EXT.

BAY - DAY                                                105\n      The tide is sweeping more wreckage into the bay. Barrels\n      and boxes and timber bob in the waves. People make their\n      way to the shoreline to retrieve these new gifts from the\n      sea.                                                                *\n      The whole of the camp is eager and shouting. They bring             *\n      in the boxes and barrels. A whole harmonium is man-\n      handled ashore. Some boys drag it up onto dry sand and\n      start to work its bellows. At first only water spurts\n      from it, but then a watery note or two is emitted. The\n      mood soon becomes festive. Dom Paulo makes his way down             *\n      to the shore to make the celebrations official.                     *\n      By now the first of the newly-arrived crates are being\n      opened. Inside are eggs, many, many large eggs, in\n      crate after crate.\n      An OFFICER brings the first of the eggs to Dom Paulo.\n\n                                 OFFICER\n                   Turtles' eggs, sir...

Some eat them raw. The abundant green fruits\n      make a tolerable side dish. The happy mood of the\n      afternoon has survived into the night. For once there\n      is enough to eat, and the hangings are a thing of the\n      past. Above the ROAR of the constantly rolling SURF\n      the CROAKY sounds of the waterlogged HARMONIUM can be\n      heard.                                                           *\n\n107   INT.

DOM PAULO'S TENT - MORNING                                110\n      Inside his tent Dom Paulo goes to his small mirror. He\n      takes off the heavy silver chain and medallion from\n      around his neck, and a valuable brooch from his coat. He\n      stows them safely in a locked box and replaces it in its\n      hiding place in the sand floor. Then he adorns himself\n      in the cheap rosary and other trashy items. Dom Paulo,               *\n      catching sight of his watching Son in the mirror, holds              *\n      a silencing finger to his mouth.                                     *\n\n111   EXT.

DUNES - MORNING                                         112\n      Hector is enjoying the   freshness of the day. We see              *\n      him climb over a dune   and then as he nears the summit\n      duck and retreat down   the slope again. Cautiously he\n      crawls up the dune and   looks over to the other side.\n\n      He is watching a young Girl and the boy Nuno. They are\n      twelve or thirteen years old. They are coyly in the\n      early stages of making love, the Boy lying close to the\n      Girl, kissing her, beginning to caress her. Their                  *\n      love-making is poised oddly between child's play and               *\n      eroticism. It's their day of discovery and it is like\n      a dream of love.\n      The Boy is just about to   discover some more and is\n      fumbling with the Girl's   clothing, when he looks up and\n      catches sight of Hector.    Hector ducks down but knows he\n      has been seen and decides   to brazen it out. He stands\n      up in full view of them.\n\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Stop that... leave her alone...\n                   get back to the camp... or I'll tell\n                   your mother... how can you play like\n                   this when there are people needing\n                   your help back there...?\n      The Boy is standing now and fixing his clothing. He walks\n      off back to the camp. The Girl remains sitting in the\n      sand, buttoning her dress, too embarrassed even to raise\n      her head to Hector.\n\n      Then Hector is touched by something, perhaps the sad stoop\n      in the Boy's shoulder or the Girl's lowered head. Hector\n      realizes he has broken something precious and in their\n      circumstances infinitely fragile and irretrievable. He\n      feels like an oaf.

Then he sees the procession of the               *\n      Native King and his people, some cattle, and porters\n      carrying baskets.\n      Hector runs off towards the camp.\n\n\n113   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                            113\n      The meeting of the two leaders is weird and wonderful                *\n      to see. The ragged Europeans, already scanning the                   *\n      baskets of the Natives for signs of solid food,\n      somehow still muster an absurd sense of their own                    *\n      importance for the occasion. The Natives, excited and                *\n      curious, trying to contain their exuberance so that they             *\n      don't miss a single detail of this most significant\n      day. Many of the Natives have climbed into the trees,                *\n      either out of timidity or to get a better view                       *\n\n      The trees around the meeting place are dripping with\n      bodies, like human fruit.\n      Hector slips into the crowd as the NATIVE KING is in\n      mid-speech.

He talks to\n      the Officers standing closest to him.\n\n                                 DOM PAULO\n                   Right... you four as well...\n\n      He begins to open up his coat and shirt. The four\n      Officers do the same. The King and a few of his atten-\n      dants take a step or two forward and peer at the exposed\n      white European bellies. They look at one another and\n      mumble solemnly. Then they step back. Dom Paulo and the\n      Officers fix their clothing and re-muster their dignity.\n      The King is enjoying himself.    He speaks again to the\n      Slave, who then translates.\n\n                                 SLAVE\n                   He wants to see you breathe.\n      The King takes a deep breath, then nods to Dom Paulo.\n      Dom Paulo and the Officers do as they are told. The King\n      joins them, and for a few moments there is a kind of\n      communion between them. Then everyone joins in. It is a            *\n      strange, poignant moment, all the Natives and all the\n      Europeans united in the simple act of breathing.\n      Dom Paulo regains his composure.    He speaks to the Slave.\n                                 DOM PAULO\n                   Tell him that we want to trade\n                   with him, to buy food... and we\n                   want him to guide us out of here...\n                   we have a long way to travel... to\n                   where the white men have their\n                   big ships...\n      The Slave speaks to the King. The King listens and talks\n      back for a long time. Then the Slave translates again.\n                                 SLAVE\n                   He has heard of white men very,                       *\n                   very far away... this way...\n                   but you have to cross many rivers...\n                   twenty big rivers...\n\n                                 DOM PAULO\n                   Tell him I want to give him these...\n      Dom Paulo steps forward to the King. An Officer brings             *\n      a wrapped cloth. Dom Paulo opens it, letting the King\n      see the pieces of broken copper inside.\n                                                                         *\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              92.\n\n113   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             113\n      The Officer produces a handful of large nails and\n      gives them directly to the King.

The King refuses to accept the               *\n      rosary. Instead he    is pointing to a couple of chunky\n      and valuable-looking   rings on Dom Paulo's fingers which\n      he has forgotten to   remove.\n                                 SLAVE\n                   He says he could not accept such\n                   a treasured gift, something of\n                   such value to your family...\n                   instead he would be happy to take\n                   one or two of the old rings you have\n                   on your fingers... but please do\n                   not insist that he take your\n                   necklace...\n      It is impossible to know if the King is being naively\n      polite or hugely clever. Dom Paulo's Officers enjoy a\n      muted titter as he peels off his precious rings and\n      gives them to the King, replacing the worthless baubles\n      around his own neck. The King begins talking again.\n      The Slave translates.\n\n                                 SLAVE\n                   He will give you guides to help                        *\n                   you across the first of the big\n                   rivers... it is ten days from\n                   here...\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              93.\n\n113   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             113\n                                 DOM PAULO\n                   Thank you, thank you...\n\n      The Slave continues.\n                                 SLAVE\n                   ... and he asks you to be ready\n                   to leave the beach in two days\n                   time... he cannot permit you to\n                   stay longer...\n\n      Dom Paulo looks shocked.\n                                 SLAVE\n                   Because with the new moon the\n                   turtles will arrive and lay\n                   their eggs... you may frighten\n                   them... you must be gone...\n      The mention of turtles' eggs almost turns the stomachs\n      of most of the survivors, even the fit ones.\n      The King and his followers walk back into the forest.               *\n      Soon the survivors are alone again, with the lost-\n      looking cow the Natives have left. A doomed cow if\n      ever there was.\n\n\n114   EXT.

Small groups\n      of people sit around it, gnawing on the roasted flesh.\n      The image is once again timeless, the elements of it\n      simple; man, fire, flesh, food.\n      One cow doesn't go far between a hundred starving people.\n      Some are still on their feet by the large fire. Now and\n      then a hand will dart out over the flames to snatch a\n      bone hanging loose or a tasty-looking piece of gristle.\n      They are the survivors of the pack, if any will be.\n\n      Hector is, of course, among them. He    risks the searing\n      heat to pull at a couple of blackened   bones. He sees\n      Nuno, the boy he chased away from the   Girl earlier in\n      the day. Nuno is sitting by himself,    staring vacantly\n      at the fire, licking his fingers.\n      Hector sits down in the sand beside him.

JUNGLE PATH - DAY                                        123\n      The trek from the beach to the village has started. A\n      long line of people, including some local natives, carry\n      the sick in crudely-made litters. Even this short trip\n      is hard.  Somewhere in the line six sailors manhandle the\n      harmonium up the jungle path.\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             102.\n\n123   CONTINUED:                                                    123\n      Just behind   them Hector is helping Nuno to carry his\n      Mother in a   litter. It is like a civilization on the\n      move. In a    day or two the wind and the sea will have\n      rubbed out   all evidence of their stay, and the bay will\n      welcome its   regular tenants, the turtles.\n\n\n124   EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE - DAY                                   124\n      There is a sense of bustle in the native village as the\n      European sick are settled into their huts and the others\n      prepare to depart. Emotional farewells take place in                *\n      dark corners of the small huts. A group of unmoved\n      sailors are playing cards in the dirt.                              *\n\n      In amongst the bustle Hector is looking for Francisco.\n      He finds him taking some of his possessions into a hut.             *\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Francisco...

Hector waits outside,\n      watching the small human dramas all around him. Soon\n      Francisco emerges from the hut.\n\n                                   FRANCISCO\n                   In you go.\n      Hector goes into the hut, stooping low at the small\n      entrance.\n\n\n125   INT.

Hector is shaken\n      by the sight of her, ashen and fevered, but tries not to\n      show it.

CAMP - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                        131\n\n      Hector is lying awake, watching Bobby's sleeping form on\n      the ground at the other side of the dying fire. Behind\n      Bobby is a wolf, sniffing and edging his way closer to\n      them. Hector isn't anxious. He knows the wolf will soon\n      become aware of them and move off. He is worried about\n      something else. From under the pack that makes his\n      pillow he pulls a piece of broken arrow, a shaft and some\n      feathers, the other end of Bobby's find. He looks at it,\n      then looks back to Bobby and the wolf.\n\n                                                            109.\n\n132   EXT.

They compare readings. There is a\n      difference of some four or five minutes in the time.\n\n                              BOBBY\n                It's getting worse... you're\n                nearly five minutes fast now...\n                              HECTOR\n                I'm not fast... you're slowing\n                down.\n      They obviously have this tiff every morning.\n                              HECTOR\n                What's the point of having two\n                chronometers when you don't take\n                the average?\n                              BOBBY\n                Exactly... you should throw yours\n                away.\n                              HECTOR\n                You're unscientific, Bobby... at\n                heart...\n      Hector writes in the book.

Hector far\n      ahead turns around, taken by surprise. Bobby has\n      frightened himself too. He eyes the forest all around\n      as the echo of his voice fades. Chastened, he begins\n      to sing again, quietly this time, under his breath.\n                                 BOBBY\n                   There's not a bonny bird that sings\n                   But minds me o' my Jean...\n\n134   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                        134\n\n      Hector and Bobby have stopped at a point of bare rock\n      looking out across the broad valley.\n      They are building a pile of stones, a cairn. They work\n      quietly, methodically. The only sounds are of their\n      breathing and the CLICK-CLACK of the stones. We feel the\n      echoes of our many previous Hectors and their piles of\n      stones, built for this or that purpose. Our doomed\n      surveyors are acting out the same ritual, this time in\n      the name of science.\n      They finish the cairn and erect their heavy tripod over\n      it, and dangle a plumb line from the tripod. Bobby\n      scratches the center point on the top stone of the cairn.\n      They are establishing a survey point. They talk as they\n      work.\n\n      When they anchor their   tripod, the cold hard sound of\n      their CHISELS STRIKING   ROCK ECHOES all through the forest.\n      It unnerves them. They    stop hammering and listen to the\n      ECHO BOUNCING down the   valley.\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Sure this is a good idea.\n\n                                 BOBBY\n                   Let's get out of here.\n\n      They hastily dismantle the equipment and load up the\n      horse, in an atmosphere of controlled panic.\n\n135   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          135\n\n      They are travelling together now, on either side of the\n      horse's nose, finding comfort in the closeness of each\n      other. They stop for Bobby to consult his compass.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                111.         *\n\n135   CONTINUED:                                                       135\n      He indicates a slight change of direction, and they move\n      off again. Still they don't talk. We can feel their\n      anxiety breeding in the silence. Why don't they talk?\n      They proceed in this weighty silence, but even the CRIES\n      of the BIRDS now seem to mock them.\n\n      The route takes them downhill. The slopes are more dense\n      with undergrowth now and the going isn't so easy. Some-\n      times they are reduced to an undignified scramble, hanging\n      onto the bulk of the horse between them. They no longer\n      look much like conquerors of the wilderness.\n\n136   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                            136\n\n      They are on the valley floor now. The trees are more\n      openly spaced and the grass is richer. They are moving\n      quickly but they have a hard time keeping the horse on\n      the trot. It hasn't seen grass this good in weeks.\n\n137   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                            137\n\n      They are moving more slowly, the ground is rockier and\n      the trees are thickening. They take the easy way up the\n      hillside, a natural path made by deer or bear.\n      It is difficult to know who is more shaken by their\n      encounter, the Indian or Hector and Bobby.\n      The INDIAN is sitting behind a tree as they pass, dozing\n      or deep in reverie. They almost pass without noticing\n      him, but Hector gives a turn of his head and there is the\n      Indian four feet from him. At the same instant the Indian\n      comes to his senses and sits bolt upright. The encounter\n      is high comedy but full of terror for all of them.\n\n      The Indian stands up.       Hector absurdly greets him.\n                                   HECTOR\n                   Hi!   Hello!\n      The Indian backs off from them, holding his hands up and\n      smiling crazily, as if to say, \"Don't mind me, boys, I'm\n      just leaving...\" Hector and Bobby are equally silly in\n      their response.\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Hey, come back... we're just\n                   moving through... don't\n                   apologize... we all got a fright...\n                   goodbye...\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                112.         *\n\n137   CONTINUED:                                                       137\n      The Indian is in full retreat now, waving his hands about\n      apologetically, but making good distance from them.\n      Suddenly, he is gone. It has happened so quickly that\n      Hector and Bobby scarcely believe it has happened. Then\n      they realize that in their fright they have let go of the\n      horse. It has headed back down to the tastier pastures\n      in the valley. They see it disappearing into the trees\n      below them.\n                                 BOBBY\n                   That was stupid...\n\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Did you see him?\n\n                                 BOBBY\n                   Sure I saw him.\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Was he a Delaware?\n                                 BOBBY\n                   How the fuck should I know?

That is when he\n      sees the first of the figures, just the ghost of a shadow\n      moving from tree to rock. His eyes flick across the\n      forest behind them. He sees another figure caught in\n      the act of seeking cover, looking absurdly embarrassed\n      for the fleeting moment that we see it. Then Bobby\n      sees another. Are they teasing them?

There are no               *\n      whoops or shouts. They follow Hector and Bobby into the\n      trees, spreading out on either side, shaping the human\n      net that will soon engulf them.\n      It is a menacing spectacle. Death is near.

Lying on the floor below,\n      surrounded by rubble, and being attended by the\n      paramedics, is an old lady, MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS.

CAR - DAY                                         153\n      A trip from Queens to New Jersey at five o'clock on\n      a Friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence\n      whatever you do with it, and that's fine.\n      Hector's trip to his children has more meaning for us\n      than a simple journey from A to B. We will be aware of\n      our other Hectors, and the journeys home that they did\n      or didn't manage to make. This car trip will pull the\n      threads together.\n      And after so many images of the natural world, a world\n      little altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in\n      all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen-\n      sion. If there is a breathtaking moment in this film,\n      when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit,\n      then it will be somewhere around here that it happens.\n      Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching\n      for his family. If the traffic allows, tonight in New\n      Jersey Hector will complete his journey.\n      We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the\n      avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONE\n      RINGS ONCE.\n\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Hello...

If the last crosslight holds\n      on green then he might even make it on time.\n      Hector stops the car outside Janet's house and lets out\n      a sigh of relief.\n\n154   EXT.

GAS STATION - NIGHT                                   157\n\n      Hector is filling up the car in a gas station close to\n      the Safeway. An attractive woman is filling her car in\n      the next line. Her eyes and Hector's meet. For some\n      reason they exchange the smallest smile. For a few\n      brief moments they are talking without words as their\n      tanks fill. The ten billionth romance in the history of\n      the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the\n      twinkling of an eye. By the time their credit cards are\n      back in their pockets their love is a memory. From the\n      back of the car the kids have watched it all.\n      Betsy gives Hector a withering look of disapproval as he\n      climbs back into the car.\n\n\n158   INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                      158\n      Back on the road, it is later. The kids have fallen\n      asleep. Hector relaxes. He watches them in their sleep,\n      searching for some traces of the little children that\n      have haunted his thoughts for so many years, the tots\n      he abandoned.\n\n159   EXT. HOLIDAY HOUSE - NIGHT                                 159\n\n      The car pulls up at the holiday house. Hector gets out.\n      It is dark, but we can hear the sound of the SEA and\n      there is sand underfoot. Hector walks to the house and\n      unlocks the door. He puts on a couple of exterior lights.\n      He carries Thomas, still sleeping, from the car and into\n      the house. Betsy follows him, still half-asleep, groaning\n      fussily. She talks through her yawns.\n                                 BETSY\n                   Are you going to bring the flowers\n                   in?\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Don't mention the flowers.\n\n                                                            140.       *\n\n160   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         160\n      Later, Hector can't sleep. It has been too eventful a\n      day. He sits bleary-eyed watching a late-night TV SHOW.\n      A man sits cross-legged on a studio floor and is talking\n      to a phone-in viewer. The TV man has five small stones\n      which he regularly scatters on the floor.\n\n                              TV MAN (V.O.)\n                This is good, Tony, the stones\n                are talking to me already... now\n                here's something... travel...\n                movement...

These\n                stones are really talking here...\n                what are you planning for yourself\n                in California?\n                              TONY (V.O.)\n                I'm hoping for an acting career,\n                Mel...\n                              TV MAN (V.O.)\n                Tony, these stones really like\n                what you're planning... there is\n                no doubt in my mind about that...\n                now listen... you have to be\n                specific... these stones really\n                want to tell you something, be it\n                love, money or the purpose of your\n                life... but I want a specific\n                question from you... think about\n                it... what do you want to know...\n                love... or your income level next\n                year? Be as specific as you\n                can, Tony...\n\n      Perhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier\n      Hectors, but our modern one is simply restless. He\n      stands up and leaves the room.\n\n\n161   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         161\n      Next door, he watches the kids sleeping in their little\n      holiday beds. Hector watches them. We've seen our\n      Hectors do this before, and we feel the echo. But as\n      he turns to leave the room Hector gets a fright.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               141.         *\n\n161   CONTINUED:                                                      161\n      Betsy starts talking loudly. At first Hector thinks she\n      is awake, giving him into trouble, but she is fast asleep.\n\n                                 BETSY\n                   Get me the books... all the books...\n                   all of the books... no, no, no...\n                   not the pancakes... not the\n                   pancakes... no...\n      She changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a\n      tearful, crumpled little girl. She sobs pitifully.\n\n                                 BETSY\n                   ... not the pancakes...\n\n      Hector is a confusion of feelings: frightened,\n      fascinated, impotent. How can he help her? How could he\n      possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes, what comfort\n      could he offer his stranger daughter if he did? It is\n      a spooky, mystical moment for Hector, more mystical than\n      the mumbo-jumbo still issuing from the TV next door.\n                                 TV WOMAN (V.O.)\n                   ... find your true cosmic partner\n                   first time around... every weekday\n                   morning at three here on the Psychic\n                   Network...

Just as he is closing the door he gets\n      another surprise, this time from the sleeping Thomas.\n                                 THOMAS\n                   ... don't let the oil run out...\n                   yes you did... watch the oil...\n                   why... why?\n      Hector closes the bedroom door.     He is one spooked, moved\n      human being.\n\n162   INT.

Betsy\n      moves off briskly along the beach. Hector trails\n      after her, hooked.\n\n\n169   EXT.

They are watching Hector who\n      is collecting a pile of large stones on the beach.\n      Another Hector and another pile of stones. This one\n      is making a fire for the barbecue.

BEACH - DAY                                              170\n\n      Hector turns from his work. Out at sea the kids look\n      small and vulnerable. Hector is more anxious than he\n      should be, out of practice at fatherhood. He calls to\n      them.\n\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Come on in, kids... that boat\n                   doesn't look too safe...\n      They call back to him.\n                                 BETSY\n                   We're fine!\n      Hector tries to relax, but he doesn't have the\n      confidence yet, or something. He is edgy.\n\n                                 HECTOR\n                   I've just found you... I don't\n                   want to lose you. What would I\n                   tell your mother... come on in...\n\n      He walks down to the water. The kids reluctantly pull\n      on the oars and bring the little boat in. A few feet\n      from the beach they hit some sand. The boat sticks.\n      Hector wades out in his shoes so far. Then he calls\n      to Thomas.\n                                 HECTOR\n                   Throw me the rope, Thomas, I'll\n                   pull you in.\n      Thomas throws the mooring rope to Hector. It isn't\n      attached to the boat. Hector ends up with all of the\n      rope in his hands. He stands there, and they all laugh.\n                                 HECTOR\n                   This is one useless piece of\n                   rope, Thomas...\n\n      Just for a moment we have the image of our     Hector\n      standing on the shoreline with a length of     rope. An\n      image with an echo from six thousand years     ago. But\n      this time Hector is laughing, and his kids     are safe.\n\n                                                            155.         *\n\n171   EXT. BEACH - SUNSET                                          171\n      At the very moment of sunset Betsy is trying to capture\n      it in a watercolor sketch. She has set up an easel on\n      the beach. It's like action painting. She works\n      frantically on the picture, racing the sun as it dips\n      into the ocean. Tough little Betsy can even lose\n      patience with the sun.\n\n                              BETSY\n                Why does it always go so fast...?\n      Thomas is laughing at her. He has seen    her attempt this\n      before. Hector has other concerns. He     is trying to\n      light his barbecue. Match after match    disappears into\n      his elaborate stone structure, only to   fizzle out.\n\n      The sun finally vanishes, and Betsy goes limp at her\n      easel. The sun has won the race again. She and Thomas\n      watch Hector trying to light the fire. After a while\n      he is conscious of their amused attention on him, then\n      he becomes a little self-conscious.\n                              HECTOR\n                I used to know how to do this...\n\n      They laugh a little.\n                              HECTOR\n                I did... I used to be really\n                good at this...\n      He wafts and blows ineffectually at a flicker of flame.\n      There's not much of the caveman about him now.\n\n\n172   EXT.

He is in a splendid frame of mind.\n                              HECTOR\n                Ah... smell it... the smell of\n                civilization... scorched meat...\n      Hector serves the chicken onto their plates. He sits\n      down beside them with his steak, and a glass of wine.\n      He watches Thomas attack his chicken, and smiles.\n\n                              HECTOR\n                I'd forgotten that... how you\n                eat... dedicated... like it's\n                your religion!\n\n                              THOMAS\n                Things I like.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               156.\n\n172   CONTINUED:                                                      172\n                                 HECTOR\n                   You used to hum to yourself too,\n                   when you ate... like everything\n                   was fine with the world.\n      Thomas tries it out, eating and humming.
