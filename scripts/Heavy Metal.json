Ahead\nof us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering\nalong a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a\nthin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI.\n\nThe truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle\nof the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar\ndevices on the roof that rotate constantly.\n\nAUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out\ntwo large metal boxes.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE ATTIC WINDOW</u>\n</b>\nThe curtains part ever so slightly, and a pair of eyes peer\ndown.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT BACK TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE VAN</u>\n</b>\nAUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal\nboxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>INSIDE THE HOUSE</u>\n</b>\nAUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of\nthe exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic\ncontraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all\nover the floor.\n\nPutting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and\ntakes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic\nreceptacles mounted in the sides.\n\nHe places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption,\nclamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles.\nThen he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball.\nUsing a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball\nout, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine,\nin the back.\n\nAs soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The\nglass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green\nplanet in space appears inside it.\n\n\n<b>                      AUSTIN\n</b>                    (looking at the holograph)\n\n                 Hmmmm ....\n\n\nHe takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an\nadjustment underneath the machine.  Suddenly a wire comes\nloose from the sphere and begins to spark.\n\n\n<b>                      AUSTIN\n</b>                    (seeing sparks)\n\n                 Uh - oh ....\n\n\nAs the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen, the\ngreen planet begins to silently shake.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>SPACE</u>\n</b>\nWith an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips\nout of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving\nthousands of glowing particles in its wake.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT BACK TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>AUSTIN</u>\n</b>\nNot noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly\nrepairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other\nadjustments.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>A FOREST</u>\n</b>\nFrom the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead,\ndropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond\na far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid\ncrashes in the distance.\n\nThe camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful\ngirl approaches, picking mushrooms.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>A GREEN BALL NEAR HER FEET</u>\n</b>\nAn ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing\nball, and is drawn to it.  Picking the sphere up, she looks\nat it.  Something inside her warns her of its danger, but,\nunable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.\n\n\n<b>                                             DISSOLVE TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE GATES OF KRAAN</u>\n</b>\nNight falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful\ngirl passes through the glass gates and heads home.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE GIRL'S BEDROOM</u>\n</b>\nThe girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to\nher basket in the corner.  Through its side, the green ball\nbegins to glow brightly.\n\nGetting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of\nthe ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green\nball behind it.\n\nThe ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to\nsurround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans\nup the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond\nthe city gates, rising higher and higher.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE OUTLANDS</u>\n</b>\nFlying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera\nheads further and further out into the less civilized sectors,\nwhere the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of\na past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.\n\nThe camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant\nmountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high\nabove the foothills, we begin to come down.\n\nIn the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are\nmoving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in\nthe mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE LINE OF BARBARIANS</u>\n</b>\nAt the front of the line, the largest barbarian - obviously\ntheir leader - stops and points.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE MOUNTAINS</u>\n</b>\nA strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains\ntoward the barbarians.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE LINE OF BARBARIANS</u>\n</b>\nThe barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps\non going.  One by one, their eyes turn green and they start to\nchange, becoming hairier, uglier, and stronger.\n\nAs their transformations are complete, the barbarians gather\nbehind their leader into an ever-growing mob of murderous\nlooking sub-humans.\n\n\n<b>                                             DISSOLVE TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE GATES OF KRAAN</u>\n</b>\nA frightened Kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through\nthe beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound\nof ten thousand approaching footsteps.\n\nThe camera pans to a hillside overlooking Kraan.  In the glow\nof sunset, the outline of the BARBARIAN LEADER, riding a black\nwar-horse, appears at the hillside and stops.  Then with a\nthundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians\ncomes into view behind him, filling the horizon.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE BARBARIAN LEADER</u>\n</b>\nHe is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild-\neyed, he screams to signal the attack.  The bloodthirsty horde\ncharges down the hill behind him.\n\nThe camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the\ngates of the city, destroying everything in their path.  Smoke\nand flames are everywhere.  Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians\nrun from the onslaught.\n\nAs we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN\nLEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting\na command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive\ndoomed building in the middle of the city.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS</u>\n</b>\nAt the far end of this huge glass hall, the Kraanian Council\nsits around a marble table.  From outside, we hear the battle\nraging.\n\nPulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the Council\nmembers.\n\n\n<b>                      COUNCILMAN #3\n</b>\n                 They're killing everyone.

Looking at the parchment thrown before\nhim, the ancient, withered ELDER rises to his feet.\n\n\n<b>                      ELDER\n</b>\n                 We are not a race of warriors.\n                 We are statesmen, and scientists.\n                 From our very beginning it was ordained\n                 that the warrior-race of Taarak the\n                 Defender would aid us in times of need.\n                 This was the <u>Pact</u>!\n\n\n<b>                      COUNCILMAN #1\n</b>\n                 Taarak the Defender?

A boy appears at\nthe doorway.\n\n\n<b>                      BOY\n</b>\n                 Elder!  They are at the walls!\n\n\n<b>                      COUNCILMAN #3\n</b>\n                 Well who is this last Defender?\n                 How can he be summoned?\n\n\n<b>                      ELDER\n</b>\n                 It is Taarna, of the blood of\n                 Taarak the Defender - the last of\n                 the race.  And must be summoned as\n                 my forefathers summoned Taarak\n                 himself - from <u>within</u>!\n\n\n<b>                      COUNCILMAN #2\n</b>\n                 But will this Defender answer?\n\n\n<b>                      ELDER\n</b>\n                 A Taarakian has no choice.  They\n                 <u>must</u> answer.  It is in their blood.\n\n\nThe clattering of armour becomes audible.\n\n\n<b>                      BOY\n</b>\n                 They are in the halls!  They are coming!!\n\n\n<b>                      ELDER\n</b>                    (calmly to the boy)\n\n                 Bar the door.\n                 (to the Councilmen)\n                 We will summon the\n                 Defender together.\n\n\nThe Councilmen nod.\n\n\n<b>                      ELDER\n</b>                    (shutting eyes)\n\n                 Taarna ... Taarna ...\n\n\nAs the Councilmen take up the chant;\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE DOOR</u>\n</b>\nAs the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him\naside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is\nthe BARBARIAN LEADER.\n\nWith a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow\nand fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed\ntroops rush in around him.\n\nThe chanting continues as we;\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE OUTLANDS</u>\n</b>\nWe look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only\ndecaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure\nbreaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's\ndistant chanting fades out, all is quiet.\n\nSuddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings\nand a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE\nDEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of\na giant crimson bird.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>TAARNA'S FACE</u>\n</b>\nShe is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing\nbehind her in the wind.\n\nBelow her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror,\nchased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.\n\nSpurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly\nbeast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into\nthe air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged\nrock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.\n\nFlying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As\nshe approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion\non a chain around his neck.\n\n\n<b>                      HUMANOID\n</b>\n                 I owe you my life.  Let me\n                 repay you ...\n\n\nHe takes off his medallion and places it around her neck.\nSuddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her\ntowards him.  His eyes change to a bright green as he forces\nher to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes.  As he\nmolests her, TAARNA is distracted.  She hears something - voices\ninside her, chanting her name.\n\nQuickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she\npowerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's\nears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him\nabove her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground.\n\nStill hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out\na second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then\nlifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock,\nnext to the growling creature.\n\nAs TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian\nhungrily.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>AUSTIN GRIMALDI</u>\n</b>\nHe is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine.\nAs the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching\ndeep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange\ndiode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection\nbreaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the\nmachine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows\nthicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.\n\n\n<b>                      AUSTIN\n</b>\n                 Dammit!\n\n\nAUSTIN pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair\nof needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part.\n\nThe camera follows AUSTIN'S arm into the chassis, where smoke\nsurrounds it and clouds over everything.  The buzzing sound\ngrows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing\nengines.  Slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice\ncrackling over a radiophone.\n\n\n<b>                      BOMBARDIER\n</b><b>                    (V.O.)\n</b>\n                 Where the hell are we?\n\n\nSuddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of B-17 bombers\ncome tearing out into the moonlit night.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE GROUND BELOW</u>\n</b>\nThe sound of jungle night creatures fills the air.  We see\npalm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky.  The\nscene is almost serene.  The camera pans and suddenly the\nnose of a large parked bomber fills the screen, and as the\ncamera continues panning, we pass a large red rising sun on\nthe bomber's fuselage.  The pan stops at the tail of the\naircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard.\n\nThere is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the\nair.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of\nsound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence\n... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters\nthe silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.\n\nInstantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet.\nSilhouetted figures rush by.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>A GUN EMPLACEMENT</u>\n</b>\nJapanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti-aircraft gun\nskyward.  We begin to hear the sound of approaching engines.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>CLOSEUP OF A SHELL</u>\n</b>\nIt is thrust into a breech.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE B-17 FORMATION</u>\n</b>\nAs the bombers press on, the camera moves in to the lead\naircraft.

The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming\nfrom what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly\nto a green ball stuck in engine No. 3.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE PILOT</u>\n</b>\nHe has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks\naround incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable\ngraveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old\nwrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal\ncorpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans\nto the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed\nElectra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted\non its side are two names; \"Amelia Earhart\" and \"Fred Noonan\".\n\nThe camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic\njunk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of\na pile of scrap.\n\nTilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan\nmetal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The\nmetal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to\nlift it up.\n\nWWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally\ncoming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls\nback to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI,\nwho carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his\nneedlenose pliers.\n\n\n<b>                      AUSTIN\n</b>\n                 Got it.\n\n\nSatisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine,\nhe begins to re-solder it in place.  Behind him, a LITTLE\nGIRL with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him.\n\n\n<b>                      LITTLE GIRL\n</b>\n                 It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?\n\n\n<b>                      AUSTIN\n</b>                    (concentrating)\n\n                 Yes dear.

Once again the glass sphere sparkles\nand the holographic screen lights up.  AUSTIN uses a tool to\nfine-tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize;\nthe glass gates of Kraan.\n\nAs the image becomes clearer, the camera pulls closer and closer\nto the holograph screen.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE GATES OF KRAAN</u>\n</b>\nThe Council's voices still ringing in her head, TAARNA flies\nin over the demolished gates.  Below her, the once-beautiful\ncity lies in ruins.\n\nGliding overtop the deserted streets, she sees a column of\nsmoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the\ntown's center.  As she watches the smoke rise, she pulls hard\non the reins, and heads her bird up.\n\nThe camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome\ndown to the Council Chambers below.\n\nCorpses of the Councilmen are strewn everywhere.  In the\ncenter of the room, a large pile of ancient books and\nmanuscripts lie smouldering.  Reaching the floor, TAARNA\ndismounts and starts to look around.  At the head of\nthe marble table sits the ELDER - dead.  In front of him,\na roll of parchment lies on the table.  TAARNA opens it.\n\nCarefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains,\ntheir tops glowing green.\n\nTAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.  Then she notices\nthat the ELDER is clutching something in his hand.  Prying\nhis stiff fingers apart, she finds a blood-stained medallion\njust like the one her attacker wore on his chain.\n\nLooking at the dead ELDER, TAARNA grips the medallion tightly\nin her hand.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL BUILDING</u>\n</b>\nTAARNA flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys\nthe city below.  All is quiet and dark, except for a green glow\ncoming from a second-floor window.  Curious, she flies over,\npulls up beside the window, and climbs in.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>GIRL'S BEDROOM</u>\n</b>\nEntering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed.\nThe basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From\nwithin the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.\n\nTAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow\ncoming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon,\nsword drawn.\n\nSuddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and\nshoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the\nball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously\nugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through\nsnake-like fangs.\n\n\n<b>                      WITCH\n</b>\n                 Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec!\n                 Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon\n                 it with fear.  For in its glow lies\n                 the end of heaven - the beginning of\n                 hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel <u>death</u>\n                 in your hands.  For death is upon\n                 you.

The ball sails\npast her, out the window.  Then TAARNA, sword raised, leaps\nat the WITCH, slicing through her in rapid strokes.\n\nThe WITCH cackles and crumbles into dust, but her green eyes\nstay suspended in the air, and her cackle echoes through\nthe room.\n\nTAARNA backs away, climbing out the window, onto her bird.  As\nshe flies off, she sees the WITCH'S green ball high above her,\nrising into the clouds and disappearing.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>SPACE</u>\n</b>\nThe WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears\nin the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting\ncloser we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no\ndeterminable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green\nmeteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.\n\nThe rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the\nhatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of\nan automobile suspended in the open hatch.\n\nHydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from\nthe belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now\nthat the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.\n\nWith a \"thunk\", the metal arms release the car, and\nas the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its\nfree-fall to Earth.\n\nAs the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays\nwith the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one\nway, then the other.\n\nOnce his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car\nradio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles\non one.\n\nWith the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to\nEarth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the\natmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts\nburning up.\n\nAs he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his\napproach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking\nCorvette bounces violently, every part straining at the\nrepeated impact.\n\nThe driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into\nhigh gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt\nto translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then\nhe pops his drag chute to help slow down.\n\nTThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the\nchute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>EXT.

Fluttering down\naround it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the\nburnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his\nclothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the\ndistance.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>TAARNA</u>\n</b>\nShe swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and\ncables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station.\nThen she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting\nfloor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into\nthe rock.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>INSIDE TAARNA'S HIDEAWAY</u>\n</b>\nLanding her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble, TAARNA\ndismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool.  Here she disrobes,\nand picking up a small gold pitcher, she pours an ancient oil\nover herself.  It shines and sparkles as it touches her skin.\nThen she steps into the water, where her body seems to sparkle\neven brighter.\n\nFinishing her sacred bath, she steps out and walks to a stone\nwall.  When she touches it, a rock panel slides away to reveal\na gold chest.  TAARNA opens it.\n\nInside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments,\nso bright that TAARNA must shield her eyes for a moment.  Then,\nas she looks down at the armour, the voice of TAARAK THE\nDEFENDER comes into her head.\n\n\n<b>                      TAARAK\n</b><b>                    (V.O.)\n</b>\n                 To <u>defend</u> - this is the Pact.\n                 but when life loses its value,\n                 and it taken for nought, then\n                 the Pact is ... to <u>avenge</u>!!\n\n\nThrough a series of dissolves we see TAARNA'S hands sensuously\nfitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body.  Finally\nwe pull back to see her fully.\n\nStanding before us, glistening in the torch-light, she looks\nmagnificent.  Reaching once more into the chest, TAARNA pulls\nout a golden sword.  As she holds it, it seems to vibrate,\nalmost buzzing in her hands.  Suddenly she swings it, slicing\ncleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall.  As\nthe burning torch falls to the ground, TAARNA leaves.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE SKY</u>\n</b>\nFrom over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour\ngleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she\nsees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers.\nDrunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run\naround loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.\n\nLooking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures\ntied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the\ncreature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the\nleather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the\nElder's fingers.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>INSIDE THE BARROOM</u>\n</b>\nBarbarian honky-tonk music fills the crowded room, as\nvarious barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the\nbar-girls who are dressed in cheap, flashy metal outfits.\n\nThree of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and\nrowdy as they push a non-barbarian down, dump a drink on his\nhead, laugh and kick him.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>THE BARROOM DOOR</u>\n</b>\nTAARNA walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass\ndoors, past the three soldiers kicking their victim.

The soldiers are gone.  As\nwe watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid\nages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves\nand shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in\nthe ground.\n\nA prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern.\nFascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a\nTyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him.\n\nTime advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and\na Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the\nfire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals,\nwhen one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing\nball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes.\nOut of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen.\n\nTime accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple,\nplacing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the\nRomans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes.\nAs the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched\nRomans, covering them and the green ball in rubble.\n\nOver the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and\nclay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval\nvillage.\n\nA Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with\nhis stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village.\nSatisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself\na drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner.\nThe axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking\nthe stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well.\n\nTime advances once more as the Medieval village grows and\ntransforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and\nthe stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas-\nlit village green.\n\nA fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and\ncircles the green.\n\nMoving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive-\nlooking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This\nis intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the\nwoman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and\nleaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo\nand leans provocatively up against the well.\n\nThe gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman\nand propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We\npan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall.\nSuddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's\nbody falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket,\nwhere the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands.\n\nAs time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles\naway, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row-\nhousing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes\ndirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning\nsky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim\ncoal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on\ntheir way to work.\n\nThe camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears.\nPanning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard\nringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner\nand into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings\nthe bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and\nload them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now\nfull of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become\ndeserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the\nweight.\n\nA support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse.\nFalling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the\nglowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered\nover by rubble.\n\nThe rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape\ngrows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything.\nAs the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but\ndesert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>PEOPLE</u>\n</b>\nThe people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying\nfuturistic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by\na goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As\nhe walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot\non the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser-\nshovels.\n\nOne of the workers finds something.\n\n\n<b>                      WORKER\n</b>\n                 Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!\n\n\nThe archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread-\ndriven shovel-sifter up to the spot.  The shovel-sifter digs\nin and pulls up a large chunk of desert.  When the sand has\nsifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip.\nIt is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman\nplucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth.\n\nAs the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly.\nThe foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands,\nthen he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's\nentire body glows green, and crumbles into dust.\n\nThe archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the\nglowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.\n\n\n<b>                                             DISSOLVE TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>NEW YORK - AERIAL SHOT - DAY</u>\n</b>\nThe camera comes down from high above the city.  The general\nshape and outline of New York looks familiar, but as we get\ncloser we sense that something is different.  Fires are\nburning in various locations below us, and intermittent\ngunshots become audible as the narration begins.\n\n\n<b>                      HARRY\n</b><b>                    (V.O.)\n</b>\n                 Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre\n                 of the world.\n\n\nMoving down through the skyscrapers, the city gets dirtier and\nslummier.  We pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline.\nBelow us, scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro-ball\nin the garbage-filled street.\n\n\n<b>                      HARRY\n</b><b>                    (V.O.)\n</b>\n                 ... and now they're talking about\n                 letting in low-lifes from other planets,\n                 too.\n\n\nUnder the narration, the camera turns a corner and zooms down\nthrough the roof of a parked taxicab.  It stops full frame on\nthe newspaper held in the cabdriver's hands.  A slow pan across\nthe front page reveals that the paper is the New York Times,\nJuly 6, 2031\n\nOne headline reads: \"400,000 Traffic Deaths Over Holiday Weekend\".\nAnother reads: \"Venus Declared 73rd State\".\nThe camera stops on a headline reading: \"Professor Discovers\nAncient Relic --- to be shown in N.Y. Museum\".\n\nThere is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and\nhis beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case\ncontaining the Loc-Nar.\n\nA knocking is heard on the cab's window, and the driver throws\ndown the newspaper.\n\n\n<b>                      YOUNG MAN\n</b>                    (from outside)\n\n                 You free?\n\n\n<b>                      HARRY\n</b>\n                 Yeah.  Get in.\n<b>                 (V.O.)\n</b>                 My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive\n                 a cab.\n\nHe flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>OUTSIDE CAB</u>\n</b>\nThe young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door.\nHarry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The\nvehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic\nchrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers.\n\n\n<b>                                             CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>INSIDE CAB</u>\n</b>\nHarry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from\nhis passenger.\n\n\n<b>                      HARRY\n</b>\n                 Where to, pal?\n\n\n<b>                      YOUNG MAN\n</b>\n                 The U.N. Building.\n\n\n<b>                      HARRY\n</b>\n                 The U.N. Building.  What a joke.\n                 Used to be a nice place until they\n                 turned it into low rent housing.\n                 Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live\n                 there if you paid me.\n\n\nHe switches on the car radio.  The music plays as Harry's\ncab passes various time-altered New York landmarks; a graffiti\n-covered Empire State Building - windows all boarded up, a\ndecrepit Lincoln Centre, the marquis reading \"Continuous Live\nSex Show, Also Inter-Planetary Mud-Wrestling\", new ultra-tech\nbuildings crammed between half-destroyed Wall Street office\nbuildings, garbage everywhere.\n\nInside the cab, the YOUNG MAN pulls a gun out of his jacket,\nsticks his arm through the opening in the plexi-glass shield,\nand holds the gun to Harry's head.\n\n\n<b>                      YOUNG MAN\n</b>\n                 Okay sucker, hand over your cash,\n                 now!\n\n\n<b>                      HARRY\n</b><b>                    (V.O.)\n</b>\n                 This city is really going to the\n                 dogs.\n\n\nHarry's foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch.\nA buzzing is heard, and the young man's body suddenly\ndematerializes.  The gun which he held at Harry's head\nfalls to the seat beside HARRY, who picks it up and tosses it\ninto the glove compartment, beside all sorts of other futuristic\nguns and weapons.\n\n\n<b>                      HARRY\n</b><b>                    (V.O.)\n</b>\n                 Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches\n                 me unless I want 'em to.\n\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>EXT.  METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM - NIGHT</u>\n</b>\nThe camera is close-up on the illustrated banner over the main\nentrance.  The banner reads; \"Treasures of the Loc-Nar - Coming\nJuly 8th\".\n\nWe pan down to the museum doors, as a man's body comes crashing\nthrough the plate glass and sprawls forward, cut and bleeding.\nIt is the goateed professor from the desert.  His daughter\nruns out behind him, ripping her clothes on the broken glass.\n\n\n<b>GIRL\n</b>\nFather!\n\n\n<b>PROFESSOR\n</b>\nRun!\n\n\nThe girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser\nguns come out and start firing.  A fat, evil-looking man (RUDNICK)\nbends down and grabs the professor's head, jerking it up.\n\n\n<b>RUDNICK\n</b>(to henchmen)\n\nHe's dead.  Get the girl!\n\n\nThe girl, clothes torn, runs out into the street, just as\nHarry's cab comes cruising by.  She runs alongside, pounding\non the window.\n\n\n<b>GIRL\n</b>(to Harry)\n\nHelp me, please!!\n\n\nA laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts Harry's side-mirror.\nHARRY flips the switch, unlocking the passenger door, and waves\nher in.\n\n\n<b>HARRY\n</b><b>(V.O.)\n</b>\nNormally my rule is \"Don't\nget involved\", but something\nabout this dame got to me.\n\n\nShe dives in the back and HARRY floors it.  The cab screams\naway as Laser-shots land all around.\n\n\n<b>GIRL\n</b>(in shock, breathless)\n\nThe Loc-Nar ... they wanted\nit ... but my father wouldn't\ntell them ... now I'm the only\none ...\n\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>HARRY</u>\n</b>\n<b>HARRY\n</b>(interupting)\n\nRelax sister.  There's a cop\nstation up here.  You can ...\n\n\nHARRY looks at her in the rear-view mirror.  The girl has fainted.\n\n\n<b>HARRY\n</b><b>(V.O.)\n</b>\nJust what I needed ... guess\nI'm a sucker for a pretty face.\n\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>POLICE STATION</u>\n</b>\nThe police station is an all-metal building with no windows.\nA plaque on thr front reads \"N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION\".\n\nHarry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious\nGIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer.\n\n\n<b>VOICE\n</b>(over intercom)\n\nPolice.  Whaddya want?\n\n\n<b>HARRY\n</b>\nI wanna report a murder.\n\n\n<b>VOICE\n</b>(over intercom)\n\nSo what else is new?\n\n\n<b>HARRY\n</b>\nYou gonna let me in or what?\n\n\nA buzzer sounds and the door slides open.  HARRY carries the\nGIRL in and heads across the room toward the main desk.  As\nhe walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector/vaccuum\ncleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects.  Piles\nof weapons can be seen in the machine's transparent belly.\n\n\n<b>COP #1\n</b>\nOkay, this guy's clean - next.\n\n\nHARRY comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl\ndown in a chair.\n\n\n<b>DESK SERGEANT\n</b>(to Harry)\n\nBefore you go any further pal, I\ngotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A\nthousand bucks a day for a full investigation.\nAnother thousand if the assailant is caught.\nGot it?\n\n\n<b>HARRY\n</b>\nYeah thanks ...\n\n\nHe picks up the girl and turns to leave.\n\n\n<b>HARRY\n</b>... for nuthin'!\n\n\n<b>DESK SERGEANT\n</b>(shouting after Harry)\n\nYou think you can do better?\nJoin one of the vigilante groups.\nThere's a list of 'em outside.\n\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>EXT. POLICE STATION</u>\n</b>\nHARRY, carrying the GIRL, comes out of the police station, as\na patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him.  Two cops\nemerge, dragging a green alien with four arms.\n\n\n<b>GREEN ALIEN\n</b>\nI tell you I'm an American citizen.\nI just lost my papers.\n\n\n<b>COP\n</b>(to himself)\n\nGoddamn illegal aliens.\n\n\nHARRY heads toward his cab.\n\n\n<b>HARRY\n</b><b>(V.O.)\n</b>\nSo here I was, stuck with this beautiful\ngirl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin'\nbut trouble ...\n\n\nHe looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood.  Every doorway\nand alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking.\n\n\n<b>HARRY\n</b><b>(V.O.)\n</b>\n... but I didn't feel right just\nleaving her for the sickos.  I\ndunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental\nor something ...\n\n\n<b>DISSOLVE TO\n</b>\n\n<b><u>INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT</u>\n</b>\nThis futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly\ncoloured molden plastic.  Bowling trophies sit on a shelf\nunderneath a neon \"Buweiser\" clock.  The place is a mess.\n\nHARRY carries the GIRL in, pushes the light button to \"On\",\nand lays her down on the sofa.  As he takes off his jacket\nhe looks down at the unconscious figure - her clothes torn\nin all the right places.  She moans and starts to come to.\n\n\n<b>GIRL\n</b>\nWhere am I?\n\n\n<b>HARRY\n</b>\nMy place ...\n\n\nWalking over to a hi-tech plastic bar, HARRY pushes a button\nand a machine pours and mixes a drink.  He hands the GIRL the\nglass.  She sits up and drinks.\n\n\n<b>GIRL\n</b>(looking at Harry)\n\nThey'd have killed me if it\nwasn't for you.\n\n\n<b>HARRY\n</b>\nWhat'd they want to snuff you\nfor?\n\n\n<b>- - -\n</b>\n\n[Page 99/120.]\n\n<b>\n</b><b></b></pre>\n<b>\n</b><b></b><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Heavy Metal</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Dan Goldberg\" title=\"Scripts by Dan Goldberg\">Dan Goldberg</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Len Blum\" title=\"Scripts by Len Blum\">Len Blum</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Animation\" title=\"Animation Scripts\">Animation</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Heavy Metal Script.html#comments\" title=\"Heavy Metal comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:07:09.135744"}
