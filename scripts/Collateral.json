Black Peter.\n<br/>                There's an old Mexican tale that tells\n<br/>                of how Santa Claus got so very busy\n<br/>                looking out for the good children that\n<br/>                he had to hire some help to look out\n<br/>                for the bad children. So he hired\n<br/>                Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a\n<br/>                list with all the names of all the bad\n<br/>                children, and Pedro would come every\n<br/>                night to check them out. And the\n<br/>                people, the little kids that were\n<br/>                misbehaving, that were not saying                        *\n<br/>                their prayers, Pedro would leave a\n<br/>                little wooden donkey on their windows.\n<br/>                And he would come back and if the\n<br/>                children were still misbehaving, he\n<br/>                would take them away and nobody would\n<br/>                ever see them again. Now, if I am\n<br/>                Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do\n<br/>                you think jolly old Santa Claus would\n<br/>                feel if one day Pedro came into his\n<br/>                office and said, 'I lost the list.'?\n<br/>                How FUCKING FURIOUS do you think Santa\n<br/>                Claus would get?!\n<br/>\n<br/>     Paco's gun is visible.

Here\n<br/>       comes fucking Vincent down the aisle of the second car. He sees\n<br/>       Max. He shouts, barely audible from here...\n<br/><b>                            VINCENT\n<br/></b><b>                  YOU CAN'T WIN, MAX!

He stares at\n<br/>       the H+K in his shaking hand, sees the slide is locked back -\n<br/>       gun's empty. He rises up. His look says, \"go ahead, kill\n<br/>       me...\" through the shattered window.\n<br/>\n<br/>       Vincent's standing in the other car, right where we left him.\n<br/>       Watching Max. A little smile on his face.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>107    INT. VINCENT'S CAR - NIGHT                                   107\n<br/></b>\n<br/>       Vincent ejects the empty magazine. Before it even hits the\n<br/>       floor or at his feet...Vincent's hand loading a full mag, the\n<br/>       weapon pointed at Max, like it was when he reloaded and shot\n<br/>       Peter Yip the first time.\n<br/>\n<br/>       Odd, though. His fingers aren't working that well. His\n<br/>       brilliant sleight-of-hand seems gone. He fumbles the reload, in\n<br/>       fact.\n<br/>\n<br/>       The magazine of stacked .45's drops, landing at his feet among\n<br/>       the expended casings. A few fresh droplets of blood patter\n<br/>       quietly.\n<br/>\n<br/>       Vincent considers picking up the mag, but it suddenly seems like\n<br/>       way too much trouble. He blinks at the .45 in his hand, as if\n<br/>       confused, then turns and starts unsteadily back toward the back\n<br/>       of the car.\n<br/>\n<br/>       The .45 slips from his fingers, clattering to the floor.\n<br/>\n<br/>       Max watches Vincent walk away.\n<br/>\n<br/>       Vincent only makes it halfway. He has to sit. He grabs an\n<br/>       aluminum pole, eases himself onto the seat, trying to catch his\n<br/>       breath.\n<br/>\n<br/>       Max slides his door open, steps across the bridge between cars.\n<br/>       Slides the second door open. Enters.\n<br/>\n<br/>       Vincent turns his head slightly, watching Max draw cautiously\n<br/>       nearer. Max stares down, seeing the blood spreading across the\n<br/>       floor beneath Vincent. Turning into quite a pool.\n<br/>\n<br/>       Vincent tries to speak, can't quite manage. Max sits across\n<br/>       from him. Annie appears in b.g., watching them.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>       VINCENT + MAX\n<br/></b>\n<br/>       sit there, riding the train.

Vincent looks.\n<br/>\n<br/>       Max follows his gaze. There, right across the car, among all\n<br/>       the ADVERTISEMENTS near the ceiling, is:\n<br/>\n<br/><b>       AN AD\n<br/></b>\n<br/>       The whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine.

But it's a protective and confident act... She\n<br/>       takes his hand. Dawn lightens the sky ahead. They ride the\n<br/>       train together, side by side, neither saying a word. For now.\n<br/>\n<br/>       The train pulls in to a station...\n<br/>\n<br/><b>       WIDE ANGLE OF SUBWAY CAR\n<br/></b>\n<br/>       ...and Max pulls Annie to her feet. The doors open.
