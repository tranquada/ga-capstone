So he hired\n                Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a\n                list with all the names of all the bad\n                children, and Pedro would come every\n                night to check them out. And the\n                people, the little kids that were\n                misbehaving, that were not saying                        *\n                their prayers, Pedro would leave a\n                little wooden donkey on their windows.\n                And he would come back and if the\n                children were still misbehaving, he\n                would take them away and nobody would\n                ever see them again. Now, if I am\n                Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do\n                you think jolly old Santa Claus would\n                feel if one day Pedro came into his\n                office and said, 'I lost the list.'?\n                How FUCKING FURIOUS do you think Santa\n                Claus would get?!\n\n     Paco's gun is visible.

Here\n       comes fucking Vincent down the aisle of the second car. He sees\n       Max. He shouts, barely audible from here...\n                            VINCENT\n                  YOU CAN'T WIN, MAX!   I DO THIS FOR A\n                  LIVING!\n\n       ...and he keeps coming, .45 at his side, a sheet of blood down\n       his face from the missing part of his ear.\n\n       ...the visage of Vincent, the .45 in his hands, scares the shit\n       out of the early-morning passengers.\n\n       ...and Max clutches the H+K, takes a deep, shaky breath, his\n       eyes on Annie's, not even sure in that moment what he's going to\n       do, probably die, and he lunges up, Vincent not ten feet away...\n\n       AND THE TRAIN GOES DARK.\n\n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                               9/30/03 MM revs. (cherry)   110A.\n106D   CONTINUED:                                                  106D\n\n       A BLIZZARD OF MUZZLE FLASHES, both men FIRING THROUGH THE\n       WINDOWS at each other, GLASS SHATTERING between the cars and\n       getting sucked away by the wind, Max screaming, face lit only by\n       the GUNFIRE, clumsy in how he holds Vincent's H+K, firing one-\n       handed, not aiming, not looking where he's shooting...Vincent's\n       Para-Ordnance BOOMING OUT MASSIVE ERUPTIONS OF FLAME...\n\n\n\n\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                9/30/03 MM revs. (cherry)    111.\n106D   CONTINUED: (2)                                               106D\n\n       ...and then abrupt silence as the LIGHTS RETURN, Max looking        *\n       down, his expression nearly childlike with terror. He stares at\n       the H+K in his shaking hand, sees the slide is locked back -\n       gun's empty. He rises up. His look says, \"go ahead, kill\n       me...\" through the shattered window.\n\n       Vincent's standing in the other car, right where we left him.\n       Watching Max. A little smile on his face.\n\n107    INT. VINCENT'S CAR - NIGHT                                   107\n\n       Vincent ejects the empty magazine. Before it even hits the\n       floor or at his feet...Vincent's hand loading a full mag, the\n       weapon pointed at Max, like it was when he reloaded and shot\n       Peter Yip the first time.\n\n       Odd, though. His fingers aren't working that well. His\n       brilliant sleight-of-hand seems gone. He fumbles the reload, in\n       fact.\n\n       The magazine of stacked .45's drops, landing at his feet among\n       the expended casings. A few fresh droplets of blood patter\n       quietly.\n\n       Vincent considers picking up the mag, but it suddenly seems like\n       way too much trouble. He blinks at the .45 in his hand, as if\n       confused, then turns and starts unsteadily back toward the back\n       of the car.\n\n       The .45 slips from his fingers, clattering to the floor.\n\n       Max watches Vincent walk away.\n\n       Vincent only makes it halfway. He has to sit. He grabs an\n       aluminum pole, eases himself onto the seat, trying to catch his\n       breath.\n\n       Max slides his door open, steps across the bridge between cars.\n       Slides the second door open. Enters.\n\n       Vincent turns his head slightly, watching Max draw cautiously\n       nearer. Max stares down, seeing the blood spreading across the\n       floor beneath Vincent. Turning into quite a pool.\n\n       Vincent tries to speak, can't quite manage. Max sits across\n       from him. Annie appears in b.g., watching them.\n\n       VINCENT + MAX\n\n       sit there, riding the train.   Softly:\n\n                            MAX\n                  We're almost at the next station.\n\n\n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                  10/9/03 MM revs. (yellow)    112.\n107    CONTINUED:                                                      107\n\n       Vincent smiles faintly. He leans his head toward Max as if\n       conferring a secret. In a halting whisper:\n\n                              VINCENT\n                    Guy. Gets on a subway. Dies.\n                        (off Max's look)\n                    Think anybody'll notice?\n\n       MAX\n\n       looks into Vincent's eyes. It means \"I'm that guy\" and \"will\n       anybody notice me when I'm gone?\"\n\n       VINCENT\n\n       leans back, gazing straight ahead now.   Rocking gently with the\n       motion of the train...\n\n       ...and with much effort and to Max's amazement, Vincent emits a\n       soft, rasping wheeze, but it's a faint laugh all the same.\n\n       Max has no idea what's so funny to a dying man.    Vincent looks.\n\n       Max follows his gaze. There, right across the car, among all\n       the ADVERTISEMENTS near the ceiling, is:\n\n       AN AD\n\n       The whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine.   A dream place.\n       Limitless horizon.                                                    *\n\n107A   INT. VINCENT'S CAR - MAX - DAWN                                107A\n\n       Vincent's no longer laughing.   In fact, Vincent's no longer\n       doing anything. Ever.\n\n       Annie comes to Max and sits. She shivers. Max takes off his\n       zippered, hooded sweatshirt and puts it around Annie. It's a\n       small gesture. But it's a protective and confident act... She\n       takes his hand. Dawn lightens the sky ahead. They ride the\n       train together, side by side, neither saying a word. For now.\n\n       The train pulls in to a station...\n\n       WIDE ANGLE OF SUBWAY CAR\n\n       ...and Max pulls Annie to her feet. The doors open. They\n       silently get off. The first sideways streams of yellow light\n       shaft into the station.\n\n       The doors close again.   The train pulls out.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                         8/24/03 MM revs.   113.\n107A   CONTINUED:                                                  107A\n\n       WE HOLD ON Vincent for a while.
