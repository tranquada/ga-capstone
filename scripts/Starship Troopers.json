You.\n\t\tWhy are only citizens allowed to vote ?\n\n\tRasczak points at LANNY, 17, with his stump\n.\n\t\t\t\tLANNY\n\t\tIt's a reward... what the Federation gives you\n\t\tfor doing Federal Service.\n\n\tRasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience.\n\n\t\t\t\tRASCZAK\n\t\tNo. Something given has no value !\n\t\tHaven't I taught you dimwits anything ?\n\t\tI guess they ought to revoke my \n\t\tteaching credential...\n\n\tLaughter. Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape:\n\tJohnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship.\n\n\t\t\t\tRASCZAK\n\t\tWhen you vote, you're exercising political\n\t\tauthority. You're using force. And force, my\n\t\tfriends, is violence, the supreme authority\n\t\tfrom which all other authority derives.\n\n\tCARL JENKINS, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\tGee, we always thought you were the\n\t\tsupreme authority, Mr. Rasczak.\n\n\tLaughter. Rasczak grins.\n\n\t\t\t\tRASCZAK\n\t\tIn my classroom, you bet. Whether it's \n\t\texerted by ten or ten billion, political \n\t\tauthority is violence by degree. The \n\t\tpeople we call citizens have earned\n\t\tthe right to wield it.\n\n\tDIZZY FLORES, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIZZY\n\t\tMy mother always says that violence\n\t\tnever solves anything.\n\n\t\t\t\tRASCZAK\n\t\tReally ? I wonder what the city fathers of\n\t\tHiroshima would have to say about that.\n\t\tYou.\n\n\tRasczak points at Carmen.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARMEN\n\t\tThey probably wouldn't say anything.\n\t\tHiroshima was destroyed.\n\n\tJohnny presses \u00b4\"SEND\" on his desk, and the cartoon appears\n\tacross the way on Carmen's screen.\n\n\t\t\t\tRASCZAK\n\t\tCorrect. Naked force has settled more\n\t\tissues in history than any other factor.\n\t\tThe contrary opinion 'violence never\n\t\tsolves anything' is wishful thinking\n\t\tat its worst.\n\n\tWhile Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful\n\tsmile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus.\n\n\t\t\t\tRASCZAK\n\t\tPeople who forget that always pay...\n\t\tThey pay with their lives and their\n\t\tfreedom.\n\n\tDizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face.\n\tSo does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump,\n\tsnaps Johnny to.\n\n\t\t\t\tRASCZAK\n\t\tYou. Tell me the moral difference,\n\t\tif any, between the citizen and the civilian ?\n\n\t\t\t\tJOHNNY\n\t\tThe difference lies in the field of civic\n\t\tvirtue. A citizen accepts personal\n\t\tresponsibility for the safety of the body politic,\n\t\tof which he is a member, defending it,\n\t\tif need be, with his life.\n\t\tThe civilian does not.\n\n\t\t\t\tRASCZAK\n\t\tThe exact words of the text. But do\n\t\tyou understand it ?\n\t\tDo you believe it ?\n\n\t\t\t\tJOHNNY\n\t\tUh, I don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tRASCZAK\n\t\tOf course you don't. I doubt if any \n\t\tof you here would recognize 'civic virtue'\n\t\tif it bit you in the ass.\n\n\tA bell rings. Rasczak shrugs, indifferent.\n\n\t\t\t\tRASCZAK\n\t\tWell, that's it.

We humans like to think we are\n\t\tNature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't \n\t\ttrue. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many\n\t\tways.
