THE CENTER - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tIt spins and falls beneath us. Down, down it goes. And\n\tthen it crashes into the GREAT LAWN. A huge cloud of\n\tdebris shoots upward.\n\n<b>\tEXT. THE SKY - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tThere is a beautiful FULL MOON. PETER and LIZ float down\n\tinto the frame lit by its wonderful light.\n\n\tThe AMERICAN FLAG which has turned into a huge parachute.\n\tThey hold each other tight. They can hear SIRENS below.\n\tThey begin to laugh with relief. Then they stop. The\n\twind billows LIZ'S skirt and plays with PETER'S hair, and\n\tsnaps in the AMERICAN FLAG.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLIZ\n</b>\t\tWe have a lot to thank your friend\n\t\tSpider-Man for.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETER\n</b>\t\tSomehow, I don't think we've seen the\n\t\tlast of him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLIZ\n</b>\t\tPeter...! Finders, keepers...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETER\n</b>\t\tWhat...? What is it? Why do you look\n\t\tlike that?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLIZ\n</b>\t\tI think I'm in love.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETER\n</b>\t\t\t(even his eyes blush)\n\t\tYou are...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLIZ\n</b>\t\tWith your friend...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETER\n</b>\t\tSpider-Man? You're in love with\n\t\tSpider-Man?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLIZ\n</b>\t\tI am... you think we'll see him again?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETER\n</b>\t\tWe might... you never know.\n\t\tHe kisses her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLIZ\n</b>\t\tOh.\n\t\t\t(bittersweet)\n\t\tThis may be the end of a beautiful\n\t\tfriendship you know?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPETER\n</b>\t\tNah.\n\n\tThey land in the center of the park under the parachute.\n\tThey stay there and kiss... completely covered by the\n\tflag. Camera pulls up to show the building floating away.\n\n<b>\tTHE END\n</b>\n\n\n\n</pre>\n\n<b></b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Spider-Man</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=David Koepp\" title=\"Scripts by David Koepp\">David Koepp</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Spider-Man Script.html#comments\" title=\"Spider-Man comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:17:02.096461"}
