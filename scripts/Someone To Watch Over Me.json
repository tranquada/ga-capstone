MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS - EARLY EVENING\n</b>\nWinter.  A celebration.  Close friends, cop friends,\nfamily all here to celebrate patrolman MIKE KEEGAN'S\npromotion to detective, NYPD.\n\nThe party spills through the house -- front room, dining\nroom, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond\nthat.  A community of cops on their off-hours, their\nwives, kids.  A mix of generations, all the way from\nMIKE'S kid, TOMMY, and his FRIENDS, playing among the\nadults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her\nchair at the side.  The mood's warm, spirited; there's a\nlot of friendship here.\n\nANGLE:  MIKE, in the dining room, posing for a photo with\nhis ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new\ngold detective's SHIELD pinned to his jersey.\n\n<b>                         MIKE\n</b>                  (calling to his\n                   wife, for a family\n                   portrait)\n          Ellie!  C'mon!  Over here!\n\nANGLE:  ELLIE, MIKE'S wife of fifteen years, a local\nproduct, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of\nher man.  She frees herself from the crush of friends,\nhurrying to join him.\n\nANGLE:  MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack on the\nlips as he hooks her into his arms.\n\nThe picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers.\nBehind, a banner and poster blowup of Mike in gun and\nuniform read:  \"FINALLY THEY'VE RECOGNIZED YOU, DETECTIVE\n<b>KEEGAN.\"\n</b>\nSCOTTY, a patrolman with the 117th and one of MIKE'S best\npals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on\n<b>MIKE'S SHOULDER.\n</b>\n<b>                         SCOTTY\n</b>                  (to Mike)\n          No joke?

Ask the man who\n          put in the good word.\n\nANGLE ON T.J. GREENING, Helen's husband, Mike's best\nfriend.  He's forty, stocky, looks up, horsing around with\nsome of the kids in the next room.\n\n<b>                         MIKE\n</b>          If T.J. didn't push for me, I never\n          would've made it.\n\n<b>                         BROOKLYN\n</b>          Bet your ass...

HELEN, passing by with\nan empty platter, catches the action.\n\n\n<b>INT.

MIKE LEAPS FOR ELLIE, knocking her off her CHAIR,\nrolling FAST as the ENTIRE KITCHEN ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE.\n\nANGLE ON ELLIE:  throwing herself OVER TOMMY, BULLETS\n\"PINGING\" AROUND MIKE as he ROLLS, RETURNING THE FIRE.\nThe pitch-black kitchen shudders with BANGS and FLASHES\nlike the Fourth of July, mixed with the \"WHINE\" of bullets\nhitting pots and pans, and the sight of BODIES hurtling\nthrough the dark.\n\nThe \"FIGURE AT THE DOOR\" is firing with both hands,\nSCORING A HIT ON VENZA'S ACCOMPLICE, who goes down,\nwounded, HIS GUN CLATTERING to the FLOOR.

MIKE picks\nup VENZA'S HUNTING KNIFE from the floor, cutting through\nthe ropes that bind TOMMY'S and ELLIE'S HANDS; she PULLS\nTOMMY to HER, in a tearful EMBRACE, shielding his face\nfrom the ghastly sight of the man, lying dead, on the\nfloor.\n\nOTHER PEOPLE are MOVING INWARD, CLAIRE among them, clad in\nan OVERSIZED POLICE OVERCOAT -- looking frail and\nfrightened, SHUDDERING WITH RELIEF when she sees that all\nare safe.
