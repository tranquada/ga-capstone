MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS - EARLY EVENING\n\nWinter.  A celebration.  Close friends, cop friends,\nfamily all here to celebrate patrolman MIKE KEEGAN'S\npromotion to detective, NYPD.\n\nThe party spills through the house -- front room, dining\nroom, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond\nthat.  A community of cops on their off-hours, their\nwives, kids.  A mix of generations, all the way from\nMIKE'S kid, TOMMY, and his FRIENDS, playing among the\nadults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her\nchair at the side.  The mood's warm, spirited; there's a\nlot of friendship here.\n\nANGLE:  MIKE, in the dining room, posing for a photo with\nhis ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new\ngold detective's SHIELD pinned to his jersey.\n\n                         MIKE\n                  (calling to his\n                   wife, for a family\n                   portrait)\n          Ellie!  C'mon!  Over here!\n\nANGLE:  ELLIE, MIKE'S wife of fifteen years, a local\nproduct, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of\nher man.  She frees herself from the crush of friends,\nhurrying to join him.\n\nANGLE:  MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack on the\nlips as he hooks her into his arms.\n\nThe picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers.\nBehind, a banner and poster blowup of Mike in gun and\nuniform read:  \"FINALLY THEY'VE RECOGNIZED YOU, DETECTIVE\nKEEGAN.\"\n\nSCOTTY, a patrolman with the 117th and one of MIKE'S best\npals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on\nMIKE'S SHOULDER.\n\n                         SCOTTY\n                  (to Mike)\n          No joke?  You're being transferred\n          to the 19th as your first\n          assignment?  Who the hell loves your\n          ass downtown?\n\n                         ROOKIE\n                  (naively)\n          What's the 21st?\n\nBROOKLYN, a cop about Mike's age, joins in.\n\n                         SCOTTY\n          What d'you care?  You'll never know.\n\n                         BROOKLYN\n          Manhattan.  The Upper East Side,\n          East 59th to 96th.\n\nThe ROOKIE stares, impressed.\n\n                         SCOTTY\n                  (to the others)\n          Remember Curran from the Sixteenth?\n          He posted a coupla months there on a\n          floater outside the French embassy.\n          He met Jackie Kennedy.\n\n                         BROOKLYN\n          Curran, that fuckin' noodlehead.  He\n          probably wrote her up for letting\n          her dog dump on Rockefeller's\n          doorstep.\n\nANGLE ON MIKE, trying to swallow a mouthful of potato\nsalad as a plump and pretty middle-aged woman (HELEN\nGREENING) pulls him into a bear hug, planting a kiss on\nhim.\n\n                         HELEN\n          Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss!  I'm so\n          proud of you!  What the hell took\n          you so long?\n\n                         MIKE\n          Hey, don't ask me.  Ask the man who\n          put in the good word.\n\nANGLE ON T.J. GREENING, Helen's husband, Mike's best\nfriend.  He's forty, stocky, looks up, horsing around with\nsome of the kids in the next room.\n\n                         MIKE\n          If T.J. didn't push for me, I never\n          would've made it.\n\n                         BROOKLYN\n          Bet your ass... I give you six weeks\n          before you're back on the beat,\n          Keegan, they got no room for hero\n          cops...\n\n                         MIKE\n          Appreciate, that vote of confidence,\n          Brook.\n\n                         BROOKLYN\n          Hey, am I supportive, or what?\n\nANGLE ON TOMMY:  in the hallway, trying to show SCOTTY'S\ndate -- a \"real\" BIMBO, who's spilling out of her woolly\nsweater and tight jeans -- how to stand on his SKATEBOARD.\nShe shrieks a laugh, toppling off.  HELEN, passing by with\nan empty platter, catches the action.\n\n\nINT.  KITCHEN - SAME\n\nELLIE, another WIFE at the sink, wives all; HELEN enters.\n\n                         HELEN\n          He left Elaine for that?\n\n                         WIFE #1\n          And what about little Scotty?\n\nELLIE continues washing the dishes as HELEN and the WIFE\ndry.  MIKE enters to get more beers.\n\n                         HELEN\n                  (still staring)\n          I'd like to tie her tits together.\n\n                         ELLIE\n          That wouldn't be too difficult.\n\n                         MIKE\n                  (overhearing)\n          I bet you think she doesn't have a\n          brain in her head.  I bet you think\n          the only thing he sees in her is one\n          incredible, dynamite body...\n\nHe GRINS at their blank stares... ELLIE'S EYES wryly\nfollowing... as he moves on out with his beers.\n\n                         HELEN\n          I love your husband, Ellie, but he's\n          a real dork.\n\n                         ELLIE\n          Yeah, but he's my dork.\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nNight has descended, PEOPLE talking and laughing quietly,\nMELLOW music is playing -- CAMERA FINDING MIKE AND ELLIE,\ndancing close, moving sensually.  It's impressive.  HELEN\nconvinces T.J. to DANCE.  SCOTTY and BIMBO join in too.\nT.J., whipped, extricates himself and Helen; tousling\nMike's hair in affection.\n\n                         T.J.\n          We're goin'.  Get some sleep,\n          Detective Keegan.  You got a new job\n          tomorrow.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT.

MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nELLIE in the bathroom, the door open, she brushes her\nhair.\n\nMIKE in bed, thoughtful, a happy man.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Ellie, you know I think it's about\n          time we got outa this place, get us\n          a house of our own.  We can afford\n          it now.\n\n                         ELLIE\n          Amen to that.  The supermarket's\n          full of assholes.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Take my advice, don't buy any...\n\nMIKE waits for a response.  None comes.\n\n                         ELLIE\n          Mike?\n\n                         MIKE\n                  (aware of her change\n                   in tone)\n          What?\n\n                         ELLIE\n          My ass if falling.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Your what...?\n\n                         ELLIE\n          My ass is falling.  It is.\n\n                         MIKE\n                  (a laugh)\n          What are you talking about?\n\n                         ELLIE\n                  (appears in the door;\n                   stricken)\n          I just saw it in the mirror, it\n          doesn't look like my ass anymore.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Get in bed.\n\n                         ELLIE\n          What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the\n          exercises on TV in the morning...\n          gravity...\n\n                         MIKE\n          You got a great ass!  I love your\n          ass -- now get that falling ass into\n          bed before it hits the floor.\n\nShe does -- the lights snap put.  They giggle, she MOVING\ninto his arms.\n\n                         ELLIE\n                  (a declaration)\n          Tomorrow, I start looking for our\n          house...

I'm sleepin' with a DT.\n\nAnother muted laugh -- and they move into an EMBRACE,\nCAMERA PANNING WITH THEM, and then STILL FARTHER INTO THE\nDARKNESS.\n\nTHE DARKNESS HOLDS.\n\n\nEXT.  EAST RIVER - (AERIAL) - NIGHT\n\n... Becoming a darkness pricked with light, as WE FLOAT\nover the reflective river, MOVING WEST TOWARD AND OVER THE\nCITY.\n\n\nEXT.  MANHATTAN - (AERIAL CONTINUED) - NIGHT\n\nThe fabled city, the ultimate object of man's desire and\nfulfillment, Oz, the city unfolding itself before and\nbeneath us, till DAZZLING SHAFTS OF LIGHT sizzling up --\nKLEIG LIGHTS -- stab our eyes and bring us down into their\nBLINDING BRIGHTNESS...\n\n\nEXT.  CLUB - MIDTOWN - NIGHT\n\nA nondescript piece of rundown city block that's the\nhottest thing in town.  PERSONNEL regulate the CROWD and\nARRIVALS.  There is a public line, and from it the young,\nhip and outrageous can look on while awaiting entrance at\nthe formally dressed, stylishly gowned GUESTS arriving at\nthe private line.\n\nA glittering post-Metropolitan Museum of Art opening gala\nis in progress tonight.  The club's private entrance looks\nlike what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and\nthe joke's not lost on most of the formal GUESTS, arriving\nthrough the X-rated doorway.\n\n\nINT.  CLUB - NIGHT\n\nThe latest achievement of money, rock and art.  It's a\nbreathtaking multi-leveled theater of light, sound and\ndance.\n\nThere is also an entrance-by-invitation-only grand salon.\n\nANGLE\n\nThe GUESTS arriving here for the Met gala enter almost in\nenchanted procession, each of them being personally\ngreeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, WIN\nHOCKINGS, a charming, rakish ex-preppy.  WIN stands in the\nmiddle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting.\nThis is his element and his club, a son of old money, and\na crossover creature to the fast life.\n\n                         WIN\n          Hi... nice to see you... thank\n          you... my pleasure...\n\n                         A MET BENEFACTRESS\n                  (effusively)\n          Thank you so much for agreeing to\n          host us tonight.

The way our CAMERA covers them makes it clear\nthey are major characters in our story.  NEIL steps\nforward to introduce himself, but WIN, looking up, spots\nCLAIRE first:  A special beauty and clearly someone very\nspecial to him...\n\n                         WIN\n          Claire!\n\n                         CLAIRE\n          Hello, Win.\n\nAnd he embraces her.\n\n                         CLAIRE\n                  (introducing her\n                   companion)\n          You know Neil Steinhart?\n\nHe grins broadly, taking NEIL'S hand; then right back to\nCLAIRE.\n\n                         WIN\n          Of the filthy rich Steinharts?  Why\n          is it Claire always connects with\n          the richest men this side of Saudi?\n\n                         NEIL\n                  (to Win; meaning the\n                   club)\n          This gives new meaning to the word\n          nightlife.\n\nWIN acknowledges the obligatory compliment with a closed\nsmile, impatiently returning to CLAIRE:\n\n                         WIN\n          C'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow\n          rag trade...\n                  (smiles, cutting\n                   Neil out)\n          You don't mind, do you?\n\nNEIL stares, polite, as WIN whisks her away; turning, as\nhe is addressed by someone else coming his way.\n\n\nEXT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT\n\nas a BLACK PORSCHE PULLS UP, its dark-tinted window\nrolling down TO REVEAL JOEY VENZA.  The MANAGER of the\nclub comes over to him, with a clipboard list of only the\ninvitees.\n\n                         MANAGER\n                  (a dilemma)\n          I'm sorry, Mr. Venza...\n\nVENZA jams the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR, the CAR burning\nrubber like a DRAGSTER as PEOPLE SQUEAL and JUMP OUT of\nthe way; the CAR fish-tailing away, screeching AROUND the\nCORNER.\n\n\nINT.  CLUB - NIGHT\n\nWIN and CLAIRE.  The music, noise, other conversations can\nstill be heard as they walk through the club.\n\nHe smiles, mid-conversation; there's a real affection\nhere.\n\n                         WIN\n          Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them\n          since that shitty pasta dinner on\n          the cape.\n\n                         CLAIRE\n          They've got two monsters now.

WIN exits into an area of\ntall rows of stacked boxes still awaiting unloading.\nBeyond, a bright, high-ceilinged linen whiteness gleams.\n\nIt's a soon-to-be restaurant-gallery area.\n\nTHE RESTAURANT GALLERY\n\nThe walls have already been painted white.  Tables have\nbeen positioned.  Chairs are stacked, waiting.  So are\nmounds of folded laundry and tablecloths, boxes of\naccessories, glass and dish and kitchenware, etc.\n\nExcept for FRED, the elderly stock boy, the bright silence\nis empty.\n\nFRED scores open the sealed cardboard cartons with a\ncurved case cutter.

He checks his watch and\nlooks to an ornate wall clock.  And he's bored.  He picks\nup an empty coffee cup, looking for a last drop.  Settles\nfor sniffing it.  Replaces it on the floor beside him.\nThen he looks to the closed doors of the apartment and\nmakes a decision.  Picking up the coffee cup, he quietly\npushes the DOORS OPEN, and ENTERS.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT.

It is gigantic, his eyes roaming the ceilings, as\nthough to estimate their height.\n\nMoving inward, his eyes fall on a BOOK RACK, and he\ncrosses to it, perusing the shelves for possible reading\nmaterial.\n\nThey're all ART BOOKS, the big, thick kind.  A Renoir,\nbecause of a NUDE FIGURE on the cover, catches his eye.\nBut as he pulls it out and begins to leaf through -- he\nHEARS VOICES.

She calms\nin his arms.\n\nRETURN:  MIKE DODGES back quickly, through the living and\ndining rooms until he's in the kitchen.\n\n\nINT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nSpotting the microwave, MIKE QUICKLY TOSSES in an English\nmuffin -- peering at the dials, as he switches it on.\n\nBut he hasn't escaped being a trespasser to what's going\non in the far room.  He can still HEAR THEM, though HE\nWHISTLES, trying not to.\n\nThe English muffin BURSTS INTO FLAMES, MIKE desperately\npulling it out, tossing it into the sink, feverishly\nfanning the air.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE ON MIKE:  becoming aware that HE'S NOT\nALONE.

Though hard to make out in\nthis windowless capsule, it is DISTANT THUNDER.  It stirs\nlife in him and his eyes wander reflexively upward,\nstudying the ceiling -- then the doors of the apartment,\nleft slightly ajar.\n\nANGLE INSIDE THE APARTMENT:  CAMERA FOLLOWING MIKE as he\nwanders inward, becoming aware of light coming from a\ndrawing room.  HE MOVES TOWARD, STOPPING.\n\nANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE, dimly illuminated by the\nlight of a desk lamp that throws a gentle glow around her\n-- seated, still as statuary, gazing out into the rain.\n\nCLOSE ON MIKE:  watching her.\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT.

I hope so.  I\n          want it to be worth it, for your\n          sake.\n\nNo response.\n\nIn the response that follows, they HEAR MOVEMENT at the\nend of the HALL, looking up to see the silhouetted figures\nof ELLIE, with HELEN GREENING in tow.  They look small,\nand lost, framed against a floor-to-ceiling window that's\nbeginning to illuminate with the first light of day.\n\nHeavy with sadness, GARBER turns and heads toward the\nwomen.  Taking a long moment.  MIKE decides not to follow.\n\nCLOSE ON MIKE\n\nCAMERA STAYS AT THIS DISTANCE as the THREESOME comes\ntogether.  We do not hear their words, but sense the\nemotion by what WE SEE.  After a brief exchange of words,\nGARBER takes HELEN GREENING under his arm, and they MOVE\nAWAY -- leaving MIKE and ELLIE alone.\n\nCLOSER ANGLE:  MIKE and ELLIE, gazing at each other across\nthe gulf of their collective misery.\n\n                         ELLIE\n          I'm going to visit my sister for a\n          few days.

Prove it.\n\n                         MIKE\n                  (calls out the\n                   window)\n          Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire!\n          It's pitch dark in here!\n                  (his words are\n                   carefully chosen)\n          You're gonna have trouble seeing\n          anything, so just come in, and\n          straight down a long hall.  Then\n          stand at the door so we can see you.\n          We want to see your face and we\n          won't be able to until you get to\n          the kitchen door!\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME MOMENT\n\nKOONTZ receiving his \"message\".  Quickly assessing CLAIRE,\nhe looks to the COPS around him -- then GRITS HIS TEETH\nwith DECISION.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nINT.  THE KITCHEN - SAME - NIGHT\n\n                         MIKE\n          I want your guarantee they'll be\n          turned loose when she opens the\n          front door.\n\n                         VENZA\n          I get my hostage first.  No one's\n          turned loose until I say so.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Let my kid go.\n\n                         VENZA\n          I'm not lettin' no one go.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Get that gun away from his head, or\n          I'll keep her from coming in!  Put\n          the gun on me, he can't hurt you!\n          He's tied up!  Put him under the\n          table!\n\n                         VENZA\n          Don't you fuckin' give orders to\n          me...\n\n                         MIKE\n          Put him under the table or I'll stop\n          her from coming in.\n\nMIKE turns to the window, about to shout.\n\n                         VENZA\n                  (to Tommy, an order)\n          Under the table.\n\n                         MIKE\n          I'll take his place, all right?  Put\n          the gun to my head.\n\nMIKE YANKS TOMMY under the TABLE, taking HIS PLACE in THE\nCHAIR; the COCKED GUN presses up against MIKE'S TEMPLE.\n\nANGLE ON ELLIE:  Her widened eyes continuing to INDICATE\n\"beneath the table\".\n\nCLOSE ON TOMMY, ON HIS KNEES, his hands tied behind his\nback; emitting a whimper of terror.\n\n                         ELLIE\n          Be careful, Tommy.\n\nHE LOOKS UP:  SPOTTING HER GUN, where she'd hidden it for\nsafe-keeping, TAPED SECURELY, just OVER HIS HEAD.\n\nThe FRONT DOOR OPENS -- with a SLOW CREAK -- the FIGURE OF\nCLAIRE, her dress silhouetted by the moonlight from\noutside, SEEN standing in the front hallway.\n\n                         MIKE\n                  (frantic)\n          Claire!  It's dark.  Watch your\n          step.  Come slowly.\n\nANGLE ON TOMMY:  trying desperately to get his hands, tied\nbehind his back, within reach of the GUN taped over his\nhead.  It's impossible.\n\nCLOSE ON MIKE:  eyes darting to ELLIE -- as the FIGURE\nslowly APPROACHES down the DARKENED HALL, his HAND\nlowering beneath his knees, within reach of TOMMY, under\nthe TABLE.\n\nANGLE ON TOMMY:  in a near HEADSTAND, his small hands\nmanaging to TOUCH THE TAPE, his fingernails futilely\nattempting to DIG BENEATH IT -- as the FOOTSTEPS continue\nto APPROACH down the DARKENED HALL.\n\nANGLE ON THE FIGURE:  almost at the kitchen door -- about\nto STEP INTO THE LIGHT.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Watch your step!\n\n                         VENZA\n                  (rising)\n          What the fuck you doin'?!\n\nTOMMY'S HANDS are on the GUN.\n\n                         MIKE\n          There's a skateboard in the door!\n\nWith a sudden SOUND of TAPE \"RIPPING\" from under the\nTABLE.  ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  TOMMY ROLLS, THRUSTING THE\nGUN INTO MIKE'S HAND as the FIGURE at the DOOR KICKS THE\nSKATEBOARD, sending it ZOOMING INTO THE ROOM.  VENZA LEAPS\nASIDE AND FIRES, the FIGURE at the DOOR OPENING FIRE in\nRETURN.  MIKE LEAPS FOR ELLIE, knocking her off her CHAIR,\nrolling FAST as the ENTIRE KITCHEN ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE.\n\nANGLE ON ELLIE:  throwing herself OVER TOMMY, BULLETS\n\"PINGING\" AROUND MIKE as he ROLLS, RETURNING THE FIRE.\nThe pitch-black kitchen shudders with BANGS and FLASHES\nlike the Fourth of July, mixed with the \"WHINE\" of bullets\nhitting pots and pans, and the sight of BODIES hurtling\nthrough the dark.\n\nThe \"FIGURE AT THE DOOR\" is firing with both hands,\nSCORING A HIT ON VENZA'S ACCOMPLICE, who goes down,\nwounded, HIS GUN CLATTERING to the FLOOR.  He REACHES for\nit, but ELLIE GETS THERE FIRST, grabbing it with her two\nhands tied in front of her.\n\n                         ELLIE\n                  (to Tommy)\n          Stay down!\n\nThe ACCOMPLICE is staggering upward as ELLIE gets to her\nfeet, SQUARING OFF in POLICE STANCE -- and FIRES, catching\nhim square between the SHOULDER BLADES; HE SPINS, crashing\nBACKWARDS through the GLASS DOOR -- SWISH-PAN to VENZA,\ntrying to get out THE KITCHEN WINDOW...\n\n                         MIKE\n          Turn around, fuck!\n\nHe DOES, BLASTED by MIKE, and the \"FIGURE\" in the door,\nSIMULTANEOUSLY.  He falls out the window, but still has\nlife in him, staggering to his feet, and hit by SPOTLIGHTS\nfrom the CARS OUTSIDE.  In a sudden barrage, he's hit by\nCROSSFIRE, SPINNING, LURCHING -- finally going down.\n\nAnd then all is quiet.\n\nINSIDE THE KITCHEN -- all sound and movement has suddenly\nceased; everyone is a state of shock.\n\n                         ELLIE\n                  (desperate)\n          Tommy...!\n\n                         TOMMY\n          I'm all right.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Ellie...\n\n                         ELLIE\n          I'm all right.\n\nThe overhead LIGHT is SNAPPED ON by the \"FIGURE\" in the\ndoorway -- revealing it to be KOONTZ.  In CLAIRE'S DRESS.\nGuns in both hands, still smoking.\n\n                         KOONTZ\n                  (emphatic)\n          Fuckin' miracle, man.\n\nIn the BACKGROUND distant SIRENS are HEARD heading toward.\nThe SWAT squad.  CAMERA MOVING ACROSS THE FACES OF ELLIE,\nTOMMY, MIKE... and KOONTZ; all holding in place.\nListening to them come.\n\n                         KOONTZ\n                  (re: the sirens)\n          Told you they'd be here in a few\n          minutes.\n\nThe grim humor of it is registered in SILENCE.  MIKE picks\nup VENZA'S HUNTING KNIFE from the floor, cutting through\nthe ropes that bind TOMMY'S and ELLIE'S HANDS; she PULLS\nTOMMY to HER, in a tearful EMBRACE, shielding his face\nfrom the ghastly sight of the man, lying dead, on the\nfloor.\n\nOTHER PEOPLE are MOVING INWARD, CLAIRE among them, clad in\nan OVERSIZED POLICE OVERCOAT -- looking frail and\nfrightened, SHUDDERING WITH RELIEF when she sees that all\nare safe.  But there is no mistaking the presence of\nsomething else in her eyes.\n\nCLOSE ON CLAIRE'S FACE:  gazing at MIKE, his family\nwrapped in his protective embrace.  He LOOKS UP, meeting\nher eyes.\n\n                         CLAIRE\n          Everyone's all right...?\n\n                         MIKE\n          Yeah.  It's all over.\n\nLONG ANGLE on the ROOM:  dimly illuminated by the single\nlight, shed from the opened refrigerator door, as people\nbegin to move -- awakening to life, and its necessary\ndetails, in the aftermath of the crisis.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME\n\nThe LAWN virtually FILLED with POLICE VEHICLES, their\nrevolving red lights illuminating the grim scene; a small\ngathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes,\nAMBULANCES pulling SLOWLY, SILENTLY, away.\n\nCAMERA PANS to two figures ALONE, beside a squad car, in\nthe distant shadows.  It's CLAIRE, still clad in the\npolice overcoat, and MIKE.  They are together, but\nseparate, maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye.\n\nCLOSER ANGLE ON THEM:  not knowing quite what to say.\n\n                         MIKE\n          So.\n\n                         CLAIRE\n          So.\n\nANGLE ON BOTH:  their eyes locked into each other's.\n\n                         MIKE\n          You still going away?\n\n                         CLAIRE\n          I don't know...\n\n                         MIKE\n          You don't have to, now.\n\n                         CLAIRE\n          I think it's probably still a good\n          idea.\n\nCLOSE ON MIKE:  getting her message.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Yeah...\n\nBoth are hurting.\n\n                         CLAIRE\n                  (heartfelt)\n          I'll miss you, Mike.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Listen, I'll... see you again.\n\nHer eyes are glistening; she gives him a bracing smile.\nBut he can't quiet manage it.\n\n                         CLAIRE\n                  (barely able to\n                   speak)\n          Say goodbye.\n\nHe struggles with it; unable.\n\n                         MIKE\n          I like your coat.\n\n                         CLAIRE\n                  (half-laugh, half-cry)\n          You have a weakness for Lady Cops.\n\n                         MIKE\n          I do.\n\nSilence now; their eyes adoring.\n\n                         CLAIRE\n          Say goodbye, Mike.\n\n                         MIKE\n                  (thick voiced)\n          You take care.\n\nMIKE TURNS -- CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM as he WALKS SLOWLY\nAWAY -- finding himself on a collision course with GARBER.\nThey meet, spending a long moment in non-communicative\ngreeting.\n\n                         MIKE\n                  (finally)\n          What do you think?\n                  (a beat)\n          Any chance?  There's nothin' else\n          I'm any good at, but this.\n\n                         GARBER\n                  (noncommittal)\n          Call me next week.  We'll talk about\n          it.\n\nMIKE absorbs it, looking up to SEE ELLIE and TOMMY, beside\na SQUAD CAR, a distance away.  Girding himself, he HEADS\nTOWARD.\n\nANGLE ON ELLIE AND TOMMY -- as he APPROACHES, and stands\nbeside them.  Not much to say.  Finally he reaches out and\ntousles TOMMY'S hair.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Good police work, kiddo.\n\nHe catches ELLIE'S eye, both assessing each other.\n\n                         ELLIE\n                  (re: Tommy)\n          He doesn't want to sleep here.\n                  (a long beat)\n          Neither do I.  It's not my house\n          anymore.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Me neither.\n\nANGLE ON ALL:  finding each other's eyes.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Let's find some place to start over.\n\nMIKE puts an arm AROUND TOMMY -- and the CAMERA BEGINS A\nLONG PULLBACK, as ELLIE moves to his side, and the KEEGAN\nFAMILY begins to MOVE AWAY.  WE SEE CLAIRE, being helped\ninto a SQUAD CAR, turning to look back at them as it PULLS\nAWAY -- CARS REVVING UP and PULLING OUT, in ALL\nDIRECTIONS.\n\nFrom a distance, we HEAR MIKE'S VOICE.\n\n                         MIKE (V.O.)\n                  (to Ellie)\n          What this crap about singing\n          lessons?\n\n                                            FADE OUT.\n\n                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone To Watch Over Me\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Howard Franklin\u00a0\u00a0Danilo Bach\u00a0\u00a0David Seltzer\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:36:02.847123"}
