Lean, hard, in perfect physical\r\n          shape. In this moment, carrying the stillness of someone\r\n          utterly in balance. For all we know, he's been sitting this\r\n          way for hours.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (V.O.)\r\n          Every man has a death that's right\r\n          for him. Every one.\r\n          REVERSE to find a wall of photographs, charts, official\r\n          documents. In the center A PHOTOGRAPH of a man, mid-40's,\r\n          East-Indian, dressed like the billionaire he is. Dodi Fayed\r\n          meets Bill Gates. THE MARK.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          For every man, there's a way to\r\n          leave this earth which is so right\r\n          for them, it's almost as if they\r\n          carry it with them.\r\n          MOVING over the wall. MORE PHOTOGRAPHS. The Mark escorted\r\n          from a bullet-proof sedan by ear-wired men. Entertaining at\r\n          a palatial estate.

RURAL RACETRACK - DAY\r\n\r\n          VINTAGE RACE CARS speed by, a blur of color. But all we hear\r\n          is the Rolling Stones' song.

BISHOP'S STUDY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Bishop at his wall again, this time actively engaged, working\r\n          it. A picture of the Mark in his vintage car goes up,\r\n          underneath, Bishop tacks a stats page: \"Fatality in auto\r\n          accidents by type of impact. Head on, Side rear,...\"\r\n          Off to the side, bank statements, cash transfers. Saudi\r\n          Arabia. Chechnya. United Arab Emirates.\r\n          Bishop tacks more photos up. The Mark, getting off a private\r\n          plane, the Mark, playing Polo...\r\n\r\n          EXT. POLO GROUNDS - DAY\r\n\r\n          WHACK! A Rider SLAMS a ball forward, spurs his horse\r\n          onwards, bearing down on the ball... and SLAM! Another Rider\r\n          comes in from the side, sends the man crashing off his horse.\r\n          The second man, the Mark, takes a second to gloat over his\r\n          fallen opponent before CHARGING onwards.\r\n          IN THE STANDS. Bishop watches, takes a note on a pad.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Bishop keeps working, the wall completely covered now. Lists\r\n          of possible deaths have been ordered, drawbacks circled.\r\n          Bishop scans over various magazine covers featuring the Mark.\r\n          One with a vintage hunting rifle slung low in his arms,\r\n          unbroken. \"American Dream or American Nightmare?\"\r\n          Bishop stares at this. Eyes moving over the wall, accident\r\n          stats, a copy of a hunting-club reprimand... he's arrived.\r\n\r\n          INT. RIVERWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop stands in front of a moving riverway, his body\r\n          sheathed in a black slicksuit, backpack on. He slips into\r\n          the water and starts to SWIM.\r\n          We STAY with Bishop as he SWIMS HARD, powerfully, not tiring.\r\n          Finally, we PULL AWAY, across miles of water, realizing this\r\n          is what Bishop will swim without stopping.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A pair of ARMED SECURITY patrol a wooded shore. One lifts a\r\n          pair of binoculars, scans the shore as BEHIND THEM, a form\r\n          moves from behind a tree, blends into the woods.\r\n          ON BISHOP. Moving fast, silent, towards a LIT STRUCTURE in\r\n          the distance...\r\n\r\n          INT. HIDEAWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          BLACK. The SENSE that someone is in here with us...\r\n          A LOW GREEN GLOW illuminates Bishop in a TINY, CRAMPED,\r\n          COMPARTMENT. No way to know what or where. The glow, coming\r\n          from his watch, illuminates his face, crammed and\r\n          claustrophobic. An eye checks the time, the light goes out.\r\n          Just the sound of his breathing...\r\n\r\n          EXT. SPORTS CLUB WOODS - MORNING\r\n\r\n          CRACK! CRACK! PLUMES OF SMOKE rise from the end of vintage\r\n          hunting rifles. Game birds scatter into the air. Dogs BARK,\r\n          tear through underbrush. MEN dressed in traditional hunting\r\n          livery move through foggy woods, followed by STEWARDS.\r\n          This is old school hunting, old school weapons. Camera finds\r\n          The Mark, raising his weapon, sights... BLAM! A PHEASANT\r\n          falls, dogs race after it. The Mark starts forward but is\r\n          interrupted by his Steward reminding him to break his weapon\r\n          as the other hunters have.\r\n          The Mark pushes the man back, ignoring him, hurrying on. At\r\n          a small distance, two unhappy private security guards follow.\r\n\r\n          INT. HIDEAWAY - NO TIME\r\n\r\n          BLACKNESS. A soft BEEPING, almost inaudible. A low rustle\r\n          of cloth, then the green glow illuminates Bishop's face as he\r\n          checks the time again. Hasn't moved in HOURS.\r\n\r\n          EXT. SPORTS CLUB WOODS - MORNING\r\n\r\n          The Mark stumbles forward, over-eager to get to his prize.\r\n          He's worked his way ahead of the field. The MIST has grown\r\n          thicker. Human forms move on all sides, hard to distinguish.\r\n          CRACK! CRACK! Guns go off around them. Dogs rush by. The\r\n          Mark brings the weapon to his face... BLAM!! The shot echoes\r\n          through the foggy woods.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n\r\n          INT. SPORTING CLUB - DAY\r\n\r\n          The Mark, pleased with himself as always, bursts into the\r\n          lodge, gun over his shoulder. A round of APPLAUSE as his\r\n          Steward holds up the morning's catch.\r\n          He pushes on into the locker rooms as one security takes\r\n          station at the door. The second emerges from the lockers,\r\n          having just done his sweep.\r\n\r\n          INT. LOCKER ROOM, SPORTING CLUB - DAY\r\n\r\n          The Mark leans his vintage hunting rifle against the wall,\r\n          opens his locker. He kicks off his boots, pulls off his\r\n          shirt. Takes a second to rub his face with his hands. It\r\n          can be exhausting being him.\r\n          Behind the Mark, a locker door opens and closes. Like a\r\n          ghost did it. He doesn't sense a thing, reaches for his\r\n          weapon, accidentally knocks it to the side. It LANDS, HARD.\r\n          The Mark WINCES, half expecting it to fire. But no.\r\n          He starts to lean down for it when another man's gloved hands\r\n          reach it first. The Mark smiles down at the well-dressed man\r\n          crouched by the gun, a little confused.\r\n          Bishop looks up, smiles back. He puts out a gloved hand.\r\n          Before the Mark can consider, he's taken Bishop's hand.\r\n          Bishop holds tight. The Mark's smile... fades.\r\n          Even though we know it's coming, Bishop's actions are so fast\r\n          and final we're taken by surprise. He PULLS the Mark in as\r\n          at the same time he cocks the rifle's hammer, slams the gun\r\n          into position, barrel pointed up and BOOM!\r\n          The shot hits the Mark in the face, obliterates him, sends a\r\n          plume of gore up against the ceiling.\r\n          One, two seconds before the Mark's SECURITY rush into the\r\n          room, guns lined. First sees the mess, puts a hand to his\r\n          mouth. Second starts on the radio.\r\n          The room is empty.\r\n\r\n          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          A vintage 1972 Shelby Cobra parked by the edge of the river.\r\n          Bishop emerges from the water, pops the trunk of the car.\r\n          Towel and large rock inside. He towels off, tosses the suit\r\n          and the rock into his pack, pack goes into the river. He\r\n          grabs a sweater from inside the trunk.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S CAR - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Bishop gets behind the wheel, dressed. He checks himself in\r\n          the rearview, finds a bead of sweat traveling from his brow.\r\n          Wipes it away, irritated, and starts the car.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LOCAL GROCERY - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Establishing. A quaint local convenience store off a two-\r\n          lane road, nestled amidst trees. Bishop's vintage car pulls\r\n          up and he gets out.\r\n\r\n          INT. LOCAL GROCERY - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Door jingles as Bishop steps in, smiles to the GROCER, a\r\n          friendly beefy guy in his 60's who checks the clock. 7:00 on\r\n          the nose.\r\n\r\n                         GROCER\r\n          'Evening, Arthur. Got your weekly\r\n          right here.\r\n          The man hoists two bags of groceries onto the counter.\r\n          Bishop comes forward, sees the Owner's DAUGHTER behind the\r\n          counter. 12, precocious, reading a dog-eared kid's book.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Hey, Sophie. I got something for\r\n          you, wanna see?\r\n          The girl smiles, puts down the book and comes over. Bishop\r\n          crouches in front of her. He puts out two empty hands, shows\r\n          them back and front, then tickles one ear with a hand while\r\n          the other \"appears\" a small daisy.\r\n          The girl sees it, smiles... a little disappointed.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm just kidding.\r\n          Bishop reaches into his jacket, pulls out the next\r\n          installment in the kid's book she's reading: A series\r\n          featuring a young female Harry-Potter like character on the\r\n          cover: LUNA CROMWELL.\r\n          Sophie BEAMS, takes it. A quick hug and she's back to her\r\n          seat, opening the new book.\r\n\r\n                         GROCER\r\n          What do you say, honey?\r\n\r\n                         SOPHIE\r\n          Thank you, Bishop.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          6.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You're very welcome.\r\n          And she's back into the book. Bishop smiles, a little sad.\r\n          It was nice... but the moment's over. He stands and collects\r\n          his groceries.\r\n\r\n                         GROCER\r\n          See you next week, Arthur.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING\r\n\r\n          A ranch-style compound, nestled in the hills. Warm, rustic,\r\n          and inviting.\r\n          Bishop's Cobra drives past the MAIN HOUSE, a large craftsman,\r\n          into a BARN where he parks next to a collection of other\r\n          beautiful vintage cars. He gets out, crosses the dirt drive\r\n          towards his home. A STUDIO separate from the main house.\r\n          Two horses graze in an attached paddock.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Bishop's enters, flicking on lights. The home is beautiful,\r\n          ordered. Everything a model of design and elegance. The\r\n          walls are home to a collection of original and slightly\r\n          sociopathic art. Lucian Freud, de Chirico, Zak Smith,\r\n          Francis Bacon. Isolation, beauty, unrest...\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S KITCHEN - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Bishop unpacks his groceries. Organic. Raw. Supplements.\r\n          Vitamins. Nothing looks delicious. His fridge is ordered.\r\n          Glass containers in rows, lightly hued liquids in each.\r\n          He opens a can of Friskies, sets it down for a mutt-like\r\n          tabby-cat who lopes over and eats. Bishop scratches her\r\n          behind the ears.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Bishop flicks on lights illuminating the WALL covered with\r\n          charts, documents, photographs of the Mark.\r\n          He goes to a gas fireplace built into the side of the room,\r\n          fires up the flames. A sideboard holds a collection of Vinyl\r\n          Albums. Mint condition, collector. Fingers play over\r\n          titles... Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Bob Dylan...\r\n          The turntable needle hits Young's \"Needle and the Damage\r\n          Done.\" Music croons sweet into the room as pages, photos,\r\n          everything goes into the fire.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          7.\r\n          One photo in particular: The Mark, busy on the phone as a\r\n          young girl pulls at his suit jacket. He was a criminal\r\n          bastard, but also a father.\r\n          Bishop stares down at the picture, consumed by fire,\r\n          reflected in his eyes.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S GYM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop, running on a treadmill, full-tilt. A controlled\r\n          sprint without end. The gym has all manner of customized\r\n          exercise equipment. Weights, machines, a climbing wall, an\r\n          infinite lap-pool.\r\n          Bishop jumps off the treadmill, immediately takes his pulse,\r\n          checks it against a clock on the wall, jots a note.\r\n          Bishop, pressing weights. 300+ pounds. Reps over and over,\r\n          Muscles HARD, STRAINING. In his eyes, almost a relaxed\r\n          intensity. The rest of the world, turned off.\r\n          Bishop RACKS the weights, LOUD. Immediately taking his\r\n          pulse, checking the clock...\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S GYM - LATER\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits at a small desk, plotting the evening's work-out\r\n          in a book. He traces columns, enters points on a graph.\r\n          THE BOOK. Doesn't matter how impressive the numbers are,\r\n          they've peaked and are now starting their inevitable slide...\r\n          ON BISHOP. Staring at the book.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishops stands in front of his phone. He scrolls through the\r\n          last ten calls that have come through. They all read\r\n          \"McKenna, Harry.\" Over and over. Three days' worth.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop eats dinner, alone at the end of a beautiful antique\r\n          table. Hanging on the wall across from him, a vivid\r\n          disturbing painting of three women.\r\n          ON HIS PLATE. His food is a meal we might expect an\r\n          astronaut to eat. Raw Spinach, a collection of supplements.\r\n          He crunches through something that looks like cardboard,\r\n          chews, stares at the painting. In his study, the phone\r\n          rings. He eyeballs it, lets it ring.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          8.\r\n\r\n          INT. DEN, BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits on the couch in front of the television, his cat\r\n          curls under his arm, purring. Bishop flips channels through\r\n          an endless display of over-amped human behavior. People HAW\r\n          and WINK in the sitcoms, people YELL on the talk-shows,\r\n          people CRY and LUST on the dramas. Flip. Flip.\r\n          A news channel shows a PICTURE of The Mark. \"Billionaire tech\r\n          mogul dead in tragic accident.\" Two ANCHORS discuss...\r\n\r\n          MALE NEWS ANCHOR\r\n          ...here's a guy at the top of his\r\n          game. And yes there were questions\r\n          about the money: Where did it all\r\n          go. Were some of his friends less\r\n          than friendly to the US? But in\r\n          the end, it's not the feds who\r\n          catch up with him --\r\n\r\n          FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR\r\n          It's that age old adage that boys\r\n          will be boys. These dangerous\r\n          hobbies come with the risk of\r\n          accidents like this --\r\n          Bishops punches off the tv, heads for the door.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGH-END APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop pulls up in his car, looks up. Hundred of lit windows\r\n          above him, lives going on behind each. He heads forward, the\r\n          doorman holding the door for him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORRIDOR, HIGH-RISE - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Bishop gets out of the elevator, stops in front of a door.\r\n          Beat. He rings the bell.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n\r\n                         (FROM INSIDE)\r\n          It's open!\r\n          Bishop pushes the door open, steps into...\r\n\r\n          INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Beautifully, warmly furnished. Sofas surround a living area,\r\n          a gas fire flickering. Throws and rugs. Art on the walls,\r\n          tasteful and human. An open bottle of wine on a granite\r\n          counter top.\r\n          THE VIEW. Over all the city, thousands of lights twinkle.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          9.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n          I'll just be a minute.\r\n          We catch a GLIMPSE of the WOMAN. A towel over her hair,\r\n          wearing a skirt and a bra, crossing from the bathroom into\r\n          her bedroom. Even in the small glimpse, she's beautiful.\r\n          Bishop looks down at a coffee table. Magazines, newspaper.\r\n          A picture of the first Mark's elaborate funeral.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I'm sorry I was away so long this\r\n          time. I had some complications...\r\n          He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom. 30's. Long dark\r\n          hair, damp from the shower. Buttoning a shirt, the curve of\r\n          her breasts caught as she does. A comfortable, sophisticated\r\n          air about her. Effortlessly attractive.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n          You don't have to apologize. I'm\r\n          just glad you're here now.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Are you hungry?\r\n          She starts to move by him, his hand catches her arm and she\r\n          is in his arms, holding him TIGHT, kissing him.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm sorry. I just... miss you. I\r\n          never thought I was going to be a\r\n          \"woman who waits.\" But I do. I\r\n          wait for you.\r\n          He nods. She breaks off, pours red wine in a glass.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Were you in Europe? Africa?\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Was there another woman?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          No.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n          Liar. It's alright. I don't mind.\r\n          (Suddenly shifting gears)\r\n          I... I made something for you.\r\n          She picks up a remote, fire up a large flatscreen TV. Hits a\r\n          button. A moment, then an IMAGE flickers to life.\r\n          ON THE TV: The WOMAN, sitting in this same living room. She\r\n          wears a long sleeve shirt over panties. Sips a glass of\r\n          wine. Smiles warm at the camera. The silence of late night.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          10.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN ON CAMERA\r\n          Hey, you. Just got back from the\r\n          weekend at the lake with Julianne\r\n          and Barry and their kids. Their\r\n          oldest is five. You'd like him.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Everybody spoke about you, of\r\n          course. We should go up there\r\n          sometime, just the two of us...\r\n          ON THE TV: She reaches towards the camera and the image\r\n          JUMPS AHEAD. Another night, late. The WOMAN enters the\r\n          frame, now wearing a stunning black party dress.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN ON CAMERA (CONT'D)\r\n          (announcing, giggling)\r\n          I, just got back from seeing the\r\n          most boring opening at the Pierre\r\n          Grochet gallery. And of course\r\n          everyone's asking where you are and\r\n          of course I made your apologies,\r\n          but what I was thinking...\r\n          ON THE TV: She winks at the camera, happily drunk. Raises\r\n          her dress a little, suggestive...\r\n\r\n          WOMAN ON CAMERA (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (WHISPER)\r\n          Why weren't you here to take me\r\n          home and make love to me...?\r\n          She blows a kiss. Closes her eyes...\r\n          ON BISHOP: Watching. Emotion breaks the surface.\r\n          The WOMAN raises the remote. Turns off the image. Looks at\r\n          Bishop. Plain, not demanding. But caring.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I'm not a man who... It wouldn't\r\n          be good for you, if I was around\r\n          all the time.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n          I know. I know.\r\n          She moves to him and they are kissing fierce.\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM, HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop and the woman make love. She's the aggressor at\r\n          first, pulling away Bishop's clothing, climbing on top of\r\n          him, pulling her own clothes away...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          11.\r\n          Bishop grabs the woman who LAUGHS in ecstacy. He reverses\r\n          her, throwing her down on the bed, climbing on top. The two\r\n          of them, eye to eye as they fuck...\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM, HIGH RISE APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Early morning light filters into the room. Bishop, awake,\r\n          staring at the sleeping woman. His eyes click over to the\r\n          clock which reaches 6:00 am. As if he's been waiting, Bishop\r\n          rises and dresses, silently.\r\n\r\n          INT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop stands in front of the plate glass windows. He turns\r\n          and moves to a music box on a shelf, opens it. A melancholy\r\n          tune plays. He admires the machinery as he removes twenty\r\n          $100 bills from his wallet, tucks them under the box...\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n          Stay for breakfast?\r\n          He turns. She's standing in the doorway, tying a robe around\r\n          herself. A cool professionalism inhabits her demeanor. Not\r\n          crass or mean-spirited, but the romance is gone.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Do I ever?\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n          No. But there's a first time for\r\n          everything.\r\n          Bishop goes to the DVD player, slots out the DVD they watched\r\n          the night before and pockets it.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Thank you. This was a good one.\r\n          See you next time.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n          Bishop... You all right?\r\n          He turns, studies her. This is new ground. He nods and\r\n          leaves. She stares a moment at the door after he's gone.\r\n\r\n          EXT. WOODS - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop, running. Full-tilt again, a maintained sprint. He\r\n          maneuvers through trees, over rocks. Below him, through the\r\n          woods, his home comes into view...\r\n          ... a BLACK BENTLEY sits parked in front of the house. A MAN\r\n          on a cell phone stands by it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          12.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          The man wears a mid-level suit, a hired professional.\r\n\r\n                         MAN\r\n          (into a phone)\r\n          Yes, I just got here. No, not yet.\r\n          He turns, REACTS as Bishop is there, CLOSE, barely sweating.\r\n\r\n          MAN (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (INTO PHONE)\r\n          Hold on, I got him.\r\n          The man holds his cell phone out for Bishop. A beat, Bishop\r\n          studying the angles... he takes the phone.\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (O.S.)\r\n          Arthur? Jesus Christ, Arthur, is\r\n          that you?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          ...How are you, Harry?\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (O.S.)\r\n          Oh you know, I'm God Damn perfect.\r\n          I'm redecorating my fucking office\r\n          and I wanted your advice on the god\r\n          forsaken curtains is how I am.\r\n          (beat, serious)\r\n          This is... this is something,\r\n          Arthur. I need to see you, for old\r\n          time's sake.\r\n\r\n          INT. BENTLEY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits in the back, looks out at the city moving around\r\n          them as the man drives. They approach the armored gates of a\r\n          business tower: MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. The driver nods at\r\n          SECURITY who recognize the car, open the gate. The car drops\r\n          down into the garage under the building.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Bishop and the man exit the Bentley. Four more ARMED\r\n          SECURITY down here, seated around a table, eating delivery\r\n          from a local Deli. Two stand, one steps forward.\r\n\r\n                         SECURITY\r\n          Sorry, gotta do this...\r\n          Patient, Bishop puts his arms out as the man searches him.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          13.\r\n\r\n          INT. MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. - DAY\r\n\r\n          Bishop steps out of the elevator into a top-level wonderland\r\n          of money manipulation. Desks, crushed with monitors, manned\r\n          by casually brilliant MIT-grads. Flat screens track the\r\n          markets. All of this overseen by a witch's tit of a MANAGER\r\n          who eyeballs Bishop coolly.\r\n          A tapping gets Bishop's attention. The corner office is\r\n          glass-walled. HARRY MCKENNA is tapping on it, gesturing\r\n          Bishop inside.\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          The office is high-tech. Harry less so. 60's. Overweight\r\n          and doesn't give a shit. Cigars in a ashtray, ash-burns on\r\n          the Persian rugs. A man to be reckoned with, in his time.\r\n          The time has perhaps passed.\r\n          Harry comes out from behind his desk, points Bishop to a big\r\n          leather sofa. Bishop perches on the arm.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I like the new digs.\r\n          McKenna LAUGHS, like a grunt. Fiddles with his hearing aid,\r\n          turning it up. Bishop's eyes track.\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          Has it really been that long?\r\n          Jesus.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          You know how they say youth is lost\r\n          on the young? They're right. If I\r\n          had my nineteen year old body back,\r\n          I wouldn't be here, I'll tell you\r\n          that. I'd be out there, making it\r\n          my personal life mission to bang\r\n          every stewardess who ever dared put\r\n          on one of those whatchamacallit\r\n          skirts.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Times have changed, Harry. They\r\n          don't wear skirts anymore.\r\n          McKenna eyeballs Bishop, shakes his head. He goes to the\r\n          glass wall, points out at the screens, financial markets.\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          You know what all that is?\r\n          (off Bishop's nod)\r\n          That's their money, getting moved,\r\n          exchanged. Made clean and neat and\r\n          proper for Uncle Sam. And I have\r\n          always been extremely careful.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          14.\r\n          McKenna goes to his desk, tosses legal papers on the table\r\n          between them.\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          You know what that is? That's a\r\n          God damn subpoena from the Justice\r\n          Department. We get a new face in\r\n          the white house, all of a sudden\r\n          they want to look at my records.\r\n          They got accountants want to go\r\n          through MY BOOKS. Are you kidding\r\n          me? I got the left hand coming\r\n          after me for what I did for the\r\n          right hand.\r\n          Bishop looks over the papers, nods.\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          So I call them up. I say \"hey, you\r\n          guys gotta get your own house in\r\n          order...\"\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          And...\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          And? And that's the point!\r\n          Nothing. I tell them they have a\r\n          problem here and instead of dealing\r\n          with it I get silence, zippo, fuck-\r\n          all. What are they, twelve?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          ...I don't see how I can --\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          That's bullshit, Arthur. Your\r\n          father -- they still talk about the\r\n          guy like he walked on water. You,\r\n          they'll listen to. You --\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I'm not a part of that.\r\n          McKenna stares out the window at the street below, nervous.\r\n          Shakes a pill out of as small vial, pops it. He chuckles,\r\n          shakes his head.\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          You remember that fishing trip we\r\n          all took, back in the day. You\r\n          were, what? About eight, right?\r\n          (Off Bishop's nod)\r\n          You fell out of the boat...\r\n          couldn't swim a stroke. City kid.\r\n          (Animated, laughing)\r\n          You're in the water, splashing\r\n          around.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          15.\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          You got these big eyes like\r\n          saucers, like you're sure you're\r\n          gonna drown. Splashing...\r\n          swallowing water... just STARING at\r\n          your father and he's not making a\r\n          move. Remember? Just looking down\r\n          at you like...\r\n          Suddenly it's gotten less funny.\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          I finally had to grab you by the\r\n          hair, pull you back into the boat.\r\n          You're shivering like hell and he --\r\n          your dad -- gives one of those\r\n          laughs. Those big laughs everyone\r\n          loved him for.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Anyway, the whole time you're in\r\n          the water, you didn't cry out. Not\r\n          once. You were a tough\r\n          sonofabitch, even then.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          That was a long time ago, Harry.\r\n          McKenna turns from the window, takes in all his monitors,\r\n          charts. Stock lines tick up and down, graphs flow, pulse...\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          Well, I'm in the water this time,\r\n          Arthur. You think it's easy for me\r\n          to ask? It cuts like hell. But\r\n          that's what I'm doing.\r\n          Bishop eyes the barely open doorway into a small room off the\r\n          office. Pillows and blankets on a sofa. Some clothes strewn\r\n          about. McKenna's been sleeping here.\r\n          A long beat. Bishop... nods. The tension seems to DRAIN\r\n          from McKenna. He claps Bishop on the back, nods back.\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          ...Thank you. Thank you.\r\n          THROUGH THE GLASS WALL OF THE OFFICE. Bishop's eyes track as\r\n          elevator doors open and STEVE MCKENNA steps out, a beautiful\r\n          young woman with him, LOUISE. She's a trophy, the woman you\r\n          get for being top dog and the one you regret getting.\r\n          Gorgeous, self-obsessed, entitled. She flops onto a leather\r\n          sofa as Steve moves towards the office.\r\n          Steve's young, mid-20's, strikingly handsome, wearing the\r\n          casual uniform of wealth not earned. But there's something\r\n          else that arrests Bishop immediately. Unwasted motion,\r\n          detachment, observing the world around him... from above.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          16.\r\n          Even as Steve nods to one of his father's security and pushes\r\n          into the room, he picks up Bishop. The two men lock eyes, a\r\n          strange reflection not of appearance, but of nature.\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          And here's the prodigal son,\r\n          arrived to bilk me for ransom.\r\n\r\n                         (TO STEVE)\r\n          Steve, this is Arthur Bishop.\r\n          Steve shakes Bishop's hand.

PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Bishop exits the elevator. Security holds the door to the\r\n          Bentley open for him. Bishop shakes his head, walks out.\r\n\r\n          INT. ARTIST'S STUDIO - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Bishop exits an old freight elevator, enters this HUGE loft\r\n          space. Old architecture divided by free-standing walls hung\r\n          with PAINTINGS from the same artist who's work hangs in\r\n          Bishop's home. Intense, slightly surreal, deeply haunting.\r\n          Nudes, raw. Men's faces, distraught, alone.\r\n          A matronly ART DEALER comes forward familiar, takes his hand.\r\n\r\n                         ART DEALER\r\n          Arthur. Glad you're here. Right\r\n          this way.\r\n          As they move across the space Bishop catches sight of a\r\n          MODEL, lying nude in a pool of blue paint. Across from her,\r\n          The ARTIST is full-focused on her. He's roughly Bishop's\r\n          age. Cigarette dangles off a lip, tattoos on his arms.\r\n          Fully comfortable and committed to the alternative life.\r\n          The model senses Bishop's gaze, looks over, unashamed.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          19.\r\n\r\n          ART DEALER (CONT'D)\r\n          This way.\r\n          Bishop follows the Dealer into another area where they\r\n          approach a canvas. It's a portrait of a young boy, alone.\r\n          The effect is of rage-filled isolation.\r\n\r\n          ART DEALER (CONT'D)\r\n          Zak is almost finished. It will\r\n          make a wonderful addition to your\r\n          collection.\r\n          Bishop looks at the canvas. Nods. Glances back to where the\r\n          artist is carefully adjusting his model's position.\r\n\r\n          ART DEALER (CONT'D)\r\n          Do you want to meet him?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          ...No.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop enters his home, sets his things down. Stares at his\r\n          phone a beat, then on impulse picks it up and dials. The\r\n          voice that answers is female, official.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n          Good evening, Mr. Bishop. How can\r\n          I help you?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Yes. I'd like to speak to Dean.\r\n          There's a brief pause on the phone, then.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n          ...Mr. Dean is not available right\r\n          now. Can I take a message?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          No. Just tell him I called.\r\n          Bishop hangs up, stares at the phone.\r\n          The doorbell rings. Bishop opens it to find a DHL COURIER on\r\n          his doorstep. Bishop is suddenly casual, friendly. The\r\n          public face of Bishop.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          Hello, Don. They make you drive\r\n          all the way out here this evening?\r\n\r\n                         DON\r\n          That's the job.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          20.\r\n          The man gestures to the open barn door, the classic cars.\r\n\r\n          DON (CONT'D)\r\n          You find tires for that old\r\n          FleetMaster?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n\r\n                         (SIGNING)\r\n          No, not yet.

Good night, Arthur.\r\n          The man heads back towards his truck. Bishop tears away the\r\n          strip that seals the envelope, a small USB jump-drive slides\r\n          into his hands. The friendly grin on Bishop's face...\r\n          evaporates.\r\n\r\n          INT. STUDY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop fires up a computer hooked to a printer. He slots the\r\n          USB drive into the computer. Nothing seems to happen, just a\r\n          low pulsing red light on the drive.\r\n          Almost instantly, his phone rings and he answers. Silence.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n\r\n                         (INTO PHONE)\r\n          We should all be so lucky.\r\n          Click. The phone goes dead. Almost at the same time, the\r\n          glowing red light on the jump-drive turns GREEN.\r\n          Bishop's PRINTER fires up. It starts printing out pages. A\r\n          few medical charts... and then a photograph: Harry McKenna.\r\n          The new mark.\r\n\r\n          INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop eats. Lost in thought. Eyes play over his art...\r\n\r\n          INT. STUDY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop hits the study, work-mode. All hesitation gone.\r\n          Pages are tacked up, other ripped down and tossed. He takes\r\n          out a thick pen, circles words: \"Syncope cardiac spasms...\"\r\n          \"Prognosis...\" \"Poor eustachian tube function...\"\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          21.\r\n\r\n          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits at a desk under a reading lamp, making notes out\r\n          of a stack of books. Medical textbooks. Charts. A diagram\r\n          of the central nervous system. Stress tests. The technical\r\n          specs for an electronic device.\r\n\r\n          INT. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Bishop receives a SET OF PLANS from an attendant. Spreads\r\n          them out over a counter. In the corner, a large photocopier.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits at his desk, a Jeweler's Loup over one eye,\r\n          working with soldering iron and electronic tools, meticulous.\r\n          Behind him, tacked to the wall, are copies of the building\r\n          plans. Heavily inked. Routes in and out penned in.\r\n          Locations of security. Photographs. He's done his recon.\r\n          Sitting in the sun on a window ledge: an open jar of\r\n          Mayonnaise, turning rancid. A fly buzzes around it.\r\n          THROUGH THE JEWELER'S LOUP: Bishop is working on a hearing\r\n          aide. Tweezers adjust a tiny chip, slot it into place...\r\n          Phone rings. Bishop eyes it for a beat. Snaps it up. The\r\n          voice on the other end is world weary, professional. DEAN.\r\n\r\n          DEAN (O.S.)\r\n          Bishop. I heard you called. Hey,\r\n          you get the stuff I sent you?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          That's what I called about. I know\r\n          him.

Bishop stares at his\r\n          work in front of him, his research on McKenna tacked to the\r\n          wall. Dean's voice comes back as suddenly as it departed.\r\n\r\n          DEAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)\r\n          No, it's been decided. This one's\r\n          a go. You take care of yourself,\r\n          Bishop.\r\n          The line goes dead. Bishop stares at the phone for a second,\r\n          sets it down. He looks up at Harry's picture on the wall.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          22.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

The SOUND OF\r\n          A PHONE RINGING, being picked up.\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA'S VOICE\r\n          Hello?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP'S VOICE\r\n          They want to talk.

DELI - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop hangs up his phone, watches as three bags of food are\r\n          put up on the TO GO counter. \"McKenna Garage\" scrawled.\r\n          Bishop approaches the counter, reaches over the bags for his\r\n          own food, pushing his drink onto the floor.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I'm sorry. My bad.\r\n          The guy at the counter shrugs, turns for a mop. Bishop\r\n          quickly reaches into the McKenna bag, switches a wrapped\r\n          sandwich for one he brought.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. - DAY\r\n\r\n          A white van passes the entrance to the underground garage,\r\n          pulls into the Alley behind the building and stops.\r\n\r\n          INT. WHITE VAN - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Bishop kills the engine, pushes aside a curtain and heads\r\n          into the back of the van which is empty aside for a heavy\r\n          acetylene torch. The bottom of the van is covered by a thick\r\n          black matt which Bishop kicks with his foot.\r\n          The matt falls aside revealing a large HOLE in the bottom of\r\n          the van, right down to the pavement and the welded steel\r\n          cover Bishop has parked on top of.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          23.\r\n          Bishop picks up the torch, SPARKS IT.\r\n\r\n          INT.

ELEVATOR LOBBY, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. - DAY\r\n\r\n          Elevator doors open. Another SECURITY GUARD steps out,\r\n          checks in by radio and heads down a corridor.\r\n          IN THE ELEVATOR behind him, Bishop drops through the ceiling\r\n          hatch, dressed casual. He hits a button, doors close.\r\n\r\n          INT. MCKENNA'S OFFICE - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Elevator doors open and Bishop steps out into the office.\r\n          Deserted. Monitors glow, tracking markets and trades. But\r\n          the human element is gone.\r\n          Except for Harry, alone, silhouetted at one of his large\r\n          plate windows, watching the sun rise over the city.\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          You ever wonder what the last day\r\n          of your life will feel like,\r\n          Arthur?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You keep standing next to that\r\n          window, maybe you'll be able to\r\n          tell me.\r\n          McKenna looks over, smiles weary. He looks exhausted. He\r\n          goes to his desk, picks up a tie, looks to Bishop.\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          This turns out alright, I'm going\r\n          to send you a dozen Thai hookers\r\n          and a case of Cuban Esplandidos.\r\n          You can return the hookers if you\r\n          want, but the cigars...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          24.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n\r\n                         (SMILING)\r\n          I don't smoke.\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          You will, my friend.

Bishop studies McKenna... then, casually:\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Why the change of security?\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          ...What?\r\n          Beat. Bishop SLAPS the STOP button. Elevator jerks to a\r\n          halt. Bishop gets a finger into the doors, PRIES them open.\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          Arthur...?\r\n          McKenna looks at the effort, sighs. Lets Bishop help him\r\n          down. Halfway through, BALANCE SHIFTS, McKenna starts to\r\n          fall. Bishop STEADIES him. McKenna STARES at Bishop,\r\n          concerned. Bishop nods, heading towards the STAIRS,\r\n          pocketing a small hearing aide as he goes.\r\n          ON MCKENNA, touching the hearing aide in his ear...\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Come on...\r\n\r\n          INT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Bishop and McKenna reach the bottom of the stairwell.\r\n          McKenna's winded, steadying himself against a wall. Bishop\r\n          cracks the door, peers out.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          What the hell...?\r\n          McKenna moves in, pushes Bishop aside.\r\n          MCKENNA'S P.O.V.: His SECURITY. Only there are two new\r\n          faces in the garage.

I know what I'm\r\n          doing.\r\n          And Bishop slips out the door, shutting it behind him.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          The moment he's out, he turns and sinks down in front of it,\r\n          blocking it with his back. He opens his jacket, brings out a\r\n          small TRANSMITTER. Waits a beat, then flicks a switch.\r\n\r\n          INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          McKenna there, STARING at the door. Nothing. He approaches\r\n          the steel door, tries the handle. Can't open it. Nervous,\r\n          he carefully puts his head against the door to listen...\r\n          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The SOUND OF GUNFIRE, VOICES fill\r\n          McKenna's ears. He staggers back, crouched, terrified...\r\n          CLOSE ON HIS HEARING AIDE: The sounds of gunfire is coming\r\n          from it. BLAM! BLAM! More shots, then the sound of\r\n          POUNDING on the door.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP'S VOICE\r\n          Harry! It's a trap! RUN!!!\r\n          The door flies opens and Bishop LURCHES IN, gun raised.\r\n          McKenna starts up the stairs, breathing hard. Behind him, he\r\n          can see Bishop, gun lined back at the door. BLAM! BLAM!\r\n          Gunshots assault his eardrums.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          On the other side of the door, Security hears the door slam,\r\n          looks over for a moment, but there's nothing else.\r\n\r\n          INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          McKenna picks up the pace, hauling himself upwards. Sweat\r\n          POURING off him, eyes wild. He stops, tries to catch his\r\n          breath. Shooting PAIN through his right arm, he grabs it\r\n          just as MORE GUNFIRE SOUNDS from below.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          26.\r\n          Bishop comes rushing up the stairs. His shirt stained with\r\n          blood. Gun in his hand.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Come on! If we can get to the roof\r\n          I can hold them off! Come on!\r\n          McKenna GULPS AIR, staggers on...\r\n\r\n          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Door BLOWS open, McKenna staggers onto the rooftop. The\r\n          manic victory of having made it clashing with the tragic\r\n          knowledge that his heart is rebelling.\r\n          He falls to his knees, clutching his right arm. PAIN\r\n          coursing through his body. Unaware for the moment that\r\n          everything has gone silent.\r\n          FEET come into his view. He looks up, sees Bishop standing\r\n          over him. Bishop's face is a death mask. Emotion removed.\r\n          Harry stares into his eyes... and understands.\r\n\r\n                         MCKENNA\r\n          ...You.\r\n          Bishop nods. McKenna CACKLES which turns into a scream as\r\n          PAIN sends him reeling. He falls, hitting his head. Blood\r\n          rolls down his face.\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          You bastard. You... Sonofabitch.\r\n          You didn't have the balls... The\r\n          balls to AARRRGHHHH!\r\n          He CONVULSES. Tears stream down his face. His body HEAVING,\r\n          not giving up the ghost.\r\n          ON BISHOP. We know it's in there. But it doesn't show.\r\n          Instead he checks his watch, calculates time...\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh God. Oh, Jesus Christ help me.\r\n\r\n          ARRGHHHH!!! ARRRRGHHHHHH!!!!\r\n          Please... Please... Please...\r\n          McKenna stops struggling, stares up at Bishop. Tears\r\n          streaming down his face.\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          Please, Arthur, put me out of my\r\n          misery. Your father...\r\n          Bishop checks his watch again, doesn't meet McKenna's eyes.\r\n          Checks the stair door, looks over the building edge...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          27.\r\n\r\n          MCKENNA (CONT'D)\r\n          Please. I'm scared. I'm really\r\n          god damn scared...\r\n          Suddenly Bishop MOVES. Lightening fast, wrapping up\r\n          McKenna's head, fingers PRESSING expertly along arteries.\r\n          McKenna STARES UP one horrible second, then goes limp in his\r\n          arms, dead.\r\n          Bishop releases, stands, stares down. For the first time,\r\n          uncertainty in his face. Why did he do that? He looks at\r\n          the body, at his hands, out at the city. Wipes his forehead\r\n          with the back of a hand, furious at himself.\r\n          He reaches down, removes the hearing aide from McKenna's ear,\r\n          replaces it with the original, turns away.\r\n          SEEN FROM FAR ABOVE. McKenna's body, alone on the rooftop.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Bishop nods thanks, turns and leaves.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Steve stares down at his dead father. A COP draws a line\r\n          around the body. Steve is expressionless.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop backs off from the wall where he has just hung the new\r\n          painting of the boy. It stares back at him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Blue-gray morning. Cold wind blows across the rooftop.\r\n          Steve watches the last police leave. He's alone.

A few dozen attendees.\r\n          At the front, Steve McKenna sits in front of his father's\r\n          coffin, cold. His girlfriend Louise next to him, weeping.\r\n          She cries at funerals.\r\n          Bishop stands at the back. His eyes scan over the\r\n          proceedings. Sixth-sense, Steve suddenly turns his head,\r\n          makes eye contact with Bishop.\r\n\r\n                         PRIEST\r\n          His good works comfort all of us,\r\n          even in his going.

Give me\r\n          a ride home?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          29.\r\n          Bishop nods to the head limo where Louise is waving\r\n          impatiently at Steve to come.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Looks like you have one.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Yeah, all of that. Empty limos.\r\n          Fake guests. All so that the\r\n          papers print what an important and\r\n          respected man Harry was.\r\n          Steve takes in the one or two guests, already counting their\r\n          money a few yards away. Shakes his head.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Well, I hope it's what Harry would\r\n          have wanted. But it's not for me.\r\n          Beat. Bishop nods.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S CAR - DAY\r\n\r\n          Bishop steers the car into the hills, past high-end estates.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You know, what I don't get is you.\r\n          Harry didn't have any friends.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Your dad worked with my father a\r\n          long time ago.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          So?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          So, just paying my respects.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          So your old man was into all that?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n\r\n                         (SMALL NOD)\r\n          Yeah, he was into all that.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Well, that is refreshingly honest,\r\n          Mr. Bishop. What about you?\r\n          Bishop doesn't answer, steers the car up a manicured drive.\r\n          P.O.V. - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: An ESTATE. A main house,\r\n          lawns, pools, guest houses.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          30.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Steve and Bishop get out of the car. The McKenna estate was\r\n          modeled neoclassical for a wanna-be emperor. Now a week of\r\n          youth with limitless credit has left its mark. A SOUND\r\n          SYSTEM has been set up poolside. A DJ spins a trance-like\r\n          deep groove. YOUNG WOMEN lounge around the pool in bikinis,\r\n          less. Beautiful and bored. YOUNG MEN, most dressed modern\r\n          hip-hop, mostly white, eyeball the women, fist-bump each\r\n          other, drink beers.\r\n          Steve takes the whole thing in, nods, somehow pleased.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Why is it so comforting, when\r\n          people surpass even our lowest\r\n          expectations?\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Come on in, meet the crowd.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          No, thanks. I've got to --\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Please. A favor to me. None of\r\n          these people even remembered what\r\n          today was.\r\n          Bishop nods. They move into the scene. People recognize\r\n          Steve, hug or bump-fists. Steve's friendly, but stays locked\r\n          on Bishop. Bishop observes it all, not uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Do you believe in fate, Mr. Bishop?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Why?\r\n          A basketball hoop has been set up near the pool. Young men\r\n          take turns dunking and then landing in the water.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          I think maybe we're all doomed to\r\n          become our fathers. I'll probably\r\n          die spoiled, corrupt, lonely and\r\n          alone. Runs in the blood. What\r\n          would that make you?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You're still young. You can do\r\n          pretty much whatever you please.\r\n          AT THE HOT TUB, two girls kiss each other, filmed in DV by an\r\n          young entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          31.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You think so? Just chuck all this\r\n          and go help the children in South\r\n          America, something like that?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Maybe.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Well look at you, Mr. Bishop.\r\n          You're a dreamer.\r\n          Steve heads inside. A beat, Bishop follows.\r\n\r\n          INT. MCKENNA ESTATE - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          As soon as they enter, Steve finds himself locked up by two\r\n          BEAUTIES who whisper excitedly in his ear.\r\n\r\n                         BEAUTY #1\r\n          Well? Do you want to...?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          No, in fact I'm pretty sure that's\r\n          illegal in this state.\r\n\r\n                         (TO BISHOP)\r\n          Come on, this way.\r\n          Steve leaves the Beauties disappointed, moves up some stairs.\r\n          Bishop follows.\r\n\r\n          INT. MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Steve and Bishop move into another room where two HUGE\r\n          flatscreens have converted the room into a Wii court. Young\r\n          muscle-bound posers play a first person head-to-head shoot-em\r\n          game. Others drink, CHEER.\r\n          Two bump fists with Steve. One fronts cool at Bishop, fakes\r\n          a punch at him. Bishop just watches, doesn't do a thing.\r\n          The kid smiles, nods...\r\n          On the floor, paintings of Harry McKenna, discarded.\r\n\r\n          INT. MASTER SUITE, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          This used to be Harry's realm. Now Steve's taken it over.\r\n          Giant ornate king bed. Huge balcony overlooking the estate.\r\n          Steve goes to the railing of the balcony, looks down at the\r\n          grounds, the people. Bishop hangs back, glances into a\r\n          private study, untouched from when Harry ruled there.\r\n          Papers, books, a portrait of Harry over the desk.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          32.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You know, I went up there. To\r\n          where my father died.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Oh?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Hell of a place to die. Lonely...\r\n          Bishop comes abreast of Steve, also looks down. Removed from\r\n          the party and the pool area, a separate area of the estate\r\n          contains an outdoor gym. Weights, exercise equipment, a\r\n          fighting matt and martial arts equipment all present.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          (off the gym area)\r\n          That all yours?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          If the body is weak, the mind can't\r\n          be strong.\r\n          Bishop nods, impressed. Something about this young man.\r\n          Engaged, observing Bishop, but not needy.\r\n\r\n          MALE VOICE (O.S.)\r\n          Steve! Steve, man. It's Louise.\r\n          At the door, a FRIEND of Steve's is held back by security.\r\n\r\n                         FRIEND\r\n          She's up in the bungalow. I think\r\n          she might really do it this time.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n\r\n                         (TO BISHOP)\r\n          My girlfriend thinks that my\r\n          father's death is a good time to\r\n          kill herself. She thinks I'm not\r\n          showing the appropriate human\r\n          reaction.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I'll let myself out.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          No, please. You've seen this much.\r\n          Aren't you interested?

BUNGALOW, MCKENNA ESTATE - EARLY EVENING\r\n\r\n          Steve and Bishop push through a guarded gate, up a small path\r\n          arriving at a beautiful bungalow, set back in the gardens.\r\n          Candle light glows inside.\r\n\r\n          INT. BUNGALOW, MCKENNA ESTATE - EARLY EVENING\r\n\r\n          Louise is nude, immersed in the water of a jacuzzi located in\r\n          the center of the room. On the side, she has a bottle of\r\n          scotch, some pills, and two razor blades.\r\n          She looks up at Steve, streaked eyes dart to Bishop.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          Who's he?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          A friend. Would have thought you'd\r\n          have started by now.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          This isn't about me. It's about\r\n          you. You need to watch.\r\n          Steve crouches down, pours himself a shot from her whiskey\r\n          bottle. Something angry and cold in his eyes.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Okay. I'm here. I'm watching.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          You don't believe I'll do it.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          No, I know you, Louise. You'll do\r\n          just about anything if it'll get\r\n          you enough attention.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          You think you can hide behind that\r\n          cool attitude. Like nothing\r\n          matters to you. But I know you.\r\n          You care. You feel.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Do I?\r\n          Louise blinks, scared a little. But she pushes the fear\r\n          away, picks up one of the razor blades. A beat, then with a\r\n          quick gesture, she slices across one wrist. Blood rises to\r\n          the surface, runs down her arms into the water.\r\n          Steve doesn't move. Neither does Bishop. Louise picks up\r\n          the second blade with the cut hand. Fingers fumble, but she\r\n          gets it. Slices across her other wrist.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          34.\r\n          Blood runs... stains the water rose.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          ...Wow.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          How long will it take?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n\r\n                         (HE SHRUGS)\r\n          Mr. Bishop?\r\n          Bishop rises, looks down at her in the tub.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          How much do you weigh?\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          A hundred and ten.\r\n          His eyes take in her body, the flow from her wrists...\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You're a hundred and twenty-five.\r\n          It'll take an hour and a half,\r\n          maybe two. When you get cold...\r\n          then you'll know you're close.\r\n          Steve takes in Bishop in this moment, nods. Glances at the\r\n          clock: 9:30. Then he refills his drink, heads out to the\r\n          patio outside. Sits facing away from them.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          He'll stop it. He thinks he's\r\n          above it all. But he's not. No\r\n          one is.\r\n          Bishop nods. Not clear if he's agreeing or observing.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BUNGALOW, MCKENNA ESTATE - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits with Steve on the patio. From inside, Louise's\r\n          soft crying can be heard. Seen through the trees in front of\r\n          them, young people dance, splash, party.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n\r\n                         (FROM INSIDE)\r\n          Steve!

Please. I'm\r\n          frightened. I'm scared, Steve.\r\n          Bishop looks at Steve who just keeps staring outwards.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You can help her if you want.\r\n          The sounds of water, splashing. Louise arrives on the patio,\r\n          a blood-stained robe loosely pulled on around her. Mascara\r\n          eyes ran. She stares down at Steve.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          You're a bastard.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You know what the kick of it is,\r\n          Louise? If you actually had the\r\n          stones, then there's be something\r\n          for us. But in 30 seconds when you\r\n          run down that path and all of those\r\n          people go crazy saving your life...\r\n          Well, then we'll be done.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          I know.

Maybe you never\r\n          really knew me.\r\n          A beat. Louise, looking between the two men. She SWAYS on\r\n          her feet and Bishop puts a hand out, steadies her.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          You're a bastard, too. Both of\r\n          you.

You'll do fine.\r\n          The world's gonna love you.\r\n          Louise steps away, turns, stumbling down the path into the\r\n          dark. A beat, the men just watching after her and then a\r\n          SCREAM from below. COMMOTION, ACTION. People rush to\r\n          Louise, help her to the ground. Others pulling out cell\r\n          phones, call for help. Louise's LOUD cries drift back.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Would you have let her do it?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          36.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          We'll never know, will we?\r\n          Steve rises, heads up a small path.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ESTATE GROUNDS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Steve and Bishop, walking high above the estate. Far below\r\n          them, the lights of an ambulance in the driveway.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You didn't answer my question.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Everybody dies.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Sure. But it's a whole other world\r\n          when you're personally involved.\r\n          There's a very big tab that has to\r\n          be picked up.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Such as?\r\n          Bishop stops, looks down at the action far below them.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Governments, cops, the military...\r\n          we give young men a licence and\r\n          send them into it blind, thinking\r\n          it'll all be okay. Because someone\r\n          told them they had permission.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          But when you cross over that line,\r\n          you do it alone. Most people, they\r\n          stay that way from then on. Alone.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Everybody can kill. You take a\r\n          mother, protecting her child...\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Sure. But that's instinct. What\r\n          I'm talking about is up here...\r\n          (tapping his head)\r\n          Knowledge of foresight. Intention.\r\n          A person who knows that the only\r\n          way to truly be free of man's laws,\r\n          is to break his highest one.\r\n          Beat. It sits there, between them.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Why are you telling me all this?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          37.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Why did you want me to see that\r\n          little stunt with your girlfriend?\r\n          Bishop stares down the hill at the commotion. Ants swarming.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          These aren't your people, are they?\r\n          You don't have \"people.\" Your life\r\n          is crowded, but you're alone.\r\n          Steve unconsciously nods, then:\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You know, you're right. You grow\r\n          up spoiled, rich, like me... Only\r\n          thing you really learn to recognize\r\n          in people is when someone wants\r\n          something from you.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          What do you want, Mr. Bishop? What\r\n          are you doing here?\r\n          Bishop considers Steve, thrown. Then...\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Thanks for the tour. It's been\r\n          interesting.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Yes, it has.\r\n          Bishop turns, heads back down towards the estate. Steve\r\n          watches him go.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop stares down at the line of supplements and pills set\r\n          out in front of him, something gnawing at him. His cat\r\n          nuzzles around his legs, purring. He scoops up the lot,\r\n          washes them down with water.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - NIGHT (LATER)\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits on his sofa, antsy. On the TV, the day's news\r\n          plays out in silence. Anti-American PROTESTS in a Middle-\r\n          Eastern country. Words scroll: \"...Official resistance to US\r\n          eavesdropping policy...\" \"...Break down of high-level...\"\r\n          Bishop rises, goes to a stack of DVD's. Grabs one, slots it.\r\n          ON THE TV: The WOMAN, speaking to him from her beautiful\r\n          apartment. Similar to the one we saw. She leans against a\r\n          large plate glass windows, shirt and panties, sipping wine.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          38.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN ON TV\r\n          Hey, you. Jesus, what a night. We\r\n          went to opening of Fernando's new\r\n          restaurant and Betty was there\r\n          wearing -- well, whatever we call\r\n          those things she wears...\r\n          ON THE STACK OF DVDs. There must be twenty of them.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN ON TV (CONT'D)\r\n          I miss you. Everybody says hi, of\r\n          course. But with me... it's like I\r\n          feel you there with me, even when\r\n          you're not.\r\n          ON THE TV: She pulls her shirt off over her head, faces the\r\n          camera again, topless.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN ON TV (CONT'D)\r\n          I feel the way you touch me...\r\n          Bishop rises, blows out of the room.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S GYM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          SLAM! Dropping in on Bishop, SPRINTING on the treadmill.\r\n          FASTER than we've seen him go before. ON and ON.\r\n          He hits the weights, slots extra 45's onto the press bar.\r\n          The weights CLANG into place.\r\n          ON BISHOP, PRESSING the enormous weight. One, two, three...\r\n          He RACKS the weights, disgusted. Gets up, throws on more\r\n          weight. He PRESSES it again. Five... six... RACKS it\r\n          again, angry. Adds MORE WEIGHT. Back under the bar.\r\n          Pressing. Muscles distending, STRAINING. Seven... Eight...\r\n          He CRIES OUT as something GIVES in his shoulder. The Weight\r\n          SETTLES down on him, crushing him. A moment in his eyes, the\r\n          weight pressing the air out of his lunges. He LAUGHS MANIC,\r\n          SURGES up against the weight, tossing it off, the weights\r\n          slamming into the floor, BOOM!\r\n\r\n          EXT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Bishop's car pulls up fast. He gets out, tosses the valet\r\n          his keys, heads in, weirdly focused.\r\n\r\n          INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits alone at a reserved table at the back, a plate of\r\n          sashimi in front of him. He looks out at the restaurant.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          39.\r\n          BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Laughter, smiles, hands touching, hands\r\n          waving mid-story, lips parting. Woman's hands touching their\r\n          necks, eyes sparkling, men laughing, wallets flashing...\r\n          Bishop rises suddenly, his hand going to his wallet, trying\r\n          to get out of there. ROOM SWAYS. He steadies himself, moves\r\n          towards the exit. People look over, alarmed as he grabs\r\n          backs of chairs to steady himself. VERTIGO LOOMING, sounds\r\n          DISTORTING and suddenly he's FALLING into blackness...\r\n\r\n          INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop, shirtless. A FEMALE DOCTOR is examining the injury.\r\n          Professional, but attractive. And attracted to him. Her\r\n          hands on his shoulder, gentle. Her other hand on his back.\r\n          Her eyes play over his form: SCARS, WOUNDS, healed. A\r\n          battlefield for a body.\r\n\r\n                         FEMALE DOCTOR\r\n          Quite a collection you have here.\r\n          Military?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Something like that.\r\n\r\n                         FEMALE DOCTOR\r\n          Does this hurt?\r\n          Bishop smiles, recognizing the nature of the touch.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Yes, a little.\r\n          The doctor lets her hands rest just a fraction too long, then\r\n          moves across the room, writes in a chart.\r\n\r\n                         FEMALE DOCTOR\r\n          Any next of kin, anybody we can\r\n          notify?\r\n          (off his shake no)\r\n          How about an acquaintance?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Am I going to die?\r\n\r\n                         FEMALE DOCTOR\r\n\r\n                         (SMILE)\r\n          No, not today.\r\n          Bishop reaches for his shirt, slips it on.\r\n\r\n          FEMALE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\r\n          You damaged your deltoid muscle.\r\n          But that doesn't explain the\r\n          anxiety attack.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          40.\r\n\r\n          FEMALE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\r\n          Any unusual stress recently?\r\n          Something at work?\r\n          (off his shake no)\r\n          I'm prescribing Cataflam for the\r\n          pain and Paxil for the stress and\r\n          I'm going to give you my card. If\r\n          you have any other episodes... or\r\n          if you need anything else, don't\r\n          hesitate to give me a call.\r\n          She holds out her card. He looks at her, lets her stay that\r\n          way for a moment, then takes the card. She looks away.\r\n\r\n          FEMALE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\r\n          You can pay at the desk.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRONT DESK, EMERGENCY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Bishop pays cash. He crumples the prescriptions, tosses it\r\n          in the trash, starts to toss the doctor's card.\r\n          Beat. He can see her down the hall, speaking with another\r\n          doctor. Pretty, real. A moment, he pockets the card.\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP. - DAY\r\n\r\n          Steve sits in his father's office chair, staring back at us,\r\n          occasionally nodding. We REVERSE to find a collection of\r\n          Investigators, a Forensic Doc, and a hardened SECURITY\r\n          SPECIALIST. The Doc is in the middle of a presentation.\r\n          BOARDS hold diagrams, conclusions, crime scene photos, all\r\n          about Harry McKenna.\r\n          The Doc demonstrates the precise hold, the pressure points\r\n          that killed Harry McKenna. Steve watches, impassive.\r\n\r\n          EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Bishop runs through the woods, full-tilt. Finally stops in\r\n          front of his house. He feels his injured shoulder, winces...\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits on his sofa in front of the TV: A bureaucrat at\r\n          a press conference. A female diplomat pushes through photogs\r\n          with her hand up, shielding her face. Words scroll: \"US\r\n          Intelligence under scrutiny... High level meeting...\"\r\n          Bishop hits the remote and the TV goes to static, white noise\r\n          again. His eyes... relax, almost asleep. We stay on his\r\n          face, a glimpse into his only moments of peace...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          41.\r\n          BANG! BANG! BANG! POUNDING on his front door. Bishop's\r\n          eyes POP open. He's on his feet, instantly alert, moving\r\n          past a sideboard. He touches a hidden catch, a \"click\" and\r\n          he reaches underneath, comes out with a handgun.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRONT DOOR, BISHOP'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Steve is there, pounding on the door.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Mr. Bishop! Arthur! Please, I\r\n          need to speak with you.\r\n          The front door opens. Bishop, fronting sleepy.

It'll be... It'll be\r\n          interesting.\r\n\r\n          INT. BENTLEY - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Steve drives, too fast. Bishop is shotgun. The rear area\r\n          usually reserved for passengers is empty.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Gonna tell me what the big surprise\r\n          is?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          I'd rather show you. I know,\r\n          melodramatic. But I think it'll be\r\n          worth it to you.\r\n          Bishop TENSES, almost imperceptible as Steve pilots the car\r\n          into the underground structure beneath McKenna Holding Corp.\r\n\r\n          INT. PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Car screeches to a stop. Steve grabs a case, is out.\r\n          Bishops takes in the area. Two of Steve's SECURITY there,\r\n          looking stern. Bishop checks the gun he has concealed in his\r\n          waistband, reaches for his door.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA ENTERPRISES - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Elevator opens at the very top. Steve pushes out onto the\r\n          roof. Bishop follows. Security lighting floods on,\r\n          illuminating the desolate surface in eerie even light.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          42.\r\n          Steve opens his case, starts tossing down PHOTOGRAPHS:\r\n          CLOSE ON THE PICTURES: Harry McKenna.

My dad\r\n          didn't die of a heart attack. I\r\n          mean, he was dying of a heart\r\n          attack, but that's not what killed\r\n          him. The blood flow to his brain\r\n          was cut off, his brain died before\r\n          his body. Somebody killed him.\r\n          On Bishop, considering Steve.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          What do the police think?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHING)\r\n          The police? They don't want to\r\n          hear about this. I mean, they'll\r\n          look into it. But they don't very\r\n          much like the idea that they\r\n          totally missed this one and it'd be\r\n          just easier for everyone if I would\r\n          shut the hell up.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          ...What do you want?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          They killed him. Here, on the roof\r\n          of his own building. His own\r\n          security all around. Why here?\r\n          Why even kill him, if he was\r\n          already dying?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You tell me.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          To make a point.

That they can get to anyone,\r\n          whenever they want to.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          So what am I doing here?\r\n          Bishop, supremely alert, listening. Tracking shadows...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          43.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          I got my black belt in Karate when\r\n          I was nineteen. I've studied Judo\r\n          since I was six.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I'm impressed.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          No, you're not. Most people are,\r\n          but you're not. If I came at you\r\n          right now, I'd wind up dead as my\r\n          father, wouldn't I?\r\n          Bishop doesn't answer. Steve breaks away, looks down at the\r\n          place where his father died.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Same as if I tried to exact justice\r\n          for my father. These men, what\r\n          this is... It's something you know\r\n          about, isn't it?\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Something you could teach me.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I didn't get the impression you\r\n          even liked Harry very much.\r\n          Steve SURGES forward. Real anger, intensity boiling over.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You really going to stand there and\r\n          judge how much I loved my father?\r\n          What the hell do you know about it?\r\n          Bishop, hearing this. A nerve touched.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Besides, this isn't just about\r\n          Harry. Harry's dead, may he rest\r\n          in peace. But this is about me.\r\n          They came here and they killed my\r\n          father. They did that to me.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You want revenge.\r\n          Steve doesn't answer. A long moment between them. Steve\r\n          turns, looks out over the city.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You know the word \"Nemesis\"? It's\r\n          not actually a word. It's a name.\r\n          She was one of the Greek goddesses.\r\n          Of anger. Retribution against any\r\n          mortal who became too proud.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          44.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          The executor of divine justice.\r\n          It's a beautiful idea, don't you\r\n          think? Justice.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Justice?\r\n          A beat. Bishop shakes his head, turns, starts to walk back\r\n          towards the elevators. Steve collects his papers, angry.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n\r\n                         (CALLING AFTER)\r\n          Fine. Fine. In case you haven't\r\n          noticed, I now have a couple of\r\n          million dollars to spend on this,\r\n          so I will find them myself and I'll\r\n          deal with them myself and if I wind\r\n          up dead trying, you can bury me\r\n          right next to dear old dad --\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Jesus, stop your whining.\r\n          SLAP! No one's ever spoken to Steve that way. He STARES. A\r\n          stillness between them, even the wind slows, waiting...\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          Corner of sixth and Grand.\r\n          Tomorrow morning. 7:00 am. Don't\r\n          be late.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          I won't.\r\n          Beat. Bishop nods, starts to leave, turns back...\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          And Steve... no more surprises like\r\n          this, okay?\r\n          Steve nods. Bishop goes. On Steve, watching as the elevator\r\n          doors erase the older man.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop stands in the middle of his home, still. Thinking.\r\n          Then he moves to his office, grabs a newspaper.\r\n          He moves to his Study, turns to a page, slaps it down on the\r\n          glass on his scanner. Hits a button, the white light of the\r\n          scanner passes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          45.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Big King bed, never used. A huge painting by the Artist on\r\n          the wall across from the bed. Landscape. Empty. Ruined.\r\n          Bishop hoists the painting down off the wall. He has a print-\r\n          out from his computer, tacks it in the center of the blank\r\n          space left by the painting: The picture of Steve, scanned\r\n          from the McKenna Obituary, enlarged. Tacked alone on the\r\n          wall. A start.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORNER OF SIXTH AND GRAND - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop stands on the corner, waiting. He checks his watch:\r\n          6:58. Steve's Bentley pulls up to the corner, parks in a\r\n          handicapped space. Steve gets out, nods to Bishop.\r\n          Bishop takes in Steve, the Bentley, a metermaid ten yards\r\n          away, already moving towards them.\r\n\r\n          INT. STERILE HALLWAY - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop enters this linoleum-lined hallway, slips the bored\r\n          ATTENDANT $100. The man hits a button, a door CLICKS open.\r\n\r\n          INT. MORGUE - MORNING\r\n\r\n          As they enter, fluorescent lights flicker on. Cheap,\r\n          overused. Some burnt out, others shorting.\r\n          ROWS OF GURNEYS line the room. Bodies, covered in green\r\n          morgue drapes. Steve's eyes play over it. He swallows.\r\n          Bishop is cold, business-like.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Stay focused. This is a test.\r\n          Bishop moves down the rows, pulling drapes away as he does.\r\n          Nude BODIES are revealed. Men, women, teens. In some, the\r\n          reason for their death is obvious. Others aren't telling.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          You want to know about killing,\r\n          look around.\r\n          Steve does, a little creeped out, but keeping it cool.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          The act of killing, is an end in\r\n          itself. Any other motive keeps it\r\n          from being pure.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          The psychopath has no motive.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          46.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          No, he's driven, compelled, by his\r\n          sickness. He's as much the victim\r\n          as those he kills.\r\n          More drapes fall. Dead eyes stare up at them.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          But when you make your own law,\r\n          you're responsible to no one else\r\n          but yourself. Maybe you're free...\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          I understand.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Do you? This isn't some idea\r\n          anymore. This is the real thing.\r\n          You still with me?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          I am.\r\n          Another drape falls. A beautiful woman. No signs of injury.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Ever heard the term \"Mechanic\" used\r\n          outside of its normal meaning?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          My father used it. A dealer... a\r\n          guy who works the tables.\r\n          Bishops smiles, shakes his head.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Or a... killer. A hit man.\r\n          Bishop just stares. Steve shakes his head, looks away from\r\n          Bishop, winds up staring at a dead man. Laughs to himself.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          What are you thinking?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          I had you pegged as... a security\r\n          consultant. Maybe ex-military.\r\n          Someone who... protects people.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Maybe I do.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Or maybe you just get paid to kill\r\n          people.\r\n          Bishop nods his head yes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          47.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          So why let me in? I mean, I know\r\n          what I want. What do you get out\r\n          of it?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          ...Times are changing. Security is\r\n          better trained, more lethal.\r\n          Sometimes I could use a partner.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Bullshit.\r\n          Bishop nods, smiles. He moves away from the tables, leaves\r\n          Steve standing in the middle of it all.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          In this... there isn't room for\r\n          those who are outside of it.\r\n          There's too much isolation.\r\n          Friendships can't work. Eventually\r\n          everyone expects you to account.\r\n          The isolation... becomes a\r\n          liability. You stand out.\r\n          Standing out... isn't good.\r\n          Steve smiles, shakes his head.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You need a... friend?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          An associate.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          I'm offering to teach you something\r\n          that most people can't be taught.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Because you think I'm a natural.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          That remains to be seen.\r\n          (taps his head)\r\n          But you're alone in there, aren't\r\n          you? That's... the prerequisite.\r\n          Steve continues to stare at the bodies. Bishops starts\r\n          towards the exit.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          Think it over.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Bishop...\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          When I find the men who murdered my\r\n          father.

Bishop nods.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S GYM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Dropping into the middle of a FIGHT. Steve and Bishop,\r\n          attacking each other, mixed martial arts.\r\n          Steve is the aggressor, moves in knocking Bishop's defenses\r\n          away. HITTING Bishop who takes the punch, steps back...\r\n          Steve's still on him. Kicking, two, three times. Bishop\r\n          catches a kick, tosses Steve back. He lands cat-like on his\r\n          feet, comes back at Bishop, strong. Hitting, pushing Bishop\r\n          back against a wall, seeming to dominate the fight.\r\n          BUZZ! A buzzer goes off. Bishop drops his guard, would be\r\n          flattened if Steve didn't pull his punch, walks out.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BISHOP'S RANGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Behind Bishop's gym is a rifle range. An assortment of\r\n          weapons lie on a table. In front of them, some trees, some\r\n          old cars... some bottles sitting on the limbs of the trees.\r\n          Bishop picks up a handgun, checks his pulse. Steve has\r\n          obviously learned from him, does the same.\r\n          Bishop raises the gun. BLAM! BLAM! Two bottles shatter at\r\n          30 yards. He tosses Steve the gun. Steve keeps two fingers\r\n          on his pulse.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          I'm still at 130.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Too fast.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          I know. I'm working on it.\r\n          Bishop nods, picks up the rifle, sights. BLAM! 1,000 yards\r\n          away, the bullet IMPACTS the head-rest of an abandoned car.\r\n          Bishop looks to Steve who gives up, raises the handgun.\r\n          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Three shots. Three misses. Steve\r\n          tosses down the gun, frustrated.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You were still over 100.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          49.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          What am I supposed to do?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          There are no perfect situations.\r\n          You fought me at 100%, so you were\r\n          winning. But in doing so, you gave\r\n          up your shooting option.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          It's all about choices. Always.\r\n          Bishop starts to leave.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Bishop... What's your 100% look\r\n          like?\r\n          Bishop smiles.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Two cars BLISTERING down the highway. Bishop's Cobra and\r\n          Steve in a classic Maserati. They JOCKEY for position, WEAVE\r\n          in and out of the other cars on the road.\r\n          WITH BISHOP. Portrait of control. Expertly working the\r\n          tuned car, coaxing power and speed out of it.\r\n          WITH STEVE. Careless, going for broke, not caring if he has\r\n          the space to make his moves. He SWERVES his car, right at\r\n          Bishop...\r\n          ... who has to PEEL away, off the highway, onto the smooth\r\n          dirt-pack. He DOWNSHIFTS, blasts back onto the road,\r\n          catching air. Steve LAUGHS out load as they CREST the top of\r\n          a rise...\r\n          LOOMING AHEAD: An existing accident. A beer truck jack-\r\n          knifed across the freeway. Bishop BRAKES, fighting for\r\n          control.\r\n          Steve SWERVES his car, too fast, it goes into a SPIN... CLIPS\r\n          another car, gains air and PLOWS ass-backwards into the side\r\n          of the beer truck.\r\n          BISHOP'S CAR slides to a stop. Bishop gets out, tracks:\r\n          STEVE, climbing out of the Maserati onto the hood protruding\r\n          from the side of the truck. LAUGHING, WHOOOPING at the sky.\r\n          Bishop approaches, sees that hundreds of bottles of BEER have\r\n          cascaded out of the punctured truck.\r\n          Steve wipes blood from a cut on his forehead, grabs a beer\r\n          and cracks it, swigs as he sits on the Maserati hood. He\r\n          grabs another, tosses it to Bishop.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          50.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Come on up, man. The view is\r\n          beautiful.\r\n          Bishop takes in the situation, the small crowd gathering...\r\n          he jumps up, sits on the hood of the car with Steve, both\r\n          leaning back against the cracked windshield.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You lost control.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You think?\r\n          Steve puts out his beer. A hesitation, then Bishop clinks\r\n          beers with him. They both drink. Stretched out in front of\r\n          them, the highway seems to go on forever.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          You ever think about just... going?\r\n          Leaving. Never turning back?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          ...Sometimes.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Why don't you?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I have... responsibilities. I have\r\n          a cat.\r\n          A beat. Steve LAUGHS loud. Bishop laughs. Maybe the first\r\n          time in ages. They drink, watch the sun move lower in the\r\n          sky as emergency vehicles approach.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Steve comes in from the guest-house, showered. Sees Bishop\r\n          at the dining room table, takes in the place for the first\r\n          time. The art on the walls.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You know, looking at these, a\r\n          person might think maybe there's a\r\n          screw or two loose up there...\r\n          Steve catches sight of a manila envelope in front of his\r\n          empty place.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Is this what I think it is?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n\r\n                         (SHAKING NO)\r\n          Don't be so eager. Open it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          51.\r\n          PLANS, diagrams. Pictures. They're of an outdoor area.\r\n          Steve's eyes scan over them, interested.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Who's the Mark?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          ...I am.\r\n\r\n          INT. OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY\r\n\r\n          A huge square filled with VENDORS selling all manner of food\r\n          and good out of CARTS and STALLS. Music, voices, crowds of\r\n          people. Bishop moves through. Dressed average, just a guy\r\n          in the crowd. He watches a couple argue. Moves on...\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (V.O.)\r\n          It's not good enough to simply\r\n          follow your Mark and attack him.\r\n          Most of these people know they're\r\n          targets. They'll be watching for\r\n          you.\r\n          ... A moment, then Steve enters the frame, tracking Bishop.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          You need to understand the\r\n          location, control the situation.\r\n          You're looking for escapes,\r\n          security, police presence...\r\n          Bishop passes two COPS, squeezes between two parked produce\r\n          trucks towards the row of shops that border the square.\r\n\r\n          INT. WATCH REPAIR SHOP - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Bishop stands in front of a case, watches the precision\r\n          instruments tick. From behind a counter, the Chinese OWNER\r\n          notices him, puts down the watch he's repairing, approaches.\r\n          60's, authoritative, a LOUP on his forehead.\r\n\r\n                         OWNER\r\n          Interest you in anything?\r\n          Bishop takes in the man, eyes check polished reflective\r\n          surfaces, back to the man. Bishop points to a watch.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          That's a beauty.\r\n\r\n                         OWNER\r\n\r\n                         (BEAMING)\r\n          You know your instruments...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          52.\r\n\r\n          EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Concealed amidst exotic Guatemalan wraps, Steve tracks the\r\n          Watch Shop. The attractive older woman running the stall\r\n          eyes him. He looks right through her.\r\n          STEVE'S P.O.V.: Bishop exits, heading back into the market.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (V.O.)\r\n          Most of all, you need to answer\r\n          this question: \"How does this man\r\n          die here today?\"\r\n          Bishop passes a butcher cutting into a slab of meat. Steve\r\n          follows behind Bishop, lost in the sea of people.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          Everybody, everyday, has a way to\r\n          die. You have to find it.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CURIOS STALL, OUTDOOR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Bishop stands in front of stall filled with classic toys,\r\n          rocking horses, vintage dolls. His gaze finds a large, still-\r\n          boxed doll of the \"Luna Cromwell\" character that the Grocery\r\n          Owner's Daughter is obsessed with. Almost life-sized.\r\n\r\n                         SALESMAN\r\n          They don't make that anymore.\r\n          That's a classic. I can let you\r\n          have it for three hundred...\r\n\r\n          INT. OUTDOOR MARKET - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Bishop turns away from the stand carrying the doll. A GROUP\r\n          of teens RUNS by Bishop, buffeting him for a moment.\r\n          Slightly off kilter, he checks his surroundings. Nothing.\r\n          Bishop starts again, aware for the first time that a MAN is\r\n          headed his direction, passing a knife-sharpening stand,\r\n          blades gleaming, his face hidden by a low hat...\r\n          Bishop tracks the figure out of the corner of his eye, turns\r\n          and pushes through the tight space between two stalls, out\r\n          the back where trucks are parked. Bishops glances back for\r\n          the man, squeezes between two large trucks...\r\n          ...coming out the other side when POP! A loud SOUND makes\r\n          Bishop glance over. A HISSING coming from one of the trucks\r\n          which starts to ROLL backwards and\r\n          Suddenly HANDS are on Bishop from behind, PUSHING HIM\r\n          backwards, into the space between the two trucks! A FLASH, A\r\n          SPLIT SECOND to stare into Steve's face, holding him there to\r\n          be crushed and...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          53.\r\n          CRASH! The one truck SLAMS into the second, the vice closed,\r\n          metal crumpling.\r\n          Bishop, at the last minute pulled back by Steve who's holding\r\n          him there, smiling. A beat. Bishop checks the surroundings,\r\n          nods. Steve release him.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          ...Good. Very good.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Good? That's all you got? How\r\n          about God damn perfect, man?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Don't get cocky.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Broad daylight. A thousand\r\n          witnesses. Man takes a wrong step.\r\n          Excuse me if I take a moment to\r\n          appreciate myself. Because that\r\n          was poetry.\r\n          (laughing, smiling)\r\n          You just can't bring yourself to be\r\n          impressed, can you?\r\n          Bishops considers, notices that the Luna Cromwell doll has\r\n          fallen in the gutter. Picks it up, tries to dry it.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          (hand to his ear)\r\n          What's that? You're what? Oh, you\r\n          are impressed? No, come on, you\r\n          don't have to say that. Really,\r\n          I'm fine with -- You what? You've\r\n          never seen someone better? Wow.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          All right. You did very well.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Damn straight I did. And now, in\r\n          celebration of me, I'm taking you\r\n          to a restaurant where the\r\n          waitresses... what?\r\n          Something about Bishop's serious gaze has stopped Steve.\r\n          Bishop reaches into his jacket, places a gun in Steve's\r\n          hands. A confused beat, Steve conceals the weapon.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          ...Bishop?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          54.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          There's a man behind me. Look up\r\n          once, then look away. Don't look\r\n          back.\r\n          Steve glances up. We realize we're right in front of the\r\n          watch store. The OWNER is pulling the steel grate down over\r\n          his store, closing for the day.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          You got him?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Yeah. Look...\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You did good here. Really good.\r\n          But this was just a game. That\r\n          man... is your graduation.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Who is he?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          He owns the watch store.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          I know. I meant... what did he do?\r\n          Bishop comes close, FOCUSED.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I've taught you how to kill without\r\n          anyone knowing there was a murder.\r\n          I've taught you to be invisible.\r\n          But that's strategy, not killing.\r\n          The real test... it's the actual\r\n          killing, isn't it?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Bishop...\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Do you want this? Be very sure.\r\n          Because you can walk away.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          No. I'm ready.\r\n          Bishop studies him... nods. Turns to go.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Bishop... We're right here, where\r\n          you wanted us to wind up. You knew\r\n          where I'd hit you, didn't you?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          55.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          ...School's out.\r\n          Bishop leaves. Steve watches him go. Stuck. Helpless. He\r\n          turns back. The Owner is headed home for the day.\r\n\r\n          INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits back at his reserved table in the rear of the\r\n          place. In a chair next to him, the doll is awkwardly\r\n          perched. Around him, people LAUGH. Lovers NUZZLE..\r\n          He reaches into his breast pocket, slides out a new DHL\r\n          envelope, tears it open. A new jump-drive slides onto the\r\n          table. He eats, takes pills, his eyes locked on the drive.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          (to Luna doll)\r\n          Who do you think that is, Luna?\r\n          He takes a card out of his wallet, studies it. It's from the\r\n          flirtatious doctor. He pulls out his phone, dials.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Steve sits in a nondescript car, lights out, parked.\r\n          STEVE'S P.O.V.: Two stories up, a lit apartment. The WATCH\r\n          STORE OWNER crosses by one of the lit windows.\r\n\r\n          INT. WATCH STORE OWNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Owner has a delicate vintage Brietlang in his hands. He\r\n          places it on a patch of velvet, watch-repair tools laid next\r\n          to it. He moves to an old stereo, puts the needle of a turn-\r\n          table down on spinning vinyl. The lonely sounds of Brahms\r\n          Piano Concerto No. 2 fill the room.\r\n          He returns to his desk, sits. A tiny noise from the hall. A\r\n          \"click.\" He looks up, sees nothing, settles in to work...\r\n\r\n          TRACKING ACROSS THE ROOM\r\n          To the front HALLWAY. Steve stands in the hallway,\r\n          motionless. He's just closed the front door behind him. In\r\n          his hands, a lock-pick set which he now pockets and pulls out\r\n          the gun Bishop gave him.\r\n\r\n          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON BISHOP. No way to tell where he is. He's holding\r\n          the Luna doll. He reaches forward, knocks on a door.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          56.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n\r\n                         (FROM INSIDE)\r\n          It's open!\r\n\r\n          INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The WOMAN's apartment. Not the doctor's, the same we've been\r\n          to before. Everything eerily identical to the last time.\r\n          Sofas, gas fire, throws and rugs, open bottle of wine.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n          I'll just be a minute.\r\n          A GLIMPSE of the woman in her bedroom, topless in front of a\r\n          vanity. She glances back, smiles warm. Laughs a little when\r\n          she sees the doll.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          It's for a friend.\r\n          Bishop awkwardly sets the doll down near the front door,\r\n          moves on, into the apartment. Restless.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm sorry I was away so long this\r\n          time. I had some complications --\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n          Don't be.\r\n          He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom, adjusting the\r\n          dress she's just pulled on. Beautiful. She comes up to him,\r\n          kisses him. He doesn't respond.

He and Ginny\r\n          have this little cottage up the\r\n          coast they hardly use. I was\r\n          thinking, maybe next week you and I\r\n          should go.\r\n          Approaching, handing him a wine.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          You and me, the whole weekend.\r\n          What would we... do?\r\n          She approaches him, sexy. Touches him, intimate. He stares\r\n          at her, blank. She recovers fast, moves off.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Of course why do we need that?

WATCH STORE OWNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Carefully, slowly, Steve makes his way down the hall towards\r\n          the lit living room.\r\n\r\n          IN THE LIVING ROOM\r\n          The owner pauses, enjoying the crescendo of the music. Eyes\r\n          closed for a moment. Then they open...\r\n          ... Steve is standing in the doorway to the living room, the\r\n          gun pointed at the owner. The owner sees him, becomes\r\n          motionless. The two men staring across the space between\r\n          them... and then everything happens very fast.\r\n          The Owner LURCHES to the side with surprising speed and\r\n          agility just as Steve FIRES! The bullet catches the Owner in\r\n          the side, SPINNING him around. He CRASHES to the floor...\r\n          ... but only for an INSTANT. THEN he's BACK ON HIS FEET,\r\n          MOVING across the room! Steve tracks, pulls the trigger\r\n          again but the gun only \"clicks\" empty.\r\n          The man reaches a coat rack, grabs it in one fluid motion and\r\n          is MOVING back at Steve who barely has time to drop the gun\r\n          and BLOCK the rack as it SLICES through the air at him.\r\n          The Owner HITS and HITS again. Skilled, professional,\r\n          martial-arts trained. Steve blocking one, two, the third hit\r\n          connects, sends Steve REELING back, crashing through the\r\n          watch-repair table.\r\n          The Owner leaps at him with the rack. Steve is BARELY able\r\n          to catch the end before it impales him. The two men,\r\n          BREATHING, STRUGGLING, the Owner FORCING the point lower\r\n          towards Steve's face...\r\n          ... Blood pools on Steve's shirt. Steve and the Owner both\r\n          track it. The man is bleeding badly from the bullet wound.\r\n          A split-second calculation and the man abandons the coat-\r\n          rack, races across the room as Steve clambers to his feet.\r\n          The man reaches the far wall, hits a RELEASE. The wood\r\n          paneling slides open, revealing a CAR-15 fully automatic\r\n          assault rifle with a silencer. The man grabs it, opens up!\r\n          Bullets CHEW through furniture, drywall, glass searching for\r\n          Steve who DIVES into the hallway, retreating as the man comes\r\n          forward, firing in deadly precise BURSTS.\r\n          Steve hides behind a wall which ERUPTS, blown to bits. He\r\n          stumbles through a doorway into a KITCHEN.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          58.\r\n\r\n          INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Stillness. The woman and Bishop, staring forward, watching\r\n          another of her videos. Another late-night diary.

His eyes move down to her sofa where another man's\r\n          tie has been discarded. A moment, then she shakes her head,\r\n          angry with herself. The pretense dropping. The real woman\r\n          scooping up the tie, tossing in a drawer.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm sorry. Really, I am. I\r\n          just...

WATCH STORE OWNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          WITH THE OWNER. Holding the CAR-15. Listening for his\r\n          target. His hand moves to the wound in his side, comes away\r\n          covered in blood. Another decision, the man slides the\r\n          weapon over his shoulder, retreats...\r\n          ...MOVING with the man, through his apartment. He reaches\r\n          his BATHROOM, blows inside. Tosses the toilet tank to the\r\n          side, reaches in and comes out with a military-grade STIM\r\n          needle which he JAMS into his own thigh.\r\n          A MOMENT with the Owner, feeling the drug course through his\r\n          system, giving him strength...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          59.\r\n          Steve comes out of nowhere, HITS the man in the head with a\r\n          heavy copper pot, sending him reeling back into the tub.\r\n          Steve starts forward, DIVES to the side as the man opens back\r\n          up, full auto, bullets CHEWING everything... CAR-15 finally\r\n          clicks empty.\r\n          Steve rises... and the Man is on him, kicking him. Steve,\r\n          rolling away. The man PULLING him back. WHAM! WHAM! Steve\r\n          takes brutal punches to the head and face. Blocks one and\r\n          they GRAPPLE, rolling in the tight space of the hallway, the\r\n          man coming up on top, pinning Steve's arm, SLAMMING him in\r\n          the ribs. Something SNAPS.\r\n          Steve SCREAMS, surges up with the man... smashing him THROUGH\r\n          a small table, winding up on top of him, his hand around the\r\n          owners throat...\r\n          The two men... eye to eye. Fierce, deadly. Steve SQUEEZING\r\n          the life out of him. The man's free arm HITTING Steve, OVER\r\n          and OVER. Brutal body blows. Steve takes the punishment...\r\n          continues to Squeeze...\r\n          ...Finally, the man weakening. In his face... a dull\r\n          resignation.\r\n\r\n                         OWNER\r\n\r\n                         (WEAKLY)\r\n          Who... are... you?\r\n          Steve doesn't answer, just keeps PRESSING. And finally...\r\n          the man's eyes film over. He dies.\r\n          Steve just KEEPS PRESSING. Locked. Horrified. Staring into\r\n          the dead man's face. Finally, he rolls off. Flops back\r\n          against the wall, broken, bleeding, weeping...\r\n          He SCREAMS. From the heart, the guts, releasing EVERYTHING.\r\n\r\n          INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop sitting at the woman's dining room table. Carefully,\r\n          she comes and takes the seat opposite him. No pretense.

Steve reaches over, turns on a table lamp as he looks\r\n          up. His face is BRUISED, bloody. His clothing, stained and\r\n          ripped. In his hand, Bishop's gun from the sideboard.\r\n          Bishop TENSES, doesn't react.

But I\r\n          think I was meant to do this.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          And like you said, you could use\r\n          someone.\r\n          Bishop studies Steve a long beat. Shakes his head, goes into\r\n          his study. Steve follows.\r\n\r\n          INT. STUDY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop fires up the computer hooked to the printer. He\r\n          glances over. Steve is standing in the doorway. Bishop\r\n          tosses Steve the jump-drive. Steve studies it, slots it into\r\n          the computer.\r\n          Almost instantly, the phone rings. Bishop punches on\r\n          SPEAKER. The same silence.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          We should all be so lucky.\r\n          The phone goes dead. The light on the drive turns GREEN.\r\n          Bishop's PRINTER fires up. It starts printing out pages...\r\n          ON BISHOP and STEVE. Watching the pages feed out.\r\n          PHOTOS: A new Mark at an elegant gathering of powerful men\r\n          and women. Tall, powerful, entitled. His arm around a\r\n          Turkish beauty in an elegant black one-piece. Emerging from\r\n          a limousine at a large public event. Security EVERYWHERE.\r\n          The same beauty on his arm. Charts. Height, weight, medical\r\n          history. Bank accounts, figures. Leases, deeds of property.\r\n          A LAST PHOTO: Peeling out of the printer... THE WOMAN, the\r\n          beauty, in a diplomatic power-suit.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          64.\r\n          A second to realize: She's the mark. More pictures, we've\r\n          seen this woman on television recently.\r\n          ON BISHOP AND STEVE, reacting. Then Bishop gestures towards\r\n          the large empty wall, waiting.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          You get started.

ENTRANCE, EMBASSY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Steve collects his cell phone from the other side of a metal\r\n          detector, slots a bluetooth and heads in.

Monitors visible.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (O.S.) (CONT'D)\r\n          How many views?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          (eyes moving fast)\r\n          Sixteen, no, eighteen. Four second\r\n          intervals.\r\n          One of the men notices Steve who starts forward to ask a\r\n          question. The man points him down the hallway towards the\r\n          consulat's reception.

BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Bishop is sighting through a camera affixed to the telescope,\r\n          headphones on. He's on the 14th floor of a skyscraper under\r\n          construction. Cement pillars and steel-work.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (O.S.)\r\n          These guys are packing Israeli-made\r\n          Uzis. Couple are actual military.\r\n          Bishop takes in the other buildings across the street, then\r\n          moves his sight up the embassy, adjusts a control\r\n          P.O.V. - THROUGH THE SCOPE: Large tinted glass windows\r\n          suddenly turn transparent. Bishop scans, find The Mark's\r\n          HUSBAND on the bed watching TV, bored. He scans again...\r\n          finds The Mark in the adjoining room, on the phone and ANGRY.\r\n          Bishop touches a switch on the telescope and a small LASER\r\n          projects. The woman's voice fills Bishop's headset:\r\n\r\n          TURKISH ENVOY'S VOICE\r\n          No, we're literally locked in here.\r\n          I'm supposed to be presenting at\r\n          the UN but I can't do that if\r\n          everyone is going to panic about\r\n          security...\r\n\r\n          INT.

Bishop moves his focus upwards to a\r\n          glassed-in terreriam-like structure on the rooftop. An\r\n          indoor swimming pool. \"Click.\" \"Click.\" More pictures.\r\n\r\n          INT.

That's gone now.\r\n          She needs to be taken seriously.\r\n          She hates that men only see the\r\n          beauty.

Desk, computer, a handwritten note reads\r\n          \"Leave mail here, will be back Wednesday.\" A box from UPS\r\n          which Bishop TEARS open. Inside, what looks like a large\r\n          WEAPON. Steve goes to the windows, pushes them open.\r\n          P.O.V. - THE EMBASSY ACROSS: Changing its security pattern.\r\n          Men are leaving posts on exterior patios, locking doors.\r\n          Below, the excess manpower is channeled to the front.\r\n          Bishop turns, FIRES OUT THE WINDOW. A Cable streaks across,\r\n          SINKS into the wall of the embassy 30 feet away. Bishop\r\n          HOOKS the cable on this side, tosses the gun in the box.\r\n          Steve seals it with tape, slaps a return label on it.\r\n          He crosses the hall, tosses it in the MAIL ROOM. When he\r\n          returns, Bishop's already secured the cable outside.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Ready?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          71.\r\n          Steve hooks on as well, they're both wearing harnesses under\r\n          their clothing. He steps out onto the ledge with Bishop,\r\n          closes the window behind him.\r\n          Bishop lets himself fall backwards.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREETS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Flashing light of the fire trucks. No one sees the two\r\n          figures sliding silently from building to building above,\r\n          disappearing over a 4th story railing.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BALCONY, EMBASSY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Steve lands next to Bishop who unfastens the cord they used\r\n          to cross, spools it back to them. A look. No way back now,\r\n          and no trace left behind.\r\n          Jackets strip, reverse to the pattern of the embassy\r\n          Security. A quick lock pick, and they slip inside.\r\n\r\n          INT. ROOF LEVEL, EMBASSY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Elevator doors open and the Mark gets out. She nods to the\r\n          guard on duty, heads into a changing room.\r\n\r\n          INT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Two guards monitor screens: Corridors, rooms, entrances and\r\n          exits. Pairs of guards make their rounds.\r\n          CLOSING IN ON ONE PAIR. Something about them... The guard\r\n          squints just as the image CHANGES, showing another part of\r\n          the embassy. The guard hits a toggle, returns the previous\r\n          image... But Bishop and Steve are gone.\r\n\r\n          INT. CHANGING ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Mark pulls the straps of her swimsuit up over her\r\n          shoulders. Stares in a mirror as she tucks strands of hair\r\n          under a swim cap.\r\n\r\n          INT. INDOOR POOL - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Quiet, lit from overhead by large halogen lights hanging from\r\n          the hanger-like beam structure. Dark shadows in the corners.\r\n          The low sound of water lapping, light reflecting off the\r\n          water, moving over walls.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          72.\r\n          The Mark enters, and hangs up her robe. She goes to the edge\r\n          of the pool, looks down into the water, then glances up at\r\n          the GUARD who's stationed across the space. He nods back to\r\n          her, moves to the lower space, giving her a little privacy.\r\n\r\n          EXT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A second guard looks in, rudely checks out the Mark as she\r\n          DIVES into the water and out of sight. He shrugs, looks back\r\n          out at the roof, lifting a cigarette to light... pauses.\r\n          ACROSS THE ROOF, an access door is open.\r\n\r\n          INT. INDOOR POOL - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Mark swims, hard. Cutting through the water. She\r\n          reaches the far wall and kick-turns against it.\r\n          UNDERWATER. Her body passing above us. Silhouetted by the\r\n          strong halogen lights above her. ONLY THE THROBBING SILENCE\r\n\r\n          OF UNDERWATER.\r\n          ACROSS THE SPACE. The indoor guard checks in on his radio.\r\n          Looks up as the DOOR nearest him swings open. He rises,\r\n          approaches the door, curious. Looks out.\r\n          HIS P.O.V.: The rooftop, lit by security lights, the\r\n          strobing of the firetrucks below. Dark shadows. He hears a\r\n          RUSTLING, a BANGING. Torn, he glances backwards. Can't see\r\n          the Mark in the pool from here, but can hear her strokes.\r\n\r\n          WITH THE MARK\r\n          She kicks hard, dives under... And we're in her P.O.V. The\r\n          far wall approaching, then we REVOLVE as she turns, now\r\n          looking UP at the surface as she backstrokes to the surface,\r\n          BREAKING THE SURFACE, now swimming face up to the bright\r\n          lights hanging from the girdered ceiling.\r\n\r\n          EXT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The second Guard tests the door. Seems fine. Takes out his\r\n          flashlight and plays it over the roof. Sees nothing. We\r\n          REVERSE to find Steve there, tucked away, just out of sight.\r\n\r\n          ACROSS THE ROOF\r\n          The first guard reaches the source of the noise: A plastic\r\n          bag, caught in a revolving air vent. He pulls it free.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          73.\r\n\r\n          INT. INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          With the Mark, coming out of another turn, still backstroke,\r\n          looking up. She makes it half way across the pool... pauses.\r\n          She slows... floating, staring upwards into the light.\r\n          HER P.O.V. The lights. But it's like she senses something\r\n          beyond them, puts a hand up to shield her eyes...\r\n\r\n          AND BISHOP DROPS FROM THE CEILING, FREE-FALL, COMING STRAIGHT\r\n\r\n          DOWN AT HER!!!!\r\n          She opens her mouth to scream...\r\n          WHUUMPH! He goes in, taking her with him underwater, his\r\n          momentum carrying them both several feet under. She TWISTS\r\n          in his arms, fighting. Screaming, bubbles FLOWING from her\r\n          mouth!\r\n          ABOVE THE SURFACE. It's silent. No sign of the violent\r\n          struggle going on below the surface.\r\n          ACROSS THE ROOM. Guard number one returns, glances up\r\n          towards the pool. Doesn't hear anything. He sits back in\r\n          his chair.\r\n          UNDERWATER. The struggle is violent, silent, terrible in\r\n          it's inevitable conclusion. The Mark writhes and jerks but\r\n          Bishop holds her tight, always pulling her away from the\r\n          surface. Finally, the fight goes out of her. She goes limp\r\n          in his arms.\r\n          He turns her, stares into her unseeing eyes. Then lets her\r\n          go, rising slowly to the surface.\r\n          AT THE SURFACE. Bishop just breaks, breathing in, silent.\r\n          He raises himself slightly, sees the guard at his post.\r\n          ACROSS THE ROOM. The guard glances back towards the pool,\r\n          hasn't heard anything for a little bit...\r\n          BAM! BAM! BAM! A new noise from outside gets his attention\r\n          again. He heads out, hand on his sidearm...\r\n\r\n          EXT. POOL STRUCTURE, ROOFTOP - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The guard approaches the same door Guard #2 already checked,\r\n          banging in the wind. Open again. He starts to move towards\r\n          it when a FIGURE looms, he almost draws his weapon, breathes\r\n          relief when he makes Guard #2.\r\n\r\n                         GUARD #2 (TURKISH)\r\n          It's the second time it's come\r\n          open. She still swimming?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          74.\r\n\r\n          INT. POOL STRUCTURE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The two Guards come into the pool area. On the far wall, the\r\n          shower is running, a towel has fallen over the drain and the\r\n          water is flowing down and into the pool.\r\n          One of the men steps forward, concerned...\r\n\r\n                         GUARD #2 (TURKISH)\r\n          Oh hell...\r\n          The Mark floats face-up in the pool, just under the surface.\r\n\r\n          INT. CHANGING ROOM, EMBASSY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop has already shed his wet clothing, pulls on dry\r\n          clothes as Steve comes into the room. They barely\r\n          acknowledge each other, business. Bishop stuffs the wet\r\n          clothes in a bag, dumps it into a LAUNDRY chute.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          How did it go --\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Not yet.\r\n          As if on cue, an ALARM BLARES. Excited voices come on over\r\n          an embassy wide PA System. VOICES from the next room.\r\n          Bishop opens the chute again as Steve cracks a glowstick,\r\n          puts it between his teeth, swings his legs in, and DROPS.\r\n          ACROSS THE ROOM. The door to the dressing room opens, armed\r\n          guards flood in, along with Embassy officials speaking on\r\n          radios. The room is empty.\r\n\r\n          INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Tight, PITCH BLACK except for the eerie glow coming from the\r\n          glowsticks Bishop and Steve have in their teeth. They slide\r\n          FAST, the sides of the tube RUSHING up at them. And then\r\n          suddenly a dim LIGHT at the bottom, rising fast...\r\n\r\n          INT. SERVICE ROOM, EMABASSY - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Steve lands hard in a cart of towels. Rises and pushes\r\n          himself out of the way just in time for Bishop who grabs the\r\n          pack he tossed down, shoulders it, and they're MOVING again,\r\n          now through sub-corridors.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Alright, you gotta admire that.\r\n          You gotta admit, we are a spooky\r\n          good team...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          75.\r\n          They PUSH through a set of old doors, move fifteen feet to a\r\n          metal roll-down door.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          It's like one moment we're there...\r\n          the next moment...\r\n          He ROLLS UP the door. STARES at a NEW WALL OF CEMENT BRICKS.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          ...we're fucked.\r\n          Bishop takes in the problem, starts to solve it. He tracks\r\n          left right, considering options...\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          There wasn't any sign of this on\r\n          the plans. I went over them fifty\r\n          times!! This isn't supposed to be\r\n          here! This can't be here!\r\n          Bishop holds up a finger. \"Shhhhhh\" They LISTEN. A soft\r\n          \"beeping.\" Both men PEER around the edge of the metal door\r\n          to where a small box with a red light BLINKS.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Bishop... what do we do!?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Duck...\r\n          Steve looks at Bishop and BOOM! Doors BLOW OPEN, THREE\r\n          GUARDS burst through, machine guns raised and SPITTING...\r\n          Steve hits the deck. Watching Bishop, it's like everything\r\n          we've seen so far was in slow motion. This is the real\r\n          thing, unleashed.\r\n          Bishop WRAPS the first man up, uses his Kevlar vest as a\r\n          shield to catch the fire from the other two. The man SCREAMS\r\n          as his arm breaks. Bishop gets control of his weapon,\r\n          focuses it on the other two. One is BLOWN back. The other\r\n          DIVES for cover.\r\n          Fluid, Bishop REVERSES the man, pushes him AWAY from him,\r\n          coming up with TWO of the man's Flash-bangs in each hand.\r\n          Each hand DIALS the grenade's timers to two different\r\n          settings, simultaneously POPPING the levers.\r\n          Second attacker FIRES a burst which Bishop DUCKS, the bullets\r\n          stitching across the first attacker, SLAMMING him back, his\r\n          rounds TEARING into the ceiling, showering Steve in debris.\r\n          Bishop THROWS the first grenade which reaches the attacker\r\n          just as he rises for another shot. BOOM!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          76.\r\n          Another down as ANOTHER ATTACKER dives through the door at\r\n          Bishop who wraps the man up, his fingers finding pressure\r\n          points on the man who goes limp in his arms, dead.\r\n          ON STEVE. On the floor, witnessing everything. Even in the\r\n          chaos, recognizing the move.\r\n          Bishop SHOVES the last grenade down the front of the dead\r\n          attacker's clothes, wheels him around, PRESSING him against\r\n          the concrete brick wall...\r\n          ... TWO more Security kick open a door, guns fire! Bishop\r\n          goes horizontal, his legs CRUSHING the one man against the\r\n          metal Grate even as he returns fire at the other two who fall\r\n          back and BOOM! The grenade goes off! Bishop is HURLED\r\n          against the far wall. SMOKE AND DEBRIS fill the space.\r\n          Bishop MOVES, hauling Steve to his feet and shoving him into\r\n          the ragged hole blown in the brick wall even as bullets trace\r\n          after them. A bullet catches Bishop in the side, he sprawls,\r\n          then LEAPS towards the hole...\r\n\r\n          INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Cover in the floor is tossed aside. Bishop and Steve emerge,\r\n          move 6 feet to a non-descript Buick. Climb in. The keys are\r\n          waiting, Bishop starts it up, drives up the ramp.\r\n          Next to him, Steve is catatonic, lost. As he drives, Bishop\r\n          RIPS a strip from his shirt, pads the wound in his side.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Hey! Hey! You still here?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          ...It was my fault. I was in\r\n          charge of the exit. I looked at\r\n          every work order, every entry in\r\n          the building logs...\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          No one controls 100% That's the\r\n          nature of the beast.\r\n          Steve swallows, nods as Bishop brings the Buick around a last\r\n          corner, ACCELERATING at the closed gate in front of them, a\r\n          Turkish guard waving his arms frantically...\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREETS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Firetrucks and ambulances already crowd the streets. There's\r\n          just no time or extra manpower left to react to the Buick\r\n          which plows through the gate of the locked garage.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          77.\r\n\r\n          INT. BUICK- CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Two blocks behind, a single police car follows. Bishop takes\r\n          a hard turn, moving FAST.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Hey! You did good in there. You\r\n          hear me?. It was asking a lot.\r\n          You came through.\r\n          Steve nods, processing, accepting. Another TURN. Bishop\r\n          slides the car to a stop in a covered lot. Across from them,\r\n          Bishop's own Cobra waits.\r\n          Behind them, the police car tears by, lost.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S CAR - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop drives down the small lane leading to his home. Steve\r\n          is staring out his window, deep in thought. Finally, looks\r\n          over. For the first time takes in Bishop's injuries.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You're bleeding.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          ...Yup.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          So back there.

BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Door opens and Bishop and Steve come in. Steve plops in a\r\n          chair, head in his hands. A beat, and then MUSIC filters in.\r\n          Neil Young's \"Needle and the Damage Done.\" He raises his\r\n          head, sees light glowing from the study.\r\n\r\n          INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits in a chair, eyes closed. Steve comes in, stares\r\n          at Bishop. Looks over and admires the surface of the\r\n          spinning record...\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Do you think you know it, when\r\n          you've made the mistake you won't\r\n          survive? Or will it be like the\r\n          Marks? Wake up on top of the\r\n          world, never know...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          78.\r\n          Steve glances into the open cabinet where Bishop keeps his\r\n          vinyl, FREEZES. Comes out with an signed album.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          ...Oh my God. This is a signed\r\n          Hendrix Axis, 1967 release. This\r\n          has gotta be worth... we have to\r\n          play this. You have to play this.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          (shaking head no)\r\n          That one... is for a special\r\n          moment. Haven't found it yet.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You haven't found the... Are you\r\n          kidding? You have to -- what?\r\n          Bishop's eyes SHOOT open. He looks out the window where a\r\n          series of SEDANS are pulling up. Men get out, approach.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          This could get... interesting.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop steps out of his home. One of the several men there\r\n          steps forward.\r\n\r\n                         MAN\r\n          Mr. Bishop? Mr. Dean would like a\r\n          moment of your time.\r\n          Off Bishop who... nods.\r\n\r\n          EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sedan pulls up, Bishop is escorted onto a private jet.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Steve stands in the middle of Bishop's home. Home alone.\r\n          -- Steve stares at the classic vinyl on Bishop's turntable.\r\n          -- Steve, wiring his IPod to Bishop's stereo. Nine Inch\r\n          Nails' \"Piggy\" comes blasting out, insults the speakers.\r\n          -- Steve moves to the bedroom, STARES at the haunting\r\n          painting. He reaches forward, takes it down. Nothing.\r\n          Blank wall behind.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          79.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Steve blasts in, lights glow on, illuminate the wall of\r\n          research on the Female Mark. He goes to the gas fireplace,\r\n          flames flicker up. Steve RIPS down the pictures of the\r\n          woman. Moves to the fire and feeds the first one in.\r\n          ON STEVE, watching. His eyes... Tracking to the side.\r\n          STEVE'S P.O.V.: Down, below the fire, stuck to the side of\r\n          the interior cavity... a scrap of paper...\r\n          Steve kills the fire, reaches in, carefully removes the scrap\r\n          of paper. A corner of a photograph. A few buildings,\r\n          distant, out of focus. Almost nothing.\r\n\r\n          INT. BATHROOM, PRIVATE JET - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop, shirtless, stares in the mirror. He checks the wound\r\n          in his side, splashes Vodka from a handful of mini bottles,\r\n          painfully re-wraps the wound.\r\n\r\n          INT. PRIVATE JET - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop emerges from the bathroom, peers out at the grey\r\n          monoliths of Washington D.C., below.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ROOFTOP, MCKENNA HOLDING CORP - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Gray morning. Wind blows. Steve stands alone, holding the\r\n          scrap of photograph, now in a plastic envelope. He stares at\r\n          where the chalk line has almost completely faded, then looks\r\n          up, taking in the views, vantage points. A half mile away a\r\n          building under construction rises high.\r\n\r\n          EXT. AIRFIELD - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop steps off the plane. Another sedan and driver waits.\r\n\r\n          EXT. OPEN CONSTRUCTION FLOOR - MORNING\r\n\r\n          P.O.V. THROUGH A CAMERA: The McKenna Holding Corp building.\r\n          Image focuses on the rooftop, shutter clicks.\r\n          Steve lowers the camera, looks at the display. He removes\r\n          the scrap from Bishop's fireplace, compares it... the same\r\n          buildings in the corner of the frame. Perfect match.\r\n          ON STEVE. No remaining doubt. Bishop killed his father.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          80.\r\n          WIDER. The SECURITY PROFESSIONAL is up here with Steve,\r\n          hanging back. Steve nods to him.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Do it. I don't care what it costs.\r\n\r\n          I/E. SEDAN - MORNING\r\n          Driver pulls the sedan to a stop in front of a large\r\n          nondescript building. Bishop steps out, alone on the street,\r\n          passes through the morning commuters, and goes in.\r\n\r\n          INT. NATIONAL SECURITY BUILDING - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop passes through a SECURITY CHECKPOINT. Post 9/11,\r\n          hyper-conscious. Metal detector. Smart guards backed up by\r\n          battle-ready US Marines. Bishop collects his ID, waits for a\r\n          door to \"click\" open.\r\n\r\n          INT. WAITING ROOM, NSA BUILDING - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits in a fluorescent lit room, now with a bar-code\r\n          badge on his coat. A few other people also wait. Bishop\r\n          checks his wound, pulls his coat closed to mask where blood\r\n          has stained his shirt.\r\n          A door opens and a plain woman nods to Bishop.\r\n\r\n          INT. DEAN'S OFFICE - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits in a chair. Through blinds, views of gray DC.\r\n          WIDER. We realize that the plain woman is sitting across\r\n          from Bishop, watching him. Finally, the door opens and DEAN\r\n          enters. Pasty white, slightly balding. It's hard to locate\r\n          where the sense of power come from, but it's there, innate.\r\n          He motions to the woman who leaves. Dean sits at his desk,\r\n          taps his fingers on it.\r\n\r\n                         DEAN\r\n          You look like shit.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          How does Harry McKenna's son figure\r\n          in?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          He's going to be working with me\r\n          from now on.\r\n\r\n                         DEAN\r\n          You sure that's wise?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          81.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Do I need your permission?\r\n\r\n                         DEAN\r\n          No... And for the record, I don't\r\n          believe you'd ask for it.\r\n          Dean grabs a remote control on his desk, points it at the set\r\n          of flatscreens on the wall which hum to life, muted.\r\n          News reports featuring the killing of the Turkish Embassador.\r\n          Shots of the woman, smiling. Helicopter shots of the pool\r\n          structure. Words scroll: \"Terror on our soil.\"\r\n          \"Assassination!\" \"US Envoy ejected from Turkey...\"\r\n\r\n          DEAN (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (POINTING)\r\n          That was my baby. But my baby has\r\n          turned into an epic shit-storm and\r\n          so when the man who caused said\r\n          epic shit storm suddenly decides to\r\n          do some soul-searching...\r\n\r\n                         (PLAINLY)\r\n          What are you doing, Bishop?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          The mistake was mine, not the\r\n          kid's.\r\n\r\n                         DEAN\r\n\r\n          I DON'T CARE.\r\n          Dean leans in, intense. Bishop watches the screens. A\r\n          screen changes to a commercial for a Bahamas resort.\r\n\r\n          DEAN (CONT'D)\r\n          I am on some very fucking thin ice\r\n          right now which means you are on\r\n          some very fucking this ice as well.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Someone I trained. That could be\r\n          worth a lot to you.\r\n          Dean laughs, rises with nervous energy and goes to the\r\n          interior blinds, raises one. From here they can see out over\r\n          the office. Glimpses of a dozen conversations. Other men\r\n          and women at work. More than a couple glance over towards\r\n          Dean's office. A predatory vibe.\r\n\r\n                         DEAN\r\n          And here I thought we were both\r\n          going to live forever.\r\n          Bishop smiles. Dean stares at him. Bishop stares back.\r\n          Suddenly, this becomes the moment, the decision...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          82.\r\n\r\n          DEAN (CONT'D)\r\n          You know, in this business, you\r\n          only get one mistake.\r\n          (off the flatscreens)\r\n          So nothing more like that. You\r\n          take full responsibility.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Yes.\r\n          The two men, face to face. Then Dean's phone rings. He\r\n          turns to it, snaps it up.\r\n\r\n                         DEAN\r\n\r\n                         (ON PHONE)\r\n          Hey, Stanley. Yes, we're all\r\n          sorted out. I just need you to --\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          The hit, on the woman. What was\r\n          the reason?\r\n          Dean looks back, surprised, angered.\r\n\r\n                         DEAN\r\n\r\n                         (ON PHONE)\r\n          I'm calling you back.\r\n          Dean clicks off, takes in this change of rules. A dead\r\n          seriousness infects his voice. Fear.\r\n\r\n          DEAN (CONT'D)\r\n          You know, this foul-up, McKenna's\r\n          son, it's all got some people's\r\n          panties in a real twirl.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          This isn't the time for questions.\r\n          This is the time for survival.\r\n          Everyone... is expendable.\r\n          Beat. Dean turns away, picks up the phone again.\r\n\r\n          DEAN (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (INTO PHONE)\r\n          Yeah, get me Stan again...\r\n\r\n          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Steve lays out by his pool, sunglasses, baking under the sun\r\n          as his group of hangers-on swarm around him. Play, dance,\r\n          splash. He's immune to all of it. Louise climbs from the\r\n          pool, water drips off her perfect form. She nestles in\r\n          behind Steve, her hands running over his body.\r\n          He stares straight ahead, as if she didn't exist.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          83.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          Come on, baby. What's the matter?\r\n          Finally, something does catch his attention: At the gate, a\r\n          DHL Van pulling up, the driver heading toward him. Steve\r\n          lowers his glasses.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Seen from far away, the sedan pulls up. Bishop gets out.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop enters, looks around. No sign of Steve, or any\r\n          disturbance. He moves through the house.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Steve! Steve...!?\r\n\r\n                         LATER\r\n          Bishop tense, in his study, holding the phone which rings...\r\n          rings... Steve's voice comes on the voicemail: \"Hi, this is\r\n          Steve. You know what to do.\"\r\n\r\n                         LATER\r\n          Bishop, sitting on his couch. On the TV in front of him,\r\n          images from a protest in Turkey, an American flag burning.\r\n          Bishop's eyes flick to the stack of DVDs from the woman. No.\r\n          He keeps watching the news images.\r\n          His phone rings. He snatches it up.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          Bishop.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (O.S.)\r\n          You're still alive.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Seems that way.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (O.S.)\r\n          Hey, can you meet me? Something I\r\n          want to talk with you about.\r\n          Bishop, silent.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (O.S.) (CONT'D)\r\n          It's important. Come up to the\r\n          house. Please, okay?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Okay.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          84.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop's sportscar pulls up in front of the large estate.\r\n          Bishop gets out, surveys the grounds. Weirdly quiet. The\r\n          windows of the house, dark. The grounds, empty.\r\n          He moves to the gates to the back yard, finds them open. He\r\n          pushes through, cautious.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop moves towards the darkened pool area. As he\r\n          approaches, Steve comes into view, standing by himself on the\r\n          edge of the diving board in the center of the dark space.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          There you are. Thanks for coming.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          What's on your mind?\r\n          Steve just smiles, shakes his head. Bishop stares at him,\r\n          tense, confused. Each trying to read the other.\r\n          Then Steve raises a bottle of whiskey to his mouth, drinks.\r\n          Bishop takes a step forward and...\r\n          ... LIGHTS WASH THE SPACE! Explosions! SOUND FILLS THE AIR!\r\n\r\n                         VOICES\r\n\r\n          SURPRISE!\r\n          Bishop ducks, rolls, his hand moving under his jacket...\r\n          ... but not coming out with his gun. He takes in a surprise\r\n          party, opening in front of him. Beautiful woman, LAUGHING,\r\n          blowing horns. Men, pouring champagne. STREAMERS falling to\r\n          the ground where seconds before they blew into the air, a\r\n          large BANNER, illuminated behind Steve: \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\r\n          ARTHUR!\" And Steve, standing on the board, master of\r\n          ceremonies, staring back at Bishop... oddly cool,\r\n          dispassionate. Then he smiles.\r\n          Bishop rises. Women come to him, touch him, put a party hat\r\n          on him and give him small kisses with wishes of \"Happy\r\n          Birthday\" as he moves to the pool edge across from Steve.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          It's not my birthday.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          When was the last time you\r\n          celebrated your real birthday?\r\n          No response from Bishop. Steve nods, swigs the bottle again.\r\n          He's lit, something fierce and fiery in his eyes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          85.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          See? You're overdue, buddy.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Who are these people?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          They think you're a friend of mine,\r\n          a producer, from Canada.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          In other words, they're all your\r\n          best friends.\r\n\r\n          EXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT (LATER)\r\n\r\n          Bishop sits on an outdoor sofa, surrounded by several\r\n          gorgeous aspiring MODELS. Steve sits across from him, Louise\r\n          under his arm. Bishop watches as one of the models ties a\r\n          cherry-stem into a knot with her tongue, presents it to the\r\n          group to a round of applause.\r\n\r\n                         MODEL\r\n\r\n                         (TO BISHOP)\r\n          So what movies have you made?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n\r\n                         (JUMPING IN)\r\n          Oh, he makes the really violent,\r\n          disturbing stuff. You wouldn't\r\n          know it to look at him, I know, but\r\n          what's locked up away in there...\r\n          (tapping his head)\r\n          Frightening, man.\r\n\r\n                         MODEL\r\n          God, I love those. Which ones --\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Mr. KcKenna has a creative\r\n          relationship with the truth. I\r\n          don't actually...\r\n          The model glances around, unsure...\r\n\r\n                         MODEL\r\n          Oh, okay. That's funny. So what\r\n          do you do?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Yes, Mr. Bishop. What do you do?\r\n          Bishop doesn't respond. He's just staring down.\r\n          BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Discarded, lying beneath the sofa the\r\n          models are perched on: The tear-strip from a DHL Envelope.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          86.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Come on, Mr. Bishop. We're all\r\n          waiting.\r\n          Bishop looks up at Steve who SMILES back. A beat, and then\r\n          Bishop is up and moving through the crowd, pushing by people\r\n          LAUGHING, DANCING. He almost runs into a bright blue-haired\r\n          woman on the arm of a jockish RAPPER.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Excuse me...\r\n          He comes up short, realizes he's staring into the face of the\r\n          Woman. She's utterly different than we've seen her.\r\n          Tonight, she's the clubbing party-girl. Dark lipstick,\r\n          bright blue wig, heavy eye-liner.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          Hi.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n          Hi... This is strange.\r\n          The Rapper she's with has found a group of his buddies. High-\r\n          fives all around. He glances around for his date...\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Is he your...?\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n          No, just a job.\r\n          (off his nod)\r\n          I have to...\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          I know. Go on.\r\n          She nods, turns away. He also turns, starts moving through\r\n          the crowd, pushing through DANCING BODIES...\r\n          ... and suddenly she's back with him. No words. Lights and\r\n          sound and dance around them. She leans forward, kisses\r\n          Bishop once. Backs off, smiles, turns away and makes her way\r\n          back to the guy she came in with who tucks her under his arm\r\n          without missing a beat, mid-story with his posse.\r\n          Bishop... staring. Turns away as the MUSIC STOPS. Steve's\r\n          voice fills the outdoor space, amplified.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Ladies and gentlemen! The man of\r\n          the hour!\r\n          A SPOTLIGHT hits Bishop. He squints up as the crowd makes\r\n          space for him. Steve's near the DJ, speaking on a mic.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          87.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          I know that not many of you know my\r\n          friend. My good, dear... friend.\r\n          I mean, he's a man of few words...\r\n          And he's an art lover! Did you\r\n          know that? His home is covered\r\n          with work. It's amazing, what you\r\n          can find in there. Amazing.\r\n          A weird beat. Steve, smiling fierce.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Happy birthday, Arthur.\r\n          Behind Steve, a covered object. Steve now turns to it, pulls\r\n          the cover off a PORTRAIT of Bishop, clearly done by the\r\n          Artist he collects. The image is twisted, vivid, disturbing.\r\n          As the crowd erupts in APPLAUSE the ARTIST himself now comes\r\n          forward, Steve's arm around his shoulder and bumping fists\r\n          before the Artist heads on towards Bishop, shaking Bishop's\r\n          hand. Faces BEAM. People CLAP. On Bishop, just looking at\r\n          Steve who stares back... unreadable.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop bangs out a door into the front drive, makes it to his\r\n          car, fumbles for his keys. Sweating, off-kilter.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (O.S.)\r\n          Hey, you forgot something.\r\n          Steve's there, holding the portrait. Bishop nods, takes it.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Sorry... Sorry for leaving. I'm\r\n          just not used to --\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          No worries, man. It's your party.\r\n          You can leave it.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          It's true, isn't it? What you said\r\n          to me the first time we met.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          What's that?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          This thing we do. Finally, you\r\n          always do it alone.\r\n          Bishop nods unconsciously, starts towards his car, forces\r\n          himself to stop.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          88.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Steve... thank you.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Uh-oh. I can feel some male\r\n          bonding coming. We gonna hug it\r\n          out, Bishop?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          No, I'm serious. Thank you.\r\n          People don't... Anyway, it's been\r\n          a long time, since someone did\r\n          something for me.\r\n          Steve looks back, nods. Strangely dark.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Happy Birthday, Arthur.\r\n          Steve raises a hand, shoots Bishop with a finger. A wink,\r\n          and he turns and is gone, back to the party.\r\n          Bishop climbs into his car, pulls away.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Bishop drives the car out of McKenna's estate, pulls out onto\r\n          the street. He starts to accelerate away... then STOPS the\r\n          car in the middle of the street.\r\n          ON BISHOP. Fighting what his guts are screaming at him.\r\n          Losing it, POUNDING on the steering wheel. Suddenly still...\r\n\r\n          EXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Party rages on, oblivious to the absence of its recipient.\r\n          Suddenly faces turn UPWARDS... to where Steve is looking down\r\n          on everyone from a third story balcony over the pool.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n\r\n                         (CALLING OUT)\r\n          Are you all having fun!\r\n          SHOUTS and NODS. LAUGHTER.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          I despise each and every one of\r\n          you!\r\n          MORE SHOUTS, LAUGHTER. Steve LEAPS out into space. Perfect\r\n          huge swam dive... falling... HITTING the water. A moment of\r\n          silence... did he? Was that deep enough...?\r\n          Steve ERUPTS out of the water. Party ROARS back into life.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          89.\r\n\r\n          EXT. GROUNDS, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          High above the festivities. Bishop slips over the wall,\r\n          makes his way down towards the estate.\r\n\r\n          INT. MCKENNA ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Dark and empty in here, party raging outside. Bishop enters\r\n          Steve's bedroom. Messy, the bed unmade. A woman's\r\n          underthings lying on the floor.\r\n          Bishop surveys the room, checks drawers, peers down into the\r\n          party below. He can see Steve in the middle of it all,\r\n          Louise on his arm, his hand on her ass.\r\n          Bishop moves to the office door, locked. He slides a pick-\r\n          set out of his pocket, gets to work.\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The door lock \"clicks\" and Bishop enters, closes the door\r\n          after himself and locks it, turns around...\r\n          The room has been STRIPPED of everything that was in here\r\n          last time. GONE are the paintings, the portraits, the\r\n          mementos. All traces of Harry McKenna, removed.\r\n          Instead, a SINGLE desk inhabits the center of the room, a\r\n          small computer monitor and keyboard centered on it. Bishop\r\n          comes around, touches a key on the keyboard. The monitor\r\n          glows to life with a single \"PASSWORD\" prompt.\r\n          Bishop stares at it. He sits, staring, concentrating...\r\n\r\n          EXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Steve has moved to the edge of the raised patio, looking down\r\n          into the valley. His eyes still, deep, impossible to read.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          Hey! Hey baby! Karen's got some\r\n          amazing E. You need to come try...\r\n          Steve turns those cool eyes on her. She shrinks. We think\r\n          he might slap her, then:\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Give me a moment. I'll be right\r\n          there. We'll do that amazing E.\r\n          And he looks away, back down over the view. A resigned\r\n          loneliness settling into his features.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          90.\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT (LATER)\r\n\r\n          Bishop, just staring at the password prompt which throbs in\r\n          front of him. Beat. His eyes flick across to the few books\r\n          lying on the desk. Weaponry, physiology... Greek Mythology.\r\n          Bishop reaches forward, types \"Nemesis.\" Hits ENTER. A\r\n          moment... and then our minds are blown.\r\n          The entire wall of the room in front of Bishop glows to life.\r\n          It's a one large high-resolution monitor. On it, glows an\r\n          infinitely detailed work-up on Bishop. A photograph on him\r\n          glows at the center of the screen, changing every three or\r\n          four seconds to another.\r\n          This is Bishop's method, brought into the 21st century.\r\n          Accounts, Medical charts, psych profile, associates,\r\n          residence...\r\n          Bishop approaches... takes it in. Touches \"Accounts\" and the\r\n          window SPREADS OUT across the whole wall. Multiple windows,\r\n          all of Bishop's money, displayed in real time, the numbers\r\n          subtly changing with the flow of foreign markets.\r\n          Another window above is labeled \"Associates.\" Bishop touches\r\n          this one and the financial windows are replaced with a\r\n          collage of FACES. Not too many. We recognize the Store\r\n          Owner and his Daughter. Steve himself. An older man \"Gerald\r\n          Bishop,\" Bishop's father. And a photo of the Woman.\r\n          Bishop touches the woman and multiple images propagate out\r\n          from the single. Many stills, but several are in motion,\r\n          looping: Childhood movies. A commercial done as a teen. A\r\n          blue movie when she was 20. Bishop's eyes settle on a video\r\n          image: He and the woman, caught just an hour ago in the\r\n          middle of the dancing party. The woman leaning to him,\r\n          kissing him.\r\n          Bishop stares at the image, then touches another image\r\n          labeled \"Residence.\" INSTANTLY, the images are replaced with\r\n          images of the interior and exterior of Bishop's home.\r\n          Bishop stares at them, confused. SQUINTS... realizing that\r\n          in one of the images, the trees lightly sway in the breeze.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Huh.\r\n          His eyes dart to an image of his DINING ROOM. It looks like\r\n          a still, until suddenly Bishops' cat passes through the\r\n          frame. Bishops' eyes dart, moving from frame to frame. The\r\n          whole interior of his life. His living room, bedroom, study,\r\n          gym. All live feeds.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          Son of a bitch...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          91.\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT (LATER)\r\n\r\n          Door BURSTS open, Steve pushing in, his arms wrapped around\r\n          Louise and another gorgeous woman from the party. As the two\r\n          women hit the bed, start undressing each other, Steve takes a\r\n          moment -- sensing. Something not right. He pulls keys from\r\n          his pocket, unlocks the study door, peers in.\r\n\r\n          STEVE'S P.O.V.: THE STUDY - EMPTY\r\n\r\n          LOUISE (O.S.)\r\n          Come on, Steve. We need you.\r\n\r\n          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Low end. Mean men and loose women. Metal on the juke. Duct-\r\n          taped naugahyde. Bartender on parole. Eyes raise as Bishop\r\n          pushes in, scattered focus, hits the bar.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Whiskey. Neat. Lots of it.\r\n          Bishop fumbles in his pocket, brings out a thick wad of cash.\r\n          $100s and $20s. Eyes track. At a booth, two EX CONS lock\r\n          onto Bishop, one sporting a middle-finger raised FU tattoo on\r\n          his bare shoulder. Bishop pushes $100 forward.\r\n\r\n                         BARTENDER\r\n          That's too much.\r\n          Bishop grabs the shot, down it.

If paranoia\r\n          and loneliness had a face, this is it.\r\n          REVERSE to find the Artist's portrait of him, hung on the\r\n          wall across, a surreal and distorted mirror. He chews his\r\n          food steady, even, acutely aware he's being watched.\r\n          We LINGER on the small camera eye tucked in the high corner\r\n          of the room, staring down...\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Steve sits half-naked in the office chair, the high-tech wall\r\n          illuminated in front of him. In the bed in the other room,\r\n          the two women are asleep, nude, draped over each other.\r\n          Steve watches Bishop leave his table. He hits a control and\r\n          the image SHIFTS, picks up Bishop checking his mail, grabbing\r\n          a baseball cap from a rack as Bishop moves to his den,\r\n          settles into a chair facing the television. Can't see his\r\n          face, just the back of the cap on his head, the tv screen,\r\n          set to white static.

No sign of Bishop.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Bishop moves through shadows.

He threads his way through\r\n          his collection of beautiful automobiles until he reaches the\r\n          far wall. He ROLLS up a large steel door...\r\n          ... revealing a wall, COVERED with his research on Steve.\r\n          Lots of it, weeks of work. He moves forward to a paper that\r\n          lists stats about Steve that includes a blank space for\r\n          \"Occupation:\" Bishop fills it in: \"Mechanic.\"\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          94.\r\n          Suddenly LIGHTS wash across the space.

No movement... Steve LEANS FORWARD, interested.\r\n          The DHL Driver knocks again, rings the bell. Still no\r\n          motion... and then Bishop RISES from the chair, makes his way\r\n          to the door.\r\n          Steve watches Bishop signing, closing the door and moving\r\n          into his living room where he opens the package, considers\r\n          the small jump-drive that slides into his hands.\r\n          ON STEVE. Watching.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S STUDY - MORNING\r\n\r\n          CLOSE on Bishop's weighted RP turntable. The needle coming\r\n          down... touching spinning vinyl. Stones' \"Sympathy for the\r\n          Devil\" croons out.\r\n          ON BISHOP, tacking up pages, photographs, financials. We\r\n          don't get a clear look, but some pages are redacted, there's\r\n          government letterhead. Personnel files, budgets,\r\n          itineraries. Many stamped \"CLASSIFIED.\"\r\n          Bishop draws lines, connections. Tosses some pages down,\r\n          pins others higher. Working it. He backs off, stares\r\n          through us.\r\n\r\n          INT.

BISHOP'S BACK PATIO - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Steve comes out to find Bishop working intently on a chemical\r\n          project.

EXTREME CARE.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          What's that?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          This... is liquid Semtex with a\r\n          built in combustible. Very\r\n          volatile. Nice and shiny once it\r\n          dries. But don't... scratch it.\r\n          Bishop takes a knife, scratches the surface of the coin-sized\r\n          disc, then backs off, by Steve, back into\r\n\r\n          INT.

They want it\r\n          fast, and they don't want it to\r\n          look like an accident.

Tripod, camera and telescope are quickly\r\n          assembled.\r\n          Bishop steps back, lets Steve take the first look.

He\r\n          looks exhausted.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          And you know, as much as I like the\r\n          quality time, unless you can read\r\n          lips, I don't exactly see what\r\n          we're doing here...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          99.\r\n          Steve glances at Bishop's pad where he's transcribing words:\r\n          \"No, no, tomorrow.

THROUGH THE LENS: EXTREME CLOSE on Dean's desk. A\r\n          piece of paper on the blotter. \"Click.\" \"Click.\"\r\n          Bishop pulls the memory-card from the camera.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n\r\n                         (INNOCENTLY)\r\n          You any good with computers?\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S BARN - DAY\r\n\r\n          Bishop is working on his classic Mustang. He's got the\r\n          steering column apart, working the mechanism. Focused.\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Steve is in front of the electronic wall of info on Bishop.\r\n          His hospital report open. In a separate window, video feed\r\n          of the real Bishop in his barn working on his car.\r\n          Steve marks the injury on Bishop, then opens a new window.\r\n          Multiple images of the scrap of paper on Dean's desk. Steve\r\n          gets to work enlarging, rotating, skewing the images...\r\n          Music and LAUGHTER filter in from outside. Steve becomes\r\n          aware of the noise from outside, frowns.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Steve emerges onto the high balcony overlooking the never-\r\n          ending party. He raises a GUN and fires into the air.\r\n          Faces, startled look up at him.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Everybody out. I'm serious. Get\r\n          the fuck off my property.\r\n          A moment, then people start to flee. Only Louise, drink in\r\n          hand, moves towards Steve, confused.\r\n\r\n                         LOUISE\r\n          Steve, baby...?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          100.\r\n          Steve levels the gun at her.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You, too.\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Steve comes back into his office, facing the wall. He tosses\r\n          the gun on the table, gets back to work. Glances at one of\r\n          the other open windows that shows Bishop at his fridge,\r\n          pouring himself filtered water.\r\n          Steve's hands fly. The images are pieced together, enlarged,\r\n          skewed until nonsensical markings resolve into an address.\r\n          Steve punches it into a search window, waits a beat, then\r\n          eyes scan over the list of returns, lock onto something.\r\n          He picks up the phone, punches a number. Watches as Bishop's\r\n          phone rings, watches Bishop answer it.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (O.S.)\r\n          Did you get it?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          It's the US Attorney's office in\r\n          New York. He's running. He's\r\n          trying to get out.\r\n          Steve, trying to read Bishop's face, ZOOMING in.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Do you think we're hitting him\r\n          because of what he's done, or\r\n          because he's trying to get away\r\n          with what he's done?\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (O.S.)\r\n          Does it make a difference?\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          ...No, I don't suppose it does.\r\n          A beat.

DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Steve and Bishop step out of the airport with bags, hail a\r\n          taxi and climb in, headed into DC.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          101.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (V.O.)\r\n          Security's going to have the actual\r\n          street locked down. But there's a\r\n          residential street, perpendicular.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DC STREETS - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Upscale streets lined with brownstone walk-ups. Steve and\r\n          Bishop walk with roller bags and a shoulder tube past mothers\r\n          and Nanny's ushering their children to school.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (V.O.)\r\n          High-end people. They'll put up\r\n          with a sweep, but they're not going\r\n          to allow an agent to spend the day.\r\n          They reach an address. Bishop puts on a hat, some\r\n          sunglasses, slaps a badge onto his jacket that reads \"DC\r\n          Municipal Utilities.\" He trots up the the half-flight, rings\r\n          the bell of an elegant brownstone.\r\n\r\n          INT. DC FLAT - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Nice. Lace curtains. Classic living room. Magazine racks,\r\n          grand piano, original art.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          Besides, the angle isn't right, too\r\n          flat. Except when they hit the\r\n          stairs. It'll spread the group\r\n          vertically. It's... the shot.\r\n          Steve and Bishop work in quiet efficient silence. Each opens\r\n          their bag, removes a series of innocuous objects, begins to\r\n          dismantle them for the more important parts they conceal.\r\n          From a clock, a firing mechanism. From the tube, an aluminum\r\n          barrel holds a fishing rod. The rod is discarded, the barrel\r\n          is attached to a hard plastic stock. AA Batteries are opened\r\n          and slender shells are removed from each.\r\n          As this strange choreography continues in silence, we PAN\r\n          ACROSS to the dining room where a WOMAN and a MAN are bound\r\n          and tied, pillowcases cinched over their heads. Their\r\n          bindings allow them to hold each other's hands which they\r\n          do, tight. They're terrified, but okay.\r\n          Back in the living room, Bishop adds the last piece to the\r\n          home-made rifle, a telescope, lifted from a child's gift box,\r\n          snaps it on top of the rifle.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          102.\r\n\r\n          INT. GOVERNMENT LIMO - DAY\r\n\r\n          Dean squints in the back of his limo as it pulls into\r\n          daylight. He's on the phone, eyes darting, nervous.\r\n\r\n          DEAN (O.S.)\r\n          Look, I don't care. Find her, I\r\n          need to talk to her right now...\r\n\r\n          INT. DC FLAT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Bishop puts the rifle to his shoulder, sights. Behind him,\r\n          Steve slips a blade from the crease of his suitcase,\r\n          considers it, looks back to Bishop.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          You ever worry about the right and\r\n          wrong of it all? I'm not talking\r\n          about God, just...\r\n          (tapping his chest)\r\n          Whatever you feel here.\r\n          BISHOP'S P.O.V.

You're telling me you've\r\n          never done anything just because it\r\n          was the right thing to do, even if\r\n          it didn't make any sense? You\r\n          never took a chance like that?\r\n          Bishop pulls his eye away from the scope a touch.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          Once I did...\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          How'd that work out for you?\r\n          Beat. Then suddenly Bishop's view is obscured by a large\r\n          truck, which has stopped trying to make the turn.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          We have a problem...\r\n          Bishop moves the scope, precisely looking for alternatives.\r\n          Nothing. He sets the rifle down, thinking as Steve takes in\r\n          the new situation.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          There's no shot.

We travel with him, to\r\n          the entryway. Keys, hats, jackets, sunglasses. Bishop grabs\r\n          a hat, tosses one to Steve.\r\n\r\n          STEVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Bishop...?\r\n          And Bishop's out.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Hats and sunglasses.\r\n          They descend the steps onto the sidewalk, closing on the US\r\n          Attorney building ahead.

You see him?\r\n          Coming up, a MAN in a jogging suit stretches, touches his ear\r\n          where's he's wired.\r\n          Steve and Bishop come abreast of him. WHAM! Steve pushes\r\n          him down into the garbage alley between two homes. WHAM!\r\n          WHAM! The man drops. Steve comes back, the man's gun\r\n          palmed. Offers it to Bishop.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (CONT'D)\r\n          No. You're the shooter.\r\n\r\n                         STEVE\r\n          When?\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP\r\n          You'll know when.\r\n          WITH THEM, MOVING, taking the corner onto the main street in\r\n          front of the large building.\r\n\r\n          INT.

The propane tank ERUPTS in flame.\r\n          Steve is knocked back.\r\n          When he rises, the interior of the car is an inferno. The\r\n          body is slumped against the wheel, the fire consuming him,\r\n          cleansing him.\r\n          Steve. Bleeding, bruised, victorious.\r\n\r\n          INT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Steve enters the study, looking down at Bishop's record\r\n          player, looks back at the wall of work on Dean. Smoke seeps\r\n          through the walls, pushes through cracks in sills.\r\n          Steve opens Bishop's record collection, takes the pristine\r\n          collector's Hendrix. The one never played.\r\n          He moves into the living room. FLAMES lick across the walls.\r\n          Through the smoke, he sees the portrait of Bishop staring\r\n          back at him. He raises the album in thanks.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Steve now stands outside Bishop's home, watching. The whole\r\n          place is an inferno.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          114.\r\n          INSIDE. Pictures bubble and peel before turning black in the\r\n          heat. The stack of DVDs melts, dripping down...\r\n          IN THE BARN. Flaming beams crash down, crumple classic cars.\r\n          Steve watches it all. The fire reflected in his eyes.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - DAY\r\n\r\n          A hot gorgeous day. Slight breeze blows through trees,\r\n          ripples the water on the pool which is suddenly CUT THROUGH\r\n          by the figure of Steve, swimming laps, hard.\r\n          He gets out at the far end, looks over his grounds. There's\r\n          no one here anymore. The place is deserted except for ear-\r\n          wired SECURITY who patrol the grounds.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - DAY\r\n\r\n          POLICE and FIRE pick through the smouldering rubble. A\r\n          DETECTIVE watches as the door to Bishop's fire-ravaged car is\r\n          pried off.\r\n\r\n          INT. MCKENNA ESTATE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Steve trots in from outside, pulling on a loose shirt. The\r\n          house is spotless, transformed. No sign of a frivolous young\r\n          man's pursuits. Art and culture and wealth.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - DAY\r\n\r\n          The door to the car gives suddenly, falls to the ground. The\r\n          Detective pulls a handkerchief, puts it over his nose and\r\n          mouth as he peers in at the body...\r\n\r\n          INT. MCKENNA'S OFFICE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Steve busts in, dragging his father's 80's turntable with\r\n          him. The portrait of Bishop has been hung here in his\r\n          office. He glances at it, then breaks the seal on the\r\n          Hendrix album, stares at the grooves before seating it on the\r\n          turntable and hitting a switch. Player starts up, needle\r\n          swings over...\r\n          Steve moves to his computer and punches in the password.\r\n          On the wall-sized screen, the Bishop research glows to life.\r\n          All the connections, people, history that made Bishop.\r\n          Bishop's cat jumps into his lap, purring, and Steve strokes\r\n          her. Finally, a decision. He hits a button and the prompt\r\n          \"DELETE FILE?\" Appears on the screen.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          115.\r\n          Needle comes down, touches the record, the sweet sound of\r\n          Hendrix's \"Little Wing\" fill the world.\r\n          Steve's finger still hovers over \"ENTER.\" Bishop's cat jumps\r\n          down, trots away. He watches the cat go, hits the button.\r\n          The wall-sized screen goes blank. Just a cool white nothing.\r\n          Steve SMILES, nods, leaning back... when a voice comes from\r\n          the record player, overlayed above the song.\r\n\r\n                         BISHOP'S VOICE\r\n          ...Steve, if you hear this, then it\r\n          means you found the right moment to\r\n          play the record. Good for you. It\r\n          also means you had to scratch the\r\n          needle across the surface of the\r\n          record.\r\n          Steve's eyes LOCK on the record player, the needle scratching\r\n          across its surface, from the surface of the record, the\r\n          smallest trace of smoke...\r\n\r\n          BISHOP'S VOICE (CONT'D)\r\n          Sorry it has to end this way.\r\n          Steve's eyes dart to the portrait of Bishop. Its cold eyes\r\n          stare back.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          KABOOOM! The windows of Steve's office blow out of the\r\n          estate's 2nd story.\r\n\r\n                         FADE TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. BISHOP'S HOME - DAY\r\n\r\n          The Detective, handkerchief over his face, leans over the\r\n          body. Burnt beyond recognition. CAMERA moves away, down to\r\n          the body's shoulder...\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (V.O.)\r\n          Every man has a death that's right\r\n          for them. Every one.\r\n          ... where a form, a heat shadow, has burnt into the charred\r\n          remains of a shirt. A fist, middle-finger raised. We know\r\n          this tattoo. It was on the ex-con who tried to mug Bishop\r\n          outside the bar. This is not Bishop.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          A death so right that when it\r\n          arrives, those who knew him will\r\n          say \"Yes, this is right...\"\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          116.\r\n          The detective leans the body forward, and the shadow\r\n          disintegrates into ash.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\r\n\r\n          A brand new Maserati crests the hill, moving FAST. Brakes\r\n          lock up, it slides to a stop in a patch of dirt.\r\n\r\n          BISHOP (V.O.)\r\n          \"...This was always going to happen\r\n          this way.\"\r\n          Bishop gets out. Shaved, healthy, clean. He climbs onto the\r\n          roof of the car, stares at the highway which winds away into\r\n          the distance.\r\n          Freedom, laid out before him. He stares at it, wanting,\r\n          needing. He blinks.\r\n\r\n          FADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n          THE END\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nMechanic, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Karl Gajdusek\u00a0\u00a0Lewis John Carlino\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:30:56.425578"}
