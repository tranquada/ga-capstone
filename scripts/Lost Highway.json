Naked under the covers, she switches out \nher bedside lamp.  The only light in the room comes from the \noutside, through the windows.  Fred moves closer to Renee, \nputs his lips to her cheek, a hand on her breast.  She does \nnot respond.  Fred pulls Renee to him, and kisses her \npassionately.  Renee accedes to his demands, but does not \nparticipate willingly.  He makes love to her voraciously, but \nher lack of passion disturbs him.

Fred starts the VCR and joins her.\n\nAs before, we first see it on the TV, then the videotape \nfills the frame.

ANDY, 37 \nyears old, a slick guy, is seen moving through the crowd, \nmaking small talk, kissing and being kissed.  The PEOPLE here \nare wannabe players, the men mostly shady, gold-chain-\nwearing, slightly unsavory types; the women dressed \nprovocatively, big hair and skin-tight dresses.  Through \nsliding glass doors we see nude and semi-nude people \ncavorting in a swimming pool.  Everyone has a drink in his or \nher hand.  Renee finishes her drinkt and hands the empty\nglass to Fred who walks away with it.  Andy grabs Renee, and \ndances with her.  They laugh and talk.  Renee appears to be a \nbit intoxicated.\n\nFred, who appears less than thrilled with the carryings on, \nmakes his way to the open bar where he orders two drinks. \nWhen the drinks arrive he drains one of them completely, then \nsets the empty glass down on the bar.  Then he swallows the \nother drink, too, and sets down the glass.\n\nA MYSTERY MAN, tall, well-dressed and groomed, older than \nFred, approaches him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMYSTERY MAN\n\t\tWe've met before, haven't we?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRED\n\t\tI don't think so.

He speaks into the phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRED\n\t\t\t(angrily)\n\t\tHow did you get into my house?\n\n\t\t\t\tPHONE VOICE OF\n\t\t\t\tMYSTERY MAN\n\t\tYou invited me.  It's not my habit to go\n\t\twhere I'm not wanted.\n\nFred looks at the man in front of him, but speaks again into \nthe phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRED\n\t\tWho are you?\n\nThe man laughs - identical laughs - both over the phone and in person.\n\n\t\t\t\tPHONE VOICE OF\n\t\t\t\tMYSTERY MAN\n\t\tGive me my phone back.\n\nThe man in front of Fred reaches out his hand for the phone.  \nFred hears the line go dead, and he slowly passes the phone \nback to the Mystery Man who takes it, folds it, and puts it in his pocket.\n\n\t\t\t\tMYSTERY MAN\n\t\tIt's been a pleasure talking to you.\n\nThe man walks away from Fred.

Very \nsoon, however, the sun passes behind a cloud and Fred is \nbathed in shade.  Fred stands up, but is almost immediately \nhit by a searing pain in his head.

The Doctor lifts \nFred's head and we see dark circles under Fred's eyes; his \nface is pale, teeth clenched, eyes tearing.  The Doctor takes \na light utensil from his pocket, and inspects each of Fred's \neyes.  He feels Fred's forehead.  After this, he allows \nFred's head to drop down again.  The Doctor takes Fred's \npulse.  He drops Fred's wrist.

Marian and Raquel take him by his hands and\nfeet and begin pulling him around the room as they dance.  \nAndy is blitzed, smiling moronically.  The girls' breasts \ntumble out of their teddies.  Raquel drops her end of Andy, \nturns up the music even louder, and dances into a frenzy.  \nMarian drops to her knees, Andy's feet on either side of her, \nshaking her shoulders and whipping her hair around.

EDDY\n\t\tYou know who it is.\n\nBill and Claire have stopped in the living room - watching \nPete.  Pete is going crazy with Mr. Eddy on one end, and his \nparents staring at him on the other.

I just wanted to jump on and tell\n\t\tyou I'm really glad you're doin' okay.\n\nThe phone goes dead and Pete sits - fearfully pondering his \nfate.  He hears a NOISE and turns.\n\nDown at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring \nat him.\n\nCLOSE UP ON PARENTS staring in the direction of the living \nroom as if sensing something, but not seeing.\n\nPARENTS POV - The hall and living room beyond.

Pete walks up \nthe street looking at numbers.\n\nHe finds 2224 Deep Dell Place - Andy's House.\n\nHe stares at the house from the sidewalk.\n\nLights are on upstairs and down.  The hot wind moves big \nshadows of trees over the front of the house.\n\nPete looks at his watch.  It reads: 11:05 p.m.\n\nHe walks down the driveway, crosses through some bushes and \ncomes to a fence separating the front yard from the back.\n\nHe stops and listens.  He pulls himself up and over the \nfence, but crashes on something on the other side.\n\nHe freezes - listening. He hears the wind blowing through \nthe trees, and distant music from inside - a slow jazz piece.  \nHe hears echoing sounds of love making.\n\nHe makes his way around back - goes up the stairs and tries \nthe back door.  It opens.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     CUT TO:\nINT. ANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nPete sneaks through the kitchen and comes into the living \nroom.  Pete stops short and stares.  A movie projector is \nrunning in the living room.  A porno film is being projected \non a huge screen at the far end.  Alice is in the porno film.  \nA man is fucking her from behind - with LOUD SLAPPING SOUNDS \nof flesh banging flesh.  Her face is in the foreground.  Her \neyes look out directly at Pete.  She is loving every minute \nof it.  Inside Pete, jealousy starts to rage out of control.  \nHe looks around.  He sees clothes scattered about.  He picks \nup a girl's sweater and smells it.  He looks up the stairs.\n\nFeet appear at the top of the stairs.  They start down.\n\nPete runs for the bar.\n\nAlong the way, he grabs a heavy, bronze figurine of a well-\nstacked woman off a rectangular glass-topped coffee table, \nand ducks behind the bar.\n\nHe can hear Andy approaching.  He can hear Andy gather two \nglasses.  He can hear Alice being fucked harder in the porno \nfilm.  He clenches his teeth with rage.\n\nSuddenly, Andy moves right in front of him.  They see each \nother.  Andy's eyes widen - Pete leaps up, and thwacks the \nbronze figurine down on the top of Andy's head.  Andy falls.  \nThe breasts of the figurine have made two bloody holes in his \nforehead.\n\nPete turns.\n\nAlice is coming quickly down the stairway - naked, except for \na pair of panties.  Lipstick is smeared around her mouth.  \nShe is carrying a half-filled pillowcase.  Her porno film is \nplaying on the wall \nbehind her.\n\nThese images jump and spin in Pete's mind.  He moves \nunsteadily toward her.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\tYou got him.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\t\t(still holding the figurine)\n\t\tAlice, I...\n\nPete starts to tremble.  He drops the figurine.  He tries to \nembrace her.\n\nThere is a crashing noise behind him.\n\nPete turns and sees Andy staggering, blood streaming from the \nwound in his head, THEN CHARGING FULL SPEED AT PETE.\n\nAndy hits him hard, and Pete goes down.  When Pete hits the \nground, he pushes Andy up and throws out his arms.  This, and \nAndy's momentum, catapult Andy into the corner of the \nrectangular glass-topped coffee table.  There is a sound like a\nhammer going through a bucket of eggs as the glass corner \nembeds about eight inches into Andy's forehead.\n\nCLOSE UP OF ANDY'S HEAD - impaled on the sharp corner of the \ntable, his chest area suspended, his legs and stomach \ntouching the floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\t(amazement - no feeling)\n\t\tWow!\n\nPete pulls himself off the floor.\n\nPete moves close to Alice, they drift to the glass coffee \ntable, staring for a few moments at Andy's dead body.\n\nWhile Pete stares, unbelieving, at Andy - Alice hurriedly \npicks up her sweater and puts it on. On the sofa next to it \nlay Andy's trousers.  She goes through the pockets, finds a \nroll of cash bound by a rubber band.  Alice hands the roll to \nPete.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE (CON'T)\n\t\tPut this in your pocket.\n\nAlice kneels next to Andy's body and quickly removes his \nRolex wristwatch, a couple of rings and the gold chain \ndangling from his neck.  These items she puts inside the \nempty pillowcase.\n\nAlice finds the rest of her clothes scattered about the \nliving room and puts them on.  Pete watches her, trembling, \nunable to say anything.\n\nShe comes back to Pete, who starts breathing irregularly, \nhyperventilating.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE (CON'T)\n\t\tYou all right?\n\n\t\t\t\tPETE,\n\t\tWe killed him.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\tYou killed him.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\tAlice?\n\nAlice slides up close to Pete.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\tIt was an accident... Accidents happen\n\t\tevery day.\n\nPete clutches her, eyes squeezed tight, as if he is holding \non for dear life.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\tAlice...\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\t(pushing back)\n\t\tWe gotta get the stuff and get out of\n\t\there.\n\nAlice starts off across the living room with the pillowcase.\n\nPete opens his eyes, he sees Alice move as a blur.  He looks \naround the room, which spins in and out of focus.  His eyes \nland on, a PHOTOGRAPH in a frame on the wall.  This photo \ntroubles him.  Pete squints, then points to the photograph.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\tIs that you?  Are both of them you?\n\nCLOSE UP OF THE PHOTOGRAPH - Four people appear in the frame: \nAndy, Renee, Alice and Mr. Eddy.\n\nAlice stops and comes back.  She looks at the photo, walks \ncloser to it, and points at herself.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\tThat's me.\n\nShe turns to Pete.  Pete is staring at the photograph - at \nAlice and Renee in the photograph.  His nose is bleeding\nprofusely.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE (CON'T)\n\t\tPete?...\n\nPete starts to reel - blood from his nose soaking his shirt.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\tWhere's the bathroom?\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\tUp the stairs - down the hall.\n\nPete runs up the stairs\t- about to get sicker. Alice watches\nhim go with a nuance of\tdisdain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      CUT TO:\n\nINT. ANDY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT\n\nPete staggers toward the bathroom at the rear right of the \nhallway.  THE HALLWAY SUDDENLY BECOMES HAZY, DIFFERENT AND \nLONGER THAN IT APPEARED TO BE.\n\nPete wanders down this \"changed\" hall.  On his left, he \nidentifies a door with the number 25 on it.  He pauses for a \nmoment in front of it, then goes on until, on his right, he \ncomes to a door with the number 26 on it.  He enters through \nthis door.\n\nInside is a WOMAN in front of a mirror with a MAN.  Her arms \nare resting on a shelf under the mirror as the man takes her \nfrom behind.  The man's face is blank, featureless, and is \nburied in the woman's back - we can't see it.\n\nPete now sees that the woman is an extremely whorish version \nof Alice - she's looking at Pete's reflection in the mirror.  \nHe's looking at her reflection in the mirror.  Pete's head is \npounding.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN/ALICE\n\t\t\t(to Pete)\n\t\tDid you want to talk to me?\n\nPete rubs his head - the pain is severe.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN/ALICE\n\t\t\t\t(CON'T)\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tDid you want to ask me \"why\"?\n\nPete staggers out of the room.\n\nHe closes the door.  The hallway has \"changed\" back to Andy's \nhallway.  The doors no longer have numbers.\n\nPete walks, unsteadily, back down the hall - faltering.  He \nstarts down the stairs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      CUT TO:\n\nINT. ANDY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nPete comes downstairs to the living room and sees Alice at \nthe desk in the corner, filling the pillowcase with cash and \njewelry.\n\nShe has a PISTOL in her hand.\n\nAlice turns when she hears Pete and they study each other's \nface as Pete makes his way to her.  His head is still \nthrobbing with pain.  His focus goes from her face to the gun \n- which is pointing right at him - back to her.  Alice \nsmiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\tDon't you trust me, Pete?...\n\nShe laughs and hands him the pistol.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE (CON'T)\n\t\tStick that in your belt.\n\nShe shows him the pillowcase filled with loot.\n\n\t\t\t\tALICE (CON'T)\n\t\t\t(going through the loot)\n\t\tLook at all this shit...

Pete takes the revolver out of his belt.  He \nopens the driver's side door of Andy's car and slowly sits \ninside.  He sets the pistol on the seat between them.  He \nlooks up at her.

She waits \nin front of the door for a few moments, her hair blowing in \nthe wind.\n\nA HOUSEBOY opens the door.  Alice says something to him -\nPete cannot bear anything that is said, even though his \ndriver's side window is down.  All he can hear is the hot \nwind blowing.\n\nThe Houseboy moves out to where he can see Pete, waiting in \nthe car.  The Houseboy and Alice exchange information.

She can't get anything in but \nstatic, with bits and pieces of old tunes fading in and out.  \nShe hits the \"seek\" button.

He begins to kiss her back.  \nShe starts to move him in a dance to the music in the glare \nof the headlights, the hot wind caressing them.\n\nThe scene is out of a dream.  Alice and Pete help each other \nundress as they dance in and out of the light, and the wind \nwhips at their bodies.\n\nThey sink down on the soft ground and start making love.\n\nThe lights from the headlights combine with the starlight, \nbathing them in a pristine glow.\n\nThe music fades and the radio begins to \"seek\" through static \nfor another station.  The music it finds now is LOUD and \nINTENSE.\n\nAlice - her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her \napproach to love making with Pete.  She is the aggressor, \nhighly-charged - she wants more and more - taking, not \ngiving, insatiable.\n\nThe headlights flare their bodies in blinding light.  They \nbecome amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light.\n\nPete is trying desperately to please her - to have her.\n\nThe driving music fills with cracks of piercing static.

He \nstarts toward Fred.\n\nThe starter motor moans as Fred twists the key frantically.\n\nThe smiling Mystery Man is almost at the car,\n\nThe engine catches.

Mr. Eddy/Laurent is asleep next to her.  \nRenee stands up, finishes dressing, then leans down and \nkisses her lover while he sleeps.  Renee leaves the room, \nclosing the door as quietly as possible behind her.\n\nAs the door CLICKS, Mr. Eddy/Laurent wakes up.  He sits up \nand gets a pack of cigarettes from the bedside table, shakes \none out, lights it with a book of \"Lost Highway Hotel\" \nmatches, and smokes it while seated on the edge of the bed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     CUT TO:\n\nINT. LOST HIGHWAY HOTEL - ROOM 25 - PRE-DAWN\n\nFred, still fully dressed, is waking up, AS IF IN A TRANCE -\nthe same attitude he had on the videotape.

He takes the edge of the window \ncurtain and pulls it back.\n\nThe view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel.\n\nFred's POV: He sees Renee, down below, walk over to a car, \nget in and drive away.\n\nFred walks back to his bed, picks up his revolver from under \nthe pillow, crosses the room to the door and walks out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    CUT TO:\n\nINT.

Fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into \nthe driver's side of what is obviously Mr. Eddy/Laurent's car \n- the Mercedes 600 Pullman.\n\nAs Fred drives away, a HAND appears in our window foreground. \nThe hand moves the window curtain further to one side.  The \ncamera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the Mystery \nMan.

Blood \nis flowing rapidly through his fingers and over the front of \nhim as be turns and opens his mouth with a gurgling sound.\n\nFred stands, facing him, his pistol out now - pointing right \nat Mr. Eddy/Laurent's forehead.\n\nCLOSE UP ON MR.

He turns it on and hands it over to Mr. \nEddy/Laurent, who manages to take it.\n\nMr. Eddy/Laurent looks down at the small television screen.\n\nMr. Eddy/Laurent's POV: As he watches the TV screen, we move \nin until the screen fills the frame - as with the former \nvideotapes.
