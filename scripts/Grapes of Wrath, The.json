At some distance, \n               hoofing down the highway, comes Tom Joad. He wears a new \n               stiff suit of clothes, ill-fitting, and a stiff new cap, \n               which he gradually manages to break down into something \n               comfortable. He comes down the left side of the road, the \n               better to watch the cars that pass him. As he approaches, \n               the scene changes to a roadside short-order RESTAURANT on \n               the right side of the road. From it comes the sound of a \n               phonograph playing a 1939 popular song. In front of the eatery \n               is a huge Diesel truck labeled: OKLAHOMA CITY TRANSPORT \n               COMPANY. The driver, a heavy man with army breeches and high-\n               laced boots, comes out of the restaurant, the screen door \n               slamming behind him. He is chewing on a toothpick. A waitress \n               appears at the door, behind the screen.\n\n<b>                                     WAITRESS\n</b>                         When you be back?\n\n<b>                                     DRIVER\n</b>                         Couple a weeks.

Getting behind the wheel, he is releasing the handbrake \n               when Tom appears at the driver's seat window.\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         How about a lift, mister?\n\n<b>                                     DRIVER\n</b>                         Can't you see that sticker?\n\n               He indicates a \"No Riders\" sticker on the windshield.\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         Sure I see it.

It is day, and \n               Tom is seated beside the driver, who is surreptitiously eyeing \n               him, trying to confirm some suspicion--an inspection which \n               Tom ignores at first.\n\n<b>                                     DRIVER\n</b>                         Goin' far?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                              (shaking his head)\n                         Just a few miles.

Not actually crazy, Muley is a \n               little touched. His eyes rove upward as he listens to the \n               sound of the storm, the sough of the wind and the soft hiss \n               of the sand. Then...\n\n<b>                                     MULEY\n</b>                         The way it happens--the way it \n                         happened to me--the man come one \n                         day...\n\n               The scene dissolves to MULEY'S DOORYARD. It is a soft spring \n               day, with the peaceful sounds of the country. Seated in a \n               three-year-old touring car is THE MAN, a city man with a \n               collar and tie. He hates to do what he is doing and this \n               makes him gruff and curt, to hide his misgivings. Squatted \n               beside the car are Muley, his son-in-law, and a half-grown \n               son. At a respectful distance stand Muley's wife, his \n               daughter, with a baby in her arms, and a small barefooted \n               girl, watching worriedly. The men soberly trace marks on the \n               ground with small sticks. A hound dog sniffs at the automobile \n               wheels.\n\n<b>                                     THE MAN\n</b>                         Fact of the matter, Muley, after \n                         what them dusters done to the land, \n                         the tenant system don't work no more. \n                         It don't even break even, much less \n                         show a profit.

We see the backs of \n               Muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder \n               watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them. It \n               is at some distance. Muley holds a shotgun. His son has a \n               baling hook. The son-in-law has a two-by-four. Behind them \n               is their cabin. Frightened and huddled together are the women \n               and children.

The womenfolks scamper out of \n               the way as the tractor heads for a corner of the house. It \n               goes over a ramshackle fence and then a feeble little flower \n               bed. Muley and the two younger men walk along. Breathing \n               hard, frightened and desperate, Muley is shouting warnings \n               at Davis, but the roar of the tractor drowns his voice. The \n               dog barks excitedly, snarling at the tractor. THE WOMENFOLKS \n               stand watching, terrified but dead pan, until a cry bursts \n               from Muley's wife.\n\n<b>                                     WIFE\n</b>                         Don't!

The corner of the \n               house sinks. MULEY lifts his shotgun, aims it, holds it, and \n               then slowly lowers it. As he stands looking at what has \n               happened his shoulders sag. He seems almost to shrink.\n\n               The scene dissolves to MULEY, once more in the back room of \n               Tom's old home, as the sound of the storm continues.\n\n<b>                                     MULEY\n</b>                              (dully)\n                         What was the use.

The sound of the dust storm \n               continues strongly.\n\n               The scene dissolves to the EXTERIOR OF THE CABIN at night. \n               It is several hours later and the sound of the storm has \n               faded out. Now all is silence as first Tom, then Casy, and \n               finally Muley steps out of the cabin and looks around. There \n               is still a slight fog of dust in the air, and clouds of \n               powderlike dust shoot up around their feet. All three men \n               have wet rags tied over their mouths and noses.\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         She's settlin'.\n\n<b>                                     CASY\n</b>                         What you figger to do?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         It's hard to say.

The cornstalks, \n               their roots blown clean and clear of the earth, lie fallen \n               in one direction. This is what has happened to farms that \n               were once rich and green. Then Uncle John's cabin comes into \n               view. It is just after sunup. The air is filled with country \n               sounds--a shrill chorus of birds, a dog barking in the \n               distance. The cabin is of the same general appearance as the \n               Joad cabin but even smaller. Smoke curls from the chimney.\n\n               We see a PLATTER ON A TABLE, inside the cabin. The platter \n               is filled with sidemeat.

They are Pa, Grampa, Granma, Noah, and Uncle John. \n               Two children, Ruthie and Winfield, stand to the table, because \n               there are no more chairs. Their heads are all bent as Ma, \n               standing with a fork in her hand between the table and the \n               stove, ends the grace. Heads lift and there is a bustle as \n               Ma turns back to the frying pork on the stove and the others \n               truck into their food.

We be out. We be out by sunup.\n\n               The touring car's engine is still heard after the men drive \n               off. The Joads watch the car, their heads turning, their \n               eyes following, expressionless.\n\n               The scene dissolves to the BACKYARD just before dawn. Now \n               and then a rooster crows. A couple of lanterns light the \n               scene as the man load the truck. It is nearly done, the body \n               piled high but flat with boxes, and more tied on running \n               boards. Al has the hood open and is working on the motor.\n\n               Noah, Casy, Uncle John, Connie, Pa, and Tom are at various \n               tasks. They talk as they work.\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                              (to Pa)\n                         How you get all this money?\n\n<b>                                     PA\n</b>                         Sol' things, chopped cotton--even \n                         Grampa.

The room \n               itself has been pretty well stripped, with only trash and \n               discarded things left. In Ma's lap is a pasteboard shoebox \n               and she is going through the meager treasures stored in it, \n               to see what must go and what she can take with her. Her eyes \n               are soft and thoughtful as each item brings a memory, but \n               not sad. Occasionally she smiles faintly. She pulls out a \n               letter, looks at it, starts to throw it into the fire, then \n               puts it back in the box. Her hand pulls out a PICTURE \n               POSTCARD. We see it in Ma's hand. It is a picture of the \n               Statue Of Liberty. Over it: \"Greetings from New York City.\" \n               She turns it over. It is addressed: \"Mrs. Joad RFD 254 \n               Oklahomy Territory.\" In the space for a message: \"Hello honey. \n               Willy Mae.\"\n\n               MA, after a moment of studying it, throws the card into the \n               fire. She lifts the letter again, puts it back. She pulls \n               out a worn NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. We see it in Ma's hand. The \n               headline is: \"JOAD GETS SEVEN YEARS.\"\n\n               MA drops the clipping into the fire. Rummaging around, she \n               pulls out a small CHINA DOG. We see it closely as before. On \n               it is printed: \"Souvenir of Louisiana Purchase Exposition--\n               St. Louis--1904.\"\n\n               MA studies the dog, smiling, remembering something that it \n               meant in her life. Then she puts in in a pocket in her dress. \n               Next she pulls out some pieces of cheap jewelry; one cuff \n               link, a baby's signet ring, two earrings. She smiles at the \n               ring, then pockets it. The cuff link too. The earrings she \n               holds for a moment longer, then looks around to make sure \n               nobody sees, then holds them to her ears, not looking into \n               any kind of a mirror, just feeling them against the lobes of \n               her ears, as once perhaps she wore them. Her eyes are grave.\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                              (from the door)\n                         How about it, Ma?\n\n<b>                                     MA\n</b>                         I'm ready.\n\n               Tom disappears. Ma looks at the earrings, and then at the \n               contents of the box. She lifts out the letter again and looks \n               at it. Then, without drama, she drops it into the fire. She \n               watches it burn. Her eyes are still on the flame as she calls.\n\n<b>                                     MA\n</b>                         Rosasharn honey! Wake up the chillun. \n                         We're fixin' to leave.\n\n               The flame dies down.\n\n               In the BACKYARD it is grey dawn. There is a thrill of quiet \n               excitement as they all stand around the loaded truck, hats \n               on, putting on coats. The ones missing are Ma, Rosasharn, \n               the children, and Grampa. Pa is in charge.\n\n<b>                                     PA\n</b>                              (as Ma comes out of \n                              the cabin)\n                         Where's Grampa?

It is in a gap in \n               the mountains and beyond can be seen the Painted Desert. A \n               border guard halts the Joad truck. He is not as tough as his \n               words indicate, just curt and matter-of-fact.\n\n<b>                                     GUARD\n</b>                         Where you going?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                              (who is driving)\n                         California.\n\n<b>                                     GUARD\n</b>                         How long you plan to be in Arizona?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         No longer'n we can get acrost her.\n\n<b>                                     GUARD\n</b>                         Got any plants?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         No plants.\n\n<b>                                     GUARD\n</b>                              (putting sticker on \n                              windshield)\n                         Okay.

Their silence is eloquent. \n               The faces of the Joads are blank with dismay, for this is an \n               unattractive sight indeed.\n\n<b>                                     PA\n</b>                              (finally)\n                         There she is, folks--the land a milk \n                         an' honey--California!\n\n<b>                                     CONNIE\n</b>                              (sullenly)\n                         Well, if *that's* what we come out \n                         here for...\n\n               They look at each other in disappointment.\n\n<b>                                     ROSASHARN\n</b>                              (timidly, to Connie)\n                         Maybe it's nice on the other side. \n                         Them pitchers--them little pos'cards--\n                         they was real pretty.\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                              (rallying them)\n                         Aw, sure.

Then the scene \n               dissolves to the BANK OF A RIVER. The camp at Needles is on \n               the bank of the Colorado River, among some willows. We see \n               the man of the family sitting chest-deep in the shallow \n               waters, talking, occasionally ducking their heads under, \n               reveling in this relief.

Taking \n               it from the book, there is a breath-taking view of the valley \n               from where Highway 66 comes out of the mountains. This is \n               the California the Joads have dreamed of, rich and beautiful, \n               the land of milk and honey. It is just daybreak, with the \n               sun at the Joad's back. They have pulled off the side of the \n               road and stopped, just to drink in the sight.

Ruthie and Winfield stand watching \n               the pot. About fifteen ragged, barefooted children in a half-\n               circle are now around the fire, their solemn eyes on the pot \n               of stew.

One gets out.\n\n               A GROUP OF MEN are squatting in a half-circle, the usual \n               pattern for conversation, but they are silent now as their \n               eyes fix on the man approaching.

A gravel road leads from the paved highway to the \n               big wire gates, which are enclosed. Along the side of the \n               paved highway are parked a dozen jalopies, the migrants \n               sitting soberly in them. Fifty or sixty other migrants line \n               the gravel road and the junction with the paved highway. \n               Five jalopies are in line waiting to enter the gates. And \n               the scene is overwhelmingly policed. There must be ten \n               motorcycle cops around. Six are dismounted and strolling to \n               keep order among the migrants along the road. Three, their \n               motorcycles roaring, flank the line of five jalopies. As the \n               Joad truck drives up, we see the FRONT SEAT. Tom, Al, and Ma \n               are beholding the scene with bewilderment.\n\n<b>                                     AL\n</b>                         What is it, a wreck?\n\n<b>                                     COP\n</b>                              (on motorcycle)\n                         Where you think you're going?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         Fella named Spencer sent us--said \n                         they was work pickin' peaches.\n\n<b>                                     COP\n</b>                         Want to work, do you?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         Sure do.\n\n<b>                                     COP\n</b>                         Pull up behind that car.\n                              (Calling)\n                         Okay for this one.

At the same \n               time, as the gates open and the six cars start through, \n               flanked by the motorcycle cops, the migrants begin spasmodic \n               shouts, but what they say cannot be understood. As the cars \n               move slowly, Tom and Al in the FRONT SEAT are puzzled and \n               worried at the demonstration.\n\n<b>                                     AL\n</b>                         Maybe the road's out.\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         I don't know what these cops got to \n                         do with it but I don't like it.\n                              (Looking out)\n                         An' these here are our own people, \n                         all of 'em. I don't like this.\n\n               AT THE GATES the heckling from the bystanders is spasmodic, \n               not continuous, as the six jalopies in line pass through the \n               gate into the Hooper ranch. Two men stand beside the gates \n               with shotguns. They keep calling.\n\n<b>                                     MEN\n</b>                         Go on, go on!

The \n               houses are small, square blocks, set in line. One, a little \n               larger, is a grocery store. Casually about are men in pairs \n               with metal stars on their shirts and shotguns in their hands. \n               Two bookkeepers are already passing down the cars and jotting \n               down information.\n\n<b>                                     BOOKKEEPER\n</b>                         Want to work?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         Sure, but what is this?\n\n<b>                                     BOOKKEEPER\n</b>                         That's not your affair.

There is a faint moonlight, but not \n               much, and little sound from the other houses as Tom strolls \n               down the street.\n\n               NEAR THE GATE: beyond, cars pass. As Tom approaches the gate \n               a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises \n               from a box.\n\n<b>                                     GUARD\n</b>                         Where you think you're going?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         Thought I'd take a walk.

Rising, he crosses the paved highway.\n\n               AN EMBANKMENT across the road from the wire fence: Tom \n               clambers down it, moving quietly. He picks his way down the \n               shallow ravine.\n\n               A TENT: there is a light inside and there are the shadows of \n               figures. In the background, beyond the tent, is the silhouette \n               of a small concrete bridge spanning a small stream. Following \n               a trail, Tom enters and approaches the tent. (The opening is \n               away from him.) IN FRONT OF THE TENT, a man sitting on a box \n               looks up suspiciously as Tom enters. His name is Joe.\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         Evenin'.\n\n<b>                                     JOE\n</b>                         Who are you?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         Jus' goin' pas', that's all.\n\n<b>                                     JOE\n</b>                         Know anybody here?\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         No. Jus' goin' pas', I tell you.\n\n               A head sticks out of the tent.

He wears a tight-fitting wool suit, a tie \n               on his shirt, yellow shoes, and his hair is damp and slicked \n               down. He rubs his hands together in anticipation as he strolls \n               in the direction of the dance floor.\n\n               At ANOTHER TENT, a blonde girl sits on a box as Al enters. \n               Casually he throws open his coat, revealing a vivid striped \n               shirt.

This is during a pause between dances \n               and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for the \n               music to begin again.

From a piece of wood on the \n               ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts \n               and lights it. While he is doing so, he lifts his head \n               suddenly, and listens.\n\n               In the CAMP STREET we catch sight of legs walking, the ground \n               lighted from a flashlight. Two pairs of the legs wear state \n               policemen's leather leggings. The third pair are the \n               caretaker's. They stop behind a car. The flashlight plays on \n               the license plate. One of the state cops leans down to copy \n               the license number in a booklet. Then they move on.\n\n               TOM has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle, enough to see \n               out by flattening his head on the floor. The LEGS are now \n               seen at the Joad jalopy. The light is on the license plate. \n               The cop leans over and copies the number. They move on.\n\n               TOM, lowering the edge of the tent, sits up. Quietly he pushes \n               aside the piece of carpet that covers him. He is wearing his \n               clothes. We see the policeman's CAR at the caretaker's hut. \n               The two policemen get into the car.\n\n<b>                                     CARETAKER\n</b>                         You got no right to arrest anybody \n                         without a warrant, you know.\n\n<b>                                     FIRST COP\n</b>                         We'll have a warrant--just as soon \n                         as we check with headquarters.\n\n               The car drives off, leaving the caretaker looking somberly \n               after it.\n\n               WITHIN THE JOAD TENT, his cap on, fully dressed for travel, \n               Tom is tieing the ends of the carpet into a shoulder bundle. \n               Rising, he slings it across his shoulder.
