At some distance, \n               hoofing down the highway, comes Tom Joad. He wears a new \n               stiff suit of clothes, ill-fitting, and a stiff new cap, \n               which he gradually manages to break down into something \n               comfortable. He comes down the left side of the road, the \n               better to watch the cars that pass him. As he approaches, \n               the scene changes to a roadside short-order RESTAURANT on \n               the right side of the road. From it comes the sound of a \n               phonograph playing a 1939 popular song. In front of the eatery \n               is a huge Diesel truck labeled: OKLAHOMA CITY TRANSPORT \n               COMPANY. The driver, a heavy man with army breeches and high-\n               laced boots, comes out of the restaurant, the screen door \n               slamming behind him. He is chewing on a toothpick. A waitress \n               appears at the door, behind the screen.\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n                         When you be back?\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Couple a weeks. Don't do nothin' you \n                         wouldn't want me to hear about!\n\n               We see him climbing into the cab of the truck from the right \n               side. Getting behind the wheel, he is releasing the handbrake \n               when Tom appears at the driver's seat window.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         How about a lift, mister?\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Can't you see that sticker?\n\n               He indicates a \"No Riders\" sticker on the windshield.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Sure I see it.

It is day, and \n               Tom is seated beside the driver, who is surreptitiously eyeing \n               him, trying to confirm some suspicion--an inspection which \n               Tom ignores at first.\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Goin' far?\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (shaking his head)\n                         Just a few miles.

We see \n               TOM'S SHOES. They are prison shoes--new, stiff and bulky.\n\n               Curiosity is in the eyes of the DRIVER as they shoot a swift \n               glance at Tom. TOM is looking straight ahead, with the dead-\n               pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal \n               something. The DRIVER'S eyes take in Tom's hands and the \n               stiff coat.\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Been doin' a job?\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         I seen your hands.

Not actually crazy, Muley is a \n               little touched. His eyes rove upward as he listens to the \n               sound of the storm, the sough of the wind and the soft hiss \n               of the sand. Then...\n\n                                     MULEY\n                         The way it happens--the way it \n                         happened to me--the man come one \n                         day...\n\n               The scene dissolves to MULEY'S DOORYARD. It is a soft spring \n               day, with the peaceful sounds of the country. Seated in a \n               three-year-old touring car is THE MAN, a city man with a \n               collar and tie. He hates to do what he is doing and this \n               makes him gruff and curt, to hide his misgivings. Squatted \n               beside the car are Muley, his son-in-law, and a half-grown \n               son. At a respectful distance stand Muley's wife, his \n               daughter, with a baby in her arms, and a small barefooted \n               girl, watching worriedly. The men soberly trace marks on the \n               ground with small sticks. A hound dog sniffs at the automobile \n               wheels.\n\n                                     THE MAN\n                         Fact of the matter, Muley, after \n                         what them dusters done to the land, \n                         the tenant system don't work no more. \n                         It don't even break even, much less \n                         show a profit. One man on a tractor \n                         can handle twelve or fourteen of \n                         these places. You just pay him a \n                         wage and take *all* the crop.\n\n                                     MULEY\n                         But we couldn't *do* on any less'n \n                         what our share is now.\n                              (Looking around)\n                         The chillun ain't gettin' enough to \n                         eat as it is, and they're so ragged \n                         we'd be shamed if ever'body else's \n                         chillun wasn't the same way.\n\n                                     THE MAN\n                              (irritably)\n                         I can't help that.

The two younger men pattern after \n               him.\n\n                                     MULEY\n                         You mean get off my own land?\n\n                                     THE MAN\n                         Now don't go blaming me.

The \n                         Rances, the Perrys, the Peterses, \n                         the Joadses--one after another they \n                         got throwed out.

The one that got me come a \n                         month ago.\n\n               The scene dissolves to MULEY'S FARM. We see the backs of \n               Muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder \n               watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them. It \n               is at some distance. Muley holds a shotgun. His son has a \n               baling hook. The son-in-law has a two-by-four. Behind them \n               is their cabin. Frightened and huddled together are the women \n               and children. The roar of the tractor comes closer.\n\n                                     MULEY\n                              (shouting)\n                         You come any closer and I'm gonna \n                         blow you right outa that cat!\n                              (He lifts his shotgun)\n\n               The TRACTOR continues to lumber along, its driver goggled \n               and black of face where his dust mask doesn't cover. MULEY \n               lifts his shotgun to his shoulder, and aims.\n\n                                     MULEY\n                         I *tol'* you!\n\n               The TRACTOR stops. The driver takes off his goggles and dust \n               mask. Like the others he's a country boy. His face is sullen. \n               Muley is lowering his shotgun. There is a surprise in his \n               face as he recognizes the driver.\n\n                                     MULEY\n                         Why, you're Joe Davis's boy!\n\n               He moves forward, followed by his son and son-in-law in the \n               TRACTOR. Davis is wiping his face as they walk toward him.\n\n                                     DAVIS\n                         I don't like nobody drawin' a bead \n                         on me.\n\n                                     MULEY\n                         Then what are you doin' this kind a \n                         thing for--against your own people?\n\n                                     DAVIS\n                         For three dollars a day, that's what \n                         I'm doin' it for.

The womenfolks scamper out of \n               the way as the tractor heads for a corner of the house. It \n               goes over a ramshackle fence and then a feeble little flower \n               bed. Muley and the two younger men walk along. Breathing \n               hard, frightened and desperate, Muley is shouting warnings \n               at Davis, but the roar of the tractor drowns his voice. The \n               dog barks excitedly, snarling at the tractor. THE WOMENFOLKS \n               stand watching, terrified but dead pan, until a cry bursts \n               from Muley's wife.\n\n                                     WIFE\n                         Don't!

The corner of the \n               house sinks. MULEY lifts his shotgun, aims it, holds it, and \n               then slowly lowers it. As he stands looking at what has \n               happened his shoulders sag. He seems almost to shrink.\n\n               The scene dissolves to MULEY, once more in the back room of \n               Tom's old home, as the sound of the storm continues.\n\n                                     MULEY\n                              (dully)\n                         What was the use. He was right. There \n                         wasn't a thing in the world I could \n                         do about it.\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (bewildered)\n                         But it don't seem possible--kicked \n                         off like that!\n\n                                     MULEY\n                         The rest of my fambly set out for \n                         the west--there wasn't nothin' to \n                         eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' \n                         wouldn't let me. So now I just wander \n                         around. Sleep wherever I am. I used \n                         to tell myself I was lookin' out for \n                         things, so when they come back \n                         ever'thing would be all right. But I \n                         knowed that wan't true. There ain't \n                         nothin' to look out for. And ain't \n                         nobody comin' back.

If I'm touched, I'm \n                         touched, and that's all there is to \n                         it.\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (still unable to grasp \n                              it all)\n                         What I can't understand is my folks \n                         takin' it!

She aimed to go for him \n                         with an ax she had in the other hand \n                         but she got mixed up and forgot which \n                         hand was which and when she got \n                         through with that peddler all she \n                         had left was two chicken legs.\n\n               He looks down at Muley.\n\n                                     MULEY\n                         Just a plain 'ol graveyard ghost, \n                         that's all.\n\n               His eyes are dull on the floor. The sound of the dust storm \n               continues strongly.\n\n               The scene dissolves to the EXTERIOR OF THE CABIN at night. \n               It is several hours later and the sound of the storm has \n               faded out. Now all is silence as first Tom, then Casy, and \n               finally Muley steps out of the cabin and looks around. There \n               is still a slight fog of dust in the air, and clouds of \n               powderlike dust shoot up around their feet. All three men \n               have wet rags tied over their mouths and noses.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         She's settlin'.\n\n                                     CASY\n                         What you figger to do?\n\n                                     TOM\n                         It's hard to say.

The cornstalks, \n               their roots blown clean and clear of the earth, lie fallen \n               in one direction. This is what has happened to farms that \n               were once rich and green. Then Uncle John's cabin comes into \n               view. It is just after sunup. The air is filled with country \n               sounds--a shrill chorus of birds, a dog barking in the \n               distance. The cabin is of the same general appearance as the \n               Joad cabin but even smaller. Smoke curls from the chimney.\n\n               We see a PLATTER ON A TABLE, inside the cabin. The platter \n               is filled with sidemeat. Over the scene comes Ma Joad's voice.\n\n                                     MA'S VOICE\n                         Lord, make us thankful for what we \n                         are about to receive, for His sake. \n                         Amen.\n\n               As she speaks, a man's scrawny hand reaches forward and sneaks \n               out a piece of sidemeat.\n\n               Five people are seated around the breakfast table on chairs \n               or boxes. They are Pa, Grampa, Granma, Noah, and Uncle John. \n               Two children, Ruthie and Winfield, stand to the table, because \n               there are no more chairs. Their heads are all bent as Ma, \n               standing with a fork in her hand between the table and the \n               stove, ends the grace. Heads lift and there is a bustle as \n               Ma turns back to the frying pork on the stove and the others \n               truck into their food. Granma points a spiteful finger at \n               Grampa.\n\n                                     GRANMA\n                         I seen you!--You et durin' grace!\n\n                                     GRAMPA\n                              (indignantly)\n                         One little ole dab!--one teeny little \n                         ole dab!\n\n               RUTHIE AND WINFIELD, though they are shoveling it in, are \n               grinning at Grampa.\n\n                                     RUTHIE\n                              (in a snickering \n                              whisper to Winfield)\n                         Ain't he messy though!\n\n                                     GRANMA\n                              (viciously)\n                         I seen him!--gobblin' away like an \n                         ole pig!\n\n                                     GRAMPA\n                         Whyn't you keep your eyes shet durin' \n                         grace, you ole...\n\n               NOAH is solemnly studying a handbill.

At that \n               instant Ma enters, unobserved, and without a word give Ruthie \n               a fine wallop. Nobody else pays any attention to the slap as \n               Ma, a bucket in her hand, moves on toward the door. We see \n               her now in the BACKYARD, first at the door, then moving toward \n               the well.

She pulls out a \n               letter, looks at it, starts to throw it into the fire, then \n               puts it back in the box. Her hand pulls out a PICTURE \n               POSTCARD. We see it in Ma's hand. It is a picture of the \n               Statue Of Liberty. Over it: \"Greetings from New York City.\" \n               She turns it over. It is addressed: \"Mrs. Joad RFD 254 \n               Oklahomy Territory.\" In the space for a message: \"Hello honey. \n               Willy Mae.\"\n\n               MA, after a moment of studying it, throws the card into the \n               fire. She lifts the letter again, puts it back. She pulls \n               out a worn NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. We see it in Ma's hand. The \n               headline is: \"JOAD GETS SEVEN YEARS.\"\n\n               MA drops the clipping into the fire. Rummaging around, she \n               pulls out a small CHINA DOG. We see it closely as before. On \n               it is printed: \"Souvenir of Louisiana Purchase Exposition--\n               St. Louis--1904.\"\n\n               MA studies the dog, smiling, remembering something that it \n               meant in her life. Then she puts in in a pocket in her dress. \n               Next she pulls out some pieces of cheap jewelry; one cuff \n               link, a baby's signet ring, two earrings. She smiles at the \n               ring, then pockets it. The cuff link too. The earrings she \n               holds for a moment longer, then looks around to make sure \n               nobody sees, then holds them to her ears, not looking into \n               any kind of a mirror, just feeling them against the lobes of \n               her ears, as once perhaps she wore them. Her eyes are grave.\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (from the door)\n                         How about it, Ma?\n\n                                     MA\n                         I'm ready.\n\n               Tom disappears. Ma looks at the earrings, and then at the \n               contents of the box. She lifts out the letter again and looks \n               at it. Then, without drama, she drops it into the fire. She \n               watches it burn. Her eyes are still on the flame as she calls.\n\n                                     MA\n                         Rosasharn honey! Wake up the chillun. \n                         We're fixin' to leave.\n\n               The flame dies down.\n\n               In the BACKYARD it is grey dawn. There is a thrill of quiet \n               excitement as they all stand around the loaded truck, hats \n               on, putting on coats. The ones missing are Ma, Rosasharn, \n               the children, and Grampa. Pa is in charge.\n\n                                     PA\n                              (as Ma comes out of \n                              the cabin)\n                         Where's Grampa?

Connie and \n               Rosasharn, whispering, giggling, and slappings, are oblivious \n               of the event. Ruthie and Winfield are trembling with \n               excitement. But Tom's and Pa's smiles have disappeared, and \n               all the men are gazing back thoughtfully and soberly, their \n               minds occupied with the solemnity of this great adventure.\n\n               In the FRONT SEAT OF THE TRUCK.

The TRUCK is lumbering \n               up onto a paved highway.\n\n               The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE: Almost filling the screen \n               is the shield marker of the U.S. Highway 66. Superimposed on \n               it is a montage of jalopies, steaming and rattling and piled \n               high with goods and people, as they pull onto the highway, \n               to indicate as much as possible that this departure of the \n               Joad family is but part of a mass movement of jalopies and \n               families. The signs of towns on U.S. Highway 66 flash past--\n               CHECOTAH, OKLAHOMA CITY, BETHANY.\n\n               This dissolves to a HIGHWAY. It is late afternoon. The Joad \n               truck pulls of the paved highway and stops. The men leap \n               down quickly from the truck, all but Pa, who lifts Grampa in \n               his arms and then lowers him slowly, gently into Tom's arms.\n\n               In TOM'S arms Grampa is whimpering feebly.\n\n                                     GRAMPA\n                         *Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...\n\n                                     TOM\n                         'S all right, Grampa.

Cars pass-a fast car passing a jalopy. Tom is \n               letting the old man down gently as Ma adjusts the quilt on \n               the ground. Death is in Grampa's eyes as he looks up dimly \n               at them.\n\n                                     GRAMPA\n                              (a whisper)\n                         Thas it, jus' tar'd thas all... jus' \n                         tar'd...\n                              (He closes his eyes)\n\n               The scene dissolves to an insert of a NOTE.

Having read the note, Tom puts it in a small fruit \n               jar and kneels down and, reaching into the grave, places it \n               on Grampa's body.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         I figger best we leave something \n                         like this on him, lest somebody dig \n                         him up and make out he been kilt.\n                              (Reaching into the \n                              grave)\n                         Lotta times looks like the gov'ment \n                         got more interest in a dead man than \n                         a live one.\n\n                                     PA\n                         Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' \n                         his name is there with 'im, not just' \n                         a old fella lonesome underground.\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (straightening up)\n                         Casy, won't you say a few words?\n\n                                     CASY\n                         I ain't no more a preacher, you know.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         We know.

We hear \n               the sound of guitar music. In the CAMP GROUND a small wooden \n               house dominates the scene. There are no facilities; the \n               migrants simply pitch makeshift tents and park their jalopies \n               wherever there is a space. It is after supper and a dozen or \n               more men sit on the steps of the house listening to Connie \n               play a road song on a borrowed guitar. The music softens the \n               tired, drawn faces of the men and drives away some of their \n               shyness. In the dark, outside the circle of light from the \n               gasoline lantern on the porch, some of the women and children \n               sit and enjoy the luxury of this relative gaiety. The \n               proprietor sits tipped back in a straight chair on the porch.\n\n               We see the JOAD TENT. Behind their truck, a tarpaulin is \n               stretched over a rope from tree to tree. Granma lies asleep \n               on a quilt, stirring fitfully. Ma sits on the ground at her \n               head, fanning her with a piece of cardboard. Rosasharn lies \n               flat on her back, hands clasped under her head, looking up \n               at the stars. The music comes to them pleasantly.\n\n                                     ROSASHARN\n                         Ma... all this, will it hurt the \n                         baby?\n\n                                     MA\n                         Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.\n\n                                     ROSASHARN\n                         Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.\n\n                                     MA\n                         Well, can't nobody get through nine \n                         *months* without sorrow.\n\n                                     ROSASHARN\n                         But will it--hurt the baby?\n\n                                     MA\n                         They use' to be a sayin': A chile \n                         born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. \n                         An' another: Born outa too much joy'll \n                         be a doleful boy.

The truck roars outside and \n               moves off. Mae looks down again at the coins.\n\n                                     MAE\n                              (softly)\n                         Bert.\n\n                                     BERT\n                              (playing a machine)\n                         What ya want?\n\n                                     MAE\n                         Look here.\n\n               As he looks we see the COINS ON THE COUNTER.

In his \n               left hand on the machine is a paper with three columns of \n               figures on it. The third column is much the longest.

It is in a gap in \n               the mountains and beyond can be seen the Painted Desert. A \n               border guard halts the Joad truck. He is not as tough as his \n               words indicate, just curt and matter-of-fact.\n\n                                     GUARD\n                         Where you going?\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (who is driving)\n                         California.\n\n                                     GUARD\n                         How long you plan to be in Arizona?\n\n                                     TOM\n                         No longer'n we can get acrost her.\n\n                                     GUARD\n                         Got any plants?\n\n                                     TOM\n                         No plants.\n\n                                     GUARD\n                              (putting sticker on \n                              windshield)\n                         Okay.

Their silence is eloquent. \n               The faces of the Joads are blank with dismay, for this is an \n               unattractive sight indeed.\n\n                                     PA\n                              (finally)\n                         There she is, folks--the land a milk \n                         an' honey--California!\n\n                                     CONNIE\n                              (sullenly)\n                         Well, if *that's* what we come out \n                         here for...\n\n               They look at each other in disappointment.\n\n                                     ROSASHARN\n                              (timidly, to Connie)\n                         Maybe it's nice on the other side. \n                         Them pitchers--them little pos'cards--\n                         they was real pretty.\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (rallying them)\n                         Aw, sure.

Then the scene \n               dissolves to the BANK OF A RIVER. The camp at Needles is on \n               the bank of the Colorado River, among some willows. We see \n               the man of the family sitting chest-deep in the shallow \n               waters, talking, occasionally ducking their heads under, \n               reveling in this relief.

Tom is counting out the money for \n               the gas.\n\n                                     FIRST BOY\n                         You people got a lotta nerve.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         What you mean?\n\n                                     FIRST BOY\n                         Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like \n                         this.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         You been acrost?\n\n                                     FIRST BOY\n                         Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck \n                         like this.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         If we broke down maybe somebody'd \n                         give us a han'.\n\n                                     FIRST BOY\n                              (doubtfully)\n                         Well, maybe.

His assistant is cleaning up \n               the pumps.\n\n                                     FIRST BOY\n                         Holy Moses, what a hard-lookin' \n                         outfit!\n\n                                     SECOND BOY\n                         All them Okies is hard-lookin'.\n\n                                     FIRST BOY\n                         Boy, but I'd hate to hit that desert \n                         in a jalopy like that!\n\n                                     SECOND BOY\n                              (contentedly)\n                         Well, you and me got sense.

He turns to \n               walk away into the darkness.\n\n               The scene dissolves to a RIVER BANK at night, and Noah is \n               once more seated in the shallow water, splashing, looking up \n               at the mountains, content.\n\n               The TRUCK is rattling along U.S. Highway 66, across the \n               desert, in the night. In the DRIVER'S SEAT Tom is driving, \n               Al and Pa are by his side.\n\n                                     AL\n                         What a place!

The old woman lies still, \n               breathing noisily. Ma continues to pat her.\n\n                                     MA\n                              (whispering)\n                         'S awright, honey. Everything's gonna \n                         be awright.\n\n               Then we see the TRUCK still churning along Highway 66 by \n               night. CASY is asleep in the truck, his face wet with sweat. \n               CONNIE AND ROSASHARN are huddled together, damp and weary.\n\n                                     ROSASHARN\n                         Seems like we wasn't never gonna do \n                         nothin' but move.

Ma's hand is on Grandma's \n               heart. The old woman's eyes are shut and her breathing is \n               almost imperceptible.\n\n                                     MA\n                              (whispering)\n                         We can't give up, honey.

Her head lifted, she is \n               staring at Granma's face. Then slowly she withdraws her hand \n               from Grandma's heart.\n\n                                     MA\n                              (slowly)\n                         Yes, ever'thing's all right. I--I \n                         guess I dropped off to sleep.\n\n               Her head rests again. She lies looking fixedly at the still \n               face.\n\n               The scene dissolves to an INSPECTION STATION, near Daggett, \n               California, at night. Obeying a sign that reads: \"KEEP RIGHT \n               AND STOP,\" the Joad truck pulls up under a long shed as two \n               officers, yawning, come out to inspect it. One takes down \n               the license number and opens the hood. The people aboard the \n               truck bestir themselves sleepily.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         What's this here?\n\n                                     OFFICER\n                         Agricultural inspection.

Taking \n               it from the book, there is a breath-taking view of the valley \n               from where Highway 66 comes out of the mountains. This is \n               the California the Joads have dreamed of, rich and beautiful, \n               the land of milk and honey. It is just daybreak, with the \n               sun at the Joad's back. They have pulled off the side of the \n               road and stopped, just to drink in the sight.

The Joad truck stops by the \n               other pump and Tom, wiping his face with his sleeve, grins \n               and address himself to the policeman.

About fifteen ragged, barefooted children in a half-\n               circle are now around the fire, their solemn eyes on the pot \n               of stew.

One gets out.\n\n               A GROUP OF MEN are squatting in a half-circle, the usual \n               pattern for conversation, but they are silent now as their \n               eyes fix on the man approaching. He is a labor agent.\n\n               OUTSIDE THE JOAD TENT the men are looking in the direction \n               of the group. They start to walk toward it.\n\n               AT THE GROUP OF MEN: The agent, wearing a flat-brimmed Stetson \n               and with his pockets filled with pencils and dog-eared \n               booklets, looks down at the silent men. All of the men in \n               the camp are approaching slowly, silently. The women give \n               their anxious attention in the background. Among the men who \n               walk up is FLOYD, a grimly disappointed young man.\n\n                                     AGENT\n                         You men want to work?\n\n                                     PA\n                         Sure we wanta work.

He wears riding breeches \n               and laced boots, carries a pistol and cartridge belt, and \n               there is a deputy sheriff's star on his brown shirt. He smiles \n               thinly and shifts his pistol holster as he starts toward the \n               group.

At the same time Floyd \n               swings, smacks him in the face. As the deputy staggers, Tom \n               sticks out a foot and trips him. Floyd is already running \n               through the camp. The deputy fires from the ground. There is \n               a scream. A WOMAN is looking down at her hand, the knuckles \n               shot away.\n\n               The COUPE is seen as the agent steps on the gas to get away. \n               As Floyd gets in the clear, the DEPUTY, sitting on the ground, \n               aims his pistol again, slowly, carefully. Behind him Casy \n               steps up, gauges his distance, and then kicks him square in \n               the base of the skull.

They wish nothing like this had happened. \n               The women have gathered around the wounded woman, who is \n               sobbing. Now at the sound of the siren everybody begins to \n               move uncomfortably toward his tent or shack.

A gravel road leads from the paved highway to the \n               big wire gates, which are enclosed. Along the side of the \n               paved highway are parked a dozen jalopies, the migrants \n               sitting soberly in them. Fifty or sixty other migrants line \n               the gravel road and the junction with the paved highway. \n               Five jalopies are in line waiting to enter the gates. And \n               the scene is overwhelmingly policed. There must be ten \n               motorcycle cops around. Six are dismounted and strolling to \n               keep order among the migrants along the road. Three, their \n               motorcycles roaring, flank the line of five jalopies. As the \n               Joad truck drives up, we see the FRONT SEAT. Tom, Al, and Ma \n               are beholding the scene with bewilderment.\n\n                                     AL\n                         What is it, a wreck?\n\n                                     COP\n                              (on motorcycle)\n                         Where you think you're going?\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Fella named Spencer sent us--said \n                         they was work pickin' peaches.\n\n                                     COP\n                         Want to work, do you?\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Sure do.\n\n                                     COP\n                         Pull up behind that car.\n                              (Calling)\n                         Okay for this one. Take 'em through.\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (the truck moving)\n                         What's the matter? What's happened?\n\n                                     COP\n                         Little trouble up ahead, but you'll \n                         get through. Just follow the line.\n\n               The motorcycle escort forms around the line of six cars and \n               a deafening din is raised, of motorcycles, sirens, and an \n               inexplicable blowing of horns on the jalopies. At the same \n               time, as the gates open and the six cars start through, \n               flanked by the motorcycle cops, the migrants begin spasmodic \n               shouts, but what they say cannot be understood. As the cars \n               move slowly, Tom and Al in the FRONT SEAT are puzzled and \n               worried at the demonstration.\n\n                                     AL\n                         Maybe the road's out.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         I don't know what these cops got to \n                         do with it but I don't like it.\n                              (Looking out)\n                         An' these here are our own people, \n                         all of 'em. I don't like this.\n\n               AT THE GATES the heckling from the bystanders is spasmodic, \n               not continuous, as the six jalopies in line pass through the \n               gate into the Hooper ranch. Two men stand beside the gates \n               with shotguns. They keep calling.\n\n                                     MEN\n                         Go on, go on! Keep movin'!\n\n               The Joad truck passes through the gates. IN THE HOOPER RANCH \n               the six jalopies are halted at the end of a camp street. The \n               houses are small, square blocks, set in line. One, a little \n               larger, is a grocery store. Casually about are men in pairs \n               with metal stars on their shirts and shotguns in their hands. \n               Two bookkeepers are already passing down the cars and jotting \n               down information.\n\n                                     BOOKKEEPER\n                         Want to work?\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Sure, but what is this?\n\n                                     BOOKKEEPER\n                         That's not your affair.

The Joad truck starts...\n\n               AT HOUSE 63, as the Joad truck pulls up, two deputies \n               approach. They look closely into each face as the Joads pile \n               out. One of the deputies has a long list in his hand.\n\n                                     FIRST DEPUTY\n                         Name.\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (impatiently)\n                         Joad.

It is filthy. A rusty \n               tin stove resting on four bricks is all the one room contains. \n               Ma and Rosasharn stand looking around at it. Finally:\n\n                                     ROSASHARN\n                         We gonna live here?\n\n                                     MA\n                              (after a moment)\n                         Why, sure.

Sitting wherever they can, the \n               Joads have finished their supper of hamburgers. And grateful \n               they are too, for the meat.\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (wiping his mouth)\n                         Got any more, Ma?\n\n                                     MA\n                         No. That's all.

Don't you worry.\n\n               IN THE RANCH STREET. There is a faint moonlight, but not \n               much, and little sound from the other houses as Tom strolls \n               down the street.\n\n               NEAR THE GATE: beyond, cars pass. As Tom approaches the gate \n               a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises \n               from a box.\n\n                                     GUARD\n                         Where you think you're going?\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Thought I'd take a walk.

Rising, he crosses the paved highway.\n\n               AN EMBANKMENT across the road from the wire fence: Tom \n               clambers down it, moving quietly. He picks his way down the \n               shallow ravine.\n\n               A TENT: there is a light inside and there are the shadows of \n               figures. In the background, beyond the tent, is the silhouette \n               of a small concrete bridge spanning a small stream. Following \n               a trail, Tom enters and approaches the tent. (The opening is \n               away from him.) IN FRONT OF THE TENT, a man sitting on a box \n               looks up suspiciously as Tom enters.

The \n               blow strikes the deputy's arm, sending his flashlight flying, \n               and the scene is in semi-darkness as Tom swings again. There \n               is a grunt and a groan as the deputy goes down. Then all is \n               confusion. Backing away, swinging the pickhandle, Tom bolts, \n               splashes a few yards through the stream, turns and gains a \n               better start by throwing the pickhandle at his pursuers. \n               They duck, and Tom disappears into the night.

As he walks slowly \n               down the main camp street we share the revelation of the \n               place to him. It is nearly daylight. Roosters crow in the \n               distance. The street is neat and orderly in a military way, \n               its cleanliness in sharp contrast to anything he has known \n               before. Inside the tents people are stirring. In front of \n               one tent a woman is cooking breakfast. A baby is in her arms.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Good mornin'.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Mornin'.\n\n               As he walks on, Tom draws a breath of exultation. As he moves \n               on, looking around, we see the EXTERIOR OF SANITARY UNIT NO. \n               4, a cheap frame building the purpose of which is pretty \n               obvious. Ruthie, warily alert lest she be caught, is peering \n               in the door. She looks a long time and then she runs out of \n               the scene.\n\n               WINFIELD is seen asleep in a quilt on the ground when Ruthie \n               enters and rousts him out.\n\n                                     RUTHIE\n                              (in an excited whisper)\n                         Git up.

Ruthie is putting on a \n               bold front as she leads Winfield into sight but she is still \n               alert for interference.\n\n                                     RUTHIE\n                         Come on.

There is a silence. Then:\n\n                                     RUTHIE'S VOICE\n                         Them's where you wash your han's.\n\n               Another silence.

It is a cheap toilet \n               and it is a loud flush which eventually ends in a long \n               refilling of the tank just as loudly. There is a paralyzed \n               silence.

Sniffling a little, Winfield mimics her, a very \n               innocent walk and yawn indeed.\n\n               The scene dissolves to a DITCH.

Those folks in to \n                         being treated like humans. Suppose \n                         the Government closes its camps.  \n                         Suppose too many people pass through \n                         'em.

It is \n               Saturday evening, the night of the dance. Glaring electric \n               lights hang over the open gate. Parked jalopies line the \n               highway as the invited guests, small farmers and migrants \n               from other camps and their families, arrive to be greeted \n               and checked by a committee of three men.\n\n                                     COMMITTEE MAN\n                         Ev'nin', ma'am.

Come right in, ma'am.\n\n               There is an air of eager anticipation, of gay celebration, \n               and everyone is in his or her best--the men in clean washed \n               overalls, clean shirts, some with ties, their hair damp and \n               slicked down, the women in their nicest. Through the gate, \n               inside the camp, can be seen the outdoor dance floor, brightly \n               lighted, with the camp musicians already tuning up, and around \n               the dance floor scores of wide-eyed children.\n\n               INSIDE THE GATE TO THE CAMP, we see Wilkie and a dark-\n               complexioned man named Jule standing among a group inside \n               watching the arrivals. They watch sharply, eyeing everyone, \n               listening to every credential. As his employer, Thomas, comes \n               through the gate with his wife, Wilkie grins and greets him \n               with a handshake.\n\n                                     WILKIE\n                         Hidy, Mr. Thomas.

He wears a tight-fitting wool suit, a tie \n               on his shirt, yellow shoes, and his hair is damp and slicked \n               down. He rubs his hands together in anticipation as he strolls \n               in the direction of the dance floor.\n\n               At ANOTHER TENT, a blonde girl sits on a box as Al enters. \n               Casually he throws open his coat, revealing a vivid striped \n               shirt. This is designed to stun his quarry.\n\n                                     AL\n                         Gonna dance tonight?\n                              (The girl \n                              ostentatiously ignores \n                              him)\n                         I can waltz.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                              (aloofly)\n                         That's nothin'--anybody can waltz.\n\n                                     AL\n                              (shaking his head)\n                         Not like me!\n\n               A fat woman thrusts her head out of the tent.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         You git right along!

The blonde girl's eyes follow \n               him. Then she turns and glances cautiously toward the tent.\n\n               ON THE DANCE FLOOR, we see Ma and Rosasharn as Tom enters \n               and stands between them. This is during a pause between dances \n               and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for the \n               music to begin again. We also see the three men very casually \n               looking around--but no more casual looking than Wilkie, \n               standing just behind them, idly whistling.\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (grinning)\n                         She's gettin' prettier, Ma.\n\n                                     MA\n                              (as Rosasharn hides \n                              her face)\n                         Girl with a baby *always* gets \n                         prettier.\n\n               The music starts again, once more the dancers move onto the \n               dance floor. The three men exchange a glance and step casually \n               to the edge of the dancing space, one in the lead. They survey \n               the scene, but for the moment make no further move. The \n               atmosphere is tense.\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (softly)\n                         Excuse me, Ma.\n                              (He moves quietly out \n                              of the scene, toward \n                              the three men)\n\n               AL, taking the blonde girl's hand, steps onto the dance floor. \n               Encircling her waist, they begin to dance.

There is not a sound as the three men, held \n               in iron grips, are whisked from the dance floor and into the \n               crowd.\n\n               Two touring cars have stopped in front of the closed GATE \n               and the deputies have drawn guns.\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Open up!

From a piece of wood on the \n               ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts \n               and lights it. While he is doing so, he lifts his head \n               suddenly, and listens.\n\n               In the CAMP STREET we catch sight of legs walking, the ground \n               lighted from a flashlight. Two pairs of the legs wear state \n               policemen's leather leggings. The third pair are the \n               caretaker's. They stop behind a car. The flashlight plays on \n               the license plate. One of the state cops leans down to copy \n               the license number in a booklet. Then they move on.\n\n               TOM has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle, enough to see \n               out by flattening his head on the floor. The LEGS are now \n               seen at the Joad jalopy. The light is on the license plate. \n               The cop leans over and copies the number. They move on.\n\n               TOM, lowering the edge of the tent, sits up. Quietly he pushes \n               aside the piece of carpet that covers him. He is wearing his \n               clothes. We see the policeman's CAR at the caretaker's hut. \n               The two policemen get into the car.\n\n                                     CARETAKER\n                         You got no right to arrest anybody \n                         without a warrant, you know.\n\n                                     FIRST COP\n                         We'll have a warrant--just as soon \n                         as we check with headquarters.\n\n               The car drives off, leaving the caretaker looking somberly \n               after it.\n\n               WITHIN THE JOAD TENT, his cap on, fully dressed for travel, \n               Tom is tieing the ends of the carpet into a shoulder bundle. \n               Rising, he slings it across his shoulder. As he tiptoes toward \n               the door:\n\n                                     MA\n                         Ain't you gonna tell me goodbye, \n                         Tommy?\n\n               For a moment he looks into the darkness in her direction.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         I didn't know, Ma. I didn't know if \n                         I ought.\n\n               She has risen, pulling the quilt around her. He takes her by \n               the hand.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Come outside.\n\n               They go out. Tom leads Ma around BEHIND THE TENT, to a SECTION \n               OF WIRE FENCE. There is a bench there. Tom leads Ma to it \n               and sits her down.
