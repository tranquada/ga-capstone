When suddenly there's a SCREAM OF TERROR -- and Jerry\n          BRACES as if he was expecting it -- looks over at a WOMAN\n          pointing like he was a fucking bodysnatcher and she collapses --\n          Jerry holds up his hands as everyone turns to look at him--\n\n          JERRY\n          -- no!

The car lands in a mountain\n          of trash. The crane STOPS, just as...
