Her pretty face, alert,\n\tshe's barely breathing.  Traces the just visible lines around\n\this eyes, and mouth.  Brushes fingertips against his\n\teyelashes.\n\n\tTIGHT CLOSE - SALLY'S HAND PULLS THE BEDROOM SHADE.\n\n\tIt retracts with a loud WHACK, sun, sky, trees.\n\n\t\t\tSTEVEN (O.S.)\n\t\tAnd breath...and chataronga...\n\n\tEXT. POOL AREA - DAY\n\n\tWe're in the middle of a yoga lesson.  Joe and Sally stand on\n\ttheir mats.  Steven, their instructor, wanders around the\n\tcouple issuing soft-spoken instructions.\n\n\tA large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge\n\tfireplace.  The dining room on one side, living room on the\n\tother.  Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch\n\tgarden pool... The house is classic Neutra.  All GLASS and\n\tSMOOTH LINES.\n\n\tThe calm is broken by the telephone.  Joe and Sally ignore it\n\tuntil the answering machine picks up.  They break their yoga\n\tposes and listen.\n\n\tThe CAMERA hovers over the answering machine.\n\n\t\t\tLUCY (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(over answering machine; sweet,\n\t\t\t British, slightly desperate)\n\t\tJoe, it's Lucy.

Sally returns to the lesson.

If\n\t\tyou please now...\n\n\t\t\tJOE\n\t\tIt's yours.\n\n\tThe CAMERA glances off photos of the couple: portraits and\n\tcandids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation,\n\ttumbling on the lawn, and the like.\n\tSome framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply\n\tleaning on a shelf.  It's clear that at least a handful are\n\tby the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and\n\tbeautiful.\n\n\tThere are lots of photos of Joe and his sister Lucy,\n\tdocumenting their relationship from childhood.  There's an\n\tANNIE LEIBOWITZ photo-shoot of Sally carelessly displayed\n\tsomewhere.\n\n\tINT.

You invited Skye fucking\n\t\tDavidson to our anniversary party?\n\n\t\t\tJOE\n\t\tOkay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell\n\t\tyou.  It was the only chance I had to\n\t\tmeet her.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tYou invited her to our anniversary party?\n\t\tI didn't even invite my mother.\n\n\t\t\tJOE\n\t\tShe goes on location tomorrow.  Sally,\n\t\tI'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on\n\t\thold.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\t\t(pissed)\n\t\tNo, no of course not.

How old is she?\n\t\tTwenty-fucking-two?\n\n\tShe gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom.  The CAMERA is\n\twith her.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY (CONT'D)\n\t\t\t(into the bathroom mirror)\n\t\tAnd she's a stinking fucking actress, for\n\t\tfuck's sake.\n\n\t\t\tJOE\n\t\t\t(into the receiver)\n\t\tSkye!\n\t\t\t(his face lights)\n\t\tI'm so glad you're able to make it...it's\n\t\tour sixth, actually.\n\t\t\t(flattered)\n\t\tYou read the book again?  Well, no, the\n\t\tending to chapter six...it's just that\n\t\tit's not filmic.\n\t\tWe tried it in an earlier draft, but, it\n\t\tjust wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can\n\t\tabsolutely look at that again.  If you're\n\t\tcoming from Laurel, you want to take\n\t\tSunset west, we're just past Will Rogers\n\t\tState Park.  Three blocks west of that,\n\t\tyou want to hang right.  It's about three\n\t\tquarters of a mile up a big white thing\n\t\ton the left.\n\n\tSally's started the bath, and is watching him from the\n\tdoorway.  He meets her eyes mid-sentence.\n\n\t\t\tJOE (CONT'D)\n\t\tOh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure\n\t\tthey're well behaved.  All our friends\n\t\thave dogs, and they always want to bring\n\t\tthem.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So\n\t\twe sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry.\n\n\tHe rolls his eyes.  Sally walks back into the bathroom, she\n\tisn't buying it.\n\n\t\t\tJOE (O.S.) (CONT'D)\n\t\tI'm looking forward to meeting you, too.\n\t\tAnd Skye, I'm thrilled that you're\n\t\twilling to take this leap with me.\n\t\tEternally grateful, really.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\t\t(into the bathroom mirror)\n\t\tI'm going to throw up.\n\n\t\t\tJOE (O.S.)\n\t\tI can't imagine anyone else playing\n\t\tGenna.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\t\t(sanguine)\n\t\tReally?\n\n\tINT. BEDROOM - LATER\n\n\tThe doorbell rings.  There are two closed doors on either\n\tside of the room.  The bed shows no sign of consummated sex.\n\tJoe comes through the left hand door, nearly dressed.\n\n\t\t\tJOE\n\t\tWho the fuck can be here at this time?\n\t\tIt's not even seven!\n\n\tSally comes through the other door, one shoe off, one on.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tOh Jesus, who else is always early for\n\t\tChrist's sake?\n\n\tNEW ANGLE\n\n\tSally kisses his cheek on her way to the door.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY (CONT'D)\n\t\tPromise you'll be nice to the neighbors.\n\n\t\t\tJOE\n\t\tI'll say as little as possible.\n\n\tSally exits the bedroom.\n\n\tHOLD ON JOE\n\n\tFor a moment, then Sally re-enters, kisses him deeply.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tI love you.\n\n\tINT. FOYER - EARLY EVENING\n\n\tThe house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements,\n\tcandles everywhere.\n\n\tJERRY and JUDY ADAMS are on the porch, just beyond the glass\n\tof the front door.  Their argument is inaudible.  They're in\n\ttheir mid-thirties, conservatively dressed.  She's stunning,\n\tgenetically nervous.  Jerry carries a briefcase.  She's got\n\tthe gift.\n\n\tSally opens the door.  Hugs and buses them, hello.\n\n\t\t\tJUDY\n\t\tI know we're early, we're so early.\n\t\tSorry.\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tYou have to sign your taxes anyway.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\t\t(a grin)\n\t\tOf course we do.\n\t\t\t(to Judy)\n\t\tWe have to sign our taxes.\n\n\t\t\tJOE\n\t\t\t(kisses Judy; all charm)\n\t\tYou can never be too early or too thin.\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tHappy anniversary, buddy!  Six months\n\t\tago, who would have thunk it?\n\n\tJerry hugs Joe.\n\n\t\t\tJOE\n\t\t\t(sotto)\n\t\tWell, not me, to be honest.\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\t\t(sotto)\n\t\tDon't fuck up again.

Judy's left alone, unsure\n\twhether to follow or not.\n\n\t\t\tJUDY\n\t\t\t(finally, to no one, and to no\n\t\t\t response)\n\t\tThe house looks beautiful, are those\n\t\thydrangeas?\n\n\tShe stands awkwardly in the middle of the foyer.\n\n\tEXT. PORCH - CONTINUOUS\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tJoe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk,\n\t\tChelsea, London, England.  No small\n\t\tdoing.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tI love you, you're a genius.\n\n\tBehind them, in the foyer, Judy wanders aimlessly.\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tI suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift.\n\t\tI'm not sure it's in your best interest.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tI adore him.\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tThe realtor'll be here tomorrow in the\n\t\tmorning.  The house had to go on the\n\t\tmarket to insure the loan on the London\n\t\tflat.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tI know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tWhat you earn has to double in order to\n\t\tcover expenses in London, it's an\n\t\toutrageously expensive city.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tWe've only been over this how many times?\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tYou only made half your quote this year.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tWell, you're a tower of support.\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tI worry because you don't.  It's my job.\n\t\tI'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it\n\t\tif you waited until the two of you were\n\t\ton more solid ground.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\t\t(direct, simple)\n\t\tWe couldn't be on more solid ground.\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tWhatever you say.  Listen, I love you.\n\n\tOtis is barking.\n\n\t\t\tJOE (O.S.)\n\t\tOtis!  No barking!\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\t\t(touched)\n\t\tAnd Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a\n\t\trock star in London.

He moves\n\tthrough the foyer and into the living room with a tray of\n\tglasses and Judy in tow.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tHe gets huge advances on his novels.\n\t\tHe's going back to that.  You know how he\n\t\thates it here.\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tThere's still time to undo this.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\t\t(kisses his cheek)\n\t\tWe'll be fine.\n\n\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\t\t(re: barking dog)\n\t\tDid you invite them?\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tThe Roses?

I sometimes\n\t\tthink we're better off not reading the\n\t\tnovel at all.  Because, we come with\n\t\texpectations... and of course, we know\n\t\twhere we're going.

I mean I've still\n\t\tgot plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I\n\t\tstill have a good six years, whatever.\n\t\tWe could have three kids yet, if we\n\t\twanted.  And I know I've always said I\n\t\tnever wanted kids, and I didn't... but\n\t\tthis year, I really, truly, feel ready...\n\n\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\tHoney, I'm not worried about you.  You\n\t\tare going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an\n\t\tissue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on\n\t\tthe other hand, is a different story.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tOh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids.\n\t\tJoe thinks he needs kids.\n\n\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\tHe wants playmates.  Oh he's a\n\t\tsweetheart, Sal, you know I love him.\n\t\tBut he's not going to be a good father.\n\t\tHe's just not parenting material.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tHey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels\n\t\treally nice against your skin.\n\n\tSally drops out of frame.\n\n\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\tDon't try and change the subject.\n\t\t\t(sitting, joining Sally)\n\t\tOh God, it feels great!  He's just a\n\t\tlittle narcissistic, irresponsible and\n\t\tunreliable.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tAnd Cal's this massive adult?\n\n\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\tCal knows who he is.

It's only five months\n\t\tsince Joe came back.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\t\t(getting up)\n\t\tWe're fine.  We're great.  We're having a\n\t\tbaby and we're moving to London.\n\n\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\t\t(following her)\n\t\tWell, you weren't fine last summer when\n\t\tyou went Sylvia Plath on me in\n\t\tConnecticut.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tNot nice.  Not kind.\n\n\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\tHa!  Not half so not kind as your husband\n\t\twas in his portrayal of you in his novel.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\tWhy are you doing this?\n\n\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\tHis image of you is a possessive, fragile\n\t\tneurotic.\n\n\t\t\tSALLY\n\t\t\t(tearing up)\n\t\tBut I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.\n\n\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\t\t(also tearing up)\n\t\tNo you are not.  You're Sally Nash.\n\t\tListen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're\n\t\tmy best friend and I love you more than\n\t\tanyone, and you're not going to move to\n\t\tLondon to have the offspring of a\n\t\tsexually ambivalent man-child.  \"Oh now\n\t\tI'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director...\"\n\t\tEnglish prick bastard Joe Therrian who's\n\t\tprobably going to leave you for Skye\n\t\tDavidson anyway.\n\n\tThey hug a bit weepy.\n\n\t\t\tSOPHIA (CONT'D)\n\t\tHe's always one step removed, always\n\t\tlooking over his shoulder always looking\n\t\tfor something else, something more\n\t\tintoxicating, and I don't mean drugs.  I\n\t\tlove him, Sal, but he's a child.  He's\n\t\tnot ready.\n\t\t\t(a choked sob, tears well and\n\t\t\t fall)\n\t\tOh God, you're so lucky you don't have\n\t\tkids.  You can't stick your head in the\n\t\toven.  You can't take a handful of\n\t\tPercoden if you want to, or slit your\n\t\twrists.  You can't do yourself in.  Kids\n\t\trob you of that option.

There was a scene last week -\n\t\tshe sobbed, through every take.  I know\n\t\tcrying's easy for her but it's a fucking\n\t\tcomedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You\n\t\tknow, that thing that was Sally - that\n\t\talways surprised you.  It's gone.  I\n\t\tthink she's scared.  And that's death.\n\n\t\t\tJOE\n\t\tI still think she sails above the rest.\n\t\tI mean not like her early films.  But\n\t\tthose were all such great directors.\n\n\t\t\tCAL\n\t\tMac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's\n\t\ta woman's director.  And nothing's\n\t\thappening.  Course he won't fire her,\n\t\tbecause of the friendship... But it was\n\t\tdiscussed.  He had to battle his studio\n\t\tto get her in the first place.\n\n\t\t\tJOE\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tCAL\n\t\tHey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's\n\t\tbest friend.\n\t\t\t(to Joe's stare)\n\t\tI never said any of this, alright.  I'll\n\t\tdeny it on the stand...\n\t\t\t(into the silence)\n\t\tYou guys are gonna have kids.  That is so\n\t\tgreat.  Maybe that's what this is all\n\t\tabout.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this\n\t\tanymore.  You know adults don't do this\n\t\tfor a living.  You guys are gonna have\n\t\tyour kids, you'll be directing -- one\n\t\tasshole in the family is enough.  Sophia\n\t\tknew that intuitively.
