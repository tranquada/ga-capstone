There are no\r\n          markings on it whatsoever.\r\n          Norma looks down the quiet, empty street.

WRAPPING\r\n          PAPER and CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS are scattered across the table.\r\n          Norma is pouring COFFEE.

Mounted on\r\n          top is a CLEAR GLASS DOME attached to a lid with a HINGE\r\n          MOUNT. Inside of the dome is a CYLINDRICAL METAL BUTTON.\r\n\r\n                         NORMA\r\n          Is there a note?\r\n          Arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small WHITE\r\n          ENVELOPE. Printed on the envelope in CALLIGRAPHY is the name:\r\n\r\n          MRS.

He and\r\n          Walter sit at the kitchen table, waiting for Norma to deliver\r\n          breakfast.\r\n          The box sits on the table between them.\r\n          Arthur opens up the newspaper.\r\n\r\n                         INSERT SHOTS:\r\n\r\n          RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH...

LEWIS HOUSE -- BASEMENT -- MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Dana and Walter come down the stairs into the BASEMENT of the\r\n          house. RED LIGHT envelops the room. There are two long wooden\r\n          WORK BENCHES running down the middle.\r\n          There are a series of BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS hanging\r\n          from a wire.

The camera is cylindrical\r\n          and features a VERTICAL SLOT on the front.\r\n\r\n                         WALTER (CONT'D)\r\n          They designed the camera to\r\n          photograph in 360 degrees. It scans\r\n          in the image one line at a time...\r\n          and takes about five minutes to\r\n          complete one revolution.\r\n\r\n                         DANA\r\n          How do they get the images back to\r\n          earth?\r\n\r\n                         WALTER\r\n          Radio transmission. They figured\r\n          out a way to interpret the scan\r\n          lines and then print them onto\r\n          film.\r\n\r\n                         DANA\r\n          How long does it take to transmit\r\n          back to earth?\r\n\r\n                         WALTER\r\n          About ten hours.\r\n          Dana looks over at the wall and sees a NEW YORK TIMES FRONT\r\n          PAGE from September with a large image of MARS on it.\r\n\r\n                         WALTER (CONT'D)\r\n          They tested the camera in the\r\n          parking lot at Langley last year.\r\n          Walter points to another FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall. In\r\n          the black & white photograph, we see a group of FIFTY NASA\r\n          EMPLOYEES assembled in a long line in a PARKING LOT.\r\n          Walter points to his father standing in the group.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          40.\r\n\r\n                         WALTER (CONT'D)\r\n          There's my dad.\r\n          He moves his finger across the line of smiling faces...\r\n          ARTHUR appears for a SECOND TIME in the row.\r\n\r\n                         WALTER (CONT'D)\r\n          And there he is again.\r\n          Walter then moves his finger down toward the right side of\r\n          the photo... ARTHUR LEWIS appears for a third time.\r\n\r\n                         WALTER (CONT'D)\r\n          And there he is again.\r\n          Dana looks close at the photo.\r\n\r\n                         DANA\r\n          How'd he do that?\r\n\r\n                         WALTER\r\n          Because the camera takes five\r\n          minutes to scan in 360 degrees, he\r\n          waited until the camera passed over\r\n          him then jumped ahead in the\r\n          circle.\r\n          The CAMERA moves in closer to the photograph... to the THIRD\r\n          VERSION of ARTHUR LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                         DANA\r\n          Your dad sounds pretty clever.\r\n\r\n                         WALTER\r\n          My dad is more than just clever,\r\n          Dana. My dad is the coolest man who\r\n          ever walked the face of the earth.\r\n          The CAMERA ZOOMS in close to Arthur's face... then tips down\r\n          to another MAN kneeling on the pavement directly below him.\r\n          It is ARLINGTON STEWARD... smiling at the camera.

Jim closes the door and goes around to the front of\r\n          the car.\r\n          Jim gets behind the wheel and starts the engine.\r\n          Arthur looks back through the window, toward his house.\r\n          Upstairs in the MASTER BEDROOM WINDOW... Walter is watching,\r\n          tears streaming down his face.\r\n          Arthur reaches up with his hands... cuffed together... and\r\n          tries his best to wave at his son.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          112.\r\n\r\n                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (MOUTHING SILENTLY)\r\n          I`m sorry...\r\n          From the window... Walter watches the car pull away from the\r\n          curb.\r\n          He places his hand on the glass... waving back.\r\n\r\n          CUT TO BLACK:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nBox, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Richard Kelly\u00a0\u00a0Richard Matheson\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:21:35.269161"}
