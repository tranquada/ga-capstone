He looks around just as:\r\n          Out of nowhere a tree branch sails down, barely missing them, \r\n          landing with a heavy WHUMP just feet away. \r\n\r\n<b>          MAN. \r\n</b>          Move!

No\r\n          matter what, Papa.\r\n          The BOY dries his eyes, takes a breath, gets up and walks\r\n          back to the road...\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. BOAT LAUNCH, ROAD- DAY \r\n</b>\r\n          As the BOY walks out of the dunes holding the gun, a MOTHERLY\r\n          WOMAN who is standing with the VETERAN comes towards him.\r\n\r\n<b>          MOTHERLY WOMAN.\r\n</b>          Oh. I am so glad to see you.\r\n          The BOY just stares at her, bemused - a short distance away\r\n          stands the rest of the family - a BOY his age and a GIRL. The\r\n          BOY stares at the OTHER BOY and recognizes him - it's the\r\n          same BOY he chased earlier.\r\n\r\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          112.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         CONTINUED:\r\n</b>          Then the BOY notices a threadbare mongrel of a DOG, waiting\r\n          with them.\r\n          The MOTHERLY WOMAN goes over and puts her arms around him.\r\n\r\n<b>          MOTHERLY WOMAN. (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          We've been following you. Did you\r\n          know that? We saw you with your\r\n          Papa and we tried to catch up but\r\n          you were too quick for us.\r\n\r\n<b>          VETERAN.\r\n</b>          There was some discussion about\r\n          whether to even come after you at\r\n          all.\r\n\r\n          As she's chatting, the MOTHERLY WOMAN gently takes the gun\r\n          from the BOY and hands it to the VETERAN.\r\n\r\n<b>          MOTHERLY WOMAN.\r\n</b>          We're so lucky. We were so worried\r\n          about you. And now we don't have to\r\n          worry about a thing.\r\n          She kisses the BOY on the forehead and holds him at arm's\r\n          length and looks at him.\r\n\r\n<b>          MOTHERLY WOMAN. (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          How does that sound? Is that okay?\r\n          He stares but says nothing...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                               CLOSING CREDITS.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Road,-The.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Road, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Joe Penhall\" title=\"Scripts by Joe Penhall\">Joe Penhall</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Road, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Road, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:14:32.164344"}
