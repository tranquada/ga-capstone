Opening credits begin. An almost \n               imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly \n               forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME \n               CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, \n               glass full moon. Fade to BLACK.\n\n               Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping \n               the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White.\n\n               EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT\n\n               A quiet, deserted industrial street. It is over an hour before \n               dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness \n               of night.\n\n               In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT \n               and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out \n               breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete \n               silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie-\n               talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters \n               and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a \n               mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered \n               donuts.\n\n                                     BERT\n                         What time is it?\n\n                                     CYBIL\n                         Four.

On an impulse Cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand \n               of Nicole's hair from her eyes.\n\n               A sudden amazed alarm fills Nicole.

Still \n               confused, she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed. \n               The woman's face is pale and drawn. As Nicole leans closer \n               her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair \n               away from her face. The gesture is one of love, acceptance, \n               and farewell.

HOTEL ROOM. DAWN\n\n               In the dim light of the hotel room, CHAD PALOMINO dresses \n               quickly. He is young, handsome, with long blond hair. A WOMAN \n               sits nude on the bed, her back to the camera. The faint sound \n               of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         They're waiting downstairs.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Go ahead, I'll take a taxi.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Oh, OK.

There \n                         is no need for melodrama.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         I just thought you might...\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Look, all I ask is that you don't \n                         mention this to anyone.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Hey, that's not my style.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Good.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         So, I'll see you on the set.\n\n               Palomino slips out the door. The woman falls back onto the \n               bed, turning her face toward the camera. We see it is NICOLE.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         God damn it.\n\n               She lies for a moment, listening to the sound of the shower. \n               The bedside clock reads 4:30 A.M.\n\n               INT. CAR. DAWN\n\n               The car pulls up outside a NYC apt building.

MORNING\n\n               A small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the \n               middle of the huge empty space. One wall has a fake window. \n               The GAFFER lies on the bed staring absently at the AC sitting \n               motionless beside the camera a few feet away. Neither speaks \n               for a long moment.\n\n                                     GAFFER\n                         I think we got nudity today.\n\n                                     AC\n                              (reads from his \n                              callsheet)\n                         It just says \"Scene Six: Ellen and \n                         Damian kiss.\"\n\n                                     GAFFER\n                         Could be a kiss with nudity.\n\n                                     AC\n                         I like Ellen.

Feature. I brought my script.\n\n               The Gaffer tugs a thin, tattered SCRIPT, folded lengthwise, \n               out of his back pocket.\n\n                                     GAFFER\n                         Palomino's perfect for the lead.

MAKEUP CORNER. DAY\n\n               Nicole sits before the makeup mirror. LORDE, the male Makeup \n               artist picks up a tube of Preparation H and begins applying \n               it under Nicole's eyes just as Nick walks up.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Jesus, what are you doing?\n\n                                     LORDE\n                         Shrinking tissue.

You really look beautiful.\n\n               Something in Nick's voice makes Nicole glance up at him. He \n               looks away quickly. The moment is awkward, as if they both \n               realize he has inadvertently revealed something. Just then \n               Palomino approaches.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Hey!

CRAFT SERVICE TABLE. DAY\n\n               Several members of the crew loiter around the table. The \n               Scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup \n               of coffee in the other. Palomino notices her and moves quietly \n               to her side. Without a word he picks up the milk and pours \n               some in her coffee. Nicole stands nearby and watches the \n               following exchange.\n\n                                     SCRIPT\n                         Thanks.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         My pleasure.

The Gaffer slips the AC a shrewd wink then \n               walks over and stands next to Palomino, giving him a big, \n               friendly grin.\n\n                                     GAFFER\n                         Hey, Chad.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Hey, whatya say.\n\n                                     GAFFER\n                         I'm Bob.

He points to the light.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Hey, Bill.

The \n               Gaffer and AC stand in silence for a long awkward moment.\n\n               INT. BATHROOM. DAY\n\n               Nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. Leaning \n               closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair \n               falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Would you care to have a drink \n                         tonight?

THE SCENE. TAKE FOUR\n\n               The scene begins again. Palomino milks his Close-up for all \n               it's worth.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         I've always admired you from afar.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Admired? That sounds rather \n                         professional.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         Well, then: loved. How does that \n                         sound?\n\n               Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera \n               moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with \n               extreme care and concentration.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         It sounds like the champagne talking.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         I've loved you from the moment we \n                         met.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Why didn't you tell me?\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         We were working together. I didn't \n                         want anything to interfere -- God!\n\n               Under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole \n               suddenly jerks her head away hard. Palomino jumps up and \n               begins pacing at the rear of the set.\n\n               INT. THE SET. DAY\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Cut!\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         That's a cut. Hold the work, going \n                         again, right away.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I \n                         did that. I'm sorry.\n\n               Palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses Nick with a \n               curtness that is a little startling.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Nick, could I talk to you a second?\n\n               Palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head \n               indicating his wish for Nick to follow him.\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         A momentary delay. Everyone stand \n                         by. We're going again, right away.\n\n                                     SOUND\n                         Excuse me, Ellen?

Actually \n                         could I listen to the take before?\n\n               The Sound man gives Nicole his headphones and rewinds the \n               tape recorder for her. The first several lines of the last \n               take are heard through the headphones.\n\n               INT. OFF THE SET. DAY\n\n               Nick follows Palomino behind the set, stopping just beside \n               the fake set window. Palomino whirls on Nick and whispers \n               fiercely.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         I'm out of here, man!\n\n                                     NICK\n                         What's the matter?!\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         I like you, but I made a big mistake \n                         taking this part. Have someone call \n                         me a cab.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to \n                         me. What's going on!?\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         I can't act with this woman. I know \n                         she's a friend of yours but I got to \n                         tell you: she cannot act worth a \n                         shit! I'm giving her everything! The \n                         whole thing I just did with the hair; \n                         did you see that? I came up with \n                         that on my own because I thought it \n                         would help her. But no, she's giving \n                         me nothing! I'm out of here.\n\n               INT. THE SET. DAY\n\n               Nicole listens to the last line of the previous take.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         God, and all this time I thought...\n                              (the muted rustle of \n                              the kiss)\n\n               The Sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take, \n               sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword \n               puzzle. Nicole is just about to take off the headphones when \n               she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking quite \n               clearly. Glancing up, she sees the Boom man has left his \n               boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the \n               open set window.\n\n                                     PALOMINO (V.O.)\n                         Why did you cast her? She sucked in \n                         that Richard Gere movie!\n\n                                     NICK (V.O.)\n                         You're right. She is not the best \n                         actress in the world. I see that now \n                         but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm \n                         asking you to please help me here. \n                         We've got to get through this somehow.\n\n               The camera begins a slow DOLLY in to Nicole's astonished \n               face. This will be intercut with a similar DOLLY in to the \n               microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ECU of the \n               mike.\n\n               INT. OFF THE SET. DAY\n\n               Camera is close on Nick and Palomino.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         I'll tell you what this is about, \n                         man. You know why she took a cab \n                         this morning?\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Something came up.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         No. She was in my hotel room and she \n                         didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm \n                         sorry it had to come out like this \n                         but I told her this morning \"thanks \n                         a lot, it was a lot of fun last night \n                         but let's get something straight -- \n                         it was just a one-time deal,\" and \n                         she didn't want to hear that. She \n                         wanted more, you see what I'm saying? \n                         It's rejection.\n\n               INT. THE SET. DAY\n\n               The camera reveals Nicole now seated in her spot on the bed. \n               She rises as Nick and Palomino reappear and approach her \n               from behind the set.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Nicole, listen...\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't \n                         working. I apologize. Chad, I \n                         apologize to you too. I'm completely \n                         unfocused here and I think you're \n                         absolutely right; what we need to do \n                         is loosen the scene up somehow.\n\n               Nick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         What would you like to do?\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         I was wondering if we could try \n                         improvising the scene. More along \n                         the lines of what Chad has been doing. \n                         Maybe that would help me find \n                         something.\n\n               Nick's smile of gratitude to Nicole looks almost drug-induced.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         That's a fantastic idea.

THE SCENE. TAKE FIVE. THE IMPROV\n\n               Nicole stays seated, though Palomino moves around making a \n               great show of loosening up.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         I've always admired you from afar.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Have you? That's, wow; that's \n                         incredible. But that sounds kind of \n                         professional doesn't it? Admired?\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         You're right.

He looks to Nick in \n               confusion. Nick silently encourages him to keep going.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                              (another laugh)\n                         That sounds like the champagne \n                         talking.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         It's not. I really do think you are \n                         a piece of shit.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         No, you don't. You love me.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         The fuck I do.

You should \n                         tell everyone what you just told \n                         Nick behind the set.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Hey, this isn't part of the scene.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         Say it anyway: The reason this scene \n                         isn't working is because you and I \n                         slept together last night. Did \n                         everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad \n                         last night!\n\n               Nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         See, Nick! I told you this was about \n                         rejection!\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         You fucking scumbag! You think I \n                         give a rat's ass about you?! I was \n                         there to get laid and even that was \n                         a joke!\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         You know, you are really starting to \n                         piss me off!\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         Oh, does that mean you're not going \n                         to come wiggle on the bed anymore, \n                         or stroke my hair real soft and \n                         concerned, or kiss me like a soap \n                         opera acting piece of shit!\n\n               Palomino snaps, and lunges for Nicole. She leaps to the other \n               side of the bed.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come \n                         on!\n\n               Nick steps between Nicole and Palomino.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         OK, guys, I think we can stop there.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         You bet your ass we can stop!

This \n                         movie is bullshit.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Now wait a second, Chad. There's no \n                         reason for hostility.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Shut up, you fucking loser. The only \n                         reason I took this part was because \n                         someone said you knew Quentin \n                         Tarantino! You're nowhere, man.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of \n                         your shit, you hostess twinkie \n                         motherfucker!\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         What'd you call me?\n\n                                     NICK\n                         You heard me.\n\n                                     PALOMINO\n                         Say it again.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         You hostess twinkie motherfucker!\n\n               Palomino suddenly punches Nick in the stomach, leaving him \n               bent over and gasping for breath. Nicole instantly leaps on \n               Palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of \n               his head. Palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as \n               Wanda rushes forward.\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         Alright, everyone just stop. Stop! \n                         Stop this right now!\n\n               As she tries to separate Nicole and Palomino, Palomino shoves \n               her hard, knocking her down. Instantly Wolf leaps off the \n               camera and runs up to Palomino.\n\n                                     WOLF\n                         Alright, you've asked for it, Chad!\n\n               Palomino suddenly punches Wolf in the teeth, dropping him \n               like a stone.\n\n                                     WANDA\n                              (shrieks)\n                         Wolf!\n\n               Suddenly Nick staggers to his feet and rushes at Palomino. \n               His momentum knocks all three backwards onto the bed, \n               Palomino's head cracking Nicole in the teeth.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         Oh, God!\n\n               Nicole rolls free as Nick and Palomino wrestle on the bed. \n               Nick gets Palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding \n               his head against the mattress.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         You want to pick my brain?!

He and the Boom man rush \n               forward and finally manage to pry Palomino free.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Get him out of here! Someone take \n                         him back to his hotel!\n\n               As the Gaffer and Boom man drag off the almost unconscious \n               Palomino, the Scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him.\n\n                                     SCRIPT\n                              (sniffling)\n                         Chad...\n\n               Suddenly, everything becomes quiet except for Nick's labored \n               breathing and the Scriptgirl's sniffles. Nick leans over and \n               touches Nicole's shoulder.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Are you alright?\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         Don't touch me.\n\n               EXT. DAY. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE SET\n\n               The Gaffer and AC help the still-groggy Palomino into the \n               back of the production van. JEFF, the driver, watches them \n               in sleepy curiosity.\n\n               With Palomino safely propped in a seat, the AC goes back to \n               the set. The Gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out \n               of his back pocket and slaps it into Palomino's motionless \n               hand.\n\n                                     GAFFER\n                         It's called \"Tsunami.\" A Japanese \n                         tidal wave hits New York.

I've loved you since the day \n                         we met.\n\n               Nicole sits for a long moment in stunned silence.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         Why didn't you tell me?\n\n                                     NICK\n                         I didn't want anything to get in the \n                         way of us working together.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         God, and all this time I thought...\n\n               Nick and Nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss.\n\n               INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN\n\n               Nicole snaps awake with a jolt. She glances quickly at the \n               clock which reads 4:35. The sound of the shower still running \n               in the bathroom.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         Oh, God.\n\n               Nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. As the \n               camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right \n               against the lens, turning the image to total BLACKNESS.\n\n               The frame is BLACK. The recognizable clatter and clunk of \n               the FILM CREW is heard. Wanda's voice is prominent.\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         Don't go out that door!\n\n               Suddenly a DOOR opens away from camera and the AC stops, a \n               foot away from the lens. Behind him, Wanda and the rest of \n               the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming. \n               We see now the door and the plywood walls around it are FAKE.\n\n               INT. THE SET. DAY\n\n                                     AC\n                         Why not?\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         It's part of the set, goddamnit.

This is an emergency.\n\n               The AC rushes past and a moment later the camera DOLLIES \n               slowly through the fake door toward Wanda pacing near the \n               set camera.\n\n                                     WANDA\n                              (into her walkie)\n                         Has Ellen showed up yet?\n\n                                     WALKIE\n                         ssss... kkkkkrrk.\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         Get her into wardrobe right away.\n\n                                     WALKIE\n                         ssskk... ssssrrrk?\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         No! Scene six; Scene five has been \n                         postponed. I'm not going to say it \n                         again; Mr. Palomino is not working \n                         today. Now where is that smoke \n                         machine!\n\n               INT. SET BUILDING, HALLWAY. DAY\n\n               The AC bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and \n               walks quickly toward the camera. Without knocking he pushes \n               open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short.\n\n                                     AC\n                         Oh. Sorry.\n\n               Standing on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off \n               the running faucet is, TITO a DWARF. He is dressed in a sky \n               blue tuxedo with tails. A top hat and white gloves rest on \n               the closed toilet seat. Tito appears extremely annoyed.\n\n                                     TITO\n                         What do you want?!\n\n                                     AC\n                         I need to use the bathroom. Kind of \n                         an emergency.\n\n                                     TITO\n                         Well, fucking knock!!\n\n               Tito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall, the \n               AC staring after him in astonishment.\n\n                                     TITO\n                              (muttering)\n                         I swear to Christ, one of these days \n                         I'm going to punch somebody in the \n                         balls!\n\n               INT. WARDROBE ROOM. DAY\n\n               Camera is close on Nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin \n               white veil is placed on her head. Camera pulls back to reveal \n               SACHIKO, the Costume Designer putting the finishing touches \n               to Nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white \n               wedding gown. Nick stands nearby, smoking.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Just as we pull up to your apartment \n                         Palomino suddenly says he feels so \n                         sick he can't work today.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         God.

But I'm not \n                         worrying about it. I had this dream \n                         last night where I was on the set. \n                         You were in it, and another woman, \n                         someone older. Anyway, everything \n                         was going wrong. The harder I tried \n                         to hold things together the more \n                         they fell apart. And you know what \n                         that dream was telling me, Nicole? \n                         You just got to roll with it. And \n                         that's what I'm doing, I'm rolling \n                         with it. So, we'll just shoot the \n                         Dream Sequence today.\n\n               Just then Tito walks in.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Hey, Tito.

Thanks for coming \n                         in on such short notice. This is \n                         Nicole; she's playing Ellen.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         Hello.

A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY\n\n               A dented, ancient smoke machine squats forlornly in the middle \n               of the set.

Just as Tito gets \n               to his mark the smoke machine backfires with a tremendous \n               explosion and begins filling the room with dense, blinding \n               smoke.\n\n               INT. THE SET. DAY\n\n               The smoke blanks out the entire frame. Frantic shouts are \n               heard from unseen bodies.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Cut! Cut!

I got it!\n\n               The smoke machine emits a loud hiss and dies, filling the \n               room with sudden silence. Slowly the smoke begins to clear \n               as the crew moves around muttering and coughing.\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         Clear the set! Ellen! Tito!

The \n               camera BOOMS up, passing over a woman's bare shins, a \n               flowered, blue silk housecoat until finally coming to rest \n               on the pleasantly smiling face of CORA. This is the same \n               woman who played Ellen's Mother in Part One; she is dressed \n               exactly the same as she was in their scene. The camera pulls \n               back to reveal JEFF the Intern standing nervously beside her \n               with a red notebook in his hands.\n\n                                     CORA\n                         Hi, Nicky.\n\n               Nick gapes in utter astonishment.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Mom!\n\n               INT.

She said she was looking \n                         for him so I figured I should just \n                         bring her up here. You look really \n                         pretty in that dress.\n\n               Nicole nods politely then looks to the Makeup corner where \n               Nick sits talking earnestly to his mother.\n\n               INT.

He \n               is smoking fiercely, holding his top hat with one hand. \n               Suddenly he begins laughing in a loud, stage bellow.\n\n               INT. A CORNER OF THE SET.

Nick turns to address Nicole and Tito and the edge \n               immediately slips back into his voice.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         OK, here we go.

OFF THE SET. DAY\n\n               Wolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly \n               in a chair beside Cora. He does not speak to her and gazes \n               blankly out at Nick, Tito, and Nicole on the set some distance \n               away. Cora however stares at the side of his head with such \n               intensity Wolf can't help but turn to her.\n\n               Cora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares \n               even more intently into his eye.\n\n               Wolf glances away for a moment then looks back. Cora continues \n               to stare at him. Suddenly, his eye is full of tears. Cora \n               watches in rapt silence. Wolf is crying openly now. Cora \n               reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently \n               lifts the eyepatch off of his eye. A tight smile of \n               satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is \n               released, streaming quickly down Wolf's cheek. No one sees \n               this.\n\n               INT. THE SET. DAY\n\n               Nick paces tensely in front of Nicole and Tito.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal. \n                         It's a dream, alright. Strange things \n                         happen in a dream. All you have to \n                         do is laugh. Why is that such a \n                         problem?\n\n                                     TITO\n                         Why does it have to be a dwarf?\n\n                                     NICK\n                         What?\n\n                                     TITO\n                         Why does my character have to be a \n                         dwarf?\n\n                                     NICK\n                         He doesn't have to be a dwarf.\n\n                                     TITO\n                         Then why is he?!

Do you know anyone \n                         who's had a dream with a dwarf in \n                         it? NO! I don't even have dreams \n                         with dwarves in them! The only place \n                         I've seen dwarves in dreams is in \n                         stupid movies like this! Make it \n                         weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone \n                         will go \"whoa whoa whoa, must be a \n                         dream, there's a fucking dwarf in \n                         it!\" Well, I'm sick of it. You can \n                         take this Dream Sequence and shove \n                         it up your ass!\n\n               Tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks \n               out. Everyone stares at Nick who is frozen in stunned silence. \n               Finally Wanda approaches him hesitantly.\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         Nick?\n                              (no response)\n                         I can get right on the phone. We'll \n                         try to get another... small person \n                         here as soon as possible.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         No. He's absolutely right.\n\n               Nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence. \n               Wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes.\n\n                                     WOLF\n                         You want to just shoot Ellen, Nick? \n                         She could be in the dream by herself.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         No. We're not going to shoot anything. \n                         I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help, \n                         but it's over. I can't take it \n                         anymore. I tried to roll with it but \n                         it's time to face the music; I can't \n                         do this. I am not a director. The \n                         shoot is over. I give up.\n\n               Nick's speech has the simple eloquence of truth; he is not \n               bitter or self-pitying. He seems unaware of how disturbing \n               this is to the crew. They all stand around him in shock, \n               afraid to move or speak. Finally Wolf turns to the AC and \n               puts his hand on his shoulder, like a father to his young \n               son.\n\n                                     WOLF\n                         Take the camera off the dolly. Start \n                         putting it away.\n\n               Everyone watches the AC unfasten the camera in silence. Nicole \n               stands alone on the set in her wedding dress, still holding \n               the golden apple. Her face is frozen in dismay. Suddenly \n               CORA comes through the set door and marches up to Nicole.\n\n                                     CORA\n                         Give me that apple!\n\n               At the sound of his mother's voice, Nick looks up. He sees \n               her snatch the apple from Nicole's hand and march back out \n               the door, closing it behind her.\n\n                                     CORA\n                              (behind the door)\n                         I'm ready, Nick!\n\n               INT. BY THE CAMERA. DAY\n\n               Nick gets up slowly and whispers intensely to Wanda, Wolf, \n               and the rest of the crew.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         Roll camera. Roll sound. Let's go. \n                         Right away.\n\n               Wolf grabs the camera and puts it on his shoulder (hand-held) \n               as the rest of the crew moves quickly and silently into \n               position. On a terse signal from Nick the camera starts \n               rolling.\n\n               INT. THE SET. THE DREAM. DAY\n\n               Nicole takes the silent \"action\" cue from Nick.\n\n                                     NICOLE\n                         I am so hungry.\n\n               Right on cue Cora walks through the door, holding the golden \n               apple out in front of her. She circles Nicole with \n               determination, seemingly oblivious to Nick and the rest of \n               the crew hovering behind Wolf as he begins following her \n               with the hand-held camera. Wolf is now in his element; gliding \n               like Nureyev with the camera. When he pans suddenly with \n               Cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera \n               range.\n\n               Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly. \n               Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of Nicole. \n               Wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing CU \n               of the apple with Nicole seen behind it. Nicole reaches out, \n               grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it.\n\n               CU Nick's face, eyes wide in anxious delight.\n\n               Cora takes one step forward. CU her fuzzy slippers stopping \n               right on the yellow tape mark. Cora waits momentarily until \n               Wolf has reframed both her and Nicole, then lets out a huge \n               laugh.\n\n               INT. THE SET.

The Nurse carries an extra overcoat. \n               Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be \n               quiet.\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         And roll sound.

DAY\n\n               The camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew. \n               Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues. \n               As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually \n               changes. One by one people drift into their own private worlds \n               of reflection.\n\n               MS the Sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his \n               stopwatch.

Nick glances up and sees Nicole \n               beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts. Suddenly she looks \n               up and her eyes meet Nick's. She slips him the barest hint \n               of a smile.\n\n               The camera DOLLIES slowly through the standing, silent group, \n               passing over faces in different degrees of thought.\n\n               CU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing \n               ten seconds have passed.\n\n               MS Nick.

AN AWARDS CEREMONY\n\n               CHAD PALOMINO stands at a gleaming podium, looking radiant \n               in an immaculate tuxedo.

He stands grinning like an idiot as the \n               applause continues.\n\n               INT. THE SET. DAY\n\n               MS Nick, still wrapped in thought, his lips starting to form \n               the same idiotic smile. MS Nicole. The camera DOLLIES slowly \n               into her face, now tinged with a slight uneasiness.\n\n               INT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT\n\n               Wide shot at the counter. Nicole stands facing a large bald \n               man with his back to the camera.

The camera begins a slow DOLLY into his CU.\n\n               INT. WANDA'S APT. DAY\n\n               Wolf stands like Thor in the middle of the Red Set, his arms \n               crossed over his chest, his jaw set in determination. Smoke \n               billows around him. At his feet, dressed in Nicole's wedding \n               gown, Wanda sobs hysterically.\n\n                                     WANDA\n                         Wolf, I'm sorry!

I love you, Wolf!\n\n               Wolf remains unmoved for a long moment. Finally he reaches \n               out with a forgiving smile and pats Wanda's head.\n\n               INT. THE SET. DAY\n\n               MS Wolf. He glances furtively at Wanda with a trace of hope \n               still in his eyes.\n\n               MS Wanda, looking off. The camera DOLLIES into her CU.\n\n               INT. A CHEAP HOTEL ROOM\n\n               This is the same hotel room from Part Two, in which we saw \n               Nicole and Chad Palomino.

She shifts slightly and glances quickly around \n               her. Her smile is tinged with the hint of sexual pleasure.\n\n               MS the Gaffer, frowning, absorbed in thought. The camera \n               DOLLIES into a CU of him.\n\n               INT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT. DAY\n\n               Suddenly, a CU of an incredibly beautiful hamburger being \n               placed in a toasted bun on a gleaming white oval plate. A \n               hand places a garnish of parsley on it then carries the plate \n               to the lunch counter. Camera PANS to reveal the GAFFER sitting \n               on the stool. He picks up the hamburger and takes a huge \n               bite out of it. This shot holds for quite some time as he \n               continues to chew.\n\n               INT. THE SET.
