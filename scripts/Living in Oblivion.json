The dolly \n               forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME \n               CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, \n               glass full moon. Fade to BLACK.\n\n               Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping \n               the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White.\n\n<b>               EXT.

They work in almost complete \n               silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie-\n               talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters \n               and buzzes occasionally.

HOTEL ROOM. DAWN\n</b>\n               Nicole snaps awake with a jolt. She glances quickly at the \n               clock which reads 4:35. The sound of the shower still running \n               in the bathroom.\n\n<b>                                     NICOLE\n</b>                         Oh, God.\n\n               Nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. As the \n               camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right \n               against the lens, turning the image to total BLACKNESS.\n\n               The frame is BLACK. The recognizable clatter and clunk of \n               the FILM CREW is heard. Wanda's voice is prominent.\n\n<b>                                     WANDA\n</b>                         Don't go out that door!\n\n               Suddenly a DOOR opens away from camera and the AC stops, a \n               foot away from the lens. Behind him, Wanda and the rest of \n               the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming. \n               We see now the door and the plywood walls around it are FAKE.\n\n<b>               INT.

DAY\n</b>\n               The AC bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and \n               walks quickly toward the camera. Without knocking he pushes \n               open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short.\n\n<b>                                     AC\n</b>                         Oh.

He is dressed in a sky \n               blue tuxedo with tails. A top hat and white gloves rest on \n               the closed toilet seat.

Camera pulls back to reveal \n               SACHIKO, the Costume Designer putting the finishing touches \n               to Nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white \n               wedding gown.
