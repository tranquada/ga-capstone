A\n     MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately.\n\n\n<b>     FADE IN:\n</b>\n\n<b>     INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n     ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking\n     man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of\n     him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we\n     catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side\n     to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman.\n\n     She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched\n     back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches\n     down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him\n     deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster.\n\n     The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what\n     we are watching is on a TELEVISION.\n\n     Further back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS\n     standing before the television watching the act.\n\n     The CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down\n     the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO\n     CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE,\n     looking, dusting, talking.\n\n     We continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the\n     tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet\n     covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his\n     dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of\n     his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\n     LIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The\n     wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.\n     The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the\n     end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,\n     their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.\n\n     A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps\n     out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,\n     with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.\n     He does not run through the rain -- he walks.\n\n     DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a\n     homicide detective runs out to meet him.\n\n<b>                                                                 2\n</b>\n\n<b>                         CARDENAS\n</b>               Is it Marsh?\n\n<b>                         REESE\n</b>               Yeah.\n\n     Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an\n     instant, then it's gone.\n\n<b>                         REESE\n</b>               Sir, do you mind if we get out of the\n               rain?\n\n     Cardenas doesn't move.  He ignores the question.\n\n<b>                         CARDENAS\n</b>               Who found him?\n\n<b>                         REESE\n</b>               His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.\n\n<b>                         CARDENAS\n</b>               She was here?\n\n<b>                         REESE\n</b>               No.  She stopped by to pick up some\n               papers.\n\n<b>                         CARDENAS\n</b>               Show me.\n\n     Reese starts for the house.  Cardenas looks up into the night\n     sky.  A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of\n     Marsh in bed.\n\n     Cardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the\n     FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the\n     gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of\n     indifference.\n\n     Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER\n     TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the\n     body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a\n     portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes.\n\n<b>                         CARDENAS\n</b>               How long?\n<b>                                                                  3\n</b>\n<b>                         MCCURDY\n</b>               About three hours.\n\n<b>                         CARDENAS\n</b>               Cause?\n\n<b>                         MCCURDY\n</b>               Not sure.  I'll have everything you\n               need tomorrow.\n\n<b>                         REESE\n</b>               Take a look at this.\n\n     Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it.  On\n     top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal\n     spray.  Inside are ROPES, HANDCUFFS and an assortment of SEXUAL\n<b>     AIDES.\n</b>\n<b>                         TROXELL\n</b>               This guy was into some kinky shit.\n\n     Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of\n     the room.\n\n\n<b>     INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n     JOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair.  Her eyes are tired -- red from\n     crying.  She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come\n     more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right\n     cosmetics.  She has a corporate look to her.\n\n     Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her.\n\n<b>                         CARDENAS\n</b>               Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney\n               John Cardenas.

We found traces\n                    of sperm on the sheets.  The\n                    toxicology report says there were\n                    high levels of cocaine in his blood.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    What'd he die of?\n\n<b>                              MCCURDY\n</b>                    The official cause of death was a\n                    cardiac arrest.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    The official cause?\n\n<b>                              MCCURDY\n</b>                    That's what my report will read.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    But there's more?\n\n          They reach a door and stop.\n\n<b>                              MCCURDY\n</b>                    It's speculative at this point.\n                    Marsh had advanced Arterial disease.\n                    His heart attack was induced by\n                    excessive aerobic activity -- in\n                    conjunction with the drug.\n\n          McCurdy enters the room.  Cardenas thinks for a moment, then\n          follows.\n\n\n<b>                                                                      5\n</b>\n\n<b>          INT.

Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy who\n          is already seated next to Reese and Troxell.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                         (to McCurdy)\n                    What are you saying, Henry?

He walks over to\n          the window and stares outside.  Reese, Troxell and McCurdy wait\n          as he thinks.  A beat.  Cardenas turns back to the room.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    What can we prove?\n\n<b>                              MCCURDY\n</b>                    We know Marsh had a head cold.   We\n                    found cocaine mixed with water in a\n                    nasal spray container on the\n                    nightstand.  The coke would contract\n                    the nasal membrane the same as any\n                    decongestant, but for a much shorter\n                    time.  He'd keep using more and more\n                    -- never knowing what he was taking.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    Any prints on the nasal spray?\n\n<b>                              REESE\n</b>                    Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's.\n\n<b>                              TROXELL\n</b>                    What if he did know what was in it?\n                    A lot of users put it in nasal spray\n                    bottles so they can use it in public.\n\n<b>                              MCCURDY\n</b>                    Cocaine is the last thing a man in\n                    his condition would want.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the\n                    scene?\n\n<b>                                                                      6\n</b>\n\n<b>                              REESE\n</b>                    A man across the street from Marsh\n                    saw her drive up about four thirty\n                    Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are\n                    all over the place.\n\n          Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall.

There's no evidence that\n                    he had anything but straight sex\n                    prior to meeting Miss Lawson.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    What about the will?\n\n<b>                              TROXELL\n</b>                    That's the best part.

To let go of what you want?\n\n          Dulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light\n          of the setting sun.  Their eyes meet.  He starts to lean in\n          towards her -- then stops.  He gets up and walks away.\n\n\n<b>          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - EVENING\n</b>\n          Rebecca's car pulls up in front.

Dulaney stands\n          in the middle of the room -- his eyes following her every move.\n\n<b>                              REBECCA\n</b>                    Yes -- it would be nice.\n\n<b>                              DULANEY\n</b>                    What would?\n\n<b>                              REBECCA\n</b>                    You and me -- making love.\n\n<b>                              DULANEY\n</b>                    Is that what you think I was\n                    thinking?\n\n<b>                              REBECCA\n</b>                    No -- that's what I know you were\n                    thinking.\n\n          Before Dulaney can start to protest she continues.  She slowly\n          walks behind him.  Dulaney stares straight ahead.\n\n<b>                              REBECCA\n</b>                    How often do you make love to your\n                    wife, Frank?  Once a week?  Sometimes\n                    twice?  There once was passion,\n                    wasn't there?  But now it's bland,\n                    predictable.  Tell me, when you do it\n                    -- do you always think of her?  Or do\n                    you wonder what it would be like to\n                    be with someone else?  Someone wild.\n                    Someone who would force you to lose\n                    control.\n\n          Her words strip his thoughts bare.  He is vulnerable.\n\n<b>                              REBECCA\n</b>                         (continuing)\n                    There's nothing wrong in admitting\n                    that you want me, Frank.\n\n<b>                              DULANEY\n</b>                    You take a lot for granted.\n\n          Dulaney starts for the door.  Rebecca's cool exterior fades,\n          giving way to her vulnerable side.\n\n\n<b>                                                                      35\n</b>\n<b>                              REBECCA\n</b>                    Please stay, Frank.

I just need to feel\n                    close to someone.\n\n          Dulaney turns back towards her.  A beat.  He thinks for a\n          moment, then walks back into the room.  Rebecca smiles warmly,\n          invitingly.\n\n<b>                              REBECCA\n</b>                    I'll be back in a minute.  Help\n                    yourself to a drink.\n\n          She disappears down the hall.  Dulaney stands were he is,\n          wondering what he is doing there.  He walks over to the BAR and\n          pours a SCOTCH.  He looks down the hall.\n\n<b>          HIS POV - REBECCA'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n          The bedroom door is open.  The room is DARK -- Lit only by the\n          moon.  Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head.\n          MOONLIGHT washes over her body, SILHOUETTING her.  She runs her\n          hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her\n          round, full breasts.  She stops for a moment -- and we sense\n          she knows Dulaney is watching her.\n\n          Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized.  He knows he should turn\n          away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look.\n\n          One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing\n          her sheer, white panties.  She bends forward slightly and\n          slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of\n          them.\n\n          We can see the desire on Dulaney's face.  He looks away.  The\n          conflict inside him grows.  He looks back.\n\n          Rebecca walks into the hall.  She is barefoot --  wearing a\n          long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's.  If she wasn't\n          aware he was watching her before -- she is now.  It doesn't\n          seem to bother her.  She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes\n          inviting his.\n\n          Dulaney moves towards her.  They meet in the middle of the\n          room.  She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can\n          smell her.  She cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to\n          bring his lips to hers.  The longing overcomes him.  He kisses\n          her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs\n          him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back.  She bites\n          his lip.\n\n\n<b>                                                                      36\n</b>\n<b>                              REBECCA\n</b>                         (whispering)\n                    My way.\n\n          Dulaney ignores her.  He tries to kiss her again.  She turns\n          her head away.\n\n          She walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door.\n          Dulaney follows.  He tries the door -- it's locked.  He starts\n          to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living room.\n          He starts to leave -- stops.  He looks at the bedroom door.\n          His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him.  He moves\n          quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination.  He\n          breaks the door open with his shoulder.\n\n          Rebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if waiting\n          for him.  He moves to her.  She can see the fire in his eyes.\n          He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly --\n          feeding his craving for her.\n\n<b>                              REBECCA\n</b>                    My way.\n\n          He is lost within her now and doesn't hear her.  She pulls his\n          hair, jerking his head back.  Her eyes command him to follow\n          her demand.\n\n          Something in him snaps -- a new door opens.  He pushes her back\n          onto the DRESSING CABINET.  He kisses her, running his hand up\n          her thighs, hiking up her dress.  She wraps her legs around his\n          waist.  They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and\n          bottles to the floor.  He lifts her -- carries her to the bed -\n          - lays her down and rips her dress from her body.  Their\n          passion is unleased.  They grope and claw for one another\n          hungrily.  She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the\n          shoulder.  His face tenses from the pain, but he MOANS with\n          pleasure.\n\n\n<b>          INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n          Dark.  Sharon is asleep.

He\n          turns his back to the mirror.  Several deep FINGERNAIL SCRAPES\n          are dug into his back.  He looks at himself in the mirror.\n\n\n\n<b>                                                                      37\n</b>\n<b>          INT.

She\n                    secretly administered cocaine, then\n                    used wild and physically demanding\n                    sex to induce a heart attack.\n                         (beat)\n                    Making love is an act of passion\n                    between two people to affirm their\n                    vows of love.  This was not an act of\n                    love -- this was an act of greed.\n                    This was betrayal.

He breaks down, weeping over her body,\n          his tears signaling to Dulaney that she is dead.\n\n\n<b>          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT\n</b>\n          Police cars are lined up outside, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.\n\n\n<b>          INT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n          Members of the POLICE FORCE, along with FORENSIC PEOPLE go over\n          the area.  Dulaney sits on the couch.  He looks indifferent --\n          as if all emotion has been sucked out of him.  Troxell is\n          beside him, taking notes.  Dulaney looks up.\n\n          A BODYBAG on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room.\n\n\n<b>                                                                      106\n</b>\n          Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Cardenas enters from the\n          bedroom.  They lock eyes.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    Paley's confessed to the whole thing.\n                    It's like he's got no will to live\n                    now that she's gone.\n                         (thinks for a moment)\n                    She almost got away with it.  Ironic,\n                    huh?  Do you believe in karma, Frank?\n\n          Dulaney doesn't answer.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    Well -- call it what you want.  Fate.\n                    Destiny.  We usually get what we\n                    deserve in the end.\n\n          A beat.  Dulaney looks at him wearily.\n\n<b>                              DULANEY\n</b>                    Can I go?\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                         (to Troxell)\n                    You get his statement?\n\n<b>                              TROXELL\n</b>                    Yeah.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    Then you can go.\n\n          Dulaney gets up and starts for the door.  Cardenas watches him.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    Frank?\n\n          Dulaney turns around slowly.  Cardenas reaches into his\n          RAINCOAT pocket and take out a VHS TAPE.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                    I found this video in her room.  It\n                    has your name on it.\n\n          The two men lock eyes.  There is a long silence between them.\n          Dulaney waits for Cardenas' next move.\n\n<b>                              CARDENAS\n</b>                         (holding it out)\n                    I assume it's yours.\n\n     Dulaney knows that Cardenas has seen it.  A hint of a grateful\n     smile shows on his face.  He takes the tape.\n\n\n<b>                                                                      107\n</b>\n<b>                              DULANEY\n</b>                    Thanks.\n\n\n<b>     EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     A light RAIN falls.  Dulaney walks out and heads towards the\n     street.  He stops -- looks back at the condo -- then walks down\n     the street towards his car.\n\n\n<b>     FADE TO BLACK\n</b>\n<b>     --------------------------------------------------------------\n</b>\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Body of Evidence</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Brad Mirman\" title=\"Scripts by Brad Mirman\">Brad Mirman</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Body of Evidence Script.html#comments\" title=\"Body of Evidence comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:00:53.769071"}
