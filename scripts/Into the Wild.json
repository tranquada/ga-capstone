He wasn't anti-social, he\n          always had friends, and everybody liked\n          him - but he could go off and entertain\n          himself for hours, he didn't seem to need\n          toys or friends. He could be alone\n          without being lonely. The secrets our\n          parents kept, though unknown to Chris and\n          I, led to bouts of rage and even violence\n          between them that we had been forced to\n          witness since we were very young. It\n          seemed like they never fought without us.\n          I remember the first family meeting to\n          let Chris and me in on their plans for\n          getting a divorce. They wanted us to\n          choose which of them we'd live with. I\n          cried my eyes out. But the divorce never\n          happened, though the threats and meetings\n          never stopped. It wasn't long before\n          Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom\n          and dad to go ahead and get the divorce.\n          Chris and I just wanted to get away from\n          their fights and mom kept promising to\n          get out and take us with her as soon as\n          their company made enough money. Dad had\n          been the young genius [that] NASA\n          enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the\n          American satellite radar systems that\n          would be our answer to the Russian\n          Sputnik. And mom and he later started up\n          a consulting firm combining her get-up-\n          and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of\n          knowledge. By the time the company\n          actually made its first million, the\n          careerism and money seemed to erase her\n          memory of the promise she'd made us.\n<b>                       (MORE)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                              16.\n</b>\n<b>                            CARINE (V.O.)

On\n          New Year's Eve 1957, I was stationed over\n          in Okinawa. My wife and son were here in\n          the States, just driving down the road\n          when a fellow who'd had too much to drink\n          plowed right into them. Killed them\n          both. Anyway, you might think that the\n          last thing in the world I'd do, is go to\n          the whiskey, but at the time, it felt\n          like the only thing I could do. And I\n          did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured\n          I wasn't doing my wife and son any good,\n          mourning them with a bottle. So, I\n          pulled myself together and quit drinking,\n          cold turkey.
