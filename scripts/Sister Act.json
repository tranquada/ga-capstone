The poster shows a \n     glittering CHRISTY VAN CARTIER:  singing star of a fifth-\n     rate Vegas lounge.  Christy wears tight spangles and a \n     major wig on the poster.

A dressing \n     room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail \n     polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry \n     are scattered everywhere.\n\n     We hear the movement of BED SPRINGS as someone sits up in \n     the dark.\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY'S VOICE\n</b>               Come on, Vince -- hold me a minute.\n\n<b>                               VINCE'S VOICE\n</b>               I'd love to. babe -- but I've got to go.  \n               It was great.

Vince is a powerful, charismatic \n     man who rules an organized crime empire with personal \n     magnetism and threat.  Vince's hold over Christy is \n     obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous \n     one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next.\n\n<b>                               VINCE\n</b>                             (half to Christy, half \n                             to the mirror)\n               You are something else.\n\n     Christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette.\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY\n</b>               Come on -- stay.

The Moonlight isn't all that small, it's \n     just seen better days.\n\n<b>     INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     A spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage.  The \n     man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an \n     Elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks \n     and style.\n\n<b>                               ELVIS\n</b>               Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

While Christy does her best, her singing voice is \n     not on a par with those of the other Ronelles.\n\n     The lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few \n     drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids.

DRESSING ROOM - LATER\n</b>\n     A small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a \n     sputtering fan for ventilation.  Christy has her own \n     dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a \n     few feet away.  Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are \n     draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY\n</b>               Screw this dump.

STAINED CLASS WINDOW - DAY\n</b>\n     Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red, \n     blue and green stained glass.  An ORGAN plays a hymn -- \n     badly.  Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated.\n\n     PAN DOWN to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel \n     at the ancient St. Katherine's Convent.  The organ isn't \n     getting any better, and we see it is being played by SISTER \n     ALMA, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing \n     aid.  Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because \n     Sister Alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's \n     playing.\n\n     As the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she \n     closes the door behind her.

Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the \n     next furrow over.\n\n     Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes.  \n     Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their \n     tasks.  Christy decides that she will try and make Sister \n     Mary  Robert talk.  She picks up the carrot and tosses it \n     at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert jumps.  She waggles a finger \n     at Christy, scolding her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing.\n\n     Page 31.\n\n     Christy is now determined.  She takes her hoe, and tiptoes \n     nearer to Mary Robert.  Very gently, she uses the handle of \n     the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her.\n\n     Mary Robert vips, very loudly.  All the other nuns turn \n     and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her.  Christy waggles \n     her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her.\n\n     Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.  She sees \n     Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow.  Mother \n     Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything.\n\n<b>     EXT.

One wall is \n     divided into stalls by wooden partitions.  In each stall is \n     a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a \n     thin stream of lukewarm water.  We see only the nuns' heads \n     and shoulders.\n\n     Still sleepy, Christy leans against the wall of her stall, \n     her eyes closed.

The atmosphere is a combination of hazy \n     darkness and colored lights; the club should have the \n     feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all \n     ages and races.  The MUSIC percolates, and Christy starts \n     to move to it.  She and Mary Robert find a table in the \n     corner, and signal a nearby waitress.\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY\n</b>               A couple of bowls of chili.\n                             (holding up the beer)\n               And another round of these.\n\n     The waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club \n     has never hosted nuns before.\n\n<b>                               MARY ROBERT\n</b>                             (to the waitress, \n                             confidentially)\n               I have to do this.

Christy and Mary \n     Robert watch the action at the club.\n\n     Across the room, MIKE the bartender stares at the nuns, \n     especially Christy; he tries to place her.\n\n<b>                               MARY ROBERT\n</b>               Who are all these people?\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY\n</b>               This is your neighborhood.

He takes out a copy of Vince's fax \n     photo and stares at it.  He covers Christy's hair in the \n     photo with his hands, creating a wimple.  There is no \n     question in his mind; the two are the same.  Mike has a \n     dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the \n     drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron.\n\n     There is a LIVE BAND on a small stage at one end of the \n     club.  They start playing a hot dance number, and the club \n     really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills.  Christy \n     and Mary Robert, both still seated, start to move with the \n     music.\n\n     A very good-looking LOCAL DUDE comes over to the nuns \n     table.

They scream, \n     and Christy grabs Mary Robert and throws her out of the \n     car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags.\n\n     Struggling to her feet, Christy sees the car go into \n     reverse, and then pull forward again.

Mike pursues, \n     looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but \n     not finding any openings.  He takes the steps two at a time \n     and begins to gain ground.\n\n     At the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in \n     the grating.

Christy's section includes an image of a nun in a \n     miniskirt and spike heels, accompanied by neon letters that \n     read \"St. Kate!\"  People gather in the street, watching the \n     nuns' activities.

She has begun to see Christy \n     in a new light.  She looks thoughtful, and walks off.\n\n<b>     INT.

Bored, \n     looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and \n     glances at its contents;  routine money vouchers for \n     equipment, supplies, etc.  Tate is about to close the \n     folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye.\n\n<b>                               TATE\n</b>               What the hell is this...?\n\n     He examines a money voucher for a generous donation to St. \n     Katherine's Convent in San Francisco.

EDDIE'S CAR - DAY\n</b>\n     Eddie glances at the dashboard and sees that the fuel \n     gauge is close to empty.  He wheels into a gas station and \n     pulls up to the tanks.  Christy starts to open the door, \n     but he stops her.\n\n<b>                               EDDIE\n</b>               What're you doing?\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY\n</b>               Even nuns have to pee.\n\n     He lets her go, then gets out to pump gas.\n\n<b>     INT. WOMEN'S ROOM\n</b>\n     Christy enters the bathroom; it is deserted.  She fondles \n     her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.  This position \n     doesn't work for her; she stands.  She looks around her; \n     she glances up, toward heaven.  She decides to do things \n     simply, and speaks in a matter-of-fact tone.\n\n     Page 95.\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY\n</b>               Okay, it's me.  Mary Clarence.

I can't believe I'm doing this. \n               Okay, look, I know I should just get back \n               in the car, and get the hell out of here.  \n               Save my skin.  I mean, it's not wrong, \n               Vince really wants to kill me. Why do you \n               make guys like Vince?  But if I don't \n               sing at St. Matthew's... Mary Robert.  \n               Mary Patrick.  It means so much to them.  \n               They're counting on me -- and I like \n               that.  Maybe Reverend Mother is right, \n               maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I'm \n               just some Vegas slut, but... can we cut a \n               deal here?  I mean, I still don't believe \n               in, like, most of the Commandments, and \n               stuff in church still gives me the \n               willies, but -- if I go back and sing, if \n               I do a good deed, will you promise I \n               won't get killed?  All I want is a sign.  \n               Lightning.  Thunder. Anything.\n\n     Suddenly, Christy hears the toilet FLUSH in the next \n     bathroom.\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY\n</b>                             (in disbelief)\n               No.  No.  Doesn't count...\n\n     Suddenly, Christy hears \"AVE MARIA\" coming from a radio or \n     TV outside the bathroom.  She looks up; a ray of sunlight \n     illuminates a grimy, dime-store Christmas tree ornament \n     hanging from a room deodorizer.  The ornament is a glittery \n     angel; it sparkles in the light.\n\n     Christy leaves the bathroom, still not quite sure.\n\n<b>     EXT. GAS STATION\n</b>\n     Christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station \n     office.  A bored Mechanic is watching a small portable TV. \n     On the TV is an episode of \"THE FLYING NUN\":  Sally Field, \n     in full habit, is soaring along.\n\n     Suddenly, Christy hears the loud ROAR of a motorcycle \n     starting up over by one of the gas pumps.  The BIKER turns \n     and looks at Christy:  he has long hair, and a beard and \n     moustache, and he looks, well, a bit like Jesus.\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY\n</b>               Oh my God...\n\n     Christy runs up to the Biker..\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY\n</b>               I'm late for church.  Can I get a lift?\n\n     Page 96.\n\n     Christy swings onto the back seat; the Biker puts his \n     Harley in gear and flies down the street.  Eddie is shocked \n     as he drops some money on the ground and jumps into his car \n     to follow.\n\n<b>     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY\n</b>\n     We see a network truck parked in front of the landmark \n     cathedral.\n\n<b>     INT. CHAPEL\n</b>\n     There is a sense of chaos in the chapel as TECHNICIANS set \n     up television equipment, and Mother Superior leads the \n     choir as it rehearses.  Near the back of the chapel, Bishop \n     O'Hara looks concerned over the performance of the choir. A \n     CARDINAL walks up to Bishop O'Hara.\n\n<b>                               CARDINAL\n</b>               Is this the choir you've been speaking \n               so highly of, Bishop?\n\n<b>                               O'HARA\n</b>               They're just a bit nervous.  They'll be \n               fine.\n\n     The choir seems very demoralized as they finish the hymn. \n     Mary Patrick is close to tears.\n\n<b>                               MARY PATRICK\n</b>               We sound terrible   We need Mary \n               Clarence.\n\n<b>                               MARY LAZARUS\n</b>               We're losing it.\n\n<b>                               MARY ROBERT\n</b>               I don't understand.

Pull yourselves \n               together.\n\n     Clapping his hands briskly, the FLOOR DIRECTOR suddenly \n     steps forward from behind the TV cameras and hustles the \n     choir away from the altar.\n\n<b>                               FLOOR DIRECTOR\n</b>               Okay, Sisters, we have to move on now. \n               That was great, just great.  Charlie, \n               throw a spot on the pulpit.  Let's get a \n               balance.\n\n     Dispirited, the choir leaves the altar and walks toward \n     the back of the church.\n\n     Page 97.\n\n<b>     EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET\n</b>\n     The motorcycle flies through the streets, breaking every \n     traffic law on the books.  Christy's robe flaps behind her \n     in the wind, and she has a wide smile as she rides.  As \n     passersby stare at her, she holds out two fingers and \n     blesses them.\n\n<b>     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL\n</b>\n     Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, \n     wringing her hands with worry.  Suddenly, her face \n     brightens like the dawn as she sees Christy ride up.\n\n<b>                               MARY ROBERT\n</b>               You're here!  Thank goodness!\n\n<b>     INT. CATHEDRAL\n</b>\n     Christy and Mary Robert rush down a side corridor, turn a \n     corner and see two TV Technicians standing near some cables \n     with the letters of the network embroidered on the backs of \n     their jackets.  Christy rushes up to them and taps them on \n     the shoulders.\n\n<b>                               CHRISTY\n</b>               Excuse me -- where's the rehearsal room?\n\n     The two Technicians turn toward her, and she is horrified \n     to see they are. Joey and Willy.  Christy gasps as Willy \n     sticks a gun in her ribs.  Joey smiles at her.\n\n<b>                               JOEY\n</b>               The rehearsal room is right this way.\n\n     Joey opens a door that leads to an alley behind the \n     cathedral.
