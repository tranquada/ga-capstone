NOW\n\n\n1   EXT   NIGHT   URBAN TERRACE                                1\n\n    A row of rundown terrace houses. Some are boarded up. Not all\n    the street lights work. Those that do cast shadows of parked\n    vehicles glistening in the rain.\n\n    A front door opens and DON appears with rubbish which he puts\n    in a bin. He hears something and looks up to see four big\n    horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the\n    street. The wagon is a gigantic windowless box. The horses\n    are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver.\n    It's a very weird sight. DON, unable to take his eyes off\n    this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where\n    light from a TV flickers.\n\n                        DON\n              Carol!...

The back begins to open, top, bottom\n    and sides, like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals.\n\n    Shadowy FIGURES manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise\n    the roof.\n\n    While this is happening THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal a\n    garishly lit club across the street.\n\n    A group of DRUNKEN YOUTHS emerge from the club, staggering,\n    laughing, shouting, drinking, breaking bottles, and throwing\n    up. The LADS grope the GIRLS. Everyone's having \"a great\n    time\".\n\n    They see the wagon and stop, unsteadily, in their tracks.\n\n                           MARTIN\n                 What the...!\n\n    We now see what they see. The wagon has been converted into a\n    stage. We're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby\n    travelling theatre. Electric footlights are powered by a\n    clanking generator. The pediment above the stage carries the\n    words: THE ASTONISHING IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS.\n\n    PERCY, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as\n    a one-man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man\n    (ANTON, 18-19 years old) who emerges from the back of the\n    stage dressed as MERCURY, the messenger of the gods, with\n    wings on his helmet and sandals.\n\n\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               3.\n4   CONTINUED:                                                4\n\n\n                           ANTON/MERCURY\n                 Ladies and Gentlemen...

(He's sitting on a glass\n    plinth). DOCTOR PARNASSUS is seemingly in a trance. A bronze\n    tripod containing burning incense stands beside him.\n\n                           ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)\n                 Doctor Parnassus... as old as\n                 time... yes, ladies and gentlemen,\n                 more than a thousand years old ...\n                 he has the power to empower your\n                 mind. A secret learned in the\n                 mystic East. Let Doctor Parnassus\n                 open your imagination. Let him\n                 guide and transport you to worlds\n                 and possibilities you never dreamt\n                 of... If you dare. But... Beware...\n                 there are dangers. You will have to\n                 choose. Will your soul fly?... Or\n                 will it be dashed on the rocks of\n                 darkness? The choice is yours and\n                 yours alone. Transcend the heights\n                 on Beauty's wing.\n\n    A young woman, VALENTINA,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair\n    and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips\n    and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length\n    mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a\n    forest... This is `Beauty'. She turns and steps forward.\n\n    ANTON takes her hand. They make a couple of dance steps\n    together. They look enchanting and enchanted.\n\n                           ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)\n                     (to the audience)\n                 Or, if you must...\n\n    Now PERCY, in demon costume, leaps from behind the scenery .\n\n\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                4.\n4   CONTINUED: (2)                                             4\n\n\n                        ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)\n              ... scour the squalid depths with\n              Putrid's brother, Stench!\n\n    PERCY indicates a ticket dispenser attached to the front of\n    the stage.\n\n                        PERCY\n              Take a ticket and join the queue!\n              Only five quid a go!

Fulfilment, grace and\n              light or... Waste, filth and\n              darkness.\n                  (under his breath,\n                   watching the drunk,\n                   MARTIN, with contempt)\n              No prizes for guessing what you'll\n              do.\n\n    MARTIN has begun, with difficulty, to clamber onto the stage.\n\n    His MATES laugh and shout encouragement.\n\n                        ANTON\n                  (not in character.. he\n                   stutters)\n              No. Sorry. That's n-not allowed.\n              You have to t-take a t-ticket\n              first.\n\n    ANTON tries to prevent MARTIN from getting on stage. But\n    MARTIN thumps ANTON and pulls him into the `audience'.\n\n    MARTIN'S drunken MATES laugh and applaud.\n\n    MARTIN is now on stage and heading for DOCTOR PARNASSUS who\n    is still in a trance.\n\n    PERCY tries to head him off but MARTIN shoves PERCY off the\n    stage. PERCY lands on the ground with a crash.\n\n    More laughter from the MOB.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                  5.\n4   CONTINUED: (3)                                               4\n\n\n                        MARTIN\n                  (drunkenly to PARNASSUS)\n              Hey you...I wanna audition. I\n              wan... I wanna be a star... I\n              wanna...\n\n    MARTIN is on the verge of tweaking DOCTOR PARNASSUS' nose or\n    pulling his beard when VALENTINA diverts him.\n\n                        VALENTINA\n              Stop! Get off the stage!\n\n    MARTIN turns his bleary focus to VALENTINA.\n\n                        MARTIN\n              Thas a nice pair of jugs.\n\n    MARTIN'S mates roar their approval.\n\n                        VALENTINA\n              Get off the stage!\n\n                        MARTIN\n              No. I wan you... I wan you...\n\n    MARTIN lunges at `Beauty' who retreats up stage.\n\n    MARTIN blunders into the scenery as he pursues `Beauty' who\n    stays just out of reach. She takes cover behind a cut-out\n    tree.\n\n    ANTON and PERCY climb back onto the stage as MARTIN continues\n    to chase `Beauty'. VALENTINA evades him by ducking through\n    the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down\n    the middle). MARTIN crashes after her.\n\n    ANTON and PERCY exchange worried looks. They look at DOCTOR\n    PARNASSUS. Should they wake him from his trance? They decide\n    not to but it's a difficult decision.\n\n\n5   INT/EXT   MAGICAL FOREST                                      5\n\n    The stage set, which was clearly only a few feet deep, now\n    seems much deeper and to contain many more cut-out trees.\n\n    `Beauty' weaves in and out of the 2 dimensional trees as\n    MARTIN chases her further into the increasingly magical\n    forest. Beauty's costume has been transformed into something\n    wonderful. (A rainbow studded with diamonds?)\n\n    VALENTINA comes into view. MARTIN is in hot pursuit.\n\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                  6.\n5   CONTINUED:                                                   5\n\n\n                           MARTIN\n                 Come here you little sexpot!\n\n    VALENTINA stops, turns, smiles sweetly and slams her fist\n    hard into MARTIN'S gut. He doubles up. VALENTINA pauses for a\n    moment, contemplating doing some serious damage, before\n    striding off.\n\n    MARTIN staggers to his feet.\n\n                           MARTIN (CONT'D)\n                 Come back! You bitch!\n\n    He rushes after her but, trips on a root (a real 3\n    dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground.\n    Recovering, he looks up. Shock. He is surrounded by a dark,\n    terrible, and very REAL forest. `Beauty' has vanished.\n\n\n6   EXT   THE STAGE     NIGHT                                     6\n\n    VALENTINA, `Beauty', slips back on stage through the mirror.\n    Her costume has reverted to its original state. She examines\n    her knuckles on the hand with which she punched Martin.\n\n    ANTON looks at her. She shrugs. DR. PARNASSUS is still in a\n    trance, his lips moving soundlessly. ANTON watches DOCTOR\n    PARNASSUS in awe. `Beauty' sighs. She's had enough.\n\n\n7   INT/EXT   MAGICAL FOREST                                      7\n\n    MARTIN is lost and terrified in the dark forest.\n\n                           MARTIN\n                 Mum...Mum!...\n\n    His voice echoes through the giant trees. But his cries are\n    interrupted by another sound...a Tarzan-like howl.\n\n    MARTIN spins around. Strange creatures are swinging on vines\n    through the giant trees. They are all around him. They look\n    like HANDS... with little heads and arms where the wrists\n    should be. They are all howling and jabbering.\n\n    From behind, a HAND CREATURE swings down and grabs MARTIN by\n    the collar, hoisting him high into the air.\n\n    Clearing the trees, MARTIN sees he is not alone. There are\n    many other people - all in the clutches of HAND CREATURES\n    swinging on \"vines\".\n\n\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                    7.\n7   CONTINUED:                                                     7\n\n    But, the \"vines\" are actually long, slim tentacles...\n    dangling from enormous, luridly coloured JELLYFISH that float\n    through the dark, frightening, sky.\n\n    From some of the tentacles, bottles of booze dangle - just\n    out of reach of the struggling crowd - all desperate for a\n    drink.\n\n                           MARTIN (CONT'D)\n                 Please... I'll never...! Never\n                 again!. Honest!... From now on... I\n                 swear!.. Not a drop!\n\n    With a smile of satisfaction, the HAND CREATURE stops\n    jabbering and let's go of MARTIN'S collar.\n\n\n\n    Down he plummets. The ground rushes up. MATRTIN is as good\n    as dead. But when he hits the ground, rather than going\n    SPLAT!!, he bounces high in the air, turns a couple\n    somersaults and lands on his feet.\n\n    He can't believe what has just happened... and then he hears\n    music. Beautiful, ethereal music.\n\n    In the distance a light is glowing. It's the sun, rising\n    above a majestic mountain pass. Cut into the rock, is a long\n    stairway winding up to the summit.\n\n    The HAND CREATURE swings down, gives MARTIN the \"thumbs up\",\n    and points encouragingly toward the stairway.\n\n    Reformed and determined, MARTIN heads for the      stairs. But on\n    reaching them he discovers that each one is 6      feet high. The\n    stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult.      Letters are\n    carved into the first stair...\"THE 12X12 STEP      PROGRAM...GOOD\n    LUCK\". This is going to be tough.\n\n    The sound of a honky-tonk piano makes him turn. Behind him\n    the sky is dark. A roadside bar/nightclub with flashing neon\n    lights has appeared. He hesitates. He could use a drink\n    before the long climb. He heads for the club.\n\n    The door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground\n    figure of a jolly smiling man (MR NICK) distinguished by a\n    bowler hat and a red waistcoat.\n\n                           MR NICK\n                 Hi there. C'mon in. Looks like you\n                 could use a drink.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                  8.\n7   CONTINUED: (2)                                               7\n\n\n    MARTIN, relieved and reassured by the welcome, steps inside.\n    The door closes followed by the sound from within of much\n    gaiety and laughter.\n\n    THE CAMERA pulls back as the nightclub suddenly EXPLODES IN A\n    BALL OF FLAME.\n\n\n8   EXT   DINGY BACK STREET                                       8\n\n    The sound of police sirens.

The world has gone dark.\n\n     He hears DIEGO crying somewhere in the distance and starts to\n     clamber over the shattered monoliths..\n\n     Reaching the top, ANTON sees DIEGO on the peak of a distant\n     rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms. There are\n     what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on\n     either side of the pinnacle.\n\n     CUT TO DIEGO who is in a state of confusion and terror. Is he\n     lost inside a video game he can't control? He presses the\n     buttons on his gaming device - to no avail.\n\n     One of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under\n     way... all very video-game-like. Thrilling aggressive music\n     blares forth.\n\n     MR NICK appears, still in red waist-coat and bowler hat, but\n     this time in the form of a CUT-OUT shooting target with a\n     bull's-eye on his chest.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                15.\n12   CONTINUED:                                                12\n\n\n                            MR NICK\n                  Come on laddy, cross the bridge!\n                  Join up!

Each time MR.NICK gets shot and is\n     knocked flat, he pops back up continuing his spiel.\n\n     The other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano\n     keys and looks very rickety and unsafe. The piano key bridge\n     descends into a great cavern where hundreds of BOY AND GIRL\n     PIANISTS are practising on hundreds of pianos, all playing\n     the same tune - the tune DR.

But\n                  at what price...\n\n     The boat bumps into a submerged log. DR. PARNASSUS tries to\n     push free. Several cigarette butts float past. Looking up,\n     DR.

It depicts a body hanging from a gibbet\n     surrounded by several arcane objects.\n\n     PARNASSUS studies the card, trying to wring some meaning from\n     it - then lays The Hanged Man in the space between the\n     others. He takes a swig from the bottle.\n\n\n26   EXT   WAGON ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE     NIGHT                 26\n\n     The wagon has stopped in the middle of Blackfriar's bridge.\n     It's pouring with rain.\n\n     VALENTINA, wearing some sort of covering against the rain,\n     climbs out of the hatch and onto the roof of the wagon.\n\n     Here she finds ANTON pointing excitedly down into the Thames.\n\n                            ANTON\n                  Incredible!

A shadow, on the water,\n     of someone `dancing', hung by his neck with a rope attached\n     to the underside of the bridge.\n\n                            ANTON (CONT'D)\n                      (triumphant)\n                  You see!

One end of\n     a rope is tied around his waist, the other is attached to the\n     bridge parapet. A lantern dangles from his waist.\n\n     VALENTINA and PERCY watch ANTON'S perilous descent.\n\n     Moments later there are two bodies hanging from the bridge,\n     the mysterious HANGING MAN'S and ANTON'S.\n\n     The MAN is hanging by a noose around his neck, still jerking\n     in his dance of death.

Dead.\n\n     With extreme difficulty and great discomfort, ANTON pulls the\n     MAN close to him, takes a knife from his pocket and cuts the\n     MAN'S rope.\n\n     ANTON and the MAN are now swinging back and forth together on\n     ANTON'S rope which is threatening to cut ANTON in half.\n\n                               ANTON\n                  Arghhh!!!!\n\n                            VALENTINA\n                  You've done it!

His\n     jacket pockets are full of strange weights and arcane symbols\n     have been scrawled on his forehead. He's about 30 years old\n     and very handsome.\n\n\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                      37.\n28   CONTINUED:                                                      28\n\n\n     The MAN appears to be dead but VALENTINA decides to try the\n     kiss of life.\n\n     ANTON is made uncomfortable seeing VALENTINA administer the\n     kiss of life and he pulls her away.\n\n                            ANTON\n                  No!

PARNASSUS, PERCY, and VALENTINA look at each other.\n\n     Then PARNASSUS sees something beyond the wagon...ANTON,\n     downcast, heading off through the swirling plastic bags and\n     flying rubbish... a battered suitcase in his hand.\n\n                           DR.

A sign proclaims \"Please Take Generously\"\n\n     Directly behind the glass box is a half-globe with the\n     continent of Africa featured. Sitting on top is Percy\n     playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one\n     hand...his other is held out pathetically... a beggar. He's\n     blacked up and dressed in rags. He doesn't look happy. He\n     sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money.\n\n     The wagon, newly painted in sleek and stylish black and\n     white, stands in Bond Street or some similarly fashionable\n     street with expensive shops and art galleries. RICH WOMEN\n     anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth\n     glide past.\n\n     New signs proclaim `The Choice Is Yours' `The Imaginarium -\n     More Exclusive than ever'.\n\n     The stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been\n     chromatically divided in half - one side black, the other\n     white.\n\n     On the dark side a bloated, sun-glassed woman consuming vast\n     quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge.

He is blindfolded.\n\n     On the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a\n     stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples. Under the\n     tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits VALENTINA as\n     Eve...naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty.\n     She gracefully combs her hair.\n\n     Above the mirror is a sign proclaiming \"The Naked Truth\".\n\n     DR. PARNASSUS, peeking under his blindfold, is distinctly\n     uncomfortable by his daughter's lack of attire.\n\n     TONY, in a beautifully cut white suit, and wearing his\n     `romantic' Venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy\n     pose on the edge of the white side of the stage.\n\n     Nobody speaks. They pay no attention to the crowd.\n\n     A few women stop, curious. One of them takes out some money\n     and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go.\n\n                            TONY\n                      (retrieving the money)\n                  Excuse me, madam.

They are press forward putting money\n     in the plinth. Tony tries to stop them but, they insist.\n     VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY, and DR.

The crowd is still... stunned by\n     the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN's transformation as she deposits the\n     cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box and\n     glides benignly through the crowd... which parts in awe.\n\n     Pause... and then the other WOMEN rush the stage. Mayhem is\n     narrowly averted as TONY and PERCY manage to coral them into\n     a more-or-less orderly queue.\n\n     Across the street, standing in the doorway of a shop selling\n     luxury goods, is MR NICK. He watches events, intrigued...\n\n     ...as TONY escorts a second woman through the mirror, and a\n     third, they descend, ecstatic, emptying the contents of their\n     handbags, their pearls, earrings and diamond rings into the\n     glass box.\n\n     TONY pays off the cops who move on.\n\n     TONY, getting more and more flamboyant, forgets to lower his\n     mask each time he re-enters the stage.

The leading RUSSIAN\n     pulls him on.\n\n\n\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                82.\n55   CONTINUED: (2)                                            55\n\n\n                         VLADIMIR (IN RUSSIAN) SUBTITLED\n               C'mon..What are you watching that\n               crap for.\n\n                         SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)\n                   (pointing at TONY)\n               It's him!\n\n                         VLADIMIR (IN RUSSIAN)\n               Who are you talking about?\n                   (following SERGE's pointed\n                    finger)\n               Impossible.\n\n                           SERGE (IN RUSSIAN)\n               I'm sure.\n\n     They start pushing through the crowd.\n\n     TONY, reaching down to help an elderly lady up to the stage,\n     looks up and sees the RUSSIANS heading through the crowd..\n\n     Panic!! He pulls the mask down and begins to back up.\n\n     But it's too late, they've definitely seen him.\n\n     He spins around and rockets upstage, past DR. PARNASSUS who\n     is deep into his trance.\n\n     TONY dives through the mirror much to the amazement of\n     VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY.\n\n     The RUSSIANS chase after him, shoving the queuing WOMEN\n     aside, smashing the scenery and knocking ANTON into the\n     wings.\n\n\n56   INT/EXT   SHAMPOO COMMERCIAL LANDSCAPE                    56\n\n     The RUSSIANS charge through the shampoo-commercial landscape.\n     No TONY..

But as they rush in that direction another wall rises\n     up blocking them. Again it is painted with a hill and TONY\n     frozen in midstride. A third and fourth wall rise up..\n     surrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS.\n\n     There is a cell door in one wall. Like crazy animals they\n     start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it\n     down. It won't budge.\n\n     While the others batter the door, GREGOR, who has been\n     somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, sits\n     quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers.\n\n     Exhausted, the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground.\n\n     GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and\n     exhales. As he does the door swings open. The other RUSSIANS\n     gape at him... then barrel out the door.\n\n     Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted with\n     white fluffy clouds. Extending from the ground to each cloud\n     is an incredibly long ladder. On each ladder is a person\n     climbing upwards.\n\n     The RUSSIANS spot Tony. He is already a hundred feet up a\n     ladder and climbing.\n\n     Unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over-bright, hyper-\n     active, wide-eyed sales girl.\n\n                            SALES-GIRL\n                  Hi!

As they rush past,\n     GREGOR pauses, hands her his flowers.\n\n                            GREGOR\n                  Relax...smell the flowers.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 84.\n56   CONTINUED: (2)                                             56\n\n\n     Reaching the base of TONY'S ladder, the RUSSIANS start\n     climbing.\n\n     Seeing the threat, TONY kicks hard and breaks the rungs below\n     him.. setting off a domino effect with more rungs breaking\n     downward towards the RUSSIANS. Snap! Crack! Rungs break in\n     their grasp.. they fall.\n\n     The RUSSIANS land in a tangled heap as the domino effect\n     continues down to the base of the ladder.\n\n     Laughing down at them, TONY turns to continue climbing - only\n     to see the domino effect heading down from the top of the\n     ladder... towards him.\n\n     THE LADDER COMPLETELY SEPARATES IN TWO.\n\n     Tony struggles to maintain his balance - and somehow manages\n     to get his feet on the two halves of a broken rung. Then, as\n     if he were on giant stilts, starts to stride away.\n\n     The RUSSIANS chase after him but, his giant strides leave\n     them far behind. Smugly, TONY looks back just as one of the\n     legs of his ladder snags on a fallen log. He loses his\n     balance... and plunges hundreds of feet earthward.\n\n     From nowhere, ANTON (still dressed as a fat woman) appears..\n     running to catch the plummeting TONY. He does and Whomp!!..\n     is flattened. Knocked out cold. TONY is unscathed.. his fall\n     broken by ANTON'S padding.\n\n     But, the RUSSIANS arrive, grab TONY, start to beat him up.\n\n                          SERGE\n               You thieving scumbag!

I'm warning you!\n\n     Foolishly, he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial\n     arts pose. The RUSSIANS look at each other. Then, utterly\n     ignoring ANTON, turn their attention back to beating TONY.\n\n     GREGOR walks calmly over to ANTON who is in attack mode.\n\n                         GREGOR\n                   (bending down and picking\n                    a flower, he offers it to\n                    ANTON)\n               Relax. Smell the flowers.\n\n     Confused, ANTON takes the flower, sniffs and then... GREGOR\n     floors him with a powerful punch on the nose\n\n     Meanwhile, the RUSSIANS have a noose around TONY's neck and\n     have looped the rope over a tree branch. TONY struggles to\n     pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck.\n     He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when...\n\n     ... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet\n     rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves -\n     revealing DR. PARNASSUS' carved and painted face beneath.\n\n     The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a\n     welcoming red carpet. From inside the giant mouth a smiling\n     policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in..\n\n     The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope.\n\n     TONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe\n     flies out of his mouth.\n\n     Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads\n     \"JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE\".. and a chorus line of\n     LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear -\n     high-kicking a snappy song and dance number.\n\n     The astonished RUSSIANS don't know what the fuck is going on.\n\n     Suddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting\n     something in Russian.\n\n     Spinning around, the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russian\n     grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to\n     them. A stunned pause. Then, pell-mell, they rush to her.\n\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 86.\n56   CONTINUED: (4)                                             56\n\n\n                           RUSSIANS (IN RUSSIAN)\n                Mama!   Mama! Help! Save us!\n\n     As they run toward her they get smaller and smaller. She\n     lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath. And\n     then.. BOOM!.. a muffled explosion balloons the skirts\n     outward. Smoke spews out from below.\n\n     Straightening her skirt, the BABOUSHKA looks up, and pulls\n     off her head - revealing MR.NICK's tiny head poking out of\n     the collar. He smiles smugly.\n\n     The giant POLICEMAN DR. PARNASSUS registers disappointment\n     and, like a balloon rapidly deflating, spins off into the sky\n     sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything.\n\n     The dust clears and TONY and ANTON find themselves in a\n     desolate, empty landscape. Nowhere. Nothing.\n\n                          TONY\n                Did you see me!! I almost reached\n                the clouds!

PARNASSUS' DRUNKEN IMAGINATION                 63\n\n     Mist and rain descend as TONY and VALENTINA run through the\n     darkened shapes of the shampoo-commercial landscape - now\n     tattered, ragged, and wind blown. Darkness reigns.\n\n                         TONY\n               This isn't right. This is all\n               wrong. Which way?\n\n     Soaked and cold they spy a welcome sight. A uniformed valet\n     with an open umbrella stands by the door of a sleek limo.\n\n                         VALET\n               Your car is here, Mr.Tony.\n\n                         TONY\n               Ah, Lester, just in time.\n\n     TONY ducks under the umbrella and helps VALENTINA into the\n     car ahead of himself.\n\n     As she slides across the seat she notices the driver - bowler\n     hatted and smoking a cigarette.\n\n                         VALENTINA\n               No! Tony, don't get in! Get away!\n\n     She pushes TONY back and scrambles out...dragging him back\n     out into the dark rain.\n\n     The driver turns around.   It's MR.NICK.. looking vexed.\n\n     VALENTINA and TONY struggle through the rain. Suddenly, they\n     find themselves in deep water up to their chests. They are\n     sinking. Through the mist they see a boat. It is the gondola\n     that transported the LOUIS VUITTON LADY.\n\n\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                102.\n63   CONTINUED:                                                 63\n\n\n                           TONY\n                  Help!

The boatman reaches down to help.\n\n                            BOATMAN\n                  Give me your hand\n\n     It's MR. NICK.    VALENTINA recoils, drags TONY off the boat.\n\n                            TONY\n                  Stop! What are you doing!

This is the way.\n\n     She points to jumbled rocks just visible in the darkness.\n     They drag themselves onto them. The rocky monoliths appear\n     to be the same as the landscape ANTON climbed over when he\n     was searching for DIEGO, the son of THE FAMILY FROM HELL.\n\n     And, like a repeat of that experience, from behind the ridge\n     rises the Parnassus-faced Mongolfier balloon. But, now the\n     eyes stream tears and rain pours down. In the basket is\n     ANTON.\n\n                            ANTON\n                  Don't d-do it. Don't g-go on.

Warm\n     candlelight glows in the windows, smoke curls from the\n     chimney. They run to the door. TONY bangs on it. Someone\n     can be heard unlatching the locks inside.\n\n     A child's crying cuts through the wind.\n\n     VALENTINA turns and sees a little girl sitting on the path...\n     among flapping laundry. She rushes to her, tries to pick her\n     up but, the little girl resists..\n\n\n\n\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                   103.\n63   CONTINUED: (2)                                                63\n\n\n                         VALENTINA\n               Tony, help me, she's heavy.\n\n     The door has just opened and TONY is halfway through.    He\n     turns, irritated.\n\n                         TONY\n               What is it now?! Can't we just go\n               inside and get dry.\n\n     Behind him, in the warmth, stands the old BABOUSHKA.\n\n     Seeing that VALENTINA is really struggling with the little\n     girl, TONY reluctantly goes to help. The little girl, on\n     seeing TONY, tries to break away but, he holds on to her.\n\n                         TONY (CONT'D)\n                   (shouting angrily)\n               Ostanobuite bas menshi schit!\n\n     The litle girl goes quiet. VALENTINA looks at TONY with\n     surprise. The BABOUSHKA looks angry. Suddenly a light begins\n     to suffuse TONY and the little girl. A small orchestra can\n     be heard playing garden party music.\n\n                         VALENTINA\n               You did it! You made the right\n               choice!\n\n     The light fills the screen and we find...\n\n     ...TONY, sleekly groomed and immaculately dressed, holding\n     the smiling little girl.

There is a marquee.\n\n     WAITERS and WAITRESSES move amongst the assembled notables\n     bearing trays of drinks and food.\n\n     TONY is the focus of attention. A TV current-affairs/news\n     JOURNALIST with CAMERA CREW is following him around.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                104.\n64   CONTINUED:                                                 64\n\n\n                            TONY\n                  Sustainability's great, if you can\n                  achieve it.

Everybody\n     loves and admires TONY. He smiles boyishly.\n\n     He moves on. The TV CREW stay with him.\n\n                            JOURNALIST\n                  Aren't you running the risk of\n                  entrenching the need for charity by\n                  increasingly institutionalising it?\n\n                             TONY\n                  Look, charity, like poor little\n                  Olga...\n                      (referring to the little\n                       girl)\n                  ...is always with us, to coin a\n                  phrase...\n\n     VALENTINA appears.
