London was the\n               capital of the world -- the height\n               of modernity, with the hiss of\n               steam and smell of coal in the\n               air. It was also the great\n               cesspool into which all the\n               sinners and criminals of the\n               empire drained.\n\n    Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a\n    POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making\n    his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.\n\n<b>                             WATSON (V.O.)\n</b>               I had come to London, ten years\n               prior, to find a life after the\n               Afghan war. I had hoped to start\n               a medical practice and settle into\n               a nice, steady existence. The\n               life I found was anything but nice\n               and steady.\n\n    We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive\n    silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A\n    FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance.\n    The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing\n    stampede.\n\n<b>                             WATSON (V.O.)\n</b>               And that had everything to do with\n               one man. My friend, my partner,\n               my burden...\n\n    The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the\n    impression that he knows something that we don't.\n\n<b>                             WATSON (V.O.)\n</b>               ...

The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he\n    recognizes his famous assailant.\n\n<b>                            MAN\n</b>              Sherlock Holmes?!\n\n    SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the\n    MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken\n    umbrella.\n\n<b>                            HOLMES\n</b>              My apologies. Send the bill to\n              John Watson, 221B Baker Street.\n\n    Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN\n    takes a step into the road to watch him go --\n\n    -- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a\n    number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious\n    pursuit, Victorian-style.\n\n<b>2                                                                    2\n</b><b>    INT.

One man stands out as a leader,\n    older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.\n\n    A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers:\n    DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in\n    the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A\n    thinking man of action.\n\n<b>3   EXT.

CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5\n</b>\n    Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a\n    stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but\n    not as fit as he used to be.\n\n    Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral\n    staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers\n    round the corner.\n\n    A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards\n    Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the\n    door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying\n    the lantern and a gun.\n\n    He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the\n    shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his\n    black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the\n    lantern away again. He peers about, confused.\n\n    We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his\n    jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.\n\n<b>                            HOLMES (V.O.)\n</b>              Head cocked to the left, partial\n              deafness in right ear.

Holmes\n    launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400\n    fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's\n    head is thrown back as he spins round.\n\n<b>                            HOLMES (V.O.)\n</b>              Then throat, paralyze vocal\n              chords, stop screaming.\n\n    BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We\n    RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck\n    with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.\n\n<b>                            HOLMES (V.O.)\n</b>              Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker --\n              knuckles to liver.\n\n    BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating\n    knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted\n    thug and crumples him to his knees.\n<b>                                                   (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                     4.\n</b><b>5   CONTINUED:                                                       5\n</b><b>    SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE\n</b>\n    Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we\n    can barely see what he's doing.\n\n    THWACK! Hammer blow to ear.\n    CRACK! Karate chop to throat.\n    WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.\n\n    BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground,\n    Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it\n    onto his own in one super fast move.\n\n    Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his\n    lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.\n\n\n<b>    POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE\n</b>\n    Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the\n    staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his\n    gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the\n    post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the\n    shadows.\n\n<b>                            THUG\n</b>              What's goin' on, John?\n\n    When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where\n    we saw Holmes hide.\n\n    But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG,\n    reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips\n    him twice with his own gun, dropping him.\n\n    Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and\n    sniffs it appreciatively.\n\n<b>                            HOLMES\n</b>              Hhhmm, good cigar.

Emotions swirling.\n\n       He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's\n       death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone,\n       hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house.\n\n       Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the\n       bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the\n       floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12\n       o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock).\n       The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's\n       fang to his left (at 9 o'clock).\n\n       Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle\n       around each image and a circle directly in the center of\n       the four other circles. He then draws lines which join\n       the circles together in the shape of a cross.\n\n       In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from\n       a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around\n       that circle.\n\n       He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross)\n       then stands in the center of the circle.\n\n       He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade,\n       cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto\n       the ground just outside the circle.\n<b>                                                      (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                      85A.\n</b><b>95   CONTINUED:                                                    95\n</b>     Then he begins to chant.

My\n                initial approach was far too\n                narrow. When Blackwood invited me\n                to Pentonville prison, he\n                suggested I widen my gaze and, at\n                minimum, I have done just that.\n                In fact, I may well have\n                reconciled thousands of years of\n                theological disparity. But that's\n                for another time. Blackwood's\n                method is based on a ritualistic\n                mystical system that has been\n                employed by The Temple of the Four\n                Orders for centuries.

The water pipe breaks off\n       jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head.\n       The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick\n       at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic\n       gamble.

Stonework fairly new.\n\n       Dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder\n       heading upwards. Irene accelerates for it.\n\n\n<b>118F   INT.
