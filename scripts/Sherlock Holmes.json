STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                1\n\n    Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET\n    LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full\n    moon.\n\n                             WATSON (V.O.)\n               The year was 1891. London was the\n               capital of the world -- the height\n               of modernity, with the hiss of\n               steam and smell of coal in the\n               air. It was also the great\n               cesspool into which all the\n               sinners and criminals of the\n               empire drained.\n\n    Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a\n    POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making\n    his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.\n\n                             WATSON (V.O.)\n               I had come to London, ten years\n               prior, to find a life after the\n               Afghan war. I had hoped to start\n               a medical practice and settle into\n               a nice, steady existence. The\n               life I found was anything but nice\n               and steady.\n\n    We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive\n    silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A\n    FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance.\n    The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing\n    stampede.\n\n                             WATSON (V.O.)\n               And that had everything to do with\n               one man. My friend, my partner,\n               my burden...\n\n    The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the\n    impression that he knows something that we don't.\n\n                             WATSON (V.O.)\n               ... Sherlock Holmes.\n\n    WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by\n    A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him,\n    his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     2.\n1   CONTINUED:                                                       1\n    The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead\n    just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies\n    it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he\n    recognizes his famous assailant.\n\n                            MAN\n              Sherlock Holmes?!\n\n    SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the\n    MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken\n    umbrella.\n\n                            HOLMES\n              My apologies. Send the bill to\n              John Watson, 221B Baker Street.\n\n    Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN\n    takes a step into the road to watch him go --\n\n    -- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a\n    number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious\n    pursuit, Victorian-style.\n\n2                                                                    2\n    INT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHT\n    inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a\n    19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader,\n    older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.\n\n    A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers:\n    DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in\n    the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A\n    thinking man of action.\n\n3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                   3\n\n    Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the\n    Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the\n    river.\n\n    As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the\n    carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot\n    follow.\n\n                                                           CUT TO:\n\n\n    ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n    Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and\n    runs across a courtyard to a side door.\n\n    WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.\n\n                                                    3.\n\n\n4   OMITTED                                                      4\n\n\n5   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5\n\n    Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a\n    stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but\n    not as fit as he used to be.\n\n    Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral\n    staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers\n    round the corner.\n\n    A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards\n    Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the\n    door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying\n    the lantern and a gun.\n\n    He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the\n    shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his\n    black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the\n    lantern away again. He peers about, confused.\n\n    We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his\n    jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.\n\n                            HOLMES (V.O.)\n              Head cocked to the left, partial\n              deafness in right ear. First\n              point of attack.\n\n\n    PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED\n\n    FOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the\n    top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes\n    launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400\n    fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's\n    head is thrown back as he spins round.\n\n                            HOLMES (V.O.)\n              Then throat, paralyze vocal\n              chords, stop screaming.\n\n    BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We\n    RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck\n    with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.\n\n                            HOLMES (V.O.)\n              Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker --\n              knuckles to liver.\n\n    BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating\n    knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted\n    thug and crumples him to his knees.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     4.\n5   CONTINUED:                                                       5\n    SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE\n\n    Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we\n    can barely see what he's doing.\n\n    THWACK! Hammer blow to ear.\n    CRACK! Karate chop to throat.\n    WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.\n\n    BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground,\n    Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it\n    onto his own in one super fast move.\n\n    Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his\n    lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.\n\n\n    POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE\n\n    Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the\n    staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his\n    gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the\n    post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the\n    shadows.\n\n                            THUG\n              What's goin' on, John?\n\n    When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where\n    we saw Holmes hide.\n\n    But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG,\n    reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips\n    him twice with his own gun, dropping him.\n\n    Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and\n    sniffs it appreciatively.\n\n                            HOLMES\n              Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you\n              work for?\n\n    He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the\n    man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the\n    crypts.\n\n6                                                                    6\n    OMITTED\n\n7   INT.

A sword has\n     been placed at her feet.\n\n     A HOODED FIGURE KNEELS INSIDE A DOUBLE CIRCLE next to the\n     pentacle. This is LORD BLACKWOOD.

This is spooky, real, powerful stuff.\n\n     Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's\n     level.\n\n     Blackwood simply ignores them.

Suddenly,\n       Holmes hears no words.

He tastes his own\n       blood from a split lip. It interests him.\n       He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle.

He is utterly in the\n       moment.\n\n       Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to\n       his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning\n       to move his head so that a punch grazes him.\n\n\n       BACK TO SCENE\n\n       McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes\n       ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes\n       even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect\n       himself.\n\n       Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches\n       McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an\n       obvious opening. But that's all.

Plymouth gin.\n\n       He turns.   Steps back into the ring.\n\n       The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from\n       Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning\n       McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee:\n\n       A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo\n       braces for combat --\n\n       Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves,\n       incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding\n       combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big\n       man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong.\n\n       McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning\n       away before the giant hits the canvas.\n\n       He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they\n       like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care.\n\n       Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes\n       strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed\n       inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge\n       swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.\n\n18A                                                                   18A\n       INT.

THE BLACKWOOD BURIAL PLOT - DAY                           42\n\n     Generations of wealth buried in moss-covered marble\n     memorials. Not a place for a picnic, not even on a\n     bright sunny day -- and it's starting to rain.\n\n     A COP stops the carriage, opens the door. Holmes and\n     Watson exit, Watson carries a black leather FORENSICS\n     KIT.\n\n     They walk up the pathway towards the Blackwood Family\n     Crypt. Watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground\n     while Holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump\n     of trees in the distance.\n\n                             WATSON\n               Look at this mess.

The cops are\n     in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked.\n     They'd rather be anywhere but here.\n\n     As Holmes and Watson approach, they see the marble doors\n     of the crypt have been BLASTED OPEN FROM THE INSIDE.\n     Holmes and Watson share a quick glance -- this is\n     interesting.\n\n     Lestrade emerges from the crypt.   He is sweating, shaken.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                      39.\n42   CONTINUED: (2)                                                42\n     Holmes offers Lestrade his handkerchief, Lestrade waves\n     it off.\n\n                             LESTRADE\n               Look at those slabs of marble --\n               they're half a ton each if they're\n               a pound -- smashed outward like\n               they were nothing.\n\n     On second thought, Lestrade does take Holmes'\n     handkerchief.\n\n                             LESTRADE\n               Explain it if you can, Holmes.\n\n     Holmes inspects the door, checking the hinges.

Holmes disappears in the opposite\n     direction.\n\n     As soon as their backs are turned, Lestrade marches over\n     to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in\n     each hand, drags his boys in close.

Watson takes a\n     boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth\n     and gently sits him down.\n\n     Holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree.\n\n                                WATSON\n               He's in shock.

They all turn to see the coffin has\n     been extracted from the crypt.\n\n     Four beefy, soil-stained cops emerge lugging the coffin.\n     They place it on the ground, step back, crossing\n     themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified.

The cops pass a CROWBAR around as if\n     it were red-hot. Watson's had enough. He marches\n     forward --\n\n     -- snatches the crowbar away, jams it under the lid and\n     levers it off with a slow, eerie groan.\n\n     Holmes and Lestrade move forward, the cops move backward.\n\n     The coffin is filled with EARTH, overflowing. They brush\n     away a layer of dirt, to reveal... A DEAD BODY in the\n     coffin.

IRENE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY                               75\n\n     Irene enters wearing a stunning evening dress. She\n     pauses glancing briefly around the room before sitting at\n     a mirrored dressing table. There's a decanter on the\n     table next to her from which she pours herself a glass of\n     wine.\n\n     Then she begins removing an impressive assortment of\n     WEAPONS hidden on her person: she pulls a stiletto from\n     her garter, a Derringer from her waistband (which she\n     puts down next to the wine glass). She pulls long thin\n     needles from her hair, lets her hair down. As she\n     continues...\n\n     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Holmes watching her from a shadowy\n     corner. He looks on silently until:\n\n                             IRENE\n               If you're going to watch me take\n               my clothes off, Sherlock, the\n               least you can do is help me with\n               the buttons.\n\n     OR ALT:\n\n                             IRENE\n               To watch a lady undress without\n               her permission is a criminal\n               offense, Sherlock, and could get\n               you into a lot of trouble...\n\n     They both eye the Derringer on the table.\n\n                             IRENE\n               So why don't you come over here\n               and help me instead.\n\n     Holmes approaches her somewhat tentatively and reaches\n     for the top button on the back of her dress.\n\n                                IRENE\n               That's better.\n\n                             HOLMES\n               You can stop looking for Reardon.\n\n                             IRENE\n               I knew I could count on you.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       61.\n75   CONTINUED:                                                     75\n                             HOLMES\n               He was buried in Blackwood's tomb.\n\n     Irene is momentarily taken aback then recovers.\n\n                             IRENE\n               Wonderful.

Perigrine heads for the kitchen,\n     licking his lips.\n\n\n77   INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM                                      77\n\n     Sir Thomas sinks into his bath.   Relaxing.\n\n     The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN, drip, drip, drip.\n\n     The silence is broken all of a sudden when the tap is\n     magically turned on. Sir Thomas opens his eyes in panic,\n     as he hears an eerie WHISPER O.S., like the rushing of\n     wind.\n\n     Sir Thomas is overcome with panic, tries to sit up.\n     Can't. Not all the way.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                      64.\n77    CONTINUED:                                                   77\n                              BLACKWOOD (O.S.)\n                Hello, Father...\n\n      Thomas blinks and sees that BLACKWOOD now sits in the\n      corner of the bathroom, lit in a sinister fashion.\n\n      Sir Thomas' eyes widen, the muscles stand out in his neck\n      as he fights paralysis. He slides back down, slowly.\n\n                              BLACKWOOD\n                You can't fight it. It comes from\n                a power greater than yours. You\n                can only surrender.\n\n      The water flows over Sir Thomas, as Blackwood steps\n      closer and takes the sacred RING from his rigid finger.\n\n                              BLACKWOOD\n                I've been imagining this moment\n                for a long time...\n\n      The water closes over his face. Sir Thomas stares up at\n      Blackwood, who watches him drown, slowly and surely.\n\n                              BLACKWOOD\n                ... I must admit, it's better than\n                I thought it would be.\n\n78                                                                  78\n      INT. THE GRAND HOTEL - CORRIDOR - DAY\n      Carrying an armful of laundry, a MAID slips a pass-key\n      into a lock and opens the door...\n\n      ... to be confronted by the snoring form of Holmes, still\n      handcuffed to the bed. Clothes in total disarray. Her\n      shriek wakes him. He looks down at himself and reacts\n      with shock, then grim recognition sets in.\n\n                              HOLMES\n                Don't take this the wrong way, but\n                might I borrow your hand?\n\n\n78A   INT. POLICE CARRIAGE                                         78A\n\n      Holmes sits beside a COP, and opposite CONSTABLE CLARK.\n\n                              HOLMES\n                Chambermaids were once such a\n                liberal breed.

The inspector's been over to\n                Baker Street himself this morning.\n\n      The coach stops.\n\n78B                                                                78B\n      EXT. SIR THOMAS' HOUSE - DAY\n      Holmes steps out of the coach, and is escorted inside by\n      Constable Clark.\n\n\n78C   INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM                                    78C\n\n      Holmes is briefed by Constable Clark as they enter. As\n      Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away --\n\n                              CONSTABLE CLARK\n                We've checked everything. No sign\n                of a break-in. The Butler didn't\n                hear anything. The body was in\n                the tub, eyes wide open --\n      -- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air.\n\n                              CONSTABLE CLARK\n                     (realizing Holmes\n                      isn't there)\n                -- only his ring was missing.\n\n      He turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right\n      back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode.\n      Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best\n      -- this is, in fact, why he exists.\n\n      Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues\n      into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the\n      tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket).\n\n      The tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene\n      violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing.\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        65A.\n78C   CONTINUED:                                                78C\n                              HOLMES\n                Why did you drain the water?\n\n                              POLICE OFFICER\n                Out of common decency.\n\n                              HOLMES\n                     (incensed)\n                Crime is common, logic is rare.\n                The decent thing to do is catch\n                the killer, not provide comfort to\n                the corpse.\n\n      Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes\n      swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to\n      the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up,\n      opens it, sniffs it.\n\n                                HOLMES\n                Hmm...\n\n      Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose.\n\n                                HOLMES\n                What is that?\n\n                              POLICE OFFICER\n                     (smelling)\n                Uhhhh... jasmine?\n\n                              HOLMES\n                Superb. I suspect this comes from\n                a larger cannister. It'll either\n                be in the pantry, high up where\n                it's warm and dry, or in a linen\n                closet with a vent. And,\n                Constable, you could check the\n                ground under the rear windows for\n                any footprints not your own.\n\n      Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss.\n\n                              HOLMES\n                Data, data, data! I cannot make\n                bricks without clay!\n\n      The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to\n      work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's-\n      eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill.\n      Sometimes he hums or sings to himself.\n\n      Holmes is happy.\n\n      He glances around the room, sees the chair where\n      Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself.\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     65B.\n78C   CONTINUED: (2)                                              78C\n      His eyes keep moving, noticing something on a wall. He\n      steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of dust.\n      The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open.\n\n      Holmes steps to the sink, grabs a handful of TALCUM\n      POWDER and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing:\n\n\n\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       66.\n78C   CONTINUED: (3)                                              78C\n      FINGERPRINTS on one of the panels.\n\n      He pushes the panel, and the wall shifts, opening to\n      reveal a SECRET ROOM. Holmes enters --\n\n\n78D   OMITTED                                                       78D\n\n\n78E   INT. SIR THOMAS' SECRET ROOM                                  78E\n\n      Holmes finds a desk with a prayer table, and ancient\n      texts, spellbooks, one book open to a picture of\n      Alexander the Great at the Sphinx. He steps toward --\n\n      An ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx. On the altar,\n      four strange objects: a strand of human HAIR, a cow's\n      BONE, a large sharp FANG, and a FEATHER.\n\n      Holmes pockets the altar items and a couple pieces of\n      paper, just as --\n\n78F                                                                 78F\n      INT. SIR THOMAS' BATHROOM\n      -- Const. Clark and the Officer return, the Officer\n      proudly hugging a 5 LB. CANNISTER OF JASMINE BATH SALTS.\n\n      They are startled by the secret room --\n\n      -- they are even more startled by the sight of Holmes\n      kneeling at the altar and singing to himself.\n\n      As soon as they arrive, Holmes springs to his feet and\n      walks out. Maybe he continues singing between words.\n                                 HOLMES\n                      (vis   the secret room)\n                I have no    idea what to make of\n                that.\n                      (vis   the bath salts)\n                Excellent    work.\n\n\n79    OMITTED                                                        79\n\n\n80    INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS - DAY                  80\n\n      Holmes walks up the stairs and finds Watson's office door            \n      open.

He's soaked, and furious.\n\n                              TANNER\n                Not a great one for the water, are\n                you, doctor? Army type, aren't\n                you? You wouldn't have lasted\n                long in the Navy.\n\n      Watson glares. Holmes scans the banks with a telescope.\n      He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. The\n      engine shudders off, the boat drifts. Tanner whispers:\n\n                              TANNER\n                That's as far as we can go.\n\n      Holmes starts clambering over the side.    Watson's pissed.\n\n                              WATSON\n                There must be fifty yards of mud\n                out there.\n\n      Holmes' head is just visible before he drops over the\n      prow. He whispers at Tanner.\n\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     74.\n84   CONTINUED:                                                   84\n                             HOLMES\n               Pull in at Vauxhall. Send for the\n               police when you get there.\n\n     Tanner nods. A soft \"splosh\" as Holmes disappears.\n     Watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind,\n     watch, etc. He lays down his wallet and looks at Tanner.\n\n                             WATSON\n               I know precisely how much money is\n               in there.\n\n                             TANNER\n                    (taking the piss)\n               I am sure you do, doctor.\n\n     Watson glares, goes over the side, with his walking\n     stick.\n\n85                                                                85\n     OMITTED\n\n86   EXT.

Watson does.\n\n     They look up and see a jetty that heads out into the\n     river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more\n     THUGS are loading the boat with something.\n\n     Holmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance,\n     where two more THUGS patrol. Watson pulls out Holmes'\n     GUN.\n                             HOLMES\n               What are you doing with my gun?\n\n                             WATSON\n               Oh, please.\n\n                             HOLMES\n               It was an honest mistake --\n\n                             WATSON\n               There was nothing honest about it.\n\n     Holmes looks back at Watson, takes the gun, says nothing,\n     the closest he'll come to a confession.

He simply walks up to the door\n     and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun --\n     before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip.\n\n     Holmes follows, notices that both men have hip flasks.\n     He picks one up, takes a whiff, and pockets it as he\n     follows Watson. He slows, sensing something behind him.\n     He turns, looks at shadows. Nothing. And he enters --\n\n87                                                                 87\n     OMITTED\n\n88   INT.

Metal groans softly, like a\n     plaintive wail. The twisted blades of slaughterhouse\n     instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay\n     dead. A truly creepy scene. Holmes and Watson move\n     through it.\n\n     As they go, Holmes notices rows of empty tables.

This is the\n     killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I-\n     beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the\n     wind.\n\n     On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:     118.\n\n                               WATSON\n               One-eighteen.

Amen.'\n\n     Holmes and Watson follow the voice to see: BLACKWOOD in\n     the rafters. Shadows hang heavy around him. Holmes and\n     Watson react: this is the first time they've seen him in\n     the flesh.\n                              BLACKWOOD\n                I cautioned you to accept that\n                this is beyond your control.

My\n                initial approach was far too\n                narrow. When Blackwood invited me\n                to Pentonville prison, he\n                suggested I widen my gaze and, at\n                minimum, I have done just that.\n                In fact, I may well have\n                reconciled thousands of years of\n                theological disparity. But that's\n                for another time. Blackwood's\n                method is based on a ritualistic\n                mystical system that has been\n                employed by The Temple of the Four\n                Orders for centuries.

Irene and Watson\n      flank him, standing in shadows. They look down a long\n      tunnel to:\n\n      The area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the\n      flashback ceremony with the sword. But now:\n\n      Blackwood's THUGS patrol the area. In the center, the\n      pentagram remains. But there is something sitting in it,\n      a futuristic device:\n\n                              HOLMES\n                Behold, Blackwood's magic.\n\n      A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with\n      electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered\n      ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE.\n      Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet:\n\n                              HOLMES\n                A chemical weapon. The first of\n                its kind.

Gun in each hand, Watson\n      herds the three thugs away from the device.\n\n                              WATSON\n                Over there.\n\n      Sullen, but without much resistance, they move away (two\n      dragging the pistol-whipped one, who is out). Watson\n      turns so that he can watch the action at the device --\n\n      -- which puts his back to another tunnel.\n\n      Holmes joins Irene at the device. She grips her knife,\n      looking for a way to detach the CYLINDER from the CRADLE\n      (where electric coils and circuits pulse).\n\n                              IRENE\n                I've never seen anything like it.\n\n                              HOLMES\n                There's never been anything like\n                it.

Electrocuted, she drops\n      the knife, which falls into the cradle, surrounded by\n      humming, sparking coils.\n\n      Irene recoils, sees something past Holmes --\n      RACK PAST HOLMES TO WATSON --\n\n      Where DREDGER LOOMS OUT OF THE DARK BEHIND HIM, both\n      hands held high to grab the guns and smash Watson.\n\n      Before Irene can alert him, Watson's wrists are crushed\n      from behind. Dredger jerks Watson's arms sideways,\n      sending both guns spinning away --\n\n      -- Holmes's gun splashes into the sewer.\n\n      Dredger spins Watson around, head-butts him with a teeth-\n      rattling blow, flings Watson away like a discarded paper\n      cup.\n\n      Now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge Holmes and\n      Irene.\n\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     100.\n112   CONTINUED: (2)                                              112\n      Irene shoots one point blank with her Derringer, Holmes\n      crushes the other's larynx.\n\n                              HOLMES\n                     (to Irene)\n                Keep at it.\n\n      Holmes goes for Dredger.\n\n\n113   INT.

Dredger charges towards the device and\n      Irene. Holmes flies into him feet-first, deflecting him\n      for a moment.\n\n      It is now clear that Dredger's sole purpose is to protect\n      the device.\n\n      Irene sits at the device, trying to figure out how to\n      defuse it.\n\n      BONG!\n\n      The second chime resounds. Dredger grabs Holmes, thrusts\n      him upwards against the sewer roof, simultaneously\n      strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard\n      enough to dislodge some.\n\n      Holmes lashes out with his feet at Dredger -- who doesn't\n      even bother to block anything.

Holmes heads back to Irene.\n\n      Watson draws the sword from his sword stick.   Deadly\n      enough, but not very big.\n\n                               WATSON\n                 You owe me for the ring.\n\n      Dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword -- but only\n      until he can reach up and pull Blackwood's ceremonial\n      sword down off a brick ledge. This is going to be more\n      uneven than usual.\n\n      BONG!\n\n      As Watson parries Dredger's massive slashes and thrusts\n      all around them, only just keeping Dredger at bay --\n\n      -- Holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the\n      cradle by two RODS.
