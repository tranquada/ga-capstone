BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... \"NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA\"\n</b>\n... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can.\nThe boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle.\nThe lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is\nfighting.\n\nIn the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black.\nThe white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old.\nHis face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black\nhair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a\nplodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and\nbangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy.\nBut the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins\nat his opponent and keeps grinding ahead.\n\nThe people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for\nblood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters.\nIn the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is\nhustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony.\nA housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.\n\nThe BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner...\nSomebody heaves a beer can into the ring.\n\nThe Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers\nacross the ring at Rocky.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBLACK FIGHTER\n</b>\t\t\t(to cornerman)\n\t\t... I'm gonna bust his head\n\t\twide open!\n\nIn Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled,\nbalding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He\nworks on Rocky without any enthusiasm.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCORNERMAN\n</b>\t\t\t(lackluster)\n\t\t... Ya waltzin' -- Give the\n\t\tsuckers some action.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\tHey --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCORNERMAN\n</b>\t\t\t(overriding)\n\t\tYa movin' like a bum -- Want\n\t\tsome advice --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\t... Just gimme the water.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.\n</b>\n\nA FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with\nyellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFAN\n</b>\t\tShould I bet the fight don't\n\t\tgo the distance -- Ya feel\n\t\tstrong?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\tAbsolutely.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCORNERMAN\n</b>\t\t... Ya want some good advice?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\t... I just want the mouthpiece.\n\nThe BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross.  The\nfighters engage in battle.  The other fighter grabs Rocky in\na clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding\ncut on the corner of Rocky's eye.\n\nRocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into\nthe man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the\nfighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into\nthe ring.  Rocky ignores it.\n\nThe fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does\nnot bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under\nthe ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new\nfighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe.\nEmbroidered clumsily on the back is, \"The Italian Stallion.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANNOUNCER\n</b>\t\tWinner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a\n\t\tsix rounder between local\n\t\tlightweights.\n\nWithout pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a\ncigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher\npasses behind him.  He watches for a moment and continues up\nthe aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the\nBELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky\nfades into the darkness of the rear of the club.\n\n<b>THE TITLE CREDITS END:\n</b>\n<b>INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nRocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his\nlocker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other\nfighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.\n</b>\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFIGHTER #1\n</b>\t\t...

That's right, I got the\n\t\tcity to myself...\n\nAnother paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and\nspit nervously on the floor.\n\nA young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO\nthat is BLASTING MUSIC.\n\nThe fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer\nand joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters\nare smoking.  The room is cloudy.\n\nA short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater\nbuttoned over a t-shirt.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPROMOTER\n</b>\t\t...Balboa!?\n\nRocky raises his head.  The promoter steps over.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPROMOTER\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t... Twenty bucks for the\n\t\tlocker an' cornerman -- Two\n\t\tbucks for the towel an'\n\t\tshower, seven for tax -- The\n\t\thouse owes ya, sixty-one\n\t\tdollars.\n\nThe man peels off the money and departs... Rocky closes his\nlocker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.\n\n<b>INT. TROLLEY - NIGHT\n</b>\nRocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly... The\ntrolley is empty except for a thin old black WOMAN... The\nblack Woman studies Rocky's bruised face... Rocky becomes\nself-conscious.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\t\t(almost apologetic)\n\t\tI'm a fighter.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.\n</b>\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n</b>\t\t\t(tired)\n\t\t... Yo' iz an accident.\n\n<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\nRocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... He waves\nat a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back.\n\nRocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty\nbookstore.  Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway.\n\nFurther down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the\n\"ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP\"... He peers into the dark store and\nsees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window.  He mumbles to\nthe dog and continues to the corner.\n\n<b>EXT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nA short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located\nin the most deprived section of South Philly.  He kicks away\nthe litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and\nenters.\n\n<b>INT. ROCKY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe narrow hallway is painted olive brown.  A single light\nbulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.\n\n<b>INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nRocky enters.  The one-room apartment is drab, with a\ncurling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall...\nNailed against the far wall is a mattress.  The mattress is\nused as a punching bag.  Stuffing spills out of the center.\n\nRocky drops his coat on the floor.  He puts on a pair of\nglasses.  He crosses to a small turtle bowl... He lifts the\ncreatures.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\t...Look who's home.\n\nRocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then\nplaces an old 45 RPM record on a battered phonograph.  The\nrecord is a tune, \"ALL IN THE GAME.\"\n\n... As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his\nhairbrush.  Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the\nrecord.  He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning\nto thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a\nbullish fighting stance and throws several punches.\n\nThe water boils.  Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5.\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT. SUNRISE OF PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAWN\n</b>\nWe SEE the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering\nfigure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it\nsits majestically above City Hall...\n\n<b>EXT. DOCKS - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\nRocky is walking along the waterfront... He has a bandaid\nover one eye.  He looks at the rugged stevedores going about\ntheir business... He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool\njacket and approaches a ship being unloaded.\n\nRocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked\ncar.  These men look like blood drinkers.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAFIA #1\n</b>\t\tYo, Rock -- How's your Boss?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\tReal good.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAFIA #2\n</b>\t\tFightin' again?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\tYeah, here an' there.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAFIA #1\n</b>\t\tMebbe we make sum money\n\t\ttogather soon... Give ya boss\n\t\tmy best.\n\nRocky shrugs and moves away... He nears a heavy man working\nthe crane.  The heavy man looks frightened... He stops the\ncrane and hurries into the ship's hole.  Rocky dashes up the\ngangplank.\n\n<b>INT. SHIP - DAY\n</b>\nThe man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked\ncrates and coffee beans.\n\nRocky sprints after him... He lunges and flings the man by\nthe neck against the wall of stacked cargo.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFATS\n</b>\t\t\t(terror-filled)\n\t\tDon't hit the face!

Rocky remains cool.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\tGoin' fishin'?\n\nThe man drops the hook.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\tWhat's ya name again?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFATS\n</b>\t\tBob.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\tLook, Bob, if ya wanna dance,\n\t\tya gotta pay the band -- If ya\n\t\tborrow, ya gotta pay the man...\n\t\tMe, I ain't emotionally\n\t\tinvolved.\n\nRocky's determined expression strikes home.

STREET - DAY\n</b>\nLater that morning Rocky passes \"Animal Town Pet Shop\" in\nSouth Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In\nthe window hangs a sign reading \"Today's special -- Mixed\nKittens -- $1.50\"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning.\nHe stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the\nwindow and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and\npresses his face against the window and does his impression\nof the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks\naway.\n\nThe girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not\nvery attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old.\nBrown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses.\n\nRocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so\npainfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters.\n\n<b>INT.

It is pitch dark and\nhis steaming breath attests to the cold.\n\nHe begins running down the center of the deserted street.\nHe can only be clearly SEEN as his form passes beneath the\nstreet lamps.\n\nTwo garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass.\n\n<b>EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAWN\n</b>\nRocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight\nof stairs.  He stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear\ninto the morning gray.  Taking a deep breath, he starts up.\nFrom the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his\nlegs give way.  Standing, he brushes off and descends the\nstairs.\n\n<b>EXT. CITY HALL - DAWN\n</b>\nRocky passes City Hall and veers to the river.  He pauses,\nheaving great gusts of exhausted breaths.  He throws several\nlazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his\naching sides.  Men delivering the morning papers observe\nwith amusement.\n\nRocky forces himself to begin running again.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t70.\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.

Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George\nWashington.  He throws silver dollars.  The NOISE builds to\nDEAFENING proportions.  Creed's trainer holds the rope and\nCreed bounds into the ring.  He tears off the Washington\noutfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in\nan outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red,\nwhite and blue sequined top hat.  The robe is sequined red,\nwhite and blue.  His boxing trunks are red, white and blue\nsilk with stars around the waistband.

She is lured by the\nGROWING ROAR OF THE FANS... She exits the dressing room.\n\n<b>INT. ARENA HALL - NIGHT\n</b>\nStepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor.\nThe MOUNTING CHEERS make her speed up.

ARENA - NIGHT\n</b>\nAdrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the\nbattle.  She is entranced by the power of it all.\n\nBack in the ring, Rocky keeps grinding ahead.  He plants a\nthumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces...\nRocky is game but losing.\n\nAt ringside Paulie is frantic... He is living the fight from\nhis seat.\n\nMr. Gazzo and his Bodyguard watch from the second row.\nGazzo looks proud.  The Bodyguard, impassive.\n\n<b>INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\nA huge and lively crowd look up at the television over the\nbar... They see Rocky driving Creed against the ropes and\ncheer loudly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tANDY\n</b>\t\t... The Rock's got real stones.\n\n<b>INT. ARENA - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe men are fighting with appalling tenacity.  Rocky rips\nand tears into the body... Apollo counters with a ceaseless\nstream of rapier-like lefts... The Challenger is seriously\noutclassed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAPOLLO\n</b>\t\tC'mon -- Lemme cut yo'!\n\nRocky wades in and Creed employs incredible footwork.  He\nsets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross\nto Rocky's already broken nose.  Blood sprays from the wound\nand red droplets drip from his chin...\n\nRocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a\ntorrent of combinations.  Rocky's eyes are closed.  But\nCreed cannot drop him... The BELL RINGS.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nThe Commentators shift in their seats.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR #1\n</b>\t\tWithout a doubt this is the\n\t\tmost punishing brawl I have\n\t\tever seen -- The ringside\n\t\taudience is spotted with blood.\n<b>\t\t\t\t(MORE)\n</b><b> \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t113.\n</b>\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tThis fight should have been\n\t\tstopped rounds ago but Rocky\n\t\tBalboa refuses to fall --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR #2\n</b>\t\tNot only has he refused to\n\t\tfall, but he has beaten the\n\t\tChampion's body without mercy\n\t\tand the bout has become a\n\t\tvicious slugfest.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nApollo's corner is in turmoil... The Champion is definitely\nhurt.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAPOLLO\n</b>\t\tMy side.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTRAINER\n</b>\t\t\t(to Assistant)\n\t\tGet that doctor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAPOLLO\n</b>\t\tNo doctor!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTRAINER\n</b>\t\tYou're hurtin', man!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAPOLLO\n</b>\t\tNo doctor!...

He secretly places a small ring knife\nbetween his index and middle finger.  In one smooth movement\nhe drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers\nthe draining wounds with gauze... It is done so quickly no\none is ever aware of the operation.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nAt the rear of the arena Adrian looks transfixed at the ring.\nShe is caught up in the heat of the battle.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nThe BELL RINGS for round fourteen.  Rocky bores in close,\nbut Apollo still has spring in his legs.  He seems determined\nto end it this round... Apollo catches Rocky flush on the\njaw.  Rocky is staggered.  Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose\nwith pure savagery.  Rocky is driven against the ropes and\nreceives a devastating beating from the Champion... Rocky is\ndropped.\n\nRocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring... Everything\nis a distortion.  He looks for familiar faces as though to\nask for help... Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him\nto stay down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tREFEREE\n</b>\t\tSix -- Seven -- Eight --\n\nRocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy.  He\nis like a wounded wild animal.  The tide suddenly turns.\nRocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific\nbody punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his\nthroat... A CRACK is HEARD.  A glaze of pain covers Apollo's\neyes.  It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion\nupright... Apollo is badly hurt.  He is bent over.\n\nRocky moves towards Apollo.  Apollo flicks dread jabs into\nRocky's eyes... The Italian wades in with punches that seem\nto bulge out Apollo's back.  Creed takes the punishment like\na stoic.\n\nBlood is running from Apollo's mouth.  In the clinch he\nleans over Rocky and it drips down the Italian's neck and\nshoulders.  Apollo shields his wound from the ringside\njudges and continues to fight.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t115.\n</b>\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nThe BELL RINGS.  Apollo's men rush out and guide him to his\ncorner.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAPOLLO\n</b>\t\t... Ribs broke --\n\nBlood trickles from the corner of Apollo's mouth.

I've\n\t\tnever seen anything like it in\n\t\tthe last round of a\n\t\tchampionship fight... Apollo\n\t\tspits blood on the canvas.  It\n\t\tappears he is protecting his\n\t\tright side.  His ribs were\n\t\tprobably injured at the end of\n\t\tround fourteen.\n<b>\t\t\t\t(MORE)\n</b><b> \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t117.\n</b>\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tIt's confirmed, unofficially,\n\t\tCreed's ribs may be broken --\n\t\tApollo fakes a left and throws\n\t\ta big tired right -- Balboa's\n\t\tmouthpiece is out!  Creed\n\t\tattacks with one hand!\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nApollo feints and Rocky falls for it.  The Champion unleashes\na lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's\nmouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the\nropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to\ntheir feet.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nRocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to\ncome ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a\nweary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O.\nwritten on every punch.  Rocky counters the assault blow for\nblow.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\tGimme ya best!!!!\n\nMickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGimme ya best!!!\n\nBlood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside\nphotographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood.\n\nThe fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit\nof strength from their souls and beat each other without\nmercy.  They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension\nfar beyond blood and pain.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSIX\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tFIVE\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tFOUR\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTHREE\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTWO\n</b><b>\t\t\t\tONE!\n</b>\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nThe BELL RINGS...

In the\nmidst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other\nwith unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched\ngladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives.\n\nAs though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step\ntowards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's\near.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tAPOLLO\n</b>\t\t... Ain't gonna be no rematch.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\t...

The CROWD ROARS.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMICKEY\n</b>\t\tI don't care what they say,\n\t\tyou're a winner.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tROCKY\n</b>\t\tYo, can I have my locker back?\n\nMickey and Rocky look at each other and grin.  Mickey hugs\nRocky like a son.  Mickey raises Rocky's hand again.  Rocky\nturns away from Mickey and pats Benny the cut-man's\nshoulder... Benny smiles wearily.  Rocky stares across the\nring at Apollo Creed, who stands victorious, but his face\nand body are badly distorted... The two men lock stares that\nreflect admiration.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nApollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward\nscreaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nRocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well-\nwishing fans rumble forward...

Mickey tries his best to\ncontrol things but his voice is drowned out in the growing\nclamor.  The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to\ntheir shoulders.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nRocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against\neach other... chanting, 'Creed, Creed, Creed.'\n\nRocky's fans counter by bellowing, 'Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.'\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nPaulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he\nstarts swinging.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nBoth Rocky and Apollo are completely at the mercy of the\ncrowd.  They are being passed overhead and remain helpless\nas their bodies float up the aisle on the sea of hands...\nThe CHANTING IS DEAFENING.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nFearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move\nforward.  Running headlong into the crowd, she angles\nthrough the mass to get to Rocky.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nShe is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions,\nbut she keeps her feet... She sees him.  In the distance,\nRocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall\nand waits for the procession to pass.\n\nThe procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's\nunbelievably battered but smiling face.  He appears to be\nking of the world.\n\nThe procession approaches and passes Adrian.  She jumps on\nher toes and waves frantically but is not seen.  She screams\nRocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through\nthe racket and reaches Rocky.\n\nRocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages\nto see Adrian jumping up and down waving.  The crowd is\ncarrying him away.  He attempts to lower himself but the\ncrowd won't permit it.\n<b> \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t121.\n</b>\n\nRocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's\nheads and shoulders.
