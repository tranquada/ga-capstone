BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT\n\nSUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... \"NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA\"\n\n... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can.\nThe boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle.\nThe lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is\nfighting.\n\nIn the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black.\nThe white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old.\nHis face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black\nhair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a\nplodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and\nbangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy.\nBut the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins\nat his opponent and keeps grinding ahead.\n\nThe people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for\nblood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters.\nIn the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is\nhustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony.\nA housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.\n\nThe BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner...\nSomebody heaves a beer can into the ring.\n\nThe Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers\nacross the ring at Rocky.\n\n\t\t\t\tBLACK FIGHTER\n\t\t\t(to cornerman)\n\t\t... I'm gonna bust his head\n\t\twide open!\n\nIn Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled,\nbalding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He\nworks on Rocky without any enthusiasm.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNERMAN\n\t\t\t(lackluster)\n\t\t... Ya waltzin' -- Give the\n\t\tsuckers some action.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tHey --\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNERMAN\n\t\t\t(overriding)\n\t\tYa movin' like a bum -- Want\n\t\tsome advice --\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t... Just gimme the water.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.\n\n\nA FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with\nyellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.\n\n\t\t\t\tFAN\n\t\tShould I bet the fight don't\n\t\tgo the distance -- Ya feel\n\t\tstrong?\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tAbsolutely.\n\n\t\t\t\tCORNERMAN\n\t\t... Ya want some good advice?\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t... I just want the mouthpiece.\n\nThe BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross.  The\nfighters engage in battle.  The other fighter grabs Rocky in\na clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding\ncut on the corner of Rocky's eye.\n\nRocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into\nthe man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the\nfighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into\nthe ring.  Rocky ignores it.\n\nThe fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does\nnot bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under\nthe ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new\nfighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe.\nEmbroidered clumsily on the back is, \"The Italian Stallion.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tANNOUNCER\n\t\tWinner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a\n\t\tsix rounder between local\n\t\tlightweights.\n\nWithout pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a\ncigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher\npasses behind him.  He watches for a moment and continues up\nthe aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the\nBELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky\nfades into the darkness of the rear of the club.\n\nTHE TITLE CREDITS END:\n\nINT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nRocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his\nlocker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other\nfighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFIGHTER #1\n\t\t... Tomorrow me an' my woman\n\t\tare gonna tip on down to\n\t\tAtlantic City, man.\n\n\t\t\t\tFIGHTER #2\n\t\t... It's cold, Bro'.\n\n\t\t\t\tFIGHTER #1\n\t\t... That's right, I got the\n\t\tcity to myself...\n\nAnother paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and\nspit nervously on the floor.\n\nA young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO\nthat is BLASTING MUSIC.\n\nThe fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer\nand joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters\nare smoking.  The room is cloudy.\n\nA short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater\nbuttoned over a t-shirt.\n\n\t\t\t\tPROMOTER\n\t\t...Balboa!?\n\nRocky raises his head.  The promoter steps over.\n\n\t\t\t\tPROMOTER\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t... Twenty bucks for the\n\t\tlocker an' cornerman -- Two\n\t\tbucks for the towel an'\n\t\tshower, seven for tax -- The\n\t\thouse owes ya, sixty-one\n\t\tdollars.\n\nThe man peels off the money and departs... Rocky closes his\nlocker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.\n\nINT. TROLLEY - NIGHT\n\nRocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly... The\ntrolley is empty except for a thin old black WOMAN... The\nblack Woman studies Rocky's bruised face... Rocky becomes\nself-conscious.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t\t(almost apologetic)\n\t\tI'm a fighter.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\t\t(tired)\n\t\t... Yo' iz an accident.\n\nEXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\nRocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... He waves\nat a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back.\n\nRocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty\nbookstore.  Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway.\n\nFurther down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the\n\"ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP\"... He peers into the dark store and\nsees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window.  He mumbles to\nthe dog and continues to the corner.\n\nEXT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nA short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located\nin the most deprived section of South Philly.  He kicks away\nthe litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and\nenters.\n\nINT. ROCKY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nThe narrow hallway is painted olive brown.  A single light\nbulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.\n\nINT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nRocky enters.  The one-room apartment is drab, with a\ncurling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall...\nNailed against the far wall is a mattress.  The mattress is\nused as a punching bag.  Stuffing spills out of the center.\n\nRocky drops his coat on the floor.  He puts on a pair of\nglasses.  He crosses to a small turtle bowl... He lifts the\ncreatures.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t...Look who's home.\n\nRocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then\nplaces an old 45 RPM record on a battered phonograph.  The\nrecord is a tune, \"ALL IN THE GAME.\"\n\n... As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his\nhairbrush.  Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the\nrecord.  He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning\nto thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a\nbullish fighting stance and throws several punches.\n\nThe water boils.  Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5.\n\n\nEXT. SUNRISE OF PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAWN\n\nWe SEE the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering\nfigure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it\nsits majestically above City Hall...\n\nEXT. DOCKS - EARLY MORNING\n\nRocky is walking along the waterfront... He has a bandaid\nover one eye.  He looks at the rugged stevedores going about\ntheir business... He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool\njacket and approaches a ship being unloaded.\n\nRocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked\ncar.  These men look like blood drinkers.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAFIA #1\n\t\tYo, Rock -- How's your Boss?\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tReal good.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAFIA #2\n\t\tFightin' again?\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tYeah, here an' there.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAFIA #1\n\t\tMebbe we make sum money\n\t\ttogather soon... Give ya boss\n\t\tmy best.\n\nRocky shrugs and moves away... He nears a heavy man working\nthe crane.  The heavy man looks frightened... He stops the\ncrane and hurries into the ship's hole.  Rocky dashes up the\ngangplank.\n\nINT. SHIP - DAY\n\nThe man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked\ncrates and coffee beans.\n\nRocky sprints after him... He lunges and flings the man by\nthe neck against the wall of stacked cargo.\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\t\t(terror-filled)\n\t\tDon't hit the face!  Not the\n\t\tface!!\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tMr. Gazzo wants the two\n\t\thundred now!\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\tHonest to God I'm broke --\n\t\tGimme a break.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tMr. Gazzo says I should get\n\t\ttwo hundred or break the thumb.\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\tPlease, I need my hands to\n\t\twork -- Christ, don't bust my\n\t\tthumbs.\n\nAt wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by\nstevedores.  Rocky remains cool.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tGoin' fishin'?\n\nThe man drops the hook.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tWhat's ya name again?\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\tBob.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tLook, Bob, if ya wanna dance,\n\t\tya gotta pay the band -- If ya\n\t\tborrow, ya gotta pay the man...\n\t\tMe, I ain't emotionally\n\t\tinvolved.\n\nRocky's determined expression strikes home.  The fat man\nquickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small\nwad of bills.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t\t(continuing; counting)\n\t\tA hundred an' thirty.\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\tThat's it, I'm broke.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tThat's it? -- Completely?\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\tThat's it.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tWhat about for food an' stuff?\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\tYou have my food in ya hand.\n\nRocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's\nflushed expression.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t... The juice is climbin'\n\t\tevery week.\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\tI know the juice is climbin' --\n\t\tI been workin' six months just\n\t\tto pay the damn interest.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tYa still light seventy.\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\tWaits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't\n\t\thave to break nothin' -- Here,\n\t\ttake my coat, it's worth\n\t\tfifty-sixty dollars.  It's\n\t\tyours.\n\nThe man quickly removes his coat and extends it...\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tSee, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's\n\t\tdon't have to know nuthin'.\n\t\tI'll go tape up the hand like\n\t\tya broke my thumb.  Gazzo\n\t\twon't be wise to nothin' -- Be\n\t\ta smart guy, keep the coat,\n\t\twe'll fake like ya broke the\n\t\thand.\n\nThe man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the\nman's thumb and bends him to his knees.\n\n\t\t\t\tFATS\n\t\t\t(almost a whisper)\n\t\tNo - no - no - Please -\n\t\tPlease - Please don't...\n\nRocky releases the man who remains almost in shock.  The\nthumb is fine.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t...That's what coulda happened.\n\t\t\t(walks off.)\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.\n\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY\n\nLater that morning Rocky passes \"Animal Town Pet Shop\" in\nSouth Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In\nthe window hangs a sign reading \"Today's special -- Mixed\nKittens -- $1.50\"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning.\nHe stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the\nwindow and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and\npresses his face against the window and does his impression\nof the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks\naway.\n\nThe girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not\nvery attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old.\nBrown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses.\n\nRocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so\npainfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters.\n\nINT. PET SHOP - DAY\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\t...

He removes the puppy and hands it\nto Adrian.\n\n\t\t\t\tCUSTOMER\n\t\tGet away from me - Give me that!\n\nRocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it\nto the lady... She nervously exits.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t... How's the turtle food this\n\t\tweek?\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\t...

Though charmed, she is slightly intimidated.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tThe last food I got here had\n\t\tmore moths than flies -- An'\n\t\tthe moths get caught in my\n\t\tturtle's throat -- That makes\n\t\tthem cough --\n\nThe OWNER, a squat woman of forty, steps out of the back and\nwaves at Rocky.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYo, Gloria -- I was talkin'\n\t\tabout the turtle food -- Like\n\t\tI was sayin', the moths get\n\t\tcaught in the turtle's throat\n\t\tan' makes 'em cough...\n\t\t\t(coughs)\n\t\tA little cough an' I gotta\n\t\tsmack 'em on the shell -- An'\n\t\twhatta think they get?\n\nAdrian shrugs.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI smack 'em hard on the shell\n\t\tan' they get... What?\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\t...

He is blind\nand mentally defective.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUDY\n\t\t...See the fight last night?\n\n\t\t\t\tRUDY\n\t\tNah, I was fightin' myself.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUDY\n\t\tApollo Creed beat the bum to\n\t\tpieces.\n\nEXT./INT. GYM - DAY\n\nMickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy\nspoons.  Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive\namong themselves.  Two winos lean against the entrance.\n\nRocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full.  The\nMEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes\nthe room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of\nmachinery.  Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers\nBLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of\nthe AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the\nTHUDDING of HEAVY BAGS.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13.\n\n\nThe room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five\npercent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other.\n\nAs Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to\nwave and yell greetings.\n\n\t\t\t\tFIGHTER #1\n\t\tHey, hear ya knocked Spider\n\t\tRice out in the sixth?\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tThe third -- Shoulda seen it.\n\nRocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag.\n\n\t\t\t\tFIGHTER #2\n\t\t\t(removes glove)\n\t\tHey, Rock, touch my hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tHow come?\n\n\t\t\t\tFIGHTER #2\n\t\tC'mon, it's important.\n\nRocky touches the Fighter's bare hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tFIGHTER #2\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tCan ya tell I just whacked-off?\n\nRocky smiles and moves away.\n\nINT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY\n\nThe dressing room is lined with dented lockers.  Wooden\nbenches stretch across the room.  On the wall is a sign that\nreads, \"NO KISSING.\"\n\nRocky goes to his locker.  He tries to open it but fails.\nHe leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers.\nStill it does not open.  He shakes the lock forcefully, no\nluck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the\nsituation.\n\nAfter a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the\nbench and smashes open the lock.  Opening the door Rocky is\ntaken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t\t(mumbling)\n\t\t...

MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nMickey is in his cluttered office above the gym... the room\nis dark.  Blankets are tacked over the windows.  Rocky is\nwatching 8 mm movies of Apollo Creed in action... Rocky\nwatches with intense concentration as the fighter moves like\na huge dancer around the ring.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICKEY\n\t\tHis defense is great, can't\n\t\tlie 'bout that -- You have a\n\t\trollin' style.

GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY\n\nRocky is pounding the heavy bag with intense concentration.\nAs he strikes from all angles, Mickey instructs.\n\nINT.

He is ready.\n\nINT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nRocky is led into Mayor Rizzo's office by an aide...

Rocky stops the projector as Apollo is delivering\na knockout blow to an unfortunate opponent.\n\nRocky moves right up to freeze frame and inspects it like it\nwas a priceless painting... He backs off and begins writing\non a note pad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAWN\n\nThe first light of dawn streams through Mickey's filthy\nwindows... Rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he\nhas lost interest in watching the movies.\n\nThe film has completed its run through the projector and\nlazily flops around on the top reel... Listlessly Rocky rubs\nhis reddened eyes.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t97.\n\n\nThe door opens and Mickey flips on the light... The two men\nstare at each other for a long moment.  Mickey studies\nRocky's despondent expression and knows what is on the\nfighter's mind.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICKEY\n\t\t... I know what you're\n\t\tthinkin'm kid -- At least ya\n\t\tgotta shot -- All ya can do is\n\t\ttry ya' best.\n\nRocky stands and, with his dog, inches past Mickey and exits\nthe room.

His\n\t\trecord is forty-four wins,\n\t\ttwenty losses and thirty-eight\n\t\tknockouts.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR #1\n\t\tI only wonder if this man has\n\t\tthe skill to go past three\n\t\trounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t102.\n\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nA wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring.\nMany people wish Rocky well as he passes... people also hurl\ninsults.  From the expression on Mickey's face it is also\nthe greatest night of his life.  In the audience are familiar\nfaces from the gym.  From the back of the arena a ROAR goes\nup... Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George\nWashington.  He throws silver dollars.  The NOISE builds to\nDEAFENING proportions.  Creed's trainer holds the rope and\nCreed bounds into the ring.  He tears off the Washington\noutfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in\nan outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red,\nwhite and blue sequined top hat.  The robe is sequined red,\nwhite and blue.  His boxing trunks are red, white and blue\nsilk with stars around the waistband.  The boxing shoes\nmatch the trunks.  On his chin is a pointed white Uncle Sam\nbeard.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR #2\n\t\tYou could go deaf with the\n\t\tnoise -- it undoubtedly means\n\t\tChampion Apollo Creed is\n\t\theading towards the ring --\n\n\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR #1\n\t\tAm I seeing right?  Creed is\n\t\tapproaching the ring in a boat.\n\t\tIs he supposed to be George\n\t\tWashington?  Obviously so.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR #2\n\t\tIt's been confirmed that it is\n\t\tdefinitely an impersonation of\n\t\tGeorge Washington -- a great\n\t\tway to start 1976 off.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR #1\n\t\tI agree.\n\nImmediately Creed begins gracefully dancing in a wide circle.\nHe passes within inches of Rocky in his Uncle Sam outfit.\n\n\t\t\t\tAPOLLO\n\t\tI want you!  I want you!\n\nThe crowd loves the taunting.  Apollo Creed floats back to\nhis corner.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICKEY\n\t\tDon't let 'im get you tight.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t103.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tWhatta ya think that outfit\n\t\tcost?\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe ANNOUNCER steps to the center of the ring... Several men\nin suits stand against the ropes... Paulie is dressed nicely\nand sits at ringside with a pretty blonde escort.  Rocky\nwaves at him.  Paulie waves back and secretly gestures at\nhis date... Rocky smiles and gestures back.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNOUNCER\n\t\tLadies and gentlemen --\n\t\tWelcome to the Bicentennial\n\t\tHeavyweight Championship\n\t\tFight...

They step to the\ncenter of the ring.  As the Referee explains the rules\nApollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes... The\nReferee's voice fades and the fighters' expressions fill the\nscreen... Something soulful and frightening is being\ncommunicated.\n\n\t\t\t\tREFEREE\n\t\t... Now come out fighting.\n\nThe fighters return to their corners.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICKEY\n\t\tGod bless ya, Rock.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tThanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe BELL RINGS...

I've\n\t\tnever seen anything like it in\n\t\tthe last round of a\n\t\tchampionship fight... Apollo\n\t\tspits blood on the canvas.  It\n\t\tappears he is protecting his\n\t\tright side.  His ribs were\n\t\tprobably injured at the end of\n\t\tround fourteen.\n\t\t\t\t(MORE)\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t117.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)\n\t\tIt's confirmed, unofficially,\n\t\tCreed's ribs may be broken --\n\t\tApollo fakes a left and throws\n\t\ta big tired right -- Balboa's\n\t\tmouthpiece is out!  Creed\n\t\tattacks with one hand!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nApollo feints and Rocky falls for it.  The Champion unleashes\na lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's\nmouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the\nropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to\ntheir feet.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nRocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to\ncome ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a\nweary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O.\nwritten on every punch.  Rocky counters the assault blow for\nblow.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tGimme ya best!!!!\n\nMickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGimme ya best!!!\n\nBlood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside\nphotographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood.\n\nThe fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit\nof strength from their souls and beat each other without\nmercy.  They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension\nfar beyond blood and pain.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIX\n\t\t\t\tFIVE\n\t\t\t\tFOUR\n\t\t\t\tTHREE\n\t\t\t\tTWO\n\t\t\t\tONE!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe BELL RINGS... The arena EXPLODES with thunderous approval.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t118.\n\n\nTheir cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters... In the\nmidst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other\nwith unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched\ngladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives.\n\nAs though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step\ntowards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's\near.\n\n\t\t\t\tAPOLLO\n\t\t... Ain't gonna be no rematch.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\t... Don't want one.\n\nMickey comes over and separates them and leads him back to\nhis corner... Mickey embraces him.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe Announcer enters the ring with a microphone.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNOUNCER\n\t\tAttention, please!!  Attention!!\n\t\tLadies and gentlemen, tonight\n\t\twe have had the rare privilege\n\t\tto have witnessed the greatest\n\t\texhibitions of stamina and\n\t\tguts ever in the history of\n\t\tsports.\n\nThe CROWD ROARS.\n\n\t\t\t\tANNOUNCER\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLadies and gentlemen -- We\n\t\thave a split decision!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nApollo did not expect this and tenses.  His corner nervously\ntries to reassure him.  It does no good.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nRocky did not expect this either and looks in confusion at\nMickey, but Mickey is frozen with anticipation.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\t\t\t\tANNOUNCER\n\t\tJudge Walker scores it eight-\n\t\tseven Creed... Judge Roseman\n\t\tscores it eight-seven Balboa.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t119.\n\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nApollo is rigid.  Fear radiates from his eyes.  To lose the\ncrown on this night after the fight he fought would kill\nhim... A silence has blanketed the arena.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\t\t\t\tANNOUNCER\n\t\tJudge Conners scores it nine-\n\t\tsix Creed... Winner and still\n\t\tHeavyweight Champion of the\n\t\tWorld, Apollo Creed!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nRocky sorely smiles and looks at the waves of CHEERING fans\nthat circle the ring and reach out towards him... Mickey\ngrabs Rocky's hand and raises it.  The CROWD ROARS.\n\n\t\t\t\tMICKEY\n\t\tI don't care what they say,\n\t\tyou're a winner.\n\n\t\t\t\tROCKY\n\t\tYo, can I have my locker back?\n\nMickey and Rocky look at each other and grin.  Mickey hugs\nRocky like a son.  Mickey raises Rocky's hand again.  Rocky\nturns away from Mickey and pats Benny the cut-man's\nshoulder... Benny smiles wearily.  Rocky stares across the\nring at Apollo Creed, who stands victorious, but his face\nand body are badly distorted... The two men lock stares that\nreflect admiration.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nApollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward\nscreaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nRocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well-\nwishing fans rumble forward... Mickey's eyes show mounting\napprehension as the fans become abnormally active.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThey shove the police aside and clutch wildly at Creed.\nCreed's army of bodyguards swing angrily at the crowd but\nthey are soon engulfed by screaming waves of humanity.\nApollo is suddenly hoisted into the air and is being carried\nalong by a legion of fans.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t120.\n\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nOn the opposite aisle Rocky is experiencing the same\noverwhelming adulation by his fans but does not seem to be\nfrightened by it, like Apollo.  Mickey tries his best to\ncontrol things but his voice is drowned out in the growing\nclamor.  The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to\ntheir shoulders.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nRocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against\neach other... chanting, 'Creed, Creed, Creed.'\n\nRocky's fans counter by bellowing, 'Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.'\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nPaulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he\nstarts swinging.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nBoth Rocky and Apollo are completely at the mercy of the\ncrowd.  They are being passed overhead and remain helpless\nas their bodies float up the aisle on the sea of hands...\nThe CHANTING IS DEAFENING.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nFearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move\nforward.  Running headlong into the crowd, she angles\nthrough the mass to get to Rocky.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nShe is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions,\nbut she keeps her feet... She sees him.  In the distance,\nRocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall\nand waits for the procession to pass.\n\nThe procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's\nunbelievably battered but smiling face.  He appears to be\nking of the world.\n\nThe procession approaches and passes Adrian.  She jumps on\nher toes and waves frantically but is not seen.  She screams\nRocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through\nthe racket and reaches Rocky.\n\nRocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages\nto see Adrian jumping up and down waving.  The crowd is\ncarrying him away.  He attempts to lower himself but the\ncrowd won't permit it.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t121.\n\n\nRocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's\nheads and shoulders.  He resembles a man trying to go up a\ndown escalator.  People are jammed so tightly together Rocky\nmanages to crawl across them to Adrian.\n\nStill suspended in air, Rocky leans down and Adrian jumps up\nand they lock in an embrace.\n\n\t\t\t\tADRIAN\n\t\tI love you -- I love you -- I\n\t\tlove you...\n\nThe two are swept along into the greatest night anyone can\nremember...\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocky\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Sylvester Stallone\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:34:18.815775"}
