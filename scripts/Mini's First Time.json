She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty\n          mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly\n          still that of a girl.\n          \n          -                    MINI (V.O.)\n                    I know what you're thinking.

Though tall\n          and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a\n          \"FUCT\" T-shirt and jean shorts.\n\n                              MINI (V.O.)

She clearly understands how to the drive the boys\n          crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who\n          stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER-\n          AEROBICIZED MOTHERS.\n          \n                              MINI (V.O.)\n                    See, I was blessed with a terrific\n                    mom.

The\n          blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing\n          for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.\n          \n                              MINI (V.O.)\n                    A few days before the party, I\n                    overhear her on the phone ordering\n                    me a male stripper. Nothing says \"I\n                    love you\" like ten inches of man\n                    meat in your face.\n          \n          Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing.\n          \n                              MINI (V.O.)\n                    And knowing dear old ma, she'll try\n                    and nail him after the party...in\n                    my bed.\n          \n          Mini's friend KAYLA, a little rounder, but also brash, comes\n          dancing over. She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini,\n          almost challenging her.\n          \n          MIKE RUDELL, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their\n          display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his\n          imagination.\n          \n          \n          \n          \n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                     3.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n                                 MINI (V.O.)\n                       That guy?

The caterers look\n          confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey,\n          starting to wheel the cake down the long hall.\n          \n          INT.

To be perfectly\n                       honest...I loved it. Talk about\n                       electric, knowing at any moment she\n                       could walk in was better than any\n                       drug.

The knife wielding figure follows behind her. She\n          looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the\n          shoulder.

The\n                    district attorney is viewing this\n                    case as an opportunity to show the\n                    public that the rich don't get away\n                    with murder in this town.\n          \n          Martin whispers something in Volant's ear and he in turn,\n                               V\n          whispers back.\n          \n                               OLANT\n                    Does this mean he's offering Mr.\n                    Tannen immunity if he says he was\n                    protecting his daughter?\n          \n          Garson takes a sip of water, as Martin anxiously waits for\n          his answer.\n          \n                              GARSON\n                    It's a strong possibility.
