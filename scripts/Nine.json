PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\r\n</b>\r\nThe flicker of film.   Footage from a press conference.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GUIDO\r\n</b>            You kill your film several times,\r\n            mostly by talking about it. A film is\r\n            a dream. You kill it writing it down,\r\n            you kill it with a camera; the film\r\n            might come to life for a moment or two\r\n            when your actors breathe life back\r\n            into it - but then it dies again,\r\n            buried in film cans. Mysteriously,\r\n            sometimes, in the editing room, a\r\n            miracle happens when you place one\r\n            image next to another so that when,\r\n            finally, an audience sits in the dark,\r\n            if you're lucky -- very lucky - and\r\n            sometimes I've been lucky - the dream\r\n            flickers back to life again. That's\r\n            why I'm secretive.\r\n\r\n<b>                         REPORTER (O.S.)\r\n</b>            So what's your favorite pasta?\r\n\r\n<b>                         GUIDO\r\n</b>            Finally, a serious question.\r\n\r\nLaughter.

The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a\r\nman into the stage, turns on a working light.\r\n\r\nSUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965\r\n\r\n<b>                         STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT\r\n</b>            Good luck, Maestro.\r\n\r\nDeparting, he closes the soundstage door.\r\n\r\nAs the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of\r\nlight catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard.\r\nGUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the\r\nworld. In front of him:\r\n\r\nAN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under\r\nconstruction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its\r\nunfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins.\r\nCracked stone facades, broken columns, open\r\nplatforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    A\r\nlighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane\r\nsurrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands.\r\n                                    p. 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts\r\non his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the\r\nstage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping\r\nover to the crane.\r\n\r\nGuido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his\r\nmouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in\r\nevery sense a jumble of ideas.\r\n\r\nGuido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the\r\nbucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands,\r\noverwhelmed.\r\n\r\n<b>THE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                       GUIDO (V.O.)\r\n</b>          Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini...\r\n          How do you begin? How do you begin\r\n          this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page\r\n          1... Page nothing...\r\n\r\nIn the distance, a figure approaches out of the\r\ndarkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An\r\nescape from his tortured reality.\r\n\r\nThe figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is\r\ngorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his\r\nfilm star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she\r\nstops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,\r\nand kisses him. And with that gesture, the music\r\nswells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the\r\nair, the gritty soundstage transforms into something\r\nbeautiful, transforms into the interior world of\r\n<b>GUIDO'S FANTASY.\r\n</b>\r\nAs Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly\r\nappear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the\r\nwomen from Guido's life, past and present. Women from\r\nhis films, women he has loved, the sources of his\r\ninspiration and creative genius.\r\n\r\nA grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women\r\nin Guido's life are revealed, each with their own\r\npowerful entrance:\r\n\r\nLUISA, his wife\r\n\r\nCARLA, his mistress\r\n\r\nLILLI, his costume designer and accomplice\r\n\r\nGUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit\r\n\r\nSTEPHANIE, a fashion journalist\r\n\r\nSARAGHINA, a whore\r\n                                       p. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido\r\nand he loses himself and his anxiety in their\r\ncollective embrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>INT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY\r\n</b>\r\nThe fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE,\r\nas the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting\r\nGuido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight\r\npenetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,\r\ndiscombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures\r\napproach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-\r\nfed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime\r\nassociate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure\r\naccompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an\r\naccountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious\r\npunctuation:\r\n\r\n<b>                       DANTE\r\n</b>                 (walking)\r\n          Guido!

They kiss on both cheeks.\r\n\r\n<b>                       DANTE\r\n</b>          Bene. My God, you look terrible,\r\n          better go to makeup, forget you've got\r\n          a press conference?\r\n\r\n<b>                       FAUSTO\r\n</b>                 (discreetly, to Dante)\r\n          He has no tie.\r\n\r\n<b>                       DANTE\r\n</b>          Yes, makeup and wardrobe.\r\n\r\nHe takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight.\r\nGuido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look\r\nand a gesture asks Dante who is he?\r\n\r\n<b>                       FAUSTO\r\n</b>                 (overlapping Dante)\r\n          Signor Contini, I'm Fausto.

CINECITTA - DAY\r\n</b>\r\nGuido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en\r\nroute to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large\r\nposter of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a\r\nfailure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido\r\npasses he causes a mild stir, and many people nod\r\ndeferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.\r\n\r\n<b>                       FAUSTO\r\n</b>          Yes, but please, please, I think it's\r\n          customary for there to be an approved\r\n          script and budget before filming\r\n          commences...\r\n\r\n<b>                       GUIDO\r\n</b>          Is he going to follow us?\r\n\r\n<b>                       FAUSTO\r\n</b>          It's not my intention to be difficult.\r\n          Maestro, I am a huge admirer of\r\n          Maestro Contini's movies, your early\r\n          films are...everybody loves them\r\n          and... I consider it a great honour\r\n          for me to be here now... none the\r\n          less, I need a script and a budget.\r\n\r\nNeither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders.\r\nThey make their way to the Production Offices.\r\nEverywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>INT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY\r\n</b>\r\nA long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio\r\nheads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are\r\nseveral, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without\r\nmissing a beat of their solemn conversation.\r\n                                       p. 5\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they progress into and through the open plan office,\r\nmany of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to\r\nget Guido's attention, swelling the procession,\r\ninterjecting with their urgent requests.\r\n\r\nThere are set models everywhere, in the process of\r\nbeing constructed, or painted.\r\n\r\nJACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a\r\nmodel, hurries over. Nobody stops moving.\r\n\r\nAs a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nPIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the\r\nprocession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting\r\nthrough them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a\r\npartitioned office -\r\n\r\n<b>                       PIERPAOLO\r\n</b>          Where do you want your messages?\r\n\r\n<b>                        GUIDO\r\n</b>          On my desk.\r\n\r\n<b>                       PIERPAOLO\r\n</b>          There's no room on your desk.\r\n\r\n- into the main office -\r\n\r\n<b>                       GUIDO\r\n</b>          Under my desk.

Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is\r\nGuido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky,\r\nindomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without\r\nany sentiment.

Nobody wants that...\r\n          especially Luisa.\r\n\r\nShe indicates the people who pass.\r\n\r\n<b>                       LILLI (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Guido - there probably isn't a single\r\n          person passing by who hasn't been\r\n          touched in some way by one of your\r\n          movies. That's your gift. That's what\r\n          you've been given. Use it. Just use it\r\n          with some grace. For Chrissake.\r\n\r\n<b>                       GUIDO\r\n</b>                 (doubtful)\r\n          The only movie I could make now would\r\n          be... I don't know... would be about a\r\n          man trying to win back his wife.\r\n\r\n<b>                       LILLI\r\n</b>          Sounds perfect.\r\n                 (after a beat)\r\n          The costumes might not be so bad too.\r\n\r\nFLASH: Lights from a makeup mirror. A glimpse of a\r\nfemale eye applying false eyelashes.\r\n\r\nFLASH: A man of the collar applies pancake makeup,\r\nwhile a cigarette dangles from his lips.\r\n\r\nYoung Guido, 9, appears and whispers into Guido's ear.\r\n\r\n<b>                       YOUNG GUIDO\r\n</b>          We're ready to begin!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS\r\n</b>\r\nA surreal backstage, the cast of Guido's life, whores,\r\nmodels, schoolboys, priests, etc. A show about to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nThe music of \"Be Italian/Folies Bergere\" plays and\r\nbuilds throughout.\r\n\r\nPeople run past with props, lights, etc.    Showgirls are\r\nhurrying. A beautiful confusion.\r\n                                      p. 91\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>EXT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY\r\n</b>\r\nGuido pulls up in his car outside the soundstage. He\r\nstops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence.\r\nSummoning his courage, he gets out of the car. He is\r\ngreeted by Pierpaolo. He seems to need and acknowledge\r\nhis support. Pierpaolo is tender.\r\n\r\n<b>                       GUIDO\r\n</b>          I can't remember how you do this.\r\n\r\n<b>                       PIERPAOLO\r\n</b>          You'll remember.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS\r\n</b>\r\nThe camera moves through the backstage mayhem.\r\n\r\nMamma is in her dressing room preparing. Saraghina is\r\nsharing a dressing room with a Priest. He is helping\r\nwith her corset. Carla and Luigi. Carla fixes her\r\nhusband's hair. Claudia and Stephanie smoke and talk.\r\nLilli adjusts her own, and other men's wardrobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY\r\n</b>\r\nGuido is in his element again, locked in passionate\r\ndiscussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand,\r\nan actual script. The set surrounding them is modest;\r\na tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets.\r\nThe vast film Italia has clearly given way to something\r\nsmaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n<b>                       GUIDO\r\n</b>          I don't want to say too much. The\r\n          first way that we kill our film is by\r\n          talking about it. But this scene is\r\n          about reconciliation. And within the\r\n          scene I would like you to try and find\r\n          your way to begin that journey back\r\n          towards each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>INT. FANTASY DRESSING ROOMS\r\n</b>\r\nYoung Guido rushes by the dressing rooms.\r\n\r\n<b>                       YOUNG GUIDO\r\n</b>          Presto! Presto! Take your places!\r\n          Andiamo! Andiamo!\r\n\r\nThe dressing rooms begin to empty.\r\n                                    p. 92\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>INT. STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY\r\n</b>\r\nFrom high above on the soundstage catwalk, Young Guido\r\nwatches Older Guido at work.\r\n\r\n<b>                       GUIDO\r\n</b>                 (Continuing to speak to\r\n                  his actors)\r\n          Maybe it's the most important building\r\n          block that we have to begin again...\r\n          We start from the beginning each time\r\n          and I feel today as if I'm starting\r\n          from the beginning. We'll just keep\r\n          asking each other questions, and don't\r\n          look to me for the answers, okay?\r\n\r\nOn cue, Young Guido opens the door behind him and\r\nushers in THE CAST OF GUIDO'S LIFE. They enter with a\r\nsense of anticipation and excitement and arrange\r\nthemselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom\r\nbehind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white.\r\n\r\nBut Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task\r\nthat lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts down\r\nhis script. He takes off his jacket and hangs his\r\nglasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set\r\nin front of him.\r\n\r\n<b>                       PIERPAOLO\r\n</b>          Maestro, should I call final checks?\r\n\r\n<b>                       GUIDO\r\n</b>          Yes.\r\n\r\n<b>                       PIERPAOLO\r\n</b>          Makeup, please! Final checks!\r\n\r\nA LONG WIDE PAN reveals a tableau vivant looming behind\r\nGuido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every\r\ninspiration. They watch him as he begins to work. A\r\npart of him now and forever.\r\n\r\nGuido sits on the crane.\r\n\r\nThe soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure\r\nslip quietly onto the set. Tentatively, she steps\r\nthrough the shadows. It's Luisa. From a discreet\r\ndistance, she watches her husband return to his gift.\r\n\r\nPierpaolo calls for silence.\r\n\r\n<b>                       PIERPAOLO (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Alora.

Luisa watches.\r\nAs the last note plays, the crane soars higher,\r\ncarrying Guido up and up.\r\n\r\n<b>                       GUIDO\r\n</b><b>          ACTION.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>CUT TO BLACK.\r\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Nine.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Nine</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Michael Tolkin\" title=\"Scripts by Michael Tolkin\">Michael Tolkin</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Anthony Minghella\" title=\"Scripts by Anthony Minghella\">Anthony Minghella</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Musical\" title=\"Musical Scripts\">Musical</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Nine Script.html#comments\" title=\"Nine comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:12:35.190119"}
