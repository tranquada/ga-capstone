PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\nThe flicker of film.   Footage from a press conference.\r\n\r\n                         GUIDO\r\n            You kill your film several times,\r\n            mostly by talking about it. A film is\r\n            a dream. You kill it writing it down,\r\n            you kill it with a camera; the film\r\n            might come to life for a moment or two\r\n            when your actors breathe life back\r\n            into it - but then it dies again,\r\n            buried in film cans. Mysteriously,\r\n            sometimes, in the editing room, a\r\n            miracle happens when you place one\r\n            image next to another so that when,\r\n            finally, an audience sits in the dark,\r\n            if you're lucky -- very lucky - and\r\n            sometimes I've been lucky - the dream\r\n            flickers back to life again. That's\r\n            why I'm secretive.\r\n\r\n                         REPORTER (O.S.)\r\n            So what's your favorite pasta?\r\n\r\n                         GUIDO\r\n            Finally, a serious question.\r\n\r\nLaughter.   A word:\r\n\r\n                        NINE\r\n\r\nINT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHT\r\n\r\nA huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a\r\nman into the stage, turns on a working light.\r\n\r\nSUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965\r\n\r\n                         STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT\r\n            Good luck, Maestro.\r\n\r\nDeparting, he closes the soundstage door.\r\n\r\nAs the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of\r\nlight catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard.\r\nGUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the\r\nworld. In front of him:\r\n\r\nAN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under\r\nconstruction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its\r\nunfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins.\r\nCracked stone facades, broken columns, open\r\nplatforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    A\r\nlighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane\r\nsurrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands.\r\n                                    p. 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts\r\non his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the\r\nstage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping\r\nover to the crane.\r\n\r\nGuido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his\r\nmouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in\r\nevery sense a jumble of ideas.\r\n\r\nGuido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the\r\nbucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands,\r\noverwhelmed.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES\r\n\r\n                       GUIDO (V.O.)\r\n          Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini...\r\n          How do you begin? How do you begin\r\n          this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page\r\n          1... Page nothing...\r\n\r\nIn the distance, a figure approaches out of the\r\ndarkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An\r\nescape from his tortured reality.\r\n\r\nThe figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is\r\ngorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his\r\nfilm star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she\r\nstops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,\r\nand kisses him. And with that gesture, the music\r\nswells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the\r\nair, the gritty soundstage transforms into something\r\nbeautiful, transforms into the interior world of\r\nGUIDO'S FANTASY.\r\n\r\nAs Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly\r\nappear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the\r\nwomen from Guido's life, past and present. Women from\r\nhis films, women he has loved, the sources of his\r\ninspiration and creative genius.\r\n\r\nA grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women\r\nin Guido's life are revealed, each with their own\r\npowerful entrance:\r\n\r\nLUISA, his wife\r\n\r\nCARLA, his mistress\r\n\r\nLILLI, his costume designer and accomplice\r\n\r\nGUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit\r\n\r\nSTEPHANIE, a fashion journalist\r\n\r\nSARAGHINA, a whore\r\n                                       p. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido\r\nand he loses himself and his anxiety in their\r\ncollective embrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY\r\n\r\nThe fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE,\r\nas the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting\r\nGuido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight\r\npenetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,\r\ndiscombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures\r\napproach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-\r\nfed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime\r\nassociate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure\r\naccompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an\r\naccountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious\r\npunctuation:\r\n\r\n                       DANTE\r\n                 (walking)\r\n          Guido! You're here.\r\n\r\n                       GUIDO\r\n          Buongiorno, Dante.\r\n\r\n                       DANTE\r\n          I've been looking for you all over the\r\n          place. The set's coming along. How\r\n          are you?\r\n\r\n                       GUIDO\r\n          Bene, grazie, bene.\r\n\r\nGuido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.\r\n\r\n                       DANTE\r\n          Bene. My God, you look terrible,\r\n          better go to makeup, forget you've got\r\n          a press conference?\r\n\r\n                       FAUSTO\r\n                 (discreetly, to Dante)\r\n          He has no tie.\r\n\r\n                       DANTE\r\n          Yes, makeup and wardrobe.\r\n\r\nHe takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight.\r\nGuido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look\r\nand a gesture asks Dante who is he?\r\n\r\n                       FAUSTO\r\n                 (overlapping Dante)\r\n          Signor Contini, I'm Fausto.     Good\r\n          morning, Signor Contini.\r\n                                       p. 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DANTE\r\n                 (interrupts)\r\n          He's counting costs, you know. The\r\n          Bank wants him here.\r\n                 (to Fausto)\r\n          Don't speak to him, I speak to him.\r\n\r\n                       FAUSTO\r\n          Okay, I have some questions for Signor\r\n          Contini.\r\n\r\n                       GUIDO\r\n          We all have questions for Signor\r\n          Contini.\r\n\r\nThey head outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. CINECITTA - DAY\r\n\r\nGuido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en\r\nroute to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large\r\nposter of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a\r\nfailure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido\r\npasses he causes a mild stir, and many people nod\r\ndeferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.\r\n\r\n                       FAUSTO\r\n          Yes, but please, please, I think it's\r\n          customary for there to be an approved\r\n          script and budget before filming\r\n          commences...\r\n\r\n                       GUIDO\r\n          Is he going to follow us?\r\n\r\n                       FAUSTO\r\n          It's not my intention to be difficult.\r\n          Maestro, I am a huge admirer of\r\n          Maestro Contini's movies, your early\r\n          films are...everybody loves them\r\n          and... I consider it a great honour\r\n          for me to be here now... none the\r\n          less, I need a script and a budget.\r\n\r\nNeither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders.\r\nThey make their way to the Production Offices.\r\nEverywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY\r\n\r\nA long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio\r\nheads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are\r\nseveral, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without\r\nmissing a beat of their solemn conversation.\r\n                                       p. 5\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they progress into and through the open plan office,\r\nmany of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to\r\nget Guido's attention, swelling the procession,\r\ninterjecting with their urgent requests.\r\n\r\nThere are set models everywhere, in the process of\r\nbeing constructed, or painted.\r\n\r\nJACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a\r\nmodel, hurries over. Nobody stops moving.\r\n\r\nAs a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nPIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the\r\nprocession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting\r\nthrough them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a\r\npartitioned office -\r\n\r\n                       PIERPAOLO\r\n          Where do you want your messages?\r\n\r\n                        GUIDO\r\n          On my desk.\r\n\r\n                       PIERPAOLO\r\n          There's no room on your desk.\r\n\r\n- into the main office -\r\n\r\n                       GUIDO\r\n          Under my desk.

WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAY\r\n\r\nGuido comes through the door, blows hard from the\r\nbarrage.\r\n\r\nThey're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always,\r\nfor Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is\r\nGuido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky,\r\nindomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without\r\nany sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido\r\nheads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting\r\nsome fabric.\r\n\r\n                       GUIDO\r\n          I need a cigarette.\r\n\r\nDante comes in, closing the door behind him.\r\n                                      p. 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DANTE\r\n          He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.\r\n\r\nGuido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to\r\nLilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.\r\n\r\n                       GUIDO\r\n          I need a coffee and a cigarette.\r\n\r\nHe lies down.\r\n\r\n                       LILLI\r\n                 (unimpressed)\r\n          Answer a question, I'll give you a\r\n          coffee.

She may be a crazy whore, but\r\nshe's not an animal, she's just playing one for the\r\nboys, and they don't quite understand that she's having\r\nher own fun with them.\r\n\r\nShe takes a deliberate step.
