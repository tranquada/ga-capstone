The woman on the floor has\njust taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her\nface is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W\nturning the red blood into black blood.\n\nA hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME\nholding a white handkerchief with the name \"BILL\" sewn in the\ncorner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the\nyoung woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice\nspeaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the\naudience.\nBut what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that\nshines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the\n\"BILL\" of the title.\n\nIn another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes\nwere called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the\nplanet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters.\nAnd of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he\n\ncorrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.\n\n\n\n                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)\n          I bet I could fry an egg on your\n          head about now, if I wanted to.\n\nHe continues wiping away the blood.\n\n\n\n                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)\n          No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even\n          now, you're aware enough to know\n          there isn't a trace of sadism in\n          my actions... Okay - Maybe towards\n          these other jokers - bot not your.\n\nOVERHEAD SHOT\nWe see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on\nthe floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others\nin black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is\nmale). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.\nWe also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated\nby blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending\non the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a\nwhite bridal gown.\nThis woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she\nwill only be referred to as The BRIDE.\n\nBack to CU of The BRIDE.\n\nThe BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.\n\n\n\n                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)\n          No Kiddo at this moment, this is me\n          at my most masochistic.\n\nWhile still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in\nthe picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and\nsays;\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.\n\nAfter saying the \"y\" in \"baby\", we hear a BANG and The Bride\nreceives a bullet in the side of her head.\n\n                                                 CUT TO:\nBLACK SCREEN: Presentation Credit\n\n\n\n                      \"The 4th Film by\n                     QUENTIN TARANTINO\"\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n\nB/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death.\n\nThe BRIDE speaks to us in a VO;\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          That's Tim, Arthur's best friend.\n\nCU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two\nbullet holes in her.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          That's his girlfriend Janeen.\n\nCU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still\nclutched in her dead fist.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          That's my best friend from work\n          Erica.\n\nAN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          That's the minister. I think his\n          name was Reverend Hillhouse.\n\nA DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower\nprint dress.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          That's his wife.\n\nA DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          Organ player, don't know her name.\n\nA YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The\n\n          name on his driver's license was\n          Charles Arthur Plympton, but for\n          some reason he preferred Arthur.\n          Maybe if he went by Carles people\n          would have called him Charlie. If\n          that was his reason for going by\n          Arthur I can understand it.\n          Nothing wrong with the name\n          Charlie, except he didn't look like\n          a Charlie, he looked like an\n          Arthur.\n          Obviously you'll have to take my\n          word on this. Speaking of names, I\n          was about two seconds away from\n          becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur\n          Plympton.\n\nAnd then finally, The Bride.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.\n\nWe do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal\ngown\n\nTo\n\nThe Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the\nasswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the\npast, because she looks like a million dollars\nnow.......three million even.\n\n\n\nINT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT\n\nThe Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia\nconvertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A\nPROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          Looked dead, didn't I? Well I\n          wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo\n          trying, I can tell you that.\n          Actually Bill's last bullet put me\n          in a coma. A coma I was to lie in\n          for five years.\n          When I woke up, ...I went on what\n          the movie advertisements refer to\n          as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I\n          roarded and I rampaged and I got\n          bloody satisfaction. In all, I've\n          killed 33 people to get to this\n          piont right now.\n          I have only one more.\n          The last one.\n\n          The one I'M driving to right now.\n          The only one left.\n          And when I arrive at my\n          destination.....\n          .... I'm gonna Kill Bill.\n\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE\n\nAs a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the\nsoundtrack, we see the credits of \"Kill Bill\" play over the\nBride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax.\n\nThe sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home.\n\n                                           WE FADE TO BLACK\n\n\n\nBLACK FRAME\nTITLE APPEARS:\n\n\n                        Chapter one\n\n                            \"2\"\n\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n\nEX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR\nWE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A\nCU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR\nShe's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on\nsomething.\n\nThe BRIDE'S POV:\nA very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of\nPasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the\ndriveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle\nthe grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name \"The\nBELLS\" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't\nsee ice cream truck bells.\n\nSUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM:\n\n\n                        \"The city of\n                   PASADENA, CALIFORNIA\"\n\n\nWe hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks\ninto the shot, heading for the front door.\n\nEX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell.\n\n\n\nEXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY\n\nThe front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the\nsame age as The Bride stands in the doorway.\nThe Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the\nblonde on her doorstep.\n\nThe BRIDE\non the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her\neyes.\n\nFLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE\n(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see\nit with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding\nchapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four\npeople in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the\nface... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.\n\nThe BRIDE ON THE PORCH\nWe Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS\nLOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme\nthroughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies\nit is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens\nto be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme\nplays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When\nthe Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.\n\n\n\nINT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY\n\nThe white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of\nthe living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of\nthe sofa.\n\nThese two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER\nthe couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing\ntogether on the plush carpet.\n\nThe HOUSEWIFE\nKICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the\nsmall table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and\nthe mail is kept.\n\nThe Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a\nFLYING TACKLE from behind by The Bride that sends them both\ninto........\n\nAn ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has\nframed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a\ncollection of painted commemorative plates depicting the\nnegro experience in the American military. Starting with a\nplate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro\ntroops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers\nfighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war,\nthe colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and\nfinally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH\nTHROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.\n\nThey land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked\nin grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...\nWhen The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.\n\nThe HOUSEWIFE\nhops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and\ncomes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.\n\nThe BRIDE\nrises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath\nhanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,\ndouble-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what\nNavy Seals use to kill humans with.)\n\nThe Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally\ndemolished living room.\n\nThe two    woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each\nlooking    like they know how to use it, each waiting for the\nother to    make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep\ninto the    other one.\n\nBlood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women\nlocked in life and death combat......\n\n....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD\nLITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.\n\n\n\n                       FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL\n             Mommy, I'm home!\n\nThe two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat\nconcentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year\nold's voice. The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to\nthe eyes of The Bride.\n\nThe Bride seems to answer back; \"Okay.\"\n\nThe Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons\nbehind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks\ninto the newly destroyed living room.\n\nThe Housewife switches to her mommy voice.\n\n\n\n                       THE HOUSEWIFE\n             Hey baby, how was school?\n\nThe Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the\ncondition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a\nbar room brawl.\n\n\n\n                        LITTLE GIRL\n             Mommy, what happened to you and the\n             T.V.

The Bride re-sheaths her\nSOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the\ndrawer.\n\nThe Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife\npours both of them coffee.\n\n                    THE HOUSEWIFE\n          Cream and sugar?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Both, please.\n\nAs The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's\nVOICEOVER ON THE SOUNDTRACK:\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          This Pasadena homemaker's name is\n          Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.\n          Lawrence Bell. But back when we\n          were acquainted, five years ago,\n          her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her\n          code name, was \"COBRA\"..... Mine\n          was BLACK MAMBA.\n\nThe two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking\ncoffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Were you expecting me?\n\n\n\n                    VERNITA\n          Yes and no. Bill got in touch with\n          me right after you woke up, and\n          then again a little later after\n          your episode in Japan.\n              (pause)\n          So I suppose it's a little late for\n          a apology, huh?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          You suppose correctly.\n\n\n\n                    VERNITA\n          Even if I was sincere?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Oh. I'm quite positive you're\n          sorry, now.\n\nVernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with\nlow volume;\n\n                    VERNITA\n          Look bitch, I need to know if\n          you're gonna start anymore shit\n          around my baby girl!\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          You can relax for now. I'm not\n          going to murder you in front of\n          your daughter.\n\n\n\n                    VERNITA\n          That's being more rational than\n          Bill led me to believe you were\n          capable of.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Well that's a demonstration of\n          Bill's complete ignorance when it\n          comes to the subject of me, and\n          what I'm thinking, and what I might\n          do. It's mercy, compassion, and\n          forgiveness I lack, not\n          rationality.\n\nShe pauses for effect -- the ham.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          I'll wait for now, but I won't wait\n          for long.

I have to fix Nikki's\n          cereal.\n\nAs they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl\nfor her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Bill said you were one of the best\n          ladies he'd ever seen with an edged\n          weapon.\n\nVernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a\nbox of the sugar cereal, \"Kaboom.\"\n\n\n\n                    VERNITA\n          Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't\n          qualify it, so you can just kiss my\n          motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.\n              (snorts to herself)\n          Black Mamba, I shoulda been\n          motherfuckin Black Mamba.\n\nAs the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand\ninside the cereal box.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Weapon of choice? And if you want\n          to stick with your butcher knife,\n          I'm cool with that.\n\n\n\n                    VERNITA\n          Very funny.\n\nVernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The\nBride....\n\n.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS\nthe coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO\nSMITHEREENS.\n\nThe Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR....\n\nVernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES\nagain...\n\n...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...\n\n...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her\nback, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT\nINTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and\nthe kitchen counter.\n\nWhile her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to\nthe SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's\ngrip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH\nTHE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel\nentering Vernita's abdomen.\n\nThe table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker\npinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.\n\n\n\n                       VERNITA\n             Sorry, bout the bushwhack.

The little girl sees her\nmother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she\nsees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife\nstill in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The\nlittle girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her\nstare.\n\nAs she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already\nstained    with blood white handkerchief with the name \"BILL\"\nsewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood\noff her    blade.\n\n\n\n                       THE BRIDE\n             It was not my intention to do this\n             in front of you. For that I'm\n             sorry. But you can take my word for\n             it, your mother had it coming. When\n             you grow up, if you still feel raw\n             about it, I'll be waiting.\n\nAnd with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride\nwalks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to\nher mourning.\n\n\n\nEXT.

She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she\nmakes here getaway.\n\nShe climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words\n\"Pussy Wagon\" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a\npimpy font.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (THE BRIDE'S FLOOR) - NIGHT\n\nWe see a HOSPITAL ORDERLY'S bright red and white Reeboks\nsoftly slapping against the smooth surface of the\ninstitution's floor.

She throws    herself back down\non the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room.\nThey see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in\nher bed in her coma.\n\nShe duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare.\nExcept knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of\nher, creates a slightly different effect.\n\nThe Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for\nwhat they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when\nThe Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE\nBILL'S FACE COMPLETELY.\n\nThe Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her\nhospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind\nof a \"TA-DA\" presentation of her vagina.\n\n\n\n                    THE ORDERLY\n          Now is that the cutest little\n          blonde pussy you ever saw, or is\n          that the cutest little blonde\n          pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW?\n\nTrucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren)\nfronts.\n\n\n\n                    WARREN\n          I seen better.\n\nCU The BRIDE\nEYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being\nexhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her\ntrying-to-be expressionless face, \"I've seen a fuck load\nbetter than you, fatass.\"\n\n\n\n                    THE ORDERLY\n          Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I\n          know damn well this is the best\n          pussy you ever saw you had touchin\n          rights to. The price is seventy\n          five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you\n          gittin your freak on or what?\n\nThe Truckers pay the bill of fare.\n\nAs The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the\nrules;\n\n\n\n                    THE ORDERLY\n          Here's the rules; Rule    number one;\n          no punchin 'er.\n          Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got\n          'er a shiner - or less    some teeth,\n          jig's up. So no knuckle    sandwiches\n          under no circumstances.    And by the\n\n          way, this little cunt's a spitter -\n          it's a motor reflex thing but spit\n          or no, no punchin. Now are we\n          absolutely positively clear about\n          rule number one?\n\n\n\n                    TWO TRUCKERS\n          Yeah.\n\n\n\n                    THE ORDERLY\n          Rule number two;\n          No monkey bites, no hickeys - in\n          fact no leavin no marks of no kind.\n          But after that, it's allll goooood.\n          Her plummin down there don't work\n          no more, so feel free to cum in 'er\n          all ya wont. Keep the noise down -\n          try not to make a mess, and I'll be\n          back in twenty.\n\nThe Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and\nturns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline\nin the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren.\n\n\n\n                     THE ORDERLY\n          Oh by the way, not all the time,\n          but sometimes this cunt's cunt can\n          get drier than a bucket of sand.\n          If she dry, lube up with this and\n          you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT,\n          gentlemen.\n\nAnd with that, The Orderly's gone.\n\nThe BRIDE'S POV:\nAs soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren\nbegins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly.\nWhile he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV\nBLINKS.\n\n\n\n                    GERALD\n          Hey Warren, she just blinked.\n\n\n\n                    WARREN\n          He said she can't blink.\n\n\n\n                    GERALD\n          I know what he said, I'm tellin ya\n\n          she just did.\n\nWarren drops his Levi's to his ankles.\n\n\n\n                    WARREN\n          Just wait, when I get through with\n          this little dumbbell, she gonna\n          stand up and recite the Gettysburg\n          Ad-dress.\n\nWarren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride.\nBefore he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald.\n\n\n\n                    WARREN\n          Hey, Gerald.\n\n\n\n                    GERALD\n          Yeah?\n\n\n\n                    WARREN\n          This shit ain't no peep show.

HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT\n\nGerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door.\n\nTHEN...\n\nHe hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE\nA BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says;\n\n                    GERALD\n          He man, keep it down in there, I\n          can hear your ass out here.\n\nMore falsetto SCREAMS behind the door...\n\nTHEN...\n\nThe HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected.\n\n\n\nINT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nGerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His\nbuddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The\nBride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma.\n\nHe moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose\nBride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the\nfront of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the\nI.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT\nAROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into\nscrambled eggs a la The BRIDE.\nShe tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor.\n\nThe BRIDE\nupon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last\nfive years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the\nbloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and\ntries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE\nCRASH BELOW FRAME.\n\nThe Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work.\nWhich means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning\ntop half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl\nto do?\n\n\n\nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nThe elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out.\n\nBACK TO The BRIDE\nShe hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room...\nSTEP...STEP...STEP...\n\nShe sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached\nto his belt. Her hands removes it.\n\nThe Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red\nReeboks slapping against the smooth floor.\n\nCU The BRIDE\nShe SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU.\n\nThe Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.\n\nThe ORDERLY'S POV:\nHe sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead\nTruckers on the floor, and no Bride.\n\n\n\n                       ORDERLY\n          Oh shit!\n\nWE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past\nshirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE\nThe BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his\nankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He\nsteps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and\nSLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons.\n\nThe STANDING ORDERLY\nlets out a \"YELP,\" adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME.\n\nIMPACT CUT\nThe Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned.\n\nThe BRIDE (Confined to the floor)\ncrawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor,\nplacing his melon head between the door and the door frame.\nThen taking the door in her right hand.\n\n                                 SLAM!\n\n                                 SLAM!\n\n                                 SLAM!\n\nSLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR\nFRAME.\n\nThe ORDERLY\nlies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in\nboth excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind,\nsince at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at\nThe comatose Bride asking him questions.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Where's Bill?\n\n\n\n                       THE ORDERLY\n                 (hurt and confused)\n          Who?\n\n                                 SLAM!\n\nHe screams.\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Bill! Where is Bill!\n\n\n\n                    THE ORDERLY\n          I dunno no Bill.\n\n                           SLAM!\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          I saw him here myself.....\n              SLAM!\n          ....Now do you tell me where he is,\n          or do I beat your fuckin brains in?\n\n                           SLAM!\n\n\n\n                    THE ORDERLY\n          Please please stop, don't hit me\n          again!\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Where is Bill?\n\n                           SLAM!\n\nSuddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck,\nthat she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill. She snatches it\nfrom around his neck.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Where did you get this from?\n\n\n\n                    THE ORDERLY\n          That's mine.\n\n                           SLAM!\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Bullshit! I saw Bill wearing it in\n          this room ten minutes ago.\n\n                           SLAM!\n\nThen The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the\nOrderly's hand - one spelling \"B.U.C.K.\" on each finger of\n\nhis left hand. And another spelling \"F.U.C.K.\" on the fingers\nof his right.\n\nThe Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she\ndoes this A SPECIAL THEME MUSIC WILL PLAY (We'll call it her\nREMEMBERING THEME).\n\nWE DO A    QUICK SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM INTO HER EYES -\nWe see    Buck enter her room that first night, five years\nago....    He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights\nyou use    in a tent when camping. -- It gives off a soft blue\nlight.    Buck examines The Bride through the blue.\n\n\n\n                       BUCK\n             Well, ain't you the slice of cutie\n             pie they all said you wuz. Well\n             Ma'am, I'm from Longview Texas, my\n             name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.\n\nHe starts to unbuckle his belt.\n\nWE ZOOM OUT OF HER EYES INTO A CU. The REMEMBERING THEME CUTS\nOFF. She looks down at Buck and says;\n\n\n\n                       THE BRIDE\n             Your name's Buck, right? And you\n             came to fuck, right?\n\nA \"how the fuck does she know look,\" crosses his face.\n\nThe Bride looks down at him....The VENGEANCE THEME BEGINS\nPLAYING LOUDLY ON The SOUNDTRACK, and the VEIN IN HER\nFOREHEAD BECOMES PRONOUNCED and begins to PULSATE IN TIME\nWITH The MUSIC. Every time The Bride comes face to face with\na tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid\nmovie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic\nanticipation of the carnage to come...\n\n...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this\nLongview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land.\n\nShe searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown\nwallet that says on it, \"BIG    EL PASO    PIMPIN,\" loaded with\nlettuce. She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup\ntruck key chain that has the    words,    \"Pussy Wagon\" on it\nwritten in a pimpy font. She    gathers    up all these items, and\nGerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly\nuniform.\n\n\n\nINT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\nThe elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot\nopen, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a\nwheelchair.\n\nShe wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her\narms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars,\nlooking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops.\n\nWhat made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4\nhard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side,\nand the words, \"PUSSY WAGON,\" written along the flat-bed\nhatch door. Pimpy font.\n\nThe Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand.\n\nEX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns.\n\nEX CU TRUCK DOOR LOCK POPS UP OPEN.\n\n\n\nINT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT\n\nThe Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup\ntruck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away.\n\nIt rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES.\n\nNow The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat.\nSeemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's\nstill stuck hiding in the hospital.    And until she regains\nfull use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin\nanywhere or doin anything.\n\nLying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the\ndoor, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her,\nher two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky,\nthe Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her\nstrength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.\n\nSLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....\n\nSLOW ZOOM INTO HER FACE....\n\nSLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....\n\nSLOW ZOOM INTO FACE.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n              (monotone)\n          Wiggle your big toe.\n\nToe doesn't move an inch.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Wiggle your big toe.\n\nIt doesn't move.\n\n                          THE BRIDE\n                Wiggle your big toe.\n                    (VOICE OVER)\n                As I lay in the back of Buck's\n                pickup truck, trying to will my\n                limbs out of entropy, I could see\n                the faces of the cunts who did this\n                to me, and the dick responsible.\n                Members all of Bill's brainchild;\n                \"The Deadly Viper Assassination\n                Squad.\"\n\n\n\nTITLE SEQUENCE\n\nFor what looks like a 60's television show about an ALL-GIRL\nHIT SQUAD, complete with its own LALO SHIFFRIN THEME MUSIC.\nAgainst a BRIGHT ORANGE BACKGROUND, A SNAKE WITH SIX HEADS\n(All different breeds), DONE IN A COOL BUT LOW-BUDGET SPEED\nRACER-STYLE OF ANIMATION, rears its heads to strike.\n\nThe    IMAGE    FREEZES...

Both girls are\ndressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid\nskirts and matching blazers.\n\nFLASH ON\nEX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's)\n\nOn her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE.\n\nFLASH ON\nEX CU OF AN EYEBALL\n\nThe bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits,\nwhite shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes,\nare her soldiers, \"The CRAZY 88.\"\n\nFLASH ON\nEX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move\nblonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way.\n\nAnd finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans\nKato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL.\n\nThey're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a\njoke in Japanese.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          The mop tops in black suits and\n          Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers,\n          \"The Crazy 88.\" The two young girls\n          in the schoolgirl uniforms are her\n          personal bodyguards, the Yubari\n          sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go\n          Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady\n          who's dressed like she's a villain\n          on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend\n          and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And\n          finally, the American in the black\n          suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's\n          head of security, Mr. Barrel.\n\nSUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest,\nher head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's\nlistening to The Bride's narration.\n\nThe Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE --\n\nO-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe\nand THROWS IT in the direction of the sound.\n\nCU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono\non the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.\nThe DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost\ntaking off the tip of her nose in the process.\n\nINSERT: DART EMBEDS ITSELF IN A WOOD POST.\n\nO-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a\nhalt. Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to\nretrieve the eavesdropper.\n\n\n\nINT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\nThe white paper door to O-Ren's dining room SLAMS OPEN. Yuki\nand Go Go step into the corridor.\n\nAll trace of the Bride has vanished.\n\nThey look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal.\n\nWhoever was there is gone now.\n\nGo Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the\nYubari sisters go back into the private dining room, SLAMMING\nthe door behind them.\n\nONE SHOT\n\nCU The BRIDE\nat the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. She\nobserves all the activity by O-Ren's private dining room.\nWhen the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off\nher barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the\nparking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door.\nTakes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece\nyellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides,\nlike the one Bruce Lee wears in \"Game of Death.\" She tosses\nthe kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo\nsword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her\nback inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren\ndining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open\nthe door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to\nthe bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki\nleaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the\nbathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce\nLee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.\n\n                                                 END OF SHOT\nBACK AND FORTH\nbetween CU's of the two women, face to face.\n\n\n\n                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)\n               (to Bride)\n           Can I help you?\n\n\n\n                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)\n           Yes, I am looking for the attorney\n           of O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would\n           that be you?\n\n\n\n                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)\n           I'm Mistress Ishii's attorney. How\n           can I help you?\n\nThe Bride PUNCHES her in the face.\n\n\n\nINT. O-REN'S PRIVATE ROOM\n\nAside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the\nTokyo underworld - Mistress O-Ren Ishii - and her private\narmy doing when we cut back?\n\nSinging karaoke, of course.\n\nIt's Crazy 88 MIKI's turn at the mike and he's having a whale\n\nof a good time singing Dionne Warwick's \"Walk On By,\" in\nJapanese....\n\nWHEN...\n\nA COMMOTION is heard being made by the restaurant staff and\nthe other patrons, from the other side of the white paper\nwall...Just as they all start to notice it, they hear;\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (O.S., JAPANESE)\n          O-Ren Ishii! You and I have\n          unfinished business!\n\nThe Crazy 88 spring to their feet. One slides open the door.\n\nThey see O-Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle\nof the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand\ngripped around a post. She has a terrified look on her face.\nBefore anybody on O-Ren's side of the room can say anything\n...The Bride steps out from behind Sofie.\n\nO-REN'S\nreaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned\nout to be. She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's\nBLEEPED OUT.\n\nThe Bride\nThe VENGEANCE THEME BURSTS ON THE SOUNDTRACK...The Vein on\nher forehead begins to pulsate. WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS\nZOOM INTO HER EYES. A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren\nbeating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS\nSUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES. The FLASHBACK DISSOLVES, we ZOOM\nBACK INTO A CU, the vein stops pulsating, and the theme STOPS\nPLAYING OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, LEAVING A CLEAN, COLORFUL CU of\nThe Bride loaded for bear.\n\nShe raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the\nShoulder with one stroke.\n\nSOFIE\nSpewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in\nagony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes\nof Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both\nsurprise and shock.\n\nThe CRAZY 88\nrun out into the dining area and create a human wall between\nthemselves and their Mistress.\n\nMR. BARREL AND GO GO\ntake positions on either side of O-Ren.\n\nO-REN\nseated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet.\n\n\n\n                    O-REN (JAPANESE)\n\n          You bastard!\n\nThe Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's\nblood flies off the blade.\n\nThe entire floor of the dining room lies between the two\nwarring parties.\n\n\n                          The Bride\n                             vs.\n                         The Crazy 88\n\nThe restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in\nfear.\n\nO-Ren says loudly to the room;\n\n\n\n                    O-REN (JAPANESE)\n          Sorry everybody, but I'm afraid\n          we're going to have to close the\n          place. There's some private\n          business that we must attend to\n          now.\n\nThe Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits.\n\nThe Bride, The Crazy 88, and O-Ren hold    their ground without\nmoving a muscle, till the dining room,    as well as the entire\nrestaurant known as \"The House of Blue    Leaves,\" is deserted\nof every human not engaged in the face-   off that precedes\ncombat.\n\nO-Ren gives a simple order;\n\n\n\n                    O-REN\n          Miki.\n\nMIKI, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward,\nunsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde.\n\n\n\n                    MIKI (JAPANESE)\n          You had it coming bastard!\n\nRaising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming A\nBanzai Scream...\n\nThe Bride turns to face him.\n\nMiki Charging and Screaming...\n\nThe Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking\nPosition.\n\nMiki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her.\n\nThe Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to\narrive.\n\nMiki arrives at his destination, he Swings...\n\nThe Bride Swings...\n\nThe Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half. Miki\nlooks down at the impotent weapon in his hand.\n\nThe Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then\nLifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air.\n\nMiki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end\nof a spear. Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in\nthe B.G.\n\nO-Ren and her crew watch stunned.\n\nThe Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that\nstarts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge\nblue splash. Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish -\nRed blood - Dead man.\n\nThe BRIDE\nlooks up from the pond, across the length of the    floor, into\nthe eyes of O-Ren Ishii.\nShe takes one step forward, hears the slightest    noise, Twirls\nthe samurai sword in the air once, drops to one    knee, and\nthrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-   covered\nfloor. The sword sticks in the floor half way...\n\nThe Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor...\n\nOVERHEAD SHOT\nLooking down on The    Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew\nat the other. A Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried\nin the floor...The    red circle grows larger...and larger...and\nlarger...and larger    still...\n\nLeaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking\nstraight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee,\nand straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo\nunderworld.\n\nO-Ren\nher eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;\n\n\n\n                    O-REN (JAPANESE)\n          Tear the bitch apart!\n\nThe six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same\ntime with a GREAT SOUND EFFECT.\n\nThey circle the Bride.\n\nThe BRIDE\nInside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her. She Whips\nthe sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in\nfront of her. Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel.\n\nHolding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see\nreflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her.\n\nThe six Crazy 88 Attack...\n\nThe BRIDE\ndoes a Zatoichi-like SWISH-SLASH-SWISH with her steel blade.\n\nFour boys die an    immediate samurai blade-inflicted death,\nSCREAMING GRUNT,    TWITCHING BODY, FROZEN IN THE STANCE IT WAS\nSLASHED IN, RED    BLOOD SQUIRTING FROM WOUNDS, THEN A CRASHING\nCOLLAPSE TO THE    FLOOR.\n\nThe last two put up more of a fight...but then one of them is\nSLASHED and FALLS and the last one is SLASHED AND CRASHES\nTHROUGH the restaurant's big picture window.\n\nEX CU The EYES\nof The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet,\n\n...BEAT\n\n...they Look back up at O-Ren.\n\nO-REN\nstanding in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow.\n\nThe BRIDE\nswipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead\nattackers flies off.\n\nGO GO and MR. BARREL\nunsheath their swords.\n\nWHEN...\n\nWe hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then\nbehind her, through the broken pictures window we see\nseventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the\nriders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry\nsamurai swords.\n\nThe BRIDE\nlooks from the reinforcements to O-Ren.\n\nO-REN\nsmiles.\n\n\n\n                     O   -REN (ENGLISH)\n              (to the     Bride)\n          You didn't     think it was going to be\n          that easy,     did you?\n\n                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)\n              (to O-Ren)\n          You know, for a second there, yeah\n          I did.\n\nO-Ren smiles...\n\n\n\n                    O-REN (ENGLISH)\n          Silly rabbit...\n\nBoth O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,...\n\n\n\n                    O-REN/THE BRIDE\n          ...Trix Are for kids.\n\nThis is something they used to say back when they fought\nalongside of each other as \"Vipers.\"\n\nThe seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the\nrestaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride.\n\nAs a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE\nSOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western\nStand-off.\n\nWe do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround\nthe yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one\nJUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE\nIRON over his head.\n\nAs the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of\nThe Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword\nHandles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc...\n\n....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point...\n\n...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN\nTIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE\nON SCREEN.\n\nAs she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms\nflailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde\nhair whipping like a whirling dervish....\n...She's a Goddess of War Venus.\n\nNot only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The\nBride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights.\n\nThis explosion of furious violence is punctuated\nCINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the\nfight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning\nthe squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO\nOIL BLACK.\n\nMany members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and\nliberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's\nblade.\n\nSome SPECIFIC MOMENTS\n\nWhile Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang\nout of its holster, and Throws it...\n\n....It Twirls Through the Air...\n\n...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces.\n\nThe Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an\nAttacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's\nOut.\n\nThe Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over\nher to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air,\nAnkles Lock Around The Boy's Neck.\n\nShe throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the\nvise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from\nits sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.\n\nWhile still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her.\nYanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends\nIt Flying in the Charging Man's path...\n\n...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground...\n\n...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he\nfalls flat.\n\nThe Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks\nher legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off.\n\n...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands\noff.\n\nSo while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine\nfoot tall Bride fights with the others.\n\nWhen she's through she brings the blade across the man she's\nperched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the\nBride back to the floor like an alevator.\n\nAs soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders,\nsomersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an\nattacker's legs into his groin.\n\nHe lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free.\n\nONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, \"The Best One.\" He\nTwirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to,\n\"Come get a piece.\"\n\nThe Bride does a screaming charge towards him....\n...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm -\nsteady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to\n\ncollide.....They meet.....\n\nSWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN -\nCLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE -\n\nThey match each other blow for blow, till one makes a\nmistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither\nclashed or blocked, slices off his right arm.\n\n...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the\nfloor.\n\nThe Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of\nhis chest.\n\nOnly half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain\nalive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still\nholding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker,\nbacks up, keeping his body between her and the remaining\nkillers.\n\nLike a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the\naction, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from\nhis chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and\nCrashes to the floor.\n\nThe Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself\nfor their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy\nMetal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top.\nShe Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and\nfeet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped\nover on its shell....\n\nMany black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground.\n\n...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of\nher head, and Pops back up on her feet.\n\nAnd then there were seven.\n\nThe seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved\nout of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the\nfloor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle.\n\nThe Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor,\nlowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In\nrepose.\n\nEX CU The Bride's eyes\npointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE\nFILM. We see her face is splashed with blood.\n\nO-REN\nWHIPS OPEN a red fan.\n\nGO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the\nswitch.\n\nThe room goes dark.\n\nThe Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still\non the floor....\n\n...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she\nbreathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED\nOVER HER FACE.\n\nBreathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in\n(Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) .....\n\nThe Bride rises to her feet...\n\nThe Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a\ncircle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in\nrhythm with the Metal...\n\nThe Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both\nMusic and The Bride Explode!\n\nWIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE\nWith the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers\nfight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow\nfalling outside is reflected against the paper wall like\nblack snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage.\n\nThe eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue\nbackdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and\ndeath. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all\nsword-weilding partners.\n\nShe CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They\nseperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then\nCLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or\nhacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each\nencounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride\ncrouches down low in repose while the others continue to\ncircle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again.\n\nWe Cut in closer whenever we need to.\n\nFinally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's\nsword.\n\nGO GO\nStanding by the junction box, flips a switch turning the\nlights back on. The electricity shines light on...\n\nThe BRIDE\nSplashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls\nand ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded\nmen who have yet to die, litter the ground.\n\nWith a big \"Whoosh\" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's\nsubordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade.\n\nThen saying to the foes who litter the ground.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)\n\n          Those    of you lucky enough to still\n          have    your lives. Take them with\n          you.    But leave the limbs you've\n          lost.    They belong to me now.\n\nThe wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant.\n\nThe yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last\nremaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren\nIshii.\n\nGo Go\nsteps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai\nsword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain.\nShe begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a\nWHOOSH sound in the air.\n\nBALL AND CHAIN\nin a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us.\n\nThe BRIDE\nducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk\nof wood post behind her.\n\nGo Go\neyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she\nlets fly...\n\nThe ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo\nsword...\n\n...Go Go yanks...\n\n...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip.\n\nGO GO\nsmiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...\n\nThe BRIDE\nremoves her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go.\n\nThe BOOMERANG\nTWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go.\n\nBAM\n\nThe young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and\nchain. She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on\nthe floor. She looks    across at her opponent...WHOOSH...\nWHOOSH...WHOOSH..she    LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the\nchest, knocking her    on her back...\n\n...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the\nBride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal\nball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead.\n\nThe weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its\npurpose.\n\nShe hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight.\n\nGo Go hops up on a table...\n\nAs they fight they hop from table to table...\n\nGo Go throws her ball and chain...\n\n...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP...\n\nBATS it away with the table leg.\n\nGo Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around\nthe Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS...\n\n...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL\nCRASHING through another table.\n\nGo Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai\nshort sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it.\n\nThe women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly\nwith struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to\nthe Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams\nas the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she\nrolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the\ntable leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER\nHEAD.\n\nThe girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and\ndelivers a powerful \"C.K.\" to the Bride from below, dropping\nher to her knees.\n\nO-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and\nbegins to strangle.\n\nThe chain digs into the Bride's throat.\n\nThe Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty\nlooking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh.\nThe nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her\nflesh...the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat\nwith them.\n\nGo Go lets out a horrific scream.\n\nThe Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young\ngirl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe\nbecomes stained with red.\n\nGo Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the\nfloor.\n\nThe Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins\nbreathing air into her lungs.\n\nGo Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her...\n\nThe Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's\nweapon above her head.\n\nGo Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second\nfloor...\n\nThe Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the\nball and chain over her head.\n\nGo Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs...\nShe gets to the top.\n\nThe Bride lets loose with the ball and chain...\n\nIt HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari\nsisters, smack DAB in the back of the head.\n\nCU GO GO\nWe see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind\nit. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit\nshatter like a teapot.\n\nLike a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the\nstaircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before\nthe tumble began.\n\nThe Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go\nto the last two remaining combatants...\n\n...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)\n          Any more subordinates for me to\n          kill, O-Ren?\n\nMr. Barrel says;\n\n\n\n                    MR.

O'Boyle didn't know was,\n             the real game was just beginning.\n             Bill was on the job, and she was\n             the target. Now Bill was the\n             greatest assassin of the 20th\n             century. In fact the term HITMAN\n             was coined for him. And he rarely\n             performs actual assassinations\n             anymore. However every once in\n             awhile - to keep his hand in - he\n             does. Only he plays a game. He\n             doesn't start big trouble...he lets\n             them start it. If they do, they're\n             dead. If they don't, not only won't\n             he perform, he'll take the hit off\n             the market. It's kind of fun\n             watching people gamble when they\n             don't know they're gambling, isn't\n             it?\n\nThey hear the elevator in the hall.\n\nL.F. O'Boyle tells her men;\n\n\n\n                       L.F.\n             Get my money back. Don't kill him.\n             Chop off all his fingers.\n\nAlburt smiles.\n\nThe Five men go out the door.\n\n\n\nINT. HALLWAY HOTEL\n\nThe Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to\nsee....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the\nend.\n\nThis wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.\n\nHe Charges at them.\n\nIn the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His\nmastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts\nthrough    the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,\nis the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's\nblade.\n\n\n\nINT. HOTEL ROOM\n\nL.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the\nfront door.\n\nShe sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for\nthat matter, to step through the doorway.\n\nWHEN...\n\nThe window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black\ngloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and\nYANKS her out the window.\n\n\n\nEXT.

Then places a baseball cap on the top of her\nnoggin that reads, \"STUBB'S BAR B-Q.\" She steps out of the\ntruck's cab.

MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY\n\nWe see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China.\nA SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH:\n\n\n                \"SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA\"\n\nA VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this\nlandscape;\n\n\n\n                       BILL (V.O.)\n             Once upon a time in China, some\n             believe around the year, one-double\n             knot-three.\n\nAs Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by\nfootage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the\n70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as\nthe old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian \"PAI MEI.\"\n\n                     BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)\n          ...head priest of The White Lotus\n          Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the\n          road, contemplating whatever a man\n          with Pai Mei's infinite power would\n          contemplate -- Which is another way\n          of saying, who knows. When, a\n          Shaolin monk appeared on the road\n          traveling in the opposite\n          direction. As the monk and the\n          priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --\n          in a practically unfathomable\n          display of generosity, gave the\n          monk the slightest of nods. The\n          nod, was not returned. Was it the\n          intention of the Shaolin monk to\n          insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just\n          fail to see the generous social\n          gesture?\n          The motives of the monk, remain,\n          unknown. What is known, were the\n          consequences. The next morning Pai\n          Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,\n          and demanded that the temple's head\n          Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to\n          repay the insult. The Abbot, at\n          first, tried to console Pai Mei,\n          only to find, Pai Mei was\n          inconsolable. So began, the\n          massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and\n          all sixty of the monks inside, at\n          the fists of the White Lotus. And\n          so began, the legend of Pai Mei's\n          Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart\n          Technique.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)\n          What praytell, is a ten-point palm -\n          exploding heart technique?\n\n\n\n                    BILL (V.O.)\n          Quite simply, the deadliest blow in\n          all of the martial arts. He hits\n          you with his fingertips, at ten\n          different pressure points on your\n          body. And then, he lets you walk\n          away. But once you've taken five\n          steps, your heart explodes inside\n          your body, and you fall to the\n          floor dead.\n\nWe see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five\nshaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then\n\nfall to the floor dead.\n\n\n\nEXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY\n\nBill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through\nthe mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Did he teach you that?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          No. He teaches no one the ten-point\n          palm - exploding heart technique.\n          But he is Nietzsche's psalm\n          personified. If Pai Mei doesn't\n          kill you, he will make you\n          stronger. Now one of the things I\n          always liked about you, Kiddo, is\n          you appear wise beyond your years.\n          Then allow me to impart, a word to\n          the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -\n          Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash\n          him - even for an instant - a\n          defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.\n          And if you throw any American sass\n          his way, he will snap your back and\n          your neck like they were twigs, and\n          that will be the story of you.\n\n\n\nEXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY\n\nThe Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of\nthe Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White\nLotus Mountain.\n\nFor over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the\nWhite Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The\ntemple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But\nnow - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All\nthe priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,\nwho once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some\nfeared as a devil...neither was wrong.\n\nA huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill\nleading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          He'll accept you as his student.\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Caught him in a good mood, aye?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          More like a sadistic one.\n\nShe climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.\n\nBill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Just seeing those steps again makes\n          me ache. You're gonna have plenty\n          of fun carrying buckets of water up\n          and down that fucker.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Why did he accept me?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Because he's a very very very old\n          man. And like all rotten bastards,\n          when they get old, they become\n          lonely. Not that that has any\n          effect on their disposition. But\n          they do learn the value of company.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          When will I see you again?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          That's the title of my favorite\n          soul song of the Seventies.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          What?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Nothing.

Now remember, no backtalk, no\n          sarcasm.\n          Least not for the first year.\n          You're going to have to let him\n          warm up for you. He hates\n          Caucasians, despises Americans, and\n          has nothing but contempt for women,\n          so in your case, that may take a\n          little while. Adios.\n\nZOOM...\n\nThe jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all\nalone, somewhere in the middle of China.\n\nShe begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps\nto Pai Mei.\n\n\n\nINT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE\n\nThe huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred\nyears ago, except now it's empty and dusty.\n\nThe Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin\nsteps.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n              (yelling)\n          Hello!\n\nHer Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple.\n\nPAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back;\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)\n          Up the stairs, yankee woman!\n\nA beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's\nprivate chamber.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n              (to herself)\n          More stairs, Jesus Christ.\n\nThe still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back;\n\n                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)\n          If it is Christ you seek, turn back\n          now.\n\nShe climbs the wooden staircase.\n\n\n\nINT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER\n\nPAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a\nsheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting\narea. The Bride enters the room.\n\nShe approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting\narea in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her\nhead.\n\n* From here on end, whenever ENGLISH is spoken     by The Bride,\nor every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be     spoken in\nENGLISH IN LIVE SYNCH SOUND. However, whenever     MANDARIN is\nsupposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths     as DUBBED\nENGLISH like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky     Flick.\n\n\n\n                     THE BRIDE *\n          Teacher, I am unworthy to be your\n          student --\n\nPai Mei is still unseen.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI'S VOICE *\n          Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't\n          understand a single word you say.\n          It causes my ears discomfort. You\n          are not to speak unless spoken to.\n          Do you understand Mandarin any\n          better than you speak it?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE *\n          I speak Japanese very well --\n\n\n\n                    PAI    MEI'S VOICE *\n          I didn't ask    if you speak Japanese,\n          or Mongolian,    for that matter. I\n          asked if you    understand Mandarin?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE *\n\n          A little, I am still learning.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI'S VOICE *\n          You are here to learn the mysteries\n          of Kung Fu, not linguistics. If you\n          can't understand me, I will\n          communicate with you like I would a\n          dog. When I yell, when I point,\n          When I beat you with my stick!\n\nHer head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.\n\nWE CUT TO PAI MEI\nHe's just like he was in the films earlier. Long White Hair,\nLong White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing\nWhite Robe. Everything's the same, except he's older, by\nabout a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting\narea on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          Bill is your master, is he not?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE *\n          Yes, he is.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          Your master tells me you're not\n          entirely unschooled. What training\n          do you possess?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE *\n          I am proficient in a combination of\n          Tiger and Crane style. And I am\n          more than proficient in the\n          exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n              (he makes a SNORTING\n               SOUND)\n          The exquisite art of the samurai\n          sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so\n          called exquisite art, is only fit\n          for Japanese fat heads. You really\n          are a silly ass.\n\nThis brings up The Bride's eye...She GLARES at the old man.\n\n                     PAI MEI *\n           Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!\n\nShe lowers her eyes.\n\n\n\n                     THE BRIDE *\n           I'm sorry master --\n\n\n\n                     PAI MEI *\n           -- Silence! I do not wish to hear\n           your unintelligible excuses.\n\nPause...\n\nTHEN...\n\nPai Mei softly LAUGHS to himself, and strokes his long white\nbeard...\n\n\n\n                     PAI MEI *\n           Your anger amuses me. Do you\n           believe you are my match?\n\n\n\n                       THE BRIDE *\n           No.\n\n\n\n                     PAI MEI *\n           Are you aware I kill at will?\n\n\n\n                       THE BRIDE *\n           Yes.\n\n\n\n                     PAI MEI *\n           Is it your wish to die?\n\n\n\n                       THE BRIDE *\n           No.\n\n\n\n                     PAI MEI *\n           Then you must be stupid. Rise\n           stupid, and let me get a better\n\n             look at your ridiculous face.\n\nShe rises.\n\nCU The BRIDE\nthrough the scrim, eyes down.\n\nPai Mei laughs to himself again;\n\n\n\n                       PAI MEI *\n             You breathe hard. The one hundred\n             steps robbed you of your wind. So\n             your stupidity is matched only by\n             your weakness. Is there anything\n             you do well? -- Oh yes, you speak\n             Japanese. I despise the Goddamn\n             Japs. I would of thought an\n             American would be immune to their\n             pompous posturing. Apparently I was\n             wrong. Go to that drawer.\n\nThe blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. She opens the\ndrawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged\nweapon.\n\n\n\n                       PAI MEI *\n             Remove the sword.\n\nThe Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.\n\nPai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,\nparts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.\n\n\n\n                       PAI    MEI *\n             Let's see how    good you really are.\n             Try and land    a blow. If you land a\n             single blow,    I'll bow down and call\n             you master.\n\nThe Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with\nthe sword.\n\nHe deftly moves out of the way.\n\nThe fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,\nwith Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.\n\nQuick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of\nEffort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out\nof the sword's path.\n\nHe's amused, and Speaks while they fight;\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          Come now woman, can't you even hit\n          an old man?\n\nShe tries more...\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          Your ability really is quite poor.\n\nHe STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an\nopen palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.\nShe clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.\n\nPai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought\n          cripples who posed more of a\n          challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!\n\nShe ATTACKS with a wild cat's fury.\n\nHe HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.\n\nHe LEAPS HIGH UP IN THE AIR, and LANDS STANDING on the Blade\nof her Sword.\n\nThe Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe\nit.\n\nPai Mei smiles at her and says;\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          From here you can get an excellent\n          view of my foot.\n\nHe does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the\nface in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD\nWALL.\n\nThe Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.\n\nPai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his\nhand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling\nSTOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          Give up? Or care to try again?\n\nThe BRIDE'S FACE\nshows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,\n\nthat she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly\namazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to\nquit, and through not quitting, she's determined to\ndistinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.\n\nShe takes the sword from him and tries again.\n\nBut this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the\nsword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young\ngirl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other\narm...Poised to cut it Off.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          That blade's sharp. Careful not to\n          cut off your own arm.\n\n...Then he TWISTS her arm, till the blade's against her own\nthroat....\n\n...Then TWISTS again till it's against her hip...\n\n...Then TWISTS again while KICKING her leg, till the blade's\nedge is against her thigh...\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          If you can't fight any better than\n          that, what use do you have for a\n          leg?\n\nHe lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...\n\n...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the\nstomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between\nher legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          Now that really would be a shame.\n\nHe takes the sword from her grasp...\n\nSWINGS once...\n\nThe BLADES's against her jugular.\n\nHe SWINGS twice...\n\nThe BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.\n\nHe SWINGS a third time...\n\nThe BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          Your swordsmanship is amateur at\n          best.\n\nHe tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the\nblade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on\nthe top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls\nto the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          I'm a hundred and fifty years old,\n          and you can't even make me break a\n          sweat.\n\nHe CHOPS the sword in half with his hand.\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          Let's see your Tiger and Crane\n          style match my Eagles's Claw.\n\nAgain she ATTACKS...again he eludes.\n\nLike a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal\nstyle martial arts dance.\n\nAs she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;\n\n\n\n                    PAI MEI *\n          ...pathetic.....terrible...you\n          idiot, you should've landed that\n          blow...you call that crane?...\n          Enough, I grow bored.\n\nWith little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her\nwrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in\nthe air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers.

In\nJAPANESE he explains to her his reason for being there.\n\nEX CU The BRIDE'S EYE\n...watching...we now leave any shot of Bill not from the\nBride's perspective.

But one thing I\n          learned from all three, was \"in\n          combat, the opponent that does the\n          unexpected, can usually expect to\n          be the victor.\" Bill would never\n          see this coming. Not from me. And\n          least any of you judge me a\n          bushwhacker, remember...It was Bill\n          who taught me how to shoot.\n\nAs the Bride has said these things, WE'VE seen    INSERTS of her\nputting together her high-powered scope rifle.    Snapping on\nthe scope sight. Setting the FOCUS through the    CROSSHAIRS.\nLoading the heavy-duty AMMO.

It comes in a lot of\n          different flavors and colors, and\n          it's really good. Maybe we should\n          fix some sometime. Want to do that?\n\nThe little girl gives a big nod, yes.\n\n\n\n                     BILL\n          Speaking of fixing and drinking and\n          eating, I think it's dinner time\n          don't you?\n\nB.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n              (to Mommy)\n          When you were doin all that fancy\n          shootin, you didn't happen to shoot\n          a nice Mexican woman about forty\n          five years old, did ya?\n\n\n\n                    MOMMY\n          No.\n\n\n\n                     BILL\n              (wiping imaginary sweat\n               off his brow)\n          Whew, then dinner should be done.\n              (shouting to the other\n               room)\n          Josephina! You can come out now,\n          we're ready for dinner.\n\n\n\n                    JOSEPHINA (O.S.)\n          Yes, Mr. Bill.\n\nHe offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then\nsays to B.B.;\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Want to go on top of the world?\n\nShe says excitedly;\n\n\n\n                      B.B.\n          Yeah!\n\nHe scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and\nas the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through\nthe house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The\nCarpenter's song, \"Top Of The World.\" It's obviously one of\ntheir songs.\n\n\n\nINT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father\nand daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          B.B., don't you think Mommy has the\n          prettiest hair in the whole wide\n          world?\n\n\n\n                      B.B.\n          Yes I do.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          In fact it's better than pretty.\n          What's better than pretty?\n\n\n\n                      B.B.\n          Gorgeous.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is\n          gorgeous.\n\nThe Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at\n          Daddy.\n\n\n\n                      B.B.\n\nWhy? Where you a bad daddy?\n\n\n\n          BILL\nI'm afraid I was. I was a real bad\ndaddy.\n    (to Mommy)\nOur little girl learned about life\nand death the other day.\n    (to B.B.)\nYou want to tell Mommy about what\nhappened to Emilio?\n\n\n\n          B.B.\nI killed him. I didn't mean to, but\nI stepped on him and he stopped\nmoving.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nEmilio was her goldfish. She came\nrunning into my room holding the\nfish in her hand, crying, \"Daddy\ndaddy, Emilio's dead.\" And I said,\n\"Really, that's so sad. How did he\ndie?\" And what did you say?\n\n\n\n          B.B.\nI stepped on him.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nActually young lady, the words you\nso strategically used were, \"I\naccidentally stepped on him.\"\nRight?\n\n\n\n          B.B.\nYeah.\n\n\n\n           BILL\nTo which I queried, \"And just how\ndid your foot accidentally find its\nway into Emilio's fishbowl?\" And\nshe told me no no no, Emilio was on\nthe carpet when she stepped on him.\n    (beat)\nHummmmmm, the plot thickens. And\njust how did Emilio get on the\n\ncarpet? And Mommy, you would have\nbeen real proud of her, because she\ndidn't lie. She said she took\nEmilio out of his bowl, and put him\non the carpet. And what was Emilio\ndoing on the carpet, baby?\n\n\n\n          B.B.\nHe was -- flapping.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nAnd then you stomped on him?\n\n\n\n           B.B.\nUh-huh.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nAnd when you lifted your foot up,\nwhat was Emilio doing then?\n\n\n\n           B.B.\nNothing.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nHe stopped flapping, didn't he?\n\n\n\n           B.B.\nUh-huh.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nAnd you knew what that meant,\ndidn't you?\n\n\n\n           B.B.\nUh-huh.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nWhat did that mean?\n\n          B.B.\nHe was dead.\n\n\n\n          BILL\n    (to Mommy)\nShe told me later, that the second\nshe lifted up her foot and saw him\nnot flapping, she knew he was dead.\nIs that not the perfect visual\nimage of life and death? A fish\nflapping on the carpet, and a fish\nnot flapping on the carpet. So\npowerful even a five-year old child\nwith no concept of life and death\nknew what it meant. Not only did\nshe know Emilio was dead, she knew\nshe had killed him. So she comes\nrunning into my room, holding\nEmilio in both of her little hands -\nit was so cute - and she wanted me\nto make Emilio better. And I asked\nher, why did she step on Emilio?\nAnd she said, she didn't know. But\nI knew why. You didn't mean to hurt\nEmilio, you just wanted to see what\nwould happen if you stepped on him,\nright?\n\n\n\n          B.B.\nUh-huh.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nAnd what happens when you stomp on\nEmilio, is you kill him. And you\ndiscovered that, didn't you?\n\n\n\n          B.B.\nUh-huh.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nSo we drove down to the beach, had\na little funeral, and gave Emilio a\nburial at sea. And right now I'm\nsure he's happy as can be, swimmin\naround in fish heaven.\nBut the point being, our child\nlearned two very important lessons.\nOne, about life and death. The\nother, somethings once you do, they\n\ncan't be undone. I knew just how\nshe felt\n    (to B.B.)\nYou loved Emilio, didn't you?\n\n\n\n            B.B.\nUh-huh.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nWell sweety, I love Mommy, but I\ndid to Mommy what you did to\nEmilio.\n\n\n\n          B.B.\nYou stomped on Mommy?\n\n\n\n          BILL\nWorse.\n    (making his finger a gun)\nI shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot,\nlike we were just doing. I shot her\nfor real.\n\n\n\n            B.B.\nWhy?\n\n\n\n          BILL\nI don't know.\n\n\n\n          B.B.\nDid you want to see what would\nhappen?\n\n\n\n            BILL\nNo, I   knew what   would happen to\nMommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't\nknow,   is when I   shot Mommy, what\nwould   happen to   me.\n\n\n\n          B.B.\nWhat happened?\n\n                    BILL\n          I was very sad. And that was when I\n          learned, somethings once you do,\n          they can never be undone.\n\n\n\n                    B.B.\n          What happened to Mommy?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Why don't you ask Mommy.\n\n\n\n                    B.B.\n          Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.\n\n\n\n                    B.B.\n          Did it make you sick?\n\n\n\n                    MOMMY\n          It put me to sleep. That's why I\n          haven't been with you B.B., I've\n          been asleep.\n\n\n\n                    B.B.\n          But you're awake now, right?\n\n\n\n                    MOMMY\n          I'm wide awake, pretty girl.\n\n\n\nEXT. PORCH - DAWN\n\nBill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house\ndrinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and\nthe sea.\n\nBeatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps\nacross from him.\n\nBetween them the dawn sky breaks.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Did she go to sleep easy?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          It took her a little bit. She was\n          excited. She's quite the little\n          chatterbox.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Well, if she doesn't like you, you\n          got to kill her to say hello. But\n          if she likes you, you can't shut\n          her up. She's a chip off the ole\n          blonde in that regards.\n\nHe holds up the bottle of vino.\n\n\n\n                      BILL\n          Red wine?\n\nShe shakes her blonde head, no.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more\n          fun with a couple glasses of wine\n          in ya.\n\nShe gives him a look.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n              (pointing towards the\n               beach)\n          We're going to go out there and\n          have at it, aren't we?\n\nShe shakes her blonde head, yes.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Well, I've already had    a glass. So\n          unless you want to win    by an unfair\n          advantage, you should    have a glass\n          of wine. So we're both    on the same\n          footing wine wise.\n\nShe holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          You know, there's an old man down\n          here, his name is Esteban Viharo.\n          He was a pimp. I knew him when I\n          was a child. He was a friend of my\n          mother's. I told him about you.\n          When I showed him your picture he\n          smiles and said;\n              (imitating his accent)\n          \"Yesss, I see the attraction.\" He\n          told me a story about taking me to\n          the movies when I was five. It was\n          a movie which had Lana Turner in\n          it. And whenever she would appear\n          on screen, he said I would stick my\n          thumb in my mouth and suck it, to\n          an obscure amount. And he knew\n          right then, this boy will be a fool\n          for blondes.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Who would of ever thought you'd be\n          such a good father?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Well not you, that's for damn sure.\n\nShe gives him another look.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Must we have to endure your little\n          zingers?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          No we mustn't. But if you're going\n          to say sentences like that, in the\n          future, I will resist the\n          temptation.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Baby, you don't have a future.\n\nBill drinks some wine.\n\n                    BILL\n          I sent you to L.A. and you never\n          came back. I thought you'd been\n          killed. Do you know how cruel it is\n          to make someone think someone they\n          love is dead? I mourned you. Then\n          in the third month of my mourning,\n          I track you down. I wasn't trying\n          to track you down, I was trying to\n          track down - the fucking assholes -\n          who I thought killed you. And when\n          I find you, what to I find? Not\n          only are you not dead, you're\n          getting married - to some fuckin\n          jerk - and you're pregnant? How do\n          you expect me to react?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Why do you think I hid?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Why did you leave in the first\n          place? You have cold eyes towards\n          me now. I understand their\n          temperature, but they were warm the\n          second to the last time I saw them,\n          or was that just my imagination?\n\n\n\n                       THE BRIDE\n          No.\n\nThe Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts\nwill be shown on the screen.\n\nTo give herself a running start with the story she starts it\noff in Japanese;\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)\n          You sent me to L.A. to kill that\n          lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.\n\nBill interrupts her.\n\n\n\n                    BILL (ENGLISH)\n          You are you talking in Japanese?\n\nThe Bride explodes;\n\n          THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)\nWhat the hell do you care what I\ntalk in? Don't you know when to\nkeep your mouth shut? I'm trying to\ntell you what you want to know, if\nyou'll just shut up and listen and\nstop talking! Now may I continue?\n\n\n\n          BILL\nYou're right, I'm wrong, continue.\n\n\n\n          THE BRIDE\nThe morning I left, I threw up. I\ndon't feel like speaking in\nJapanese anymore - on the plane, I\nthrew up. When I got to my hotel, I\nthrew up. So naturally I started\nthinking, maybe I might be\npregnant. So I bought one of those\nhome pregnancy kits. Went back to\nmy room and took the test. The\nlittle strip said blue. I was going\nto have a baby. I tried to call\nyou, but you weren't there, so I\njust thought I'd call back later.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nBut you never did.\n\n\n\n          THE BRIDE\n- Would you shut up, I'm trying to\ntell you how I feel.\n\n\n\n          BILL\nMy apologies, please continue.\n\n\n\n          THE BRIDE\nSo I just figured I'd call you back\nlater. I was just so happy, I put\non music and danced by myself in\nthe hotel suite, holding my little\nblue strip.\nWhat I didn't know, was at some leg\nof my journey, I was spotted. With\nme in Los Angeles it didn't take\nLisa Wong long to figure out\nsomeone put a hit out on her. So\nshe sent an assassin of her own to\n\n          kill me in my hotel room. As I was\n          dancing in euphoria, the killer\n          came down the hall.\n\nThere's a knock on the hotel room door.\n\nThe Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.\n\nPEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt\noutfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.\n\nThe Bride says through the door;\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Hello, can I help you?\n\n\n\n                    HOTEL WOMAN\n          Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the\n          hospitality manager of the hotel. I\n          have a welcome gift from the\n          management.\n\nSeeing it through the peephole.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda\n          busy at this second, could you\n          possibly come back later?\n\nAs she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she\nbends down to pick it up...\n\nWHEN...\n\nA SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the\nbent over woman was previously standing.\n\nKaren kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.\n\nThe Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.\n\nKaren aims the shotgun down at her.\n\nWith her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.\n\nIt SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.\n\nThe Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.\n\nKaren pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES\nthe shotgun The Bride's way.\n\nThe Bride DIVES out of the way.\n\nThe BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.\n\nThe Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,\nand THROWS IT across the room at Karen...\n\nKaren BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade\nsticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,\nand drops it to the floor.\n\nThe Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do\nexcept wait to get shot.\n\n\n\n                    KAREN\n          So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,\n          huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.\n          I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here\n          to kill you.\n\nShe raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Wait a second!\n\nKaren stops.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did\n          come here to kill your sister. But\n          I'm not gonna do that now.\n\n\n\n                    KAREN\n          Oh, I know you're not --\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          - listen to me! I just found out,\n          right now - not two minutes before\n          you blew a hole in the door, I'm\n          pregnant.\n\nKaren looks at her, \"what?\".\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          On that table is the    home pregnancy\n          kit. On the floor by    the door is\n          the strip that says    I'm pregnant.\n          I'm telling you the    truth, I don't\n          want to and I won't    kill your\n          sister. I just want    to go home.\n\n                    KAREN\n          What is this, bullshit story number\n          twelve in the female assassin's\n          handbook?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Any other time you'd be a hundred\n          percent right. But this time you're\n          a hundred percent wrong. I'm the\n          deadliest woman in the world, but\n          right now I'm scared shitless for\n          my baby. Please, you hafta believe\n          me. Look at the strip, it's on the\n          floor.\n\nKaren looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the\nfloor.\n\n\n\n                    KAREN\n          Sit down on that bed and put your\n          hands behind your head.\n\nThe Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off\nthe floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the\ndirections on the box.\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Blue means pregnant.\n\n\n\n                    KAREN\n          I'll read it myself, thank you.\n\nIt is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.\n\n\n\n                     KAREN\n          Okay, say I were to believe you,\n          what then?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Just go home. I'll do the same.\n\nKaren does...She starts backing out of the room...before she\nleaves, she says;\n\n                    KAREN\n          You fucked with the Wong sisters.\n\n\n\nBACK ON THE PORCH\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Facing Karen Wong, was the most\n          frightening moment I have ever\n          experienced. And that includes\n          three years with that evil bastard\n          Pai Mei. Before that strip turned\n          blue, I was a woman, I was your\n          woman. I was a killer, who killed\n          for you. Before that strip turned\n          blue, I would have jumped a\n          motorcycle on to a speeding train\n          ...for you. But once that strip\n          turned blue, I could no longer do\n          any of those things. Not anymore.\n          Because now I was a mother. A\n          mother who only had one thought on\n          her mind. Please don't harm my\n          baby. Can you understand that?\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          Yes. But why tell me now, and not\n          then?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          You wouldn't have let me go.\n          Specially once you found out I was\n          pregnant. You would've tried to\n          talk me out of it. It would have\n          been a big scene. I just said fuck\n          it.\n\nStarting to get mad.\n\n\n\n                       BILL\n          Fuck who?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Bill, you couldn't know I was\n          pregnant, once you knew, you'd\n          claim it, and I didn't want that.\n\n                    BILL\n          That's not your decision to make.\n\n\n\n                     THE BRIDE\n          Yes, but it's the right decision.\n          And I made it for my daughter.\n          Everybody on this earth deserves to\n          start with a clean slate. But with\n          us - my daughter would be born into\n          a world she shouldn't be. Robbing\n          her of the one thing everybody\n          deserves. She would be born with\n          blood stains. I had to choose. I\n          chose her.\n\nShe takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her\nturn.\n\n\n\n                     THE BRIDE\n          You know five years ago, if I had\n          to make a list of impossible things\n          that could never happen.\n          You performing a coup de grace on\n          me by bustin a cap in my crown,\n          would be right at the top of the\n          list.\n              (beat)\n          I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?\n\nBill listens stoney, then;\n\n\n\n                    BILL\n          I'm sorry was that a question? Of\n          impossible things that could never\n          happen - yes in this instance you\n          would have been wrong.\n\nThe Bride listens stoney, then;\n\n\n\n                       THE BRIDE\n          Well?\n\n\n\n                       BILL\n          Well what?\n\n\n\n                    THE BRIDE\n          Explain yourself.\n\n                    BILL\n          I already have.
