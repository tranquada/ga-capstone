TAHOOCHIE BRIDGE - NIGHT\n           \n          A forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of Edge City. We can hear \n          Stanley's car SPUTTERING and POPPING along before it actually \n          pulls into \n          sight on the dark rain-slick street.\n           \n          INT. CAR\n           \n          Stanley drives along in a miserable daze. Suddenly the engine \n          starts KNOCKING violently and the car dies.\n           \n          EXT. BRIDGE\n           \n          Steam HISSES from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop. \n          Stanley GRINDS the ignition key again and again trying futilely \n          to restart the \n          engine.\n           \n          Finally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a \n          SQUEAL of metal, turns and kicks the bumper... which promptly \n          falls off with a \n          resounding CLUNK.\n           \n          Beat.\n           \n          The front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's \n          side door CLATTERS to the ground.\n           \n          Stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless \n          metal... his mind a complete blank.\n           \n          He slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water \n          swirling along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge. A wave of melancholy \n          sweeps over \n          him. Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it \n          drops down... down to the river below.\n           \n          Suddenly, something catches Stanley's eye... a BODY, floating \n          along in the darkness.

He steps on and shatters a \n          discarded mirror, and he ducks under an old ladder that leans \n          against the bridge's foundation as he finally reaches the shore.\n           \n          Stanley splashes into the waist deep water just in time to catch \n          the body as it floats by.\n           \n          CLOSER - BODY\n           \n          As Stanley grabs it, the \"body\" falls to pieces... revealing that \n          it's nothing but a trash bag, an old tire and some floating bits \n          of garbage all \n          clinging to the \"head\": an old wooden Mask.\n           \n          Stanley shakes his head in disgust... some lifesaver.\n           \n          Stanley inspects the Mask more closely; strange ritualistic \n          symbols carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and eerie \n          empty eye holes.\n           \n          The faintest sound of a haunting \"Mask SFX Theme\" rises as \n          Stanley turns the Mask around and inspects the inside... slowly \n          bringing it \n          closer and closer to his face. The surface of the Mask begins to \n          SHIMMER.\n           \n          But then... RIBET! A frog jumps out of it, right into Stanley's \n          face. Stanley nearly loses his footing on the slippery river \n          bottom.\n           \n          Suddenly a blinding SPOTLIGHT shines down from the bridge and an \n          amplified voice calls out from a squad car.\n           \n          POLICEMAN\n          Hey, you!

With a FLASH of steel, he \n          slices straight \n          through Stanley's watch band and snatches the watch.\n           \n          DEATH'S HEAD\n          (holding up his prize)\n          See, I only wanted the time!

Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more \n          violently within the circle of giggling street toughs. He finally \n          breaks free and \n          scrambles to his front door, still reeling with dizziness. He \n          fumbles with the key and SLAMS the door behind him as the Death's \n          Heads roar with \n          laughter.\n           \n          CUT TO:\n           \n          INT.

STANLEY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUES\n           \n          Small, full of books but very neat. A few cherished animation \n          cels from 1940s cartoons are framed on the wall. As Stanley locks \n          the door behind \n          him - he's greeted by MILO, a happy little terrie sized mutt with \n          a big heart.\n           \n          STANLEY\n          Hello, Milo.\n           \n          Milo gets so excited he starts GAGGING and COUGHING.\n           \n          STANLEY (CONT.)\n          Easy, buddy.

The disk sails...\n           \n          OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY\n           \n          Milo runs it down, leaps up, and makes a perfect catch. He trots \n          back to the bedroom, and drops it in Stanley's lap.\n           \n          STANLEY\n          Easy. This is the best part.\n           \n          On the screen a cartoon dog ZZZIPS into frame and drops a \n          frizzing stick of dynamite down a bad guy's pants. KA-BOOM! The \n          dog LAUGHS \n          maniacally.\n           \n          Suddenly there is a POUNDING on the wall that rattles Stanley's \n          framed cartoon cels.\n           \n          STANLEY (CONT.)\n          (calls out)\n          Sorry Mrs. Peenman.\n           \n          With a sigh, he ejects the tape and a much quieter talk show POPS \n          on.

A \n          SUBTLE \n          SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly hops off \n          the bed.\n           \n          We now begin to hear the \"Mask Theme\"... echoes of the POUNDING \n          Viking drums... growing louder. Haunting whispery VOICES seem to \n          call to Stanley as he slowly crosses to the bedside. He picks up \n          the Mask and turns it over in his hands running his fingers \n          across the time \n          work wood. The music builds...\n           \n          He turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the Mask \n          to his face. Milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed.\n           \n          For an instant - the MASK SHRINK WRAPS like a vacuum over \n          Stanley's head. We hear the PIERCING MASK SFX.\n           \n          Then, a beat later, the Mask is off with a POP. The SFX STOP.\n           \n          STANLEY (CONT.)\n          Whoa.\n           \n          Stanley studies the old mask, then his own face in the mirror. \n          Everything's status quo. It must have been his imagination.\n           \n          STANLEY (CONT.)\n          Naw...\n           \n          He puts the Mask on again - firmly this time. Milo dives under \n          the bed as...\n           \n          AN INCREDIBLE METAMORPHOSIS BEGINS:\n           \n          RUBBERY WOODEN WHIPS shoot out of the Mask and wrap around \n          Stanley's head - locking the Mask in place.\n           \n          STANLEY'S PAJAMAS magically reweave themselves... growing in all \n          directions.\n           \n          HIS HEAD THROBS AND EXPANDS, turning lime green as it unites with \n          the Mask.\n           \n          STANLEY GRABS HIS HEAD - His body begins to move uncontrollably.\n           \n          Spinning faster and faster like a gyroscope. The SFX get loonier \n          and loonier as he becomes...\n           \n          A HUMAN TORNADO. Stanley's words are almost unintelligible as his \n          voice jumps one, two, five octaves.\n           \n          STANLEY\n          Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee...\n           \n          A HAND reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost. The \n          whirlwind SCREECHES to a halt, causing sparks and smoke to rise \n          FROM \n          the singed carpet. The smoke clears revealing...\n           \n          THE MASK CREATURE\n           \n          He's dressed in a snazzy zoot suit - a distortion of the paisley \n          material of Stanley's pajamas.\n           \n          The head is no longer Stanley's. It's large, bald and bright \n          green. The huge bug-eyes glow with mischief. The nose is small, \n          bony and beaked. \n          The mouth and teeth are enormous and gleaming white as he breaks \n          into a learning grin.\n           \n          The overall effect is devilishly loony, but not altogether \n          unhuman. In fact, there's something downright charming about him.\n           \n          The Mask checks himself out in the mirror and likes what he sees.\n           \n          THE MASK\n          S-s-s-nazzy!\n           \n          He SNAPS his bow tie with a crazy gleam in his eyes.\n           \n          THE MASK (CONT.)\n          It's party time!\n           \n          INT.

He raises a finger to his lip, making the \"SHUSH\" \n          sign.\n           \n          Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps out of \n          Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall.\n           \n          STANLEY/MASK\n          O, jeepers--!\n           \n          Stanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every \n          time. Frustrated, he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from his \n          pocket and \n          starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock. \n          Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but \n          those bells just keep \n          ringing.\n           \n          The hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers \n          into the floor and reverberates through the building like \n          THUNDERBOLTS.\n           \n          The door bursts open and Mrs. Peenman's angry face pops out \n          covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers. She gets one look \n          at the Mask \n          with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and \n          SCREAMS bloody murder.\n           \n          The Mask SCREAMS in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and \n          his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror.\n           \n          Mrs. Peenman's door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as she \n          appears cocking an enormous shotgun.\n           \n          MASK\n          Easy lady! I was just killin'\n          time!\n           \n          The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal \n          laughter as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM.\n           \n          The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs. Peenman continues to blast \n          away, and finally leaps straight out the window. KEE-RASH.\n           \n          EXT.

The machine disappears down \n          the street as we HOLD on Stanley/Mask's flattened body.\n           \n          He raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself \n          off the street.

PARK ENTRANCE\n           \n          A twelve foot high stone wall surrounds the park.

Put your hands\n          over your head or we'll open fire.\n           \n          Stanley/Mask looks around, like he's trying to figure a way out \n          of this mess - then -\n           \n          STANLEY/MASK\n          Hit it!\n           \n          With that, a police SPOTLIGHT SNAPS on, and the brightly lit park \n          entry-way becomes a beautifully lit stage. Stanley/Mask strikes a \n          pose, \n          now wearing a straw hat \"boater\" and weilding a cane.\n           \n          Pedestrians with radios and ghetto blasters look down in shock as \n          a RUMBA begins playing from every speaker in town. \n          Stanley/Mask SWAYS seductively in time to the music.\n           \n          A FEMALE COP steps forward, a look of surprise spreaading over \n          her face as, against her will, she opens her mouth in song.\n           \n          FEMALE COP\n          They rave about Sloppy Joe - the\n          Latin lothario - but Havana -\n          has a new sensation.\n           \n          It's \"Cuban Pete RUMBA\" by Desi Arnaz!

His legs twine around each other like spaghetti, then \n          his upper torso \n          SPINS until they're straightened out again.\n           \n          STANLEY/MASK\n          (still singing)\n          Yessir, I'm Cuban Pete!

When I start\n          to dance everything goes chick\n          chick chickie boom!\n           \n          Like some weird, loony case of mass hypnosis, Stanley/Mask waits \n          for the \"musical break\" to coax the armed cops into JOINING him \n          on the \n          number - as the rough and tumble equivalent of CHORUS GIRLS!\n           \n          ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN FROM HELICOPTER\n           \n          The street takes the look of a Busby Berkeley musical as the cops \n          HIGH STEP in time to the infectious RUMBA beat.\n           \n          EXT. STONE WALL - NIGHT\n           \n          Kellaway leaps/tumbles down from the wall into some bushes and \n          scrambles to his feet. He can't believe his eyes. His cops, his \n          tac squad, his \n          friggin' SWAT team - they're ALL in the street, dancing with this \n          crazy maniac!\n           \n          Stanley/Mask sidles up to a heavily armed female SWAT officer, \n          \"dirty dancing\" her across the street -\n           \n          STANLEY/MASK\n          The senoritas they sing, and how\n          they sling their sombreros --!\n          (It's very nice!

The sharp REPORT \n          AND \n          stinging gas seems to break the spell of THE MASK. The music \n          suddenly STOPS and the high stepping cops stagger away from the \n          CHORUS \n          line, looking confused.\n           \n          LT.

NEWS SHIPPING ROOM - NIGHT\n           \n          Stanley and Peggy sit on stacks of bound newspapers in the vast \n          shadowy shipping room. In the b.g., a huge machine spews out \n          hundreds of \n          newspapers on an assembly line.
