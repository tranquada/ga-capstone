A\r\n          young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense\r\n          moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his\r\n          tousled hair frosted white.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           JACK (V.O.)\r\n</b>           But then...then I saw the moon.

And when it did...I wasn't\r\n           scared anymore.\r\n                         \r\n          Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up\r\n          underneath him.\r\n<b>           JACK (V.O.)\r\n</b>           Why I was there, and what I was\r\n           meant to do - that I've never\r\n           known.

He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden\r\n          staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the\r\n          staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd.\r\n           Guardians Screening Script 9/6/12 Avid 2.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in\r\n          contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across\r\n          the ice. Jack is visibly confused.\r\n                         \r\n          He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their\r\n          trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as\r\n          he begins to run across the frozen pond.\r\n                         \r\n          Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the\r\n          air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to\r\n          earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch\r\n          and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT.
