But around here;\n                 that's when all the drama begins...\n\n       Blue and red police lights flash over Debo's body.  Two\n       sheriffs walk INTO OUR FRAME and stand over Debo.  They flash\n       their lights on him.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)\n                 Last Friday; I got fired for the first\n                 time.  I got high for the first time.  I\n                 got shot at for the first time and I\n                 kicked Debo's ass for the first time...\n\n       They get him to his feet; but he stumbles and falls in the\n       bushes like a knocked out prize fighter.  The sheriffs laugh\n       at him.\n\n       Debo looks dazed and confused.  The sheriffs help him out the\n       bushes and start to cuff him.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)\n                 I was the man that night; and Debo ended\n                 up going to jail for a couple of years.\n                 But he told Ezal he was getting out next\n                 Friday.  He said, when he see me, he was\n                 gonna smoke me on the spot...\n\n       They walk him OUT OF FRAME...\n\n<b>                                                     FADE TO BLACK.\n</b>\n<b>                                                        OVER BLACK:\n</b>\n                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)\n                 And today is next Friday...\n\n<b>       SOUNDTRACK!\n</b>\n       \"New Line Cinema presents, etc., etc...\n\n<b>       FADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>       EXT. LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING\n</b>\n       OPENING CREDITS.  It's early Friday morning and the sun peeks\n       over the LA skyline.  As the city starts to awake and the\n       credits continue to roll;\n       we see SEVERAL SHOTS of the real people who make up Los\n       Angeles.  It seems that they all move to the same beat.\n\n<b>       EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n       Debo is released from the Twin Towers County Jail.  Still in\n       his orange jumpsuit, he walks right past us and down the\n       street.  Everybody clears his path.\n\n       SOUNDTRACK still PUMPIN'.\n\n       Debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and\n       directing traffic.  Debo stops, the man starts to dance in\n       front of him.  He stares for a second, then he's on his way.\n\n       Still walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the\n       sidewalk (losing cool points).\n\n       Three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the\n       latest dance steps on their way to school.  Debo is walking\n       towards them.  They scream and take off in the other\n       direction.  He smiles.  Briefly.\n\n       Still walking; he stops at a corner.  A SA boy waits to cross\n       with his low-rider bike.  A Metrolink train passes.  After it\n       goes by; we see Debo riding off on the boy's bike.  He's on\n       the ground holding his eye.\n\n       Debo continues to ride through the city.\n\n       He turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at Craig's\n       house.\n\n<b>       EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n       Mr. Jones' dog catcher's truck sits in front of the house.\n\n       A CHIHUAHUA (like the Taco Bell dog) takes a dump on the\n       lawn.  It starts to BARK at Debo.  He looks down at the dog\n       and kicks him in the street.  The DOG YIPES!\n\n       Debo focuses his attention on Craig's house.\n\n<b>       INT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n       The hallway is clear and quiet, until MR. JONES (Craig's\n       father), storms out of the bedroom.  He struggles to put on\n       his dog catcher's uniform.  He stops at the bathroom door and\n       knocks hard.\n\n<b>                           MR. JONES\n</b>                 Craig!  Craig!

BATHROOM - CLOSE-UP ON HIGH TIMES MAGAZINE - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n       Hands crack open a $20 sack of bud onto the magazine.  A pack\n       of Zigzags fall INTO FRAME.  Papers are ripped from the\n       package.\n\n<b>       CLOSE UP ON CRAIG JONES\n</b>\n       the doctor of this delicate operation.\n\n<b>                           CRAIG (V.O.)\n</b>                 Soon as my pops found out what Debo said\n                 to Ezal, he wanted me to move with my\n                 uncle and little cousin in Rancho\n                 Cucamonga.  Til' things calm down, or\n                 Debo went back to prison.  Whichever\n                 comes first.\n\n       He's sitting on the toilet (dressed: not using it) putting\n       the finishing touches on his masterpiece.  He licks, rolls\n       and slides the 'J into the fifth pocket on his Levi jeans.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)\n                 I feel like the biggest punk around here.\n                 I wiped Debo's ass.  He should be the one\n                 moving.\n\n       He exits.\n\n<b>       EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n       The front door opens.  Mr. Jones walks out the door, yelling\n       back into the house.\n\n<b>                           MR. JONES\n</b>                 Craig!  Let's go!  I don't wanna hit that\n                 traffic.\n\n       He steps off the porch backwards and into \"fresh Chihuahua\n       shit.\"  He slips and falls on the grass.\n\n                           MR. JONES (cont'd)\n                 I be got damn.\n\n       Mr. Jones gets up.  He brushes the grass off his uniform.  He\n       looks clean, but when he turns around dog shit is smashed all\n       over his back and butt.\n\n                           MR. JONES (cont'd)\n                 Craig!

He falls over the hood,\n       off the car and in the street.  The yellow truck speeds off.\n\n       Debo jumps up staggering with scrapes and bruises.\n\n<b>                           DEBO\n</b>                 You know I'mma find you!

He\n       starts to cough out of control and he falls next to Uncle\n       Elroy who's still coughing.  Craig passes the blunt to Suga,\n       who looks at it for a moment and then looks directly INTO the\n       CAMERA.  (As if to say, \"Shiiiiiiiiiiiit.\").\n\n<b>       INT.

Craig shakes him.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd)\n                 Uncle Elroy, wake up.  You got a letter\n                 today.\n\n       No response.

Uncle Elroy\n       starts to snore again.  He's asleep.  The coast is clear now.\n       Craig tries to make his escape.  He crawls over Suga to get\n       away.
