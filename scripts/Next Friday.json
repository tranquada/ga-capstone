FRONT LAWN - OVERHEAD SHOT - NIGHT\n\n       DEBO is laid out on the grass.\n\n                           CRAIG (V.O.)\n                 In the movies, when you beat up the\n                 neighborhood bully; you suppose to live\n                 happily ever after.  But around here;\n                 that's when all the drama begins...\n\n       Blue and red police lights flash over Debo's body.  Two\n       sheriffs walk INTO OUR FRAME and stand over Debo.  They flash\n       their lights on him.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)\n                 Last Friday; I got fired for the first\n                 time.  I got high for the first time.  I\n                 got shot at for the first time and I\n                 kicked Debo's ass for the first time...\n\n       They get him to his feet; but he stumbles and falls in the\n       bushes like a knocked out prize fighter.  The sheriffs laugh\n       at him.\n\n       Debo looks dazed and confused.  The sheriffs help him out the\n       bushes and start to cuff him.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)\n                 I was the man that night; and Debo ended\n                 up going to jail for a couple of years.\n                 But he told Ezal he was getting out next\n                 Friday.  He said, when he see me, he was\n                 gonna smoke me on the spot...\n\n       They walk him OUT OF FRAME...\n\n                                                     FADE TO BLACK.\n\n                                                        OVER BLACK:\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)\n                 And today is next Friday...\n\n       SOUNDTRACK!\n\n       \"New Line Cinema presents, etc., etc...\n\n       FADE IN:\n\n       EXT. LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING\n\n       OPENING CREDITS.  It's early Friday morning and the sun peeks\n       over the LA skyline.  As the city starts to awake and the\n       credits continue to roll;\n       we see SEVERAL SHOTS of the real people who make up Los\n       Angeles.  It seems that they all move to the same beat.\n\n       EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Debo is released from the Twin Towers County Jail.  Still in\n       his orange jumpsuit, he walks right past us and down the\n       street.  Everybody clears his path.\n\n       SOUNDTRACK still PUMPIN'.\n\n       Debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and\n       directing traffic.  Debo stops, the man starts to dance in\n       front of him.  He stares for a second, then he's on his way.\n\n       Still walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the\n       sidewalk (losing cool points).\n\n       Three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the\n       latest dance steps on their way to school.  Debo is walking\n       towards them.  They scream and take off in the other\n       direction.  He smiles.  Briefly.\n\n       Still walking; he stops at a corner.  A SA boy waits to cross\n       with his low-rider bike.  A Metrolink train passes.  After it\n       goes by; we see Debo riding off on the boy's bike.  He's on\n       the ground holding his eye.\n\n       Debo continues to ride through the city.\n\n       He turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at Craig's\n       house.\n\n       EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Mr. Jones' dog catcher's truck sits in front of the house.\n\n       A CHIHUAHUA (like the Taco Bell dog) takes a dump on the\n       lawn.  It starts to BARK at Debo.  He looks down at the dog\n       and kicks him in the street.  The DOG YIPES!\n\n       Debo focuses his attention on Craig's house.\n\n       INT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\n       The hallway is clear and quiet, until MR. JONES (Craig's\n       father), storms out of the bedroom.  He struggles to put on\n       his dog catcher's uniform.  He stops at the bathroom door and\n       knocks hard.\n\n                           MR. JONES\n                 Craig!  Craig!  Off yo' ass and on yo'\n                 feet; this ain't the time to beat your\n                 meat!\n\n       Mr. Jones laughs at himself.\n\n                           CRAIG (O.S.)\n                 I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!\n\n                           MR. JONES\n                 Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta\n                 hit the high-way!\n\n       Mr. Jones continues on his way; dancing to the beat.\n\n       INT. BATHROOM - CLOSE-UP ON HIGH TIMES MAGAZINE - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Hands crack open a $20 sack of bud onto the magazine.  A pack\n       of Zigzags fall INTO FRAME.  Papers are ripped from the\n       package.\n\n       CLOSE UP ON CRAIG JONES\n\n       the doctor of this delicate operation.\n\n                           CRAIG (V.O.)\n                 Soon as my pops found out what Debo said\n                 to Ezal, he wanted me to move with my\n                 uncle and little cousin in Rancho\n                 Cucamonga.  Til' things calm down, or\n                 Debo went back to prison.  Whichever\n                 comes first.\n\n       He's sitting on the toilet (dressed: not using it) putting\n       the finishing touches on his masterpiece.  He licks, rolls\n       and slides the 'J into the fifth pocket on his Levi jeans.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)\n                 I feel like the biggest punk around here.\n                 I wiped Debo's ass.  He should be the one\n                 moving.\n\n       He exits.\n\n       EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\n       The front door opens.  Mr. Jones walks out the door, yelling\n       back into the house.\n\n                           MR. JONES\n                 Craig!  Let's go!  I don't wanna hit that\n                 traffic.\n\n       He steps off the porch backwards and into \"fresh Chihuahua\n       shit.\"  He slips and falls on the grass.\n\n                           MR. JONES (cont'd)\n                 I be got damn.\n\n       Mr. Jones gets up.  He brushes the grass off his uniform.  He\n       looks clean, but when he turns around dog shit is smashed all\n       over his back and butt.\n\n                           MR. JONES (cont'd)\n                 Craig!  Craig!\n\n       Craig emerges from the house with his bags in hand.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                     (irritated)\n                 Here I come!\n\n                           MR. JONES\n                     (still mad)\n                 Well bring yo' ass on...\n\n       Craig slams the door and starts towards the truck.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 What's the matter?\n\n                           MR. JONES\n                 I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!\n\n       Mr. Jones gets in the truck.  Craig jumps in.  They back out\n       and pull off.\n\n       INT. DOG TRUCK - MOVING - CLOSE-UP ON CRAIG - CONTINUOUS\n\n       He's daydreaming about Smokey.\n\n                           CRAIG (V.O.)\n                 I didn't wanna leave my neighborhood at\n                 all.  Especially my homeboy Smokey.  But\n                 he went to rehab last week.  I know I'mma\n                 miss him...\n\n       Out of nowhere, Debo jumps in front of the truck.  Mr. Jones\n       slams on the BRAKES.\n\n                           DEBO\n                 Craig!  Get out the car, boy!  This the\n                 rematch!\n\n       Debo reaches for his shank.  Craig turns to Mr. Jones!\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 Daddy, punch it!\n\n       Mr. Jones floors it and hits Debo.  He falls over the hood,\n       off the car and in the street.  The yellow truck speeds off.\n\n       Debo jumps up staggering with scrapes and bruises.\n\n                           DEBO\n                 You know I'mma find you!  You can run ya'\n                 can't hide!\n\n       BACK IN CAR - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Craig screams out the window.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 You fake ass Suge Knight!\n\n       Mr. Jones is a bit shaken up.\n\n                           MR.

He\n       starts to spray too much.  Craig's window won't roll down.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd)\n                 What's wrong with the window?\n\n                           MR.

UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Welcome to the suburbs.  Where the \"Smiley Happy People\" live\n       in peace and quiet.\n\n       The neighborhood is full of green lawns and nice two story\n       track homes as far as the eye can see.  The yellow truck\n       drives through the streets and pulls up to a cul-de-sac.  Mr.\n       Jones BLOWS the HORN.\n\n                           MR.

He yells back into the\n       house.\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 Daddy, Craig is here.\n\n       Day-Day walks out to the car and gives Craig a pound.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 What's crackin'?\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 You.

Up at the family\n                 reunion.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed\n                 out everybody, and threw up in Aunt\n                 Faye's backseat.\n\n       Day-Day laughs.\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out\n                 everybody.  Damn that was fun.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 I know, we had a good time.  But ever\n                 since you guys moved out here, it seems\n                 like we've lost touch.\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 I know; this a long way from Watts.  But\n                 what I like about living out here is that\n                 you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens,\n                 no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace\n                 and quiet.  Listen.\n\n       They do.  It is quiet, except for a few BIRDS SINGING.\n\n                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)\n                 Shit sound good, huh?\n\n       Just then, a maroon Cadillac low-rider on Daytons rolls up\n       the block.  It's the Jokers: JOKER (28), LI'L JOKER (21) and\n       BABY JOKER (15).  They pull into their driveway.\n\n                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)\n                 Aw damn.\n\n       In SLOW MOTION: One by one they get out the car.  They have a\n       dog with them named \"Cheeco.\"  As they get to the front door\n       they all look over at Craig and Day-Day.\n\n       Day-Day looks away, while Craig keeps his eye on them.  They\n       disappear inside.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 Who is that?\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 Joker, he just got out of the pen.

Plus, I got something\n                 better than a Cadillac.\n\n       They walk over to his black BMW 325i on chrome rims.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 This you?\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                     (proud)\n                 Yeah, that's me.

UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Day-Day and Craig enter the house.  They still have the\n       furniture from the projects.  Craig looks around.

CRACK HOUSE - MORNING\n\n       A run-down crack house sits alone in the middle of the block.\n       It looks deserted with chipped paint, overgrown grass and\n       security bars everywhere.

Out of nowhere, a bicycle comes\n       INTO FRAME.  Ezal looks up at the rider.  It's Debo.\n\n                           DEBO\n                 Where did Craig move to?\n\n                           EZAL\n                 I don't know, Debo.\n\n       Debo rolls on top of him with the front tire.

He's BARKING viciously.\n\n       ACROSS STREET\n\n       Joker, Li'l Joker and Baby Joker are across the street\n       laughing.  Karla is embarrassed.\n\n       ON BMW\n\n       Craig is breathing hard but he's calm, but Day-Day is\n       terrified.\n\n                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)\n                 Hey, Joker!  Stop playing, man!  Call the\n                 dog back!\n\n       They continue to laugh.  Craig pulls his belt off.  He swings\n       it and hits Cheeco in the middle of his forehead with the\n       buckle.  The DOG CRIES and runs back across the street.\n\n       The Jokers aren't laughing anymore.  Joker stares at Craig.\n       Craig stares back.  You can feel the tension.  Joker kicks\n       the dog.\n\n                           JOKER\n                 Get yo dumb ass in the back.\n\n       CHEECO HOLLERS.  Craig and Day-Day get off the top of the\n       BMW.\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 Look at my roof.\n\n       Big dents in the roof of his BMW.\n\n                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)\n                 Man, why you do that?  I told you not to\n                 talk to that girl.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 Why not?  She was cool with it.\n\n       Day-Day gets into the car.\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 So.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 What you mean, so?\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and\n                 start a feud, you can always go back to\n                 home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember\n                 that.\n\n       He slams the door, starts the car and backs up.  Leaving\n       Craig standing there.  He sees Karla walking away.  He looks\n       over at the Jokers.  They're still staring hard.  Craig just\n       looks away and walks into the house.\n\n       INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Craig steps into the house.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 Nephew, you got perfect timing...\n\n       Uncle Elroy is sitting on the couch.  He has a Phillies'\n       Blunt (cigar) in one hand, a razor blade in the other.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)\n                 We about to start a little puff, puff\n                 give in this mothafucka.  Are you down?\n\n       Suga is sippin' on a glass of wine.  She moves over, making\n       room in the middle.\n\n                           SUGA\n                     (patting the couch)\n                 Come on, Craig.  Sit down right here.\n\n       Craig does.  Suga moves closer, boxing him in nice and tight.\n       Uncle Elroy licks the cigar.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 I know you smoke weed, right?\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 Why you say that?\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 'Cause your lips is getting black.\n\n       Uncle Elroy takes the razor and starts to cut the cigar the\n       long way.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)\n                 All I smoke is blunts.  Them fuckin'\n                 Zigzags don't do nothing for me.\n\n       Uncle Elroy scrapes the cigar shavings into a nearby trash\n       can (that's overflowing with cigar shavings already).  Suga\n       presses against Craig.\n\n                           SUGA\n                 Would you like a glass of wine, baby?\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 No thank you. It's too early.\n\n       Uncle Elroy stuffs the open cigar full of weed.  He's\n       concentrating.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 Boy, I can roll a blunt better than them\n                 bitches in Havana.  I know Willie don't\n                 let'cha smoke in the house, but I'm ya\n                 uncle.  I don't care how high you get in\n                 my house.  Long as you let me hit it...\n\n       He licks and rolls.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)\n                 Look at that.\n\n       It's perfect.\n\n                           SUGA\n                 Fire it up, Roy.\n\n       Uncle Elroy grabs the lighter.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 Now I'mma show you the real \"Puff Daddy.\"\n\n       He lights the blunt.  Craig's watching, so is Suga.  Uncle\n       Elroy holds the smoke in for a very long time.  Maybe too\n       long...'cause his eyes start to bulge, and he starts to toke\n       (cough with your mouth closed).  And toke.  And toke.  And\n       toke.  It looks like he's about to bust when he lets out a\n       big puff of smoke.  Then he starts to cough, and cough, and\n       cough out of control.\n\n       Craig and Suga are amazed at this display.  Uncle Elroy falls\n       to the floor on his hands and knees.  Still coughing.  He\n       falls on his back and passes the blunt to Craig.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)\n                     (still coughing)\n                 It's the Bombay.\n\n       Craig takes the blunt and puts it up to his lips.  He hits\n       it, holds it in and looks at Suga.  Suddenly, his eyes bulge\n       out and he starts to toke, and toke, and toke, and toke.  He\n       starts to cough out of control and he falls next to Uncle\n       Elroy who's still coughing.  Craig passes the blunt to Suga,\n       who looks at it for a moment and then looks directly INTO the\n       CAMERA.  (As if to say, \"Shiiiiiiiiiiiit.\").\n\n       INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - 15 MINUTES LATER\n\n       All three are passed out on the couch.  Uncle Elroy is\n       snoring with a little slobber hanging.  Craig's knocked out\n       with his mouth open.  Suga's head is not secure and she's\n       starting to bob.  She bobs so hard that her head falls in\n       Craig's lap.  He wakes up and looks down.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 Suga.\n\n       He looks over at Uncle Elroy who's looking over at him.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 Negro, what the hell you doing to my\n                 woman?\n\n                           CRAIG\n                     (confused and dazed)\n                 I don't know!\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 Suga!\n\n                           SUGA\n                     (face in lap)\n                 Huh?\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 What you doing to my nephew?\n\n                           SUGA\n                     (lifting her head)\n                 Ah, baby...I thought this was you.\n                     (to Craig)\n                 Craig, what are you doing to me?\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 I don't know, I think I passed out or\n                 something.  I don't remember.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I\n                 knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out\n                 on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make\n                 'em like they used to, baby.\n\n       Uncle Elroy staggers to his feet.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)\n                 Come on, woman.  I'm faded and feeling X-\n                 rated.  It's Mr. Nasty time.\n\n                           SUGA\n                 Mr. Nasty time?\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 Mr. Nasty time.\n                     (grabbing his back)\n                 But take it easy on me, girl.\n\n                           SUGA\n                 Craig, you ain't the only lightweight\n                 around here.\n\n       Suga takes Elroy's hand.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY\n                 Make yourself at home.\n\n       They both stumble upstairs leaving Craig all alone.  It's too\n       quiet now.  He grabs the remote and TURNS ON the TV.  Flicks\n       a few channels.  He picks up the blunt and the lighter.\n\n       ON TV\n\n       A public service announcement from King/Drew Rehab Center.\n       It's SMOKEY!\n\n                           SMOKEY (V.O.)\n                 Hi, my name is Smokey.

But here at the King/Drew Rehab\n                 Center, they help you curve your crave\n                 for marijuana but still let you get your\n                 drank on.\n\n       He lifts a 22 oz. bottle of Olde English.\n\n                           SMOKEY (cont'd) (V.O.)\n                 It's too hard to stop everything all at\n                 once.  So some days they let you smoke,\n                 but not drank.  And other days you can\n                 drank, but not smoke.  And if you're\n                 really making progress, the nurses will\n                 get fucked up wit you.  Helping you kick\n                 the habit by smoking up all yo shit.  So\n                 come down to the King/Drew Rehab Center\n                 and put down the joint, but B.Y.O.B.,\n                 man!\n\n       BACK ON COUCH\n\n       Craig is high.  He's looking at the TV with a slight smile on\n       his face.  It seems like the walls are shaking.  He looks\n       over at Suga's glass and her wine is vibrating, like Jurassic\n       Park.  Plaster falls from the ceiling.  He listens, it's\n       Uncle Elroy and Suga making love.\n\n                           UNCLE ELROY (O.S.)\n                 Oh, baby, right there.  Right\n                 there...bite the nipple, baby.  Bite it!\n                 Bite it!  Yeah, mothafucka -- yeah, come\n                 on, baby, get busy...\n\n       His eavesdropping is interrupted by a loud KNOCK on the door.\n       Craig is so comfortable, he doesn't want to move.  The\n       KNOCKING gets LOUDER.\n\n                           DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)\n                 Delivery!\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 Hold on.\n\n       Craig gets up slowly and starts to clean the area.  The\n       KNOCKING CONTINUES.\n\n                           DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)\n                 Delivery!\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 I said hold on!\n\n                           DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)\n                 Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda\n                 hot out here.\n\n       Craig stops what he's doing and swings the door open.\n\n       ON PORCH\n\n       The DELIVERY GUY, a thirtysomething asshole with tight shorts\n       and a buzz cut, is looking into the house.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 Can I help you?\n\n                           DELIVERY GUY\n                 Nice house.

It's just a\n                 certified mail delivery.\n\n       He hands Craig a letter.\n\n                           DELIVERY GUY (cont'd)\n                 Sign here.\n\n       Craig signs.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 What is it?\n\n                           DELIVERY GUY\n                 Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope\n                 the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if\n                 not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife\n                 stays here, of course.\n\n       He laughs and walks off singing the \"Good Times\" jingle.\n\n                           DELIVERY GUY (cont'd)\n                 '...temporary layoffs?

Craig looks at\n       the notice.  \"DELINQUENT! YOUR HOUSE WILL BE SEIZED AND\n       AUCTIONED -- TOMORROW AT 9AM  PAY TODAY!\"\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 Oh damn.\n\n       He SLAMS the DOOR.  We FOLLOW Craig upstairs TO Uncle Elroy's\n       room.  He knocks softly.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd)\n                 Uncle Elroy?\n\n       No answer.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd)\n                 Uncle Elroy, you got a tax notice.\n\n       Still no answer.  He turns the knob.  It's open.\n\n       INT. UNCLE ELROY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n       Craig steps into Uncle Elroy's freak palace.  Black lights,\n       candles, velvet posters - the works.  There's even a leather\n       fuck swing hanging from the ceiling.  Uncle Elroy and Suga\n       are asleep in a leopard-skin waterbed.  Craig is amazed.  He\n       slowly walks over to the bed.  Uncle Elroy is calling the\n       hogs.  Snoring.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                     (whispering)\n                 Uncle Elroy...Uncle Elroy?\n\n       He's about to shake him when Uncle Elroy lets out a big\n       grunt.  It startles Craig.  He looks over at Suga.  She's\n       completely under the covers.  Uncle Elroy rolls over on his\n       stomach, then he rolls on his back again.  Craig shakes him.\n\n                           CRAIG (cont'd)\n                 Uncle Elroy, wake up.  You got a letter\n                 today.\n\n       No response.

Wake\n                 up!\n\n       Uncle Elroy grabs him in a bear hug and slams him on the bed.\n\n       Craig finds himself caught between Suga and Uncle Elroy, but\n       now everything is totally still and quiet.  Uncle Elroy\n       starts to snore again.  He's asleep.  The coast is clear now.\n       Craig tries to make his escape.  He crawls over Suga to get\n       away.  She grabs him and starts to kiss him.\n\n                           SUGA\n                     (half asleep)\n                 Ohhh, baby!\n\n       Craig breaks away and tries to hurry out the room.  On his\n       exit, he hangs himself on the \"fuck swing\" and hits the floor\n       with a thud.  He scrambles to his feet, then he's out of\n       there.  Uncle Elroy and Suga lay asleep as if nothing ever\n       happened.\n\n       IN HALLWAY\n\n       Craig tries to gain his composure.  He gets an idea.\n\n       EXT.

Sticks his key in the\n       door and steps in.\n\n       BACK STORE AREA - CLOSE UP - ROACH\n\n       is upside down.  All the blood has rushed to his head.  He\n       has Chinaman eyes and a big smile on his face.\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 Roach, what are you doing?\n\n                           ROACH\n                 R-U-S-H Intensely.\n\n       A big cloud of smoke rolls out of his mouth and he falls and\n       hits the deck.\n\n                           ROACH (cont'd)\n                 My spleen.\n\n       Craig and Day-Day laugh at Roach.  The VACUUM is still GOING\n       but the room is very smoky.  Craig jumps in.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                     (unplugging the vacuum)\n                 This vacuum don't work.

He feels something\n       pressing on the back of his head (gun).\n\n                           PINKY\n                     (whispering)\n                 Don't move or I'll blow your head smooth\n                 off.\n\n       Craig throws his hands up.\n\n                           PINKY (cont'd)\n                 Now back up slowly... and don't say a\n                 word.\n\n       He obeys.  Pinky backs Craig into the store.\n\n                           PINKY (cont'd)\n                 Get on the floor.\n\n       Craig gets down.\n\n                           PINKY (cont'd)\n                 Little mothafucka trying to rob me.\n                 I'mma show you how I do 'em.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 I ain't trying to rob you...\n\n                           PINKY\n                 Shut up!

I'm\n                 not playing!\n\n       Pinky starts to pat down Craig's pockets.\n\n                           PINKY (cont'd)\n                 You ain't got no gun, but where's the\n                 weed at?

The gun goes\n       flying and so does he.  Pinky falls on his ass.  The 9mm\n       lands in front of Craig.  There's a big scramble for the gun.\n\n       BACK STORAGE AREA\n\n       The mood is serious.\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 I gotta think of a plan to get this money\n                 before tomorrow.\n\n                           ROACH\n                 You could sell your Beamer.\n\n       Day-Day gives Roach the evil-eye.\n\n                           ROACH (cont'd)\n                 My bad.\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good\n                 idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes\n                 out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky\n                 gets here.\n\n                           ROACH\n                 Maybe you can ask him to loan you the\n                 money.\n\n                           DAY-DAY\n                 Yoooo, that's it.

The store\n       looks like a tornado hit it.  Twice.  Craig comes up with the\n       pistol.  Pinky jumps on the ground.\n\n                           PINKY\n                 Don't kill me.\n\n       Craig is exhausted.  He stands over Pinky with the gun.\n\n                           CRAIG\n                 Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass\n                 that... Day-Day is my cousin.

I was just about to\n                 get in yo' ass.  Now give me my pistol\n                 back and get the hell out my store.\n\n       Craig looks at Day-Day.  Day-Day looks back at him.  Nobody's\n       high now.\n\n       EXT. FREEWAY - MONTAGE SEQUENCE - AFTERNOON\n\n       Mr. Jones' dog truck is weaving in and out of traffic.\n\n       INT.

If I wouldn't\n                 have fought Pinky, and gave Day-Day the\n                 joint, he'd still have a job.\n\n       Day-Day walks into the house while Craig and Roach stay out\n       on the porch.\n\n       INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MONTAGE SEQUENCE\n\n       Uncle Elroy opens his bedroom door wearing a S&M mask and\n       holding a tube of KY jelly.  He removes the mask.

FREEWAY - MONTAGE SEQUENCE - AFTERNOON\n\n       The dog truck exits the freeway.  He pulls into a gas station\n       by the freeway.  He stops near the restrooms and jumps out,\n       air freshner in hand.  When he gets to the door, it's locked.\n\n                           MR.
